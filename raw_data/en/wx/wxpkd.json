You must choose a Primary Care Physician for each of your family members from the selected Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group. In addition, female members also may choose a Woman's Principal Health Care Provider.

A Woman's Principal Health Care Provider may be seen for care without referrals from your Pri\u00admary Care Physician, however your Primary Care Physician and your Woman's Principal Health Care Provider must be affiliated with or employed by your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group. B. OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW The OTHER BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD PLANS' SEPAR\u00ad ATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS provision of the OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW section of your Certi\u00ad ficate is replaced with the following: OTHER BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD PLANS' SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS BlueCard The Plan hereby informs you that other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans outside of Illinois (\"Host Blue\") may have contracts similar to the contracts described above with certain Providers (\"Host Blue Providers\") in their ser\u00ad vice area. Under BlueCard, when you receive health care services outside of Illinois and from a Provider which does not ha ve a contract with the Plan, the amount you pay, if not covered by a flat dollar Copayment, for Covered Ser\u00ad vices is calculated on the lower of: \u2014 The billed charges for your Covered Services, or \u2014 The negotiated price that the Host Blue passes on to the Plan. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will consist of a simple discount which re\u00ad flects the actual price paid by the Host Blue. Sometimes, however, it is an estimated price that factors into the actual price increases or reductions toreflect aggregate payment from expected settlements, withholds, any otherGB16A144 HCSCcontingent payment arrangements and nonclaims transactions with your health care provider or with a specified group of providers. The negotiated price may also be billed charges reduced to reflect an average expected sav\u00ad ings with your health care provider or with a specified group of providers. The price that reflects average savings may result in greater variation (more or less) from the actual price paid than will the estimated price. The nego\u00adtiated price will also be adjusted in the future to correct for over or underestimation of past prices. However, the amount you pay is considered a final price. Statutes in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to use a basis for calculating your liability for Covered Services that does not reflect theentire savings realized, or expected to be realized, on a particular claim or to add a surcharge. Should any state statutes mandate your liability calculation methods that differ from the usual BlueCard method noted above in para\u00ad graph one of this provision or require a surcharge, the Plan would then calculate your liability for any covered health care services in accordancewith the applicable state statute in effect at the time you received your care. OutofArea Services The Plan has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans under their Licensed Controlled Affiliates (\"Licensees\") re\u00ad ferred to generally as \"InterPlan Programs\". Whenever you obtain health care services outside of your Plan's service area, the claims for these ser\u00ad vices may be processed through one of these InterPlan Programs. Typically, when accessing care outside your Plan's service area and the ser\u00ad vice area of your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group, you will obtain care from health care providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e., are \"Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Groups\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from NonParticipating pro\u00ad viders. The Plan's payment practices in both instances are described below. The Plan covers only limited health care services received outside of your Plan's Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area. As used in this section, Other Things You Should Know \"OutofArea Cov\u00ad ered Services\" include emergency care, Urgent Care and followup careobtained outside the geographic area of the Plan's Participating IPA's/Partic\u00ad ipating Medical Group's service area. Any other services will not be covered when processing through any InterPlan Programs arrangements, unless au\u00ad thorized by your Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\") or Women's Principal Health Care Provider (\"WPHCP\"). BlueCard /C0082 Program Under the BlueCard Program, when you obtain OutofArea Covered Ser\u00ad vices, as defined above, from a health care Provider participating with a Host Blue, the Plan will remain responsible for fulfilling Blue Cross and Blue Shield's contractual obligations. However the Host Blue is responsibleGB16A144 HCSCfor contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its partici\u00ad pating healthcare providers. The BlueCard Program enables you to obtain OutofArea Covered Ser\u00ad vices, as defined above, from a health care provider participating with aHost Blue, where available. The participating Provider will automatically file a claim for the OutofArea Covered Services provided to you, so there are no claim forms for you to fill out. You will be responsible for the Copay\u00ad ment amount, as stated in this Certificate. Emergency Care Services: If you experience a medical emergency while traveling outside the Plan's the Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area, go to the nearest emergency facility, Urgent Care facility, or other health care Provid\u00ad er. Whenever you access Covered Services outside your Plan's the Participat\u00ad ing IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for Covered Services, if not a flat dollar Copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: \u2014 The billed charges for your Covered Services, or \u2014 The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to the Plan. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actu\u00ad al price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with yourhealthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average sav\u00ad ings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price the Plan use[s] for your claim be\u00ad cause they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Federal law or the laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If federal law or any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, the Plan would then calculate your liability for any Covered Services according to applicable law.GB16A144 HCSCNonParticipating Healthcare Providers Outside The Plan's Service Area Liability Calculation a. In General: Except for emergency care and Urgent Care, services received from a NonParticipating Provider outside of the service area will not be covered. For emergency care and Urgent Care services received from NonPar\u00ad ticipating Providers outside of your Participating IPA's/Participating Medical Group's service area, but within the Plan's service area, please refer to the EMERGENCY CARE BENEFITS section of this Certific\u00ad ate. For emer gency care and Urgent Care services that are provided outside of the Plan's service area by a NonParticipating Provider, the amount(s) you pay for such services will be calculated using the meth\u00ad odology described in the EMERGENCY CARE BENEFITS section for NonParticipating Providers located inside the service area. b. Exceptions: In some exception cases, the Plan may, but is not required to, in its sole and absolute discretion, negotiate a payment with such NonParticipat\u00ad ing Provider on an exception basis. Except as amended by this Rider, all terms, conditions, limitations and ex\u00ad clusions of the Certificate to which this Rider is attached will remain in full force and effect.

MEDICARE ELIGIBLE COVERED PERSONS A series of federal laws collectively referred to as the ``Medicare Secondary Payer'' (MSP) laws regulate the manner in which certain Employers may offer group health care coverage to Medicare eligible employees, spouses, and in some cases, dependent children. Reference to spouse under this sec\u00adtion do not include a party to a Civil Union with the Eligible Person, the Domestic Partner (provided your Employer covers Domestic Partners) of the Eligible Person or their children. The statutory requirements and rules for MSP coverage vary depending on the basis for Medicare and employer group health plan (\"GHP\") coverage,as well as certain other factors, including the size of the employers sponsor\u00ad ing the GHP. In general, Medicare pays secondary to the following: 1. GHPs that cover individuals with endstage renal disease (\"ESRD\") dur\u00ad ing the first 30 months of Medicare eligibility or entitlement. This is the case regardless of the number of employees employed by the employeror whether the individual has \"current employment status.\" 2. In the case of individuals age 65 or over, GHPs of employers that employ 20 or more employees if that individual or the individual's spouse (of any age) has \"current employment status.\" If the GHP is a multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least one parti\u00adcipating employer that employs 20 or more employees, the MSP rules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 20 employees (un\u00ad less the plan elects the small employer exception under the statute). 3. In the case of disabled individuals under age 65, GHPs of employers that employ 100 or more employees, if the individual or a member of the in\u00addividual's family has \"current employee status.\" If the GHP is a multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least one parti\u00ad cipating employer that employs 100 or more employees, the MSP rules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 100 employees. Please see your employer or Group Administrator if you have any ques\u00ad tions regarding the ESRD Primary Period or any other provisions of the MSP laws and their application to you, your spouse or your depen\u00ad dents. Your MSP Responsibilities In order to assist your employer in complying with MSP laws, it is very im\u00ad portant that you promptly and accurately complete any requests for information fr om the Plan and/or your employer regarding the Medicare eli\u00ad gibility of you, your spouse and covered dependent children. In addition, ifyou, your spouse or covered dependent child becomes eligible for Medicare, or has Medicare eligibility terminated or changed, please contact your em\u00ad ployer or your group administrator promptly to ensure that your claims are processed in accordance with applicable MSP laws.GB16A143 HCSC Rev. 4/14 Effective Date: 04/25/2014YOUR IDENTIFICATION CARD You will receive an identification (ID) card from the Plan.

See your employer or Group Ad\u00ad ministrator should you have any questions about COBRA.GB16A143 HCSC Rev. 4/14 Effective Date: 04/25/2014Introduction You are receiving this notice because you have recently become covered un\u00ad der your employer's group health plan (the Plan). This notice contains important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice gen\u00ad erally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect the right to receive it. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage. It can also become avail\u00adable to other members of your family who are covered under the Plan when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Descrip\u00ad tion or contact the Plan Administrator. What Is COBRA Continuation Coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualify\u00ad ing event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your depen\u00ad dent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified bene\u00adficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your hours of employment are reduced; or /C0083Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficia\u00ad ry if you lose your coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your spouse dies; /C0083Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; /C0083Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083Your spouse becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or /C0083You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.GB16A143 HCSC Rev. 4/14 Effective Date: 04/25/2014Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events hap\u00ad pen: /C0083The /C0083The parentemployee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083The parentemployee becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); /C0083The parents become divorced or legally separated; or /C0083The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \"depen\u00ad dent child.\" If the Plan provides health care coverage to retired employees, the following applies: Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the Plan, the retired em\u00ad ployee will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy.The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan. When Is COBRA Coverage Available? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying eventhas occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduc\u00ad tion of hours of employment, death of the employee, in the event of retired employee health coverage, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the employee's becoming entitled to Medi\u00ad care benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), the employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a depen\u00ad dent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. Contact your employer and/or COBRA Adminis\u00ad trator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documentation. How Is COBRA Coverage Provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has oc\u00ad curred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may electGB16A143 HCSC Rev. 4/14 Effective Date: 04/25/2014COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the employee's be\u00adcoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), your divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's losing eligibility as a de\u00ad pendent child, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the em\u00ad ployee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employeelasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his employment terminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifyingevent (36 months minus 8 months). Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employ\u00ad ment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts for only up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. Disability Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled and you notify the Plan Ad\u00ad ministrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 m onths of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18month period of continuation coverage.Contact your employer and/or the COBRA Administrator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documen\u00ad tation. Second Qualifying Event Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent chil\u00ad dren in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be avail\u00ad able to the spouse and dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare bene\u00ad fits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or gets divorced or legally separated or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child,but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.GB16A143 HCSC Rev. 4/14 Effective Date: 04/25/2014If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights, should be addressed to your Plan Administrator.

CLAIM APPEAL PROCEDURES DEFINITIONS An appeal of an Adverse Benefit Determination may be filed by you or a per\u00ad son authorized to act on your behalf. In some circumstances, a health careprovider may appeal on his/her own behalf.

An \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" means a denial, reduction, or ter\u00ad mination of, or a failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit, including any such denial, reduction, termination, or failure to pro\u00advide or make payment for, a benefit resulting from the application ofutilization review, as well as a failure to cover an item or service for whichbenefits are otherwise provided because it is determined to be experimental or investigational or not medically necessary or appropriate. If an ongoingcourse of treatment had been approved by the Plan and the Plan reduces orterminates such treatment (other than by amendment or termination of theGroup's benefit plan) before the end of the approved treatment period, that is also an Adverse Benefit Determination. In addition, an Adverse Benefit Determination, also includes an \"Adverse Determination.\" An \"Adverse Determination\" means a determination by the Plan or its designated utilization review organization that an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or other health care service that is a Cov\u00ad ered Service has been reviewed and, based upon the information provided, does not meet the Plan's requirements for medical necessity, appropriate\u00ad ness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness, and the requested service or payment for the service is therefore denied, reduced, or termi\u00ad nated. For purposes of this benefit program, we will refer to both an Adverse Determination and an Adverse Benefit Determination as an Adverse Benefit Determination, unless indicated otherwise. A \"Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination\" means an Adverse Benefit Determination that has been upheld by the Plan at the completion of the Plan's internal review/appeal process.GB16A121 HCSCCLAIM APPEAL PROCEDURES If you have received an Adverse Benefit Determination, you may have your Claim reviewed on appeal.

Claim reviews are commonly referred to as \"appeals.\" Within 180 days after you receive notice of an Adverse Benefit Determina\u00ad tion, you may call or write to the Plan to request a claim review.

Urgent Care/Expedited Clinical Appeals If your appeal relates to an ur gent care/expedited clinical claim, or health care services, including but not limited to, procedures or treatments ordered by a health care provider, the denial of which could significantly increase the risk to the claimant's health, then you may be entitled to an appeal on an expedited basis. Before authorization of benefits for an ongoing course of treatment is terminated or reduced, the Plan will provide you with notice and an opportu\u00adGB16A121 HCSCnity to appeal. For the ongoing course of treatment, coverage will continue during the appeal process.

(Contact your Group or Member Ser\u00ad vices at 18008922803 for information regarding service area.); and, \u2014 If Medicare eligible, have both Part A and B coverage. REPLACEMENT OF DISCONTINUED GROUP COVERAGE When your Group initially purchases this coverage, if such coverage is purchased as replacement of coverage under another carrier's group policy, persons who are Totally Disabled on the effective date of this coverage but who otherwise meet the definition of an Eligible Person under this coverage and who were covered under the prior group policy will be eligible for coverage under this Certificate. Totally Disabled dependents of an Eligible Person will be considered eligible de\u00ad pendents under this Certificate provided such dependents meet the description of an eligible family member as specified below under the heading Family Cover\u00ad age. Depende nt children who have reached the limiting age of this Certificate will be considered eligible dependents under this Certificate if they were covered un\u00adder the prior group policy and, because of a handicapped condition, are incapable of self sustaining employment and are dependent upon the Eligible Person or oth\u00ad er care providers for lifetime care and supervision. Such Totally Disabled persons will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Certifi\u00ad cate. Benefits will be coordinated with benefits under the prior group policy andthe prior group policy will be considered the primary coverage for all services rendered in connection with the disability when no coverage is available under this Certificate due to the absence of coverage in this Certificate. The provisions of this Certificate regarding Primary Care Physician referral remain in effect for such Totally Disabled persons. INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE If you have Individual Coverage, only your own health care expenses are cov\u00ad ered, not the health care expenses of other members of your family. FAMILY COVERAGE Under Family Coverage, your health care expenses and those of your enrolled spouse and your (and/or your spouse's) unmarried children who are under the limiting age specified in the BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS section will be covered. All of the provisions of this Certificate that pertain to a spouse also apply to a party of a Civil Union unless specifically noted otherwise. A Domestic Partnerand his or her children who have not attained the limiting age specified in the BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS section are also eligible dependents. All of the provi\u00ad sions of this Certificate that pertain to a spouse also apply to a Domestic Partner unless specifically noted otherwise.5 GB16 HCSCIn addition, enrolled unmarried children will be covered up to the age of 30 if they: /C0083Live within the Plan's service area; and /C0083Have served as an active or reserve member of any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States; and /C0083Have received a release or discharge other than a dishonorable discharge. Coverage for unmarried children will end on the last day of the period for which premium has been accepted. If you have Family Coverage, newborn children will be covered from the moment of birth as long as the Plan receives notice of the birth within 31 days of the birth. Your Group Administrator can tell you how to submit the proper notice. Children who are under your legal guardianship or who are in your custody under an interim court order prior to finalization of adoption or placement of adoption vesting temporary care, whichever comes first, will be covered. In addition, if you have children for whom you are required by court order to provide health care coverage, those children will be covered. Any children who are incapable of selfsustaining employment and are dependent upon you or other care providers for lifetime care and supervision because of a handicapped condition occurring prior to reaching the limiting age will be cov\u00adered regardless of age as long as they were covered prior to reaching the limiting age specified in the BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS section. This coverage does not include benefits for foster children or grandchildren (un\u00ad less such children have been legally adopted or are under your legal guardianship). MEDICARE ELIGIBLE COVERED PERSONS A series of federal laws collectively referred to as the \"Medicare Secondary Pay\u00ad er\" (MSP) laws regulate the manner in which certain employers may offer group health care cov erage to Medicare eligible employees, spouses, and in some cases, dependent children. The statutory requirements and rules for MSP coverage vary depending on the basis for Medicare and employer group health plan (\"GHP\") coverage, as well as certain other factors, including the size of the employers sponsoring the GHP. In general, Medicare pays secondary to the following: 1. GHPs that cover individuals with endstage renal disease (\"ESRD\") during the first 30 months of Medicare eligibility or entitlement. This is the case regardless of the number of employees employed by theemployer or w hether the individual has \"current employment status.\" 2. In the case of individuals age 65 or over, GHPs of employers that employ 20 or more employees if that individual or the individual's spouse (of any age) has \"current employment status.\" If the GHP isa multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least oneparticipating employer that employs 20 or more employees, the MSP6 GB16 HCSCrules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 20 em\u00ad ployees (unless the plan elects the small employer exception underthe statute). 3. In the case of disabled individuals under age 65, GHPs of employers that employ 100 or more employees, if the individual or a member of the individual's family has \"current employee status.\" If the GHP isa multiemployer or multiple employer plan, which has at least oneparticipating employer that employs 100 or more employees, theMSP rules apply even with respect to employers of fewer than 100employees. Please see your employer or Group Administrator if you have any questions regarding the ESRD Primary Period or any other provisions of the MSP laws and their application to you, your spouse or your dependents. Your MSP Responsibilities In order to assist your employer in complying with MSP laws, it is very important that you promptly and accurately complete any requests for information from the Plan and/or your employer regarding the Medicare eligibility of you, your spouseand covered dependent children. In addition, if you, your spouse or covered de\u00ad pendent child becomes eligible for Medicare, or has Medicare eligibility terminated or changed, please contact your employer or your group administrator promptly to ensure that your claims are processed in accordance with applicable MSP laws. YOUR IDENTIFICATION CARD You will receive an identification (ID) card from the Plan. Your ID card contains your identification number, the name of the Participating IPA/Participating Medi\u00ad cal Group that you have selected and the phone number to call in an emergency. Always carry your ID card with you.

This includes, but is not limited to, loss of coverage due to: a. Legal separation, divorce, dissolution of a Civil Union, cessation of dependent status, death of an employee, termination of employ\u00ad ment, or reduction in number of hours of employment; b. In the case of HMO, coverage is no longer provided because an in\u00ad dividual no longer resides in the service area or the HMO no longer offers coverage in the HMO service area in which the individual resides; c. Reaching a lifetime limit on all benefits in another group health plan; d. Another group health plan no longer offering any benefits to the class of similarly situated individuals that includes you or your de\u00ad pendent; e. When Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is terminated as a result of loss eligibility; or f. When you or your dependents become eligible for a premium as\u00ad sistance subsidy under Medicaid or CHIP. \u2014 Termination of employer contributions towards your or your dependent's other coverage. \u2014 Exhaustion of COBRA continuation coverage or state continuation cover\u00ad age.

Your Family Coverage or the coverage for your additional dependents will be ef\u00ad fective from the date of the event if you apply for this change within 60 days of any of the following events: \u2014 Loss of eligibility for you or your dependents when Medicaid or CHIP cov\u00ad erage is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or \u2014 You or your dependents become eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or CHIP.

Please notify your Group Administrator so that your membership records can be adjusted. LATE APPLICANTS If you do not apply for Family Coverage or to add dependents within the allotted time, you will have to wait until your Group's annual open enrollment period to do so. Your Family Coverage or the coverage for your additional dependents will then be effective on the first day of the month following the open enrollment peri\u00ad od. Benefits will not be provided for any treatment of an illness or injury to a newborn child unless you have Family Coverage. (Remember, you must add the newborn child within 31 days of the date of birth.) CHANGING FROM FAMILY TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE You can apply to change from Family to Individual Coverage at any time.

Upon termination of your coverage under this Certificate, you will be issued a Certificate of Creditable Coverage.

NOTE: Certain employers may not be affected by CONTINUATION OF COV\u00ad ERAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA. See your employer or Group Administrator should you have any questions about COBRA. Introduction You are receiving this notice because you have recently become covered under your employer's group health plan (the Plan). This notice contains important in\u00ad formation about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a10 GB16 HCSCtemporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect the right to receive it. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage. It can also become available to other members of your family who are covered under the Plan when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description orcontact the Plan Administrator. What Is COBRA Continuation Coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Spe\u00ad cific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become quali\u00ad fied beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your hours of employment are reduced; or /C0083Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: /C0083Your spouse dies; /C0083Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; /C0083Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083Your spouse becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or /C0083You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happen: /C0083The parentemployee HCSC/C0083The parentemployee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; /C0083The parentemployee becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); /C0083The parents become divorced or legally separated; or /C0083The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \"dependent child.\" If the Plan provides health care coverage to retired employees, the following ap\u00ad plies: Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the UnitedStates Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the Plan, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan. When Is COBRA Coverage Available? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has oc\u00ad curred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the employee, in the event of retired employee health coverage, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the em\u00ad ployer, or the employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A,Part B, or both), the employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the qualify\u00ad ing event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying eventoccurs. Contact your employer and/or COBRA Administrator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documentation. How Is COBRA Coverage Provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficia\u00ad ries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation cov\u00ad erage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuationcoverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the employee's becoming en\u00ad titled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), your divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's losing eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to 36 months.12 GB16 HCSCWhen the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the em\u00ad ployee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee be\u00ad comes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his employmentterminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus 8 months). Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the em\u00ad ployee's hours of employment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts for only up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. Disability Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by the So\u00ad cial Security Administration to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60thday of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18month period of continuation covera ge. Contact your employer and/or the COBRA Administrator for procedures for this notice, including a description of any required information or documentation. Second Qualifying Event Extension of 18Month Period of Continuation Coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maxi\u00admum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be available to the spouse and dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, be\u00ad comes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or gets divorced or legally separated or if the dependent child stops being eligible underthe Plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights, should be addressed to your Plan Administrator.

COVERAGE AFTER TERMINATION (Illinois State Laws) The purpose of this section of your Certificate is to explain the options available for continuing your coverage after termination, as it relates to Illinois state legis\u00ad lation. The provisions which apply to you will depend upon your status at the time of termination. The provisions described in Article A will apply if you are the Eli\u00ad gible Person (as specified in the Group Policy) at the time of termination. The provisions described in Article B will apply if you are the spouse of a retired Eli\u00ad gible Person or the party to a Civil Union with a retired Eligible Person and are at least 55 years of age or the former spouse of an Eligible Person or the formerparty to a Civil Union with a retired Eligible Person who has died or from whom you have been divorced or from whom your Civil Union has been dissolved. The provisions described in Article C will apply if you are the dependent child of an Eligible Person who has died or if you have reached the limiting age under this Certificate and not eligible to continue coverage as provided under Article B. Your continued coverage under this Certificate will be provided only as specified below. Therefore, after you have determined which Article applies to you, please read the provisions very carefully.

COB does not apply to the Outpatient Prescription Drug Program Bene\u00ad fits. The order of benefit determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules de\u00ad termine whether the benefits of this Benefit Program are determined before or after those of another Benefit Program. The benefits of this Benefit Program: 1. Shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, this Benefit Program determines its benefits before another Benefit Pro\u00ad gram; but 2. May be reduced when, under the order of benefits determination rules, another Benefit Program determines its benefits first. This reduction is de\u00ad scribed below in \"When this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program.\" In addition to the Definitions Section of this Certificate, the following definitions apply to this section: ALLOWABLE EXPENSE.....means a Covered Service, when the Covered Service is covered at least in part by one or more Benefit Program covering the person for whom the claim is made. The difference between the cost of a private Hospital room and the cost of a semiprivate Hospital room is not considered an Allowable Expense underthe above definition unless your stay in a private Hospital room is Medically Necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as spe\u00ad cifically defined in the Benefit Program. When a Benefit Program provides benefits in the form of services, the rea\u00ad sonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. BENEFIT PROGRAM.....means any of these which provides benefits or ser\u00ad vices for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment: (i) Group insurance or grouptype c overage, whether insured or unin\u00ad sured. This includes prepayment, group practice or individual practicecoverage. (ii) Coverage under a governmental plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX of the Social Security Act). Each contract or other arrangement under (i) or (ii) above is a separate bene\u00ad fit program. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate program. CLAIM DETERMINATION PERIOD.....means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage un\u00ad der this Benefit Program, or any part of a year before the date this COBprovision or a similar provision takes effect.62 GB16 HCSCPRIMARY PROGRAM or SECONDARY PROGRAM.....means the order of payment responsibility as determined by the order of benefit determination ru\u00ad les. When this Benefit Program is the Primary Program, its benefits are deter\u00ad mined before those of the other Benefit Program and without considering the other program's benefits. When this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program, its benefits are deter\u00ad mined after those of the other Benefit Program and may be reduced because of the other program's benefits. When there are more than two Benefit Programs covering the person, this Benefit Program may be a Primary Program as to one or more other pro\u00ad grams, and may be a Secondary Program as to a different program or programs. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION When there is a basis for a Claim under this Benefit Program and another Benefit Program, this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program which has its benefits de\u00ad termined after those of the other program, unless: 1. The other Benefit Program has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this Benefit Program; and 2. Both those rules and this Benefit Program's rules, described below, require that this Benefit Program's benefits be determined before those of the other Benefit Program. This Benefit Program determines its order of benefit payments using the first of the following rules which applies: 1. NonDependent or Dependent The benefits of the Benefit Program which covers the person as an em\u00ad ployee, member or subscriber (that is, other than a dependent) are determined before those of the Benefit Program which covers the person as dependent; except that, if the person is also a Medicare beneficiary, Medi\u00ad care is: a. Secondary to the Benefit Program covering the person as a dependent; and b. Primary to the Benefit Program covering the person as other than a de\u00ad pendent, for example a retired employee. 2. Dependent Child if Parents not Separated or Divorced Except as stated in rule 3 below, when this Benefit Program and another Benefit Program cover the same child as a dependent of different persons, called \"parents:\" a. The benefits of the program of the parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earlier in a calendar year are determined before those of theprogram of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but63 GB16 HCSCb. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the program which covered the parents longer are determined before those of the program which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. However, if the other Benefit Program does not have this birthdaytype rule, but instead has a rule based upon gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the Benefit Programs do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other Benefit Program will determine the order of benefits. 3. Dependent Child if Parents Separated or Divorced If two or more Benefit Programs cover a person as a dependent child of di\u00ad vorced or separate parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order: a. First, the program of the parent with custody of the child; b. Then, the program of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; and c. Finally, the program of the parent not having custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obli\u00ad gated to pay or provide the benefits of the program of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that program are determined first.The program of the other parent shall be the Secondary Program. This para\u00ad graph does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Benefit Program year during which any benefits are actually paid or pro\u00ad vided before the entity has that actual knowledge. It is the obligation of the person claiming benefits to notify the Plan and, upon its request, to providea copy of the court decree. 4. Dependent Child if Parents Share Joint Custody If the specific terms of a court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the Benefit Programs covering the child shall fol\u00ad low the order of benefit determination rules outlined in 2 above. 5. Active or Inactive Employee The benefits of a Benefit Program which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent) are de\u00ad termined before those of a Benefit Program which covered that person as alaid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other Benefit Program does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Benefit Pro\u00ad grams do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored.64 GB16 HCSC6. Continuation Coverage If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation pur\u00ad suant to federal or state law also is covered under another Benefit Program, the following shall be the order of benefit determination: a. First, the benefits of a Benefit Program covering the person as an em\u00ad ployee, member or subscriber (or as that person's dependent); b. Second, the benefits under the continuation coverage. If the other Benefit Program does not contain the order of benefits deter\u00ad mination described within this rule, and if, as a result, the programs do notagree on the order of benefits, this requirement shall be ignored. 7. Length of Coverage If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Benefit Program which covered an employee, member or subscriber lon\u00ad ger are determined before those of the Benefit Program which covered thatperson for the shorter term. WHEN THIS BENEFIT PROGRAM IS A SECONDARY PROGRAM In the event this Benefit Program is a Secondary Program as to one or more other Benefit Programs, the benefits of this Benefit Program may be reduced. The benefits of this Benefit Program will be reduced when the sum of: 1. The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under this Benefit Program in the absence of this COB provision; and 2. The benefits that would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the other Benefit Programs, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this COB provision, whether or not a claim is made; Exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the benefits of this Benefit Program will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other Benefit Programs do not total more than those Allowable Expenses. When the benefits of this Benefit Program are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefitlimit of this Benefit Program. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. The Plan has the right to de\u00ad cide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. The Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this Benefit Program must give thePlan any facts it needs to pay the Claim. FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Benefit Program may include an amount which should have been paid under this Benefit Program. If it does, the Plan may pay65 GB16 HCSCthat amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this Benefit Program. The Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes pro\u00ad viding benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of payments made by the Plan is more than it should have paid un\u00ad der this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of: 1. The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; 2. Insurance companies; or3. Other organizations. The \"amount of payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any bene\u00ad fits provided in the form of services. REDUCTION IN BENEFITS The amount by which your benefits under this Benefit Program have been re\u00ad duced is called your ``savings.'' Savings can be used to pay for services that arenot covered under this Benefit Program provided that the services are covered un\u00ad der another Benefit Program and were not completely paid for under that Benefit Program. Savings can only be used to pay for services rendered in the same calen\u00ad dar year in which the Claim that earned the savings is actually processed. In order to have Claims paid from your savings, a Claim for such payment, in\u00ad cluding a statement of savings earned, must be submitted to the Plan no later than March 31st of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the savings were earned.66 GB16 HCSCHOW TO FILE A CLAIM When you receive care from your Primary Care Physician or from another Pro\u00ad vider who is affiliated with your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group, or from your Woman's Principal Health Care Provider, a Claim for benefits does not have to be filed with the Plan. All you have to do is show your Plan ID card to your Provider. However, to receive benefits for care from another Physician or Provider, you must be referred to that Provider by your Primary Care Physician or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider. When you receive care from Providers outside of your Participating IPA/Partici\u00ad pating Medical Group (i.e. emergency care, medical supplies), usually all you have to do to receive your benefits under this Certificate is to, again, show your Plan ID card to the Provider. Any Claim filing required will be done by the Pro\u00ad vider. There may be situations when you have to file a Claim yourself (for example, if a Provider will not file one for you). To do so, send the following to the Plan: 1. an itemized bill from the Hospital, Physician or other Provider (including the Provider's name and address, the patient's name, the diagnosis, the date of service, a description of the service and the Claim Charge); 2. the Eligible Person's name and Plan ID number; 3. the patient's name, age and sex; 4. any additional relevant information. Mail all of that information to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield 300 East Randolph Street Chicago, Illinois 606015099 In any case, it is your responsibility to make sure that the necessary Claim in\u00ad formation has been provided to the Plan. Claims must be filed no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the year in which the Covered Ser\u00ad vice was rendered. For the purposes of this filing time limit, Covered Services rendered in December will be considered to have been rendered in the next calen\u00ad dar year. If you have any questions about a Claim, call Member Services at 18008922803. FILING OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM CLAIMS In certain situations, you will have to file your own Claims in order to obtain benefits under the Outpatient Prescription Drug Program. This is primarily true when you did not receive an identification card, th e pharmacy was unable to transmit a claim or you received benefits from a nonParticipating Prescription Drug Provider. To do so, follow these instructions:67 GB16 HCSC1. Complete an Outpatient Prescription Drug Program Claim Form. These forms are available from your Employee Benefits Department or from the Plan. 2. Attach copies of all pharmacy receipts to be considered for benefits. These receipts must be itemized. 3. Mail the completed Claim Form with attachments to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois P. O. Box 64812 St. Paul, MN 551640812 In any case, Claims must be filed no later than one year after the date a service is received. Claims not filed within one year from the date a service is received, will not be eligible for payment. CLAIM PROCEDURES The Plan will pay all Claims within 30 days of receipt of all information required to process a Claim. In the event that the Plan does not process a Claim within this30day period, you or the valid assignee shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% per year, from the 30th day after the receipt of all Claim information until the date payment is actually made. However, interest payment will not be made if the amount is $1.00 or less. The Plan will notify you or the valid assignee when all information required to pay a Claim within 30 days of the Claim's receipt has not been received. (For information regarding assigning benefits, see \"Payment of Claims and Assignment of Benefits\" provision in the OTHER THINGS YOUSHOULD KNOW section of this Certificate.) If the Claim is denied in whole or in part, you will receive a notice from the Plan with: (1) the reasons for denial; (2) a reference to the health care plan provisions on which the denial is based; (3) a description of additional information which may be necessary to perfect the appeal, and (4) an explanation of how you mayhave the Claim reviewed by the Plan if you do not agree with the denial. CLAIM REVIEW PROCEDURES If your Claim has been denied in whole or in part, you may have your Claim re\u00ad viewed. The Plan will review its decision in accordance with the following procedure. Within 180 days after you receive notice of a denial or partial denial, write or tele\u00ad phone the Plan. You will need to submit the reason why you do not agree with the denial or partial denial, comments and any additional medical information.

The Plan shall have the right to first reimbursement out of all funds you, your covered dependents or your legal representative, are or were able to obtain for the same expenses the Plan has provided as a result of that sick\u00ad ness or injury. For the purposes of this provision, the cost of benefits provided will be the charges that would have been billed if you had not been enrolled under this bene\u00ad fit program. You are required to furnish any information or assistance and to provide any doc\u00ad uments that the Plan m ay request in order to obtain its rights under this provision. PLAN'S SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS The Plan has contracts with certain Providers and other suppliers of goods and services for the provision of and/or payment for health care goods and services to all persons entitled to health care benefits under individual and group policies or contracts to which the Plan is a party, including all persons covered under your Group's Policy. Under certain circumstances described in its contracts with such Providers and suppliers, the Plan may: \u2014 receive substantial payments from Providers or suppliers with respect to goods, supplies and services furnished to all such persons for which the Plan was obligated to pay the Provider or supplier, or \u2014 pay Providers or suppliers substantially less than their Claim Charges for goods or services, by discount or otherwise, or73 GB16 HCSC\u2014 receive from Providers or suppliers other substantial allowances under the Plan's contracts with them. Your Group understands that the Plan may receive such payments, discounts, and/ or other allowances during the term of the Policy. Neither you nor your Group are entitled to receive any portion of any such pay\u00ad ments, discounts, and/or other allowances. Any Copayments and/or deductibles payable by you are predetermined fixed amounts, based upon the selected benefit plan, which are not impacted by any discounts or contractual allowances which the Plan may receive from a Provider. OTHER BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD PLANS' SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS BlueCard The Plan hereby informs you that other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans outside of Illinois (\"Host Blue\") may have contracts similar to the contracts described above with certain Providers (\"Host Blue Providers\") in their service area. Under BlueCard, when you receive health care services outside of Illinois and from a Provider which does not have a contract with the Plan, the amount you pay, if not covered by a flat dollar Copayment, for Covered Services is calculated onthe lower of: \u2014 The billed charges for your Covered Services, or \u2014 The negotiated price that the Host Blue passes on to the Plan. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will consist of a simple discount which reflects the actual price paid by the Host Blue. Sometimes, however, it is an estimated pricethat factors into the actual price increases or reductions to reflect aggregate pay\u00ad ment from expected settlements, withholds, any other contingent payment arrangements and nonclaims transactions with your health care provider or with a specified group of providers. The negotiated price may also be billed charges reduced to reflect an average expected savings with your health care provider orwith a specified group of providers. The price that reflects average savings may result in greater variation (more or less) from the actual price paid than will the estimated price. The negotiated price will also be adjusted in the future to correct for over or underestimation of past prices. However, the amount you pay is con\u00ad sidered a final price. Statutes in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to use a basis for calculating your liability for Covered Services that does not reflect the entire sav\u00ad ings realized, or expected to be realized, on a particular claim or to add a surcharge. Should any state statutes mandate your liability calculation methods that differ from the usual BlueCard method noted above in paragraph one of this provision or require a surcharge, the Plan would then calculate your liability for any covered health care services in accordance with the applicable state statute ineffect at the time you received your care.74 GB16 HCSCPLAN'S SEPARATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Prescription Drug Providers The Plan hereby informs you that it has contracts, either directly or indirectly, with prescription drug providers (\"Participating Prescription Drug Providers\") to provide prescription drug services to all persons entitled to prescription drug benefits under health policies and contracts to which the Plan is a party, including all persons covered under this Certificate. Under its contracts with Participating Prescription Drug Providers, the Plan may receive from these providers discounts for prescription drugs dispensed to you. Neither the Group nor you are entitled toreceive any portion of any such payments, discounts and/or other allowances. Plan's Separate Financial Arrangements with Pharmacy Benefit Managers The Plan owns a significant portion of the equity of Prime Therapeutics LLC and informs you that the Plan has entered into one or more agreements with Prime Therapeutics LLC or other entities (collectively referred to as \"Pharmacy Benefit Managers\") to provide, on the Plan's behalf, Claim Payments and certain admin\u00ad istrative services for your prescription drug benefits. Pharmacy Benefit Managers have agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to receive rebates for using their products. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager may share a portion of those re\u00ad bates with the Plan. Neither the Group nor you are entitled to receive any portionof such rebates as they are figured into the pricing of the product. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS All benefit payments may be made by the Plan directly to any Provider furnishing the Covered Services for which such payment is due, and the Plan is authorized by you to make such payments directly to such Providers. However, the Plan re\u00ad serves the right to pay any benefits th at are payable under the terms of this Certificate directly to you. You will not receive any notices regarding Covered Services received from your Primary Care Physician (or other Providers who are part of your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group) because Claims do not have to be filed for those services.
