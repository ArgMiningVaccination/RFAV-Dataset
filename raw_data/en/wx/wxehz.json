Teegan and Sarah and Teegan are exceptional doctors, and I have had a wonderful experience in the 4 months I've been receiving care for my chronic headaches. After 25 years of chronic pain and an endless trail of disappointment and heartbreak from failed conventional medicine treatments, I've never given up believing there are reliable options in natural medicine. I am ecstatic that I found a program at NFN that works! I had my first appointment today with Dr. Teegan and Sarah Fiedler, very thorough visit and great listeners! Warm and welcoming environment! I had treatment by Dr. Teegan, and that was amazing!! I have so much more range of motion in my neck. M.M. Loved the personal attention and quick responses from NFN! They are 100% focused on their patients, and listened so attentively to my health concerns and goals. A wonderful team to work with! L.J. TESTIMONIALS Contact Us "}
