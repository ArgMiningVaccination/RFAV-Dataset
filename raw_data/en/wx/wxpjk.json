DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS As shown in Example 1 below, sequence variants in ASGR-1 (which resulted in either a faster degrading ASGR1 or a loss of function ASGR1 mutation) resulted in a lowering in the level of non-HDL cholesterol in humans. This in turn resulted in a decrease in the risk of coronary artery disease experienced by these people. As loss of function mutations in ASGR-1 resulted in both the lowering of non-HDL cholesterol and the lowering of coronary artery disease, antibodies and inhibitory RNA that effectively block ASGR can be used to lower the risk of coronary artery disease. The present invention is directed to inhibitors of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. The present invention provides antigen binding proteins that specifically bind to human ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and inhibit human ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 binding to a ligand.

The present invention further provides compositions, kits, and methods relating to antigen binding proteins that specifically bind to human ASGR, human ASGR-1, and/or human ASGR-2. Also provided are nucleic acid molecules comprising a sequence of polynucleotides that encode all or a portion of a polypeptide that specifically binds to human ASGR, human ASGR-1, and/or human ASGR-2.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application, the use of \"or\" means \"and/or\" unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \"including\", as well as other forms, such as \"includes\" and \"included\", is not limiting. Also, terms such as \"element\" or \"component\" encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise. Also, the use of the term \"portion\" can include part of a moiety or the entire moiety. Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well-known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates (1992), and Harlow and Lane Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1990), which are incorporated herein by reference. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The terminology used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well-known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences are indicated using standard one- or three-letter abbreviations. Unless otherwise indicated, polypeptide sequences have their amino termini at the left and their carboxy termini at the right, and single-stranded nucleic acid the top strand of double-stranded nucleic acid sequences, have their 5 termini at the left and their 3 termini at the right. A particular section of a polypeptide can be designated by amino acid residue number such as amino acids 1 to 50, or by the actual residue at that site such as asparagine to proline. A particular polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence also can be described by explaining how it differs from a reference sequence. The following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings: The term \"inhibitor\" as used herein, is a compound that decreases the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the inhibitor. In some instances, an inhibitor will substantially decrease the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the inhibitor. In some instances, an inhibitor will completely diminish the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the inhibitor. Certain exemplary inhibitors include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, antibodies, peptibodies, aptamers, antisense oligonucleotides, interfering RNA, carbohydrates or small organic molecules. The term \"isolated molecule\" (where the molecule is, for example, a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, antigen binding protein or an antibody) is a molecule that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state, (2) is substantially free of other molecules from the same species (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus, a molecule that is chemically synthesized, or expressed in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates, will be \"isolated\" from its naturally associated components. A molecule also may be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using purification techniques well known in the art. Molecule purity or homogeneity may be assayed by a number of means well known in the art. For example, the purity of a polypeptide sample may be assayed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of the gel to visualize the polypeptide using techniques well known in the art. For certain purposes, higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for purification. The terms \"polynucleotide,\" \"oligonucleotide\" and \"nucleic acid\" are used interchangeably throughout and include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA), analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide (e.g., peptide nucleic acids and non-naturally occurring nucleotide analogs), and hybrids thereof. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise a contiguous open reading frame encoding an antibody, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, of the invention. A \"vector\" is a nucleic acid that can be used to introduce another nucleic acid linked to it into a cell. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), wherein additional DNA segments can be introduced into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. An \"expression vector\" is a type of vector that can direct the expression of a chosen polynucleotide. A nucleotide sequence is \"operably linked\" to a regulatory sequence if the regulatory sequence affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of the nucleotide sequence. A \"regulatory sequence\" is a nucleic acid that affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The regulatory sequence can, for example, exert its effects directly on the regulated nucleic acid, or through the action of one or more other molecules (e.g., polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence and/or the nucleic acid). Examples of regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Further examples of regulatory sequences are described in, for example, Goeddel, 1990, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. and Baron et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3605-06. A \"host cell\" is a cell that can be used to express a nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid of the invention. A host cell can be a prokaryote, for example, E. coli, or it can be a eukaryote, for example, a single-celled eukaryote (e.g., a yeast or other fungus), a plant cell (e.g., a tobacco or tomato plant cell), an animal cell (e.g., a human cell, a monkey cell, a hamster cell, a rat cell, a mouse cell, or an insect cell) or a hybridoma. Typically, a host cell is a cultured cell that can be transformed or transfected with a polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, which can then be expressed in the host cell. The phrase \"recombinant host cell\" can be used to denote a host cell that has been transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid to be expressed. A host cell also can be a cell that comprises the nucleic acid but does not express it at a desired level unless a regulatory sequence is introduced into the host cell such that it becomes operably linked with the nucleic acid. It is understood that the term host cell refers not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to, e.g., mutation or environmental influence, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein. ASGR Genomic database analysis is one manner that allows for the discovery of associations between disease states and particular targets and/or pathways. For example, genetic analysis of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia resulted in the discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) being involved with regulating serum LDL cholesterol levels and risk of developing coronary artery disease, and ultimately, in the development of the recently approved Repatha\u00ae, an anti-hPCSK9 antibody. (see, e.g., Jackson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,030,457). Advances in DNA sequencing technology provide the means to sequence the genomes of large numbers of individuals allowing for discovery of rare variants. deCODE Genetics (an Amgen company) has previously reported methods to analyze whole genomes of large numbers of Icelanders in order to search for associations between genetic variants and traits of interest. (Gudbjartsson et al., Nature Genetics; Vol. 47; 5; May 2015; p. 435-444). This methodology has now been applied in the search for novel genetic variants that affect cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol levels, and the risk for developing coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). The groundbreaking analysis performed has identified novel sequence variants of the Ashwell-Morell Receptor that are implicated in cardiovascular disease. In the present invention, whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population discovered a rare, 12 base pair deletion (\"del12\") in intron 4 of the ASGR-1 gene that is also present in other European ancestry populations. This deletion leads to a frameshift predicted to generate a truncated ASGR-1 receptor subunit that is lacking both the oligomerization and extracellular carbohydrate recognition domains (also known as \"CRD,\" \"carbohydrate binding domain\" or \"CBD\") or may generate an unstable and rapidly degraded transcript (and therefore no protein) due to nonsense mediated decay. In the present invention, whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population also discovered a second rare loss of function variant in the ASGR-1 gene; namely, a 4 base pair insertion in exon 7 (c. 469-472dupAACT or \"W158\u00d7\"). This 4 base pair insertion in exon 7 causes a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 158 out of the 291 amino acid full length protein (NP_001662.1:p.W158X). This variant is predicted to encode a protein lacking the carbohydrate recognition domain of the receptor or may generate an unstable and rapidly degraded transcript (and therefore no protein) due to nonsense mediated decay. Furthermore, the W158X variant effects all reported refseq transcripts of ASGR-1 regardless of tissue or cell type of expression. Without wishing to be bound by any particular hypothesis, the analysis indicates that del12 and W158X results in lower non-HDL cholesterol levels, protection against CAD and MI, leading to prolonged life. Additionally, the analysis indicates that del12 and W158X also associates with increased levels of circulating ALP and vitamin B12. Supporting this del12 and W158X association with increased levels of ALP are data from mice having a Y272C variant in ASGR-1, showing that these mice exhibit a phenotype of increased plasma ALP (Sabrautzki et al., Mamm. Genome, 23, 416-430, 2012). The Y272 position in mouse ASGR-1 corresponds to the Y273 position in human ASGR-1 (see FIG. 1A). The Ashwell-Morell Receptor (AMR), originally named the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, was one of the first cellular receptors to be isolated and identified. (Grewal, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 479, Chapter 13, 2010, pp. 223-241). This receptor is also known as the Ashwell Receptor, the hepatic galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) receptor, or the hepatic lectin receptor. However, this receptor is now more commonly known as \"ASGPR,\" or simply \"ASGR.\" ASGR is a C-type lectin that is expressed on the surface of hepatocytes and is made up of 48 kDa major subunit(s) (ASGR-1) and 40 kDa minor subunit(s) Autoimmune Highlights, 2012, 3:119-125). Functional variants of ASGR are formed by the oligomerization of the ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 subunits. (Grewal). The receptor complexes can the ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 subunits, with (ASGR-1)2-(ASGR-2)1 trimer being the most common form and having the highest affinity to substrate. (Grewal). Other identified forms of ASGR species of ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 are known. Table 1 presents sequences for human, mouse, rat, pig, dog and cynomolgus. FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2 present sequence alignments of various species of ASGR-1 and ASGR-2, and FIG. 3 presents a sequence alignment between human ASGR-1 and human ASGR-2. ASGR-1 is a single pass transmembrane protein and is the major subunit of ASGR. The galactose (Gal) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues of glycoproteins are exposed by removal of sialic acid by sialidases, hence the term asialoglycoprotein for the ligands of ASGR. Although ASGR expression is detected in other tissues, liver is the predominant site of expression. A circulating form of the receptor, generated from ASGR-1 transcripts lacking exon two, has also been reported. (Liu J, Hu B, Yang Y, et al. A new splice variant of the major subunit of human asialoglycoprotein receptor a W158X variants are predicted to truncate both the membrane bound and the circulating form of the receptor, and as mentioned above, the W158X variant may generate an unstable and rapidly degraded transcript (and therefore no protein) due to nonsense mediated decay. The primary reported function of ASGR is to bind and internalize glycoproteins in the circulation that contain terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues (asialoglycoproteins), resulting in the clearance of these proteins from the circulation. (Roggenbuck). Reported endogenous ligands include components of the blood coagulation system, such as platelets and Von Willebrand Factor. (Grewal). As used herein, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, ASGR function or activity includes the ability of ASGR to interact or bind to a ligand. In some embodiments, ASGR function or activity is represented by the ability of ASGR to interact or bind to sugars including but not limited to lactose, galactose, and/or GalNAc or glycoproteins displaying such sugars including but not limited to fetuin, orosomucoid and/or alkaline phosphatase. In some embodiments, ASGR function or activity includes any biological activity resulting from ASGR response. Exemplary activities include, but are not limited to, clearance of asialoglycoproteins from the circulation; clearance of IgA from circulation; removal of apoptotic cells; clearance of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or the disposal of cellular fibronectin (Roggenbuck). Given the location of ASGR on the surface of liver hepatocytes and its implication in hepatocyte entry by certain viruses (Roggenbuck), the receptor has become a target of convenience for therapeutics that require delivery to the liver and internalization into the cells. Examples of these uses include the targeted delivery of doxorubicin to hepatocellular carcinoma (Wei et al., Int J Nanomedicine, 2015, 10:5123-37), gene delivery to hepatocytes (D'Souza et al., J Control Release, 2015, 203:126-39), and targeted delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes (Rajeev et al., Chembiochem, 2015, 16(6):903-8). Although the ASGR and its ability to mediate endocytosis and degradation of desialated glycoproteins has been known for nearly 4 decades, the endogenous ligands and the physiological function of the receptor have been difficult to establish. (Weigel P H, Yik J H. Glycans as endocytosis signals: the cases of the Biochimica et biophysica acta 2002; 1572:341-63). It has been reported that ASGR-1/ mice (lacking any ASGR activity) thrive normally and do not accumulate desialylated glycoproteins in their circulation although they are unable to clear exogenously added asialoglycoproteins, suggesting that under normal physiological condition ASGR is not essential for homeostasis of circulating asialoglycoproteins. (Tozawa R, Ishibashi S, Osuga J, et al. Asialoglycoprotein receptor deficiency in mice lacking the major receptor subunit. Its obligate requirement for the stable expression of oligomeric receptor. The Journal of Biological Chemistry 2001; 276:12624-8). In contrast to the ASGR-1 knockout mice which lack an apparent phenotype, the present invention has established a clear physiological role for human ASGR-1 in cardiovascular disease, for example, but not limited to, the regulation of non-HDL levels and modulation of CAD and MI risk. The present invention has also demonstrated the association of del12 and W158X with increased levels of circulating ALP and vitamin B12. Furthermore, the present invention shows that disturbing one allele of ASGR-1 appears to have an overall beneficial effect as heterozygotes carriers of del12 live on average 1.5 years longer than non-carriers. Surprisingly, the various embodiments provided herein demonstrate that the del12 variant and the W158 variant both have an effect on non-HDL levels that is opposite to their effect on ALP and vitamin B12 levels; decreasing non-HDL and increasing ALP and vitamin B12. While not wishing to be bound by any particular hypothesis, it is important to note that the common variant previously described that associates with ALP and LDL cholesterol also has opposing effects on these serum components; hence ASGR-1 may affect the level of these molecules through different mechanisms. It is unlikely that the ALP increase mediated by del12 or W158X reflects an underlying liver disease since other measures of liver function are not affected. Both ALP and the vitamin B12 transporter in the circulation, haptocorrin, are asialylated glycoproteins known to bind ASGR-1 and be cleared from the circulation by the receptor (Tuin A, Huizinga-Van der Vlag A, van Loenen-Weemaes A M, Meijer D K, Poelstra K.

The asialoglycoprotein receptor regulates levels of plasma glycoproteins terminating with sialic acid alpha2,6-galactose. The Journal of Biological Chemistry 2009; 284:3777-83). While not wishing to be bound by any particular hypothesis, the more likely reason for the increased levels of ALP and vitamin B12 in del12 carriers and in W158X carriers is decreased clearance of desialylated forms of these molecules from the circulation, due to reduced number of functional ASGR receptors in del12 carriers and in W158X carriers, suggesting a role for ASGR-1 in maintaining homeostasis of circulating ALP and vitamin B12. While not wishing to be bound by any particular hypothesis, the decreased levels of non-HDL in del12 carriers and in W158X carriers in the face of reduced ASGR-1 function suggest that ASGR-1 affects non-HDL levels by mechanisms other than direct binding and endocytosis of cholesterol particles. In mice expressing a hypomorphic form of neuraminidase 1 (Neu1), a sialidase that cleaves the sialic acid residues thereby generating substrates for ASGR-1, the LDL receptor (LDLR) is sialylated and this form of the receptor was more stable and took up LDL cholesterol more avidly (LDL levels were decreased in these mice) than the asialylated form of the wild type LDLR (Yang A, Gyulay G, Mitchell M, White E, Trigatti B L Igdoura S A. Hypomorphic sialidase expression decreases serum cholesterol by downregulation of VLDL production in mice Journal of Lipid Research 2012; 53:2573-2585). Both ASGR and LDLR are located in clathrin-coated pits on hepatocytes and ASGR may be capable of interacting with the asialylated form of the LDLR and blocking its activity. Two novel rare variants in ASGR-1 have been identified herein that play a role in cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, lowering non-HDL levels and protecting against CAD and MI. These variants disrupt ASGR-1 protein function. Accordingly, the present invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting ASGR function, methods of inhibiting ASGR-1 function and/or methods of inhibiting ASGR-2 function. The present invention is further directed to molecules (for example, but not limited to, antigen binding proteins or interfering RNA) that inhibit ASGR function, ASGR-1 function and/or ASGR-2 function. Antigen Binding Proteins In some embodiments, the invention comprises antigen binding proteins that bind to ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2 of different species, including, but not limited to, human, cynomolgus, porcine, canine, murine and rat. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins specifically bind to ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2 of different species, including, but not limited to, human, cynomolgus, porcine, canine, and murine and rat. Exemplary amino acid sequences of human, cyno, dog, pig, rat and mouse ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 are provided in FIGS. 1-3. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins further inhibit ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from binding to a ligand. An \"antigen binding protein\" is a protein comprising an antigen binding fragment that binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding fragment to adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to the antigen. In the instant application, the antigen is ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 protein or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the antigen binding fragment comprises at least one CDR from an antibody that binds to the antigen, and in some embodiments comprises the heavy chain CDR3 from an antibody that binds to the antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen binding fragment comprises all three CDRs from the heavy chain of an antibody that binds to the antigen or from the light chain of an antibody that binds to the antigen. In still some embodiments, the antigen binding fragment comprises all six CDRs from an antibody that binds to the antigen (three from the heavy chain and three from the light chain). The antigen binding fragment in certain embodiments is an antibody fragment. Nonlimiting examples of antigen binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., an antigen binding fragment of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. Further specific examples include, but are not limited to, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), a nanobody (e.g. VH domain of camelid heavy chain antibodies; VHH fragment, see Cortez-Retamozo et al., Cancer Research, Vol. 64:2853-57, 2004), a Fab fragment, a Fab fragment, a F(ab)2 fragment, a Fv fragment, a Fd fragment, and a complementarity determining region (CDR) fragment. These molecules can be derived from any mammalian source, such as human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or pig, dog, or camelid. Antibody fragments may compete for binding of a target antigen with an intact antibody and the fragments may be produced by the modification of intact antibodies (e.g. enzymatic or chemical cleavage) or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies or peptide synthesis. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, for example, Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, Volume Issue 1:121-129 (2003); et peptide antibody mimetics (\"PAMs\") can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronectin components as a scaffold. An antigen binding protein can also include a protein comprising one or more antibody fragments incorporated into a single polypeptide chain or into multiple polypeptide chains. For instance, antigen binding proteins can include, but are not limited to, a diabody (see, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger Sci. USA, Vol. 90:6444-6448, 1993); an intrabody; a domain antibody (single VL or VH domain or two or more VH domains joined by a peptide linker; see Ward et al., Nature, Vol. 341:544-546, 1989); a maxibody (2 scFvs fused to Fc region, see Fredericks et al., Protein Engineering, Design & Selection, Vol. 17:95-106, 2004 and Powers et al., Journal of Immunological Methods, Vol. 251:123-135, 2001); a CH3 domain; see Olafsen et al., Protein Eng Des Sel., Vol. 17:315-23, 2004); a peptibody (one or more peptides attached to an Fc region, see WO 00/24782); a linear antibody (a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH\u2014CH1-VH\u2014CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions, see Zapata et al., Protein Eng., Vol. 8:1057-1062, 1995); a small modular immunopharmaceutical (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030133939); and Fab-scFv-Fc). In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein can have, for example, the structure of an immunoglobulin. An \"immunoglobulin\" is a tetrameric molecule, with each tetramer comprising two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Within light and heavy chains, the variable (V) and constant regions (C) are joined by a \"J\" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \"D\" region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites. Immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. The term \"light chain\" refers to a polypeptide comprising, from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus, a single immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and a single immunoglobulin light chain constant domain (CL). Heavy chains are classified as mu (), delta (), gamma (), alpha (), and antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. The term \"heavy chain\" refers to a polypeptide comprising, from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus, a single immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH), an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain 1 (CH1), an immunoglobulin hinge region, an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain 2 (CH2), an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain 3 (CH3), and optionally an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain 4 (CH4). The IgG-class is further divided into subclasses, namely, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. The divided subclasses, namely IgA1 and IgA2. The IgM has subclasses including, but not limited to, IgM1 and IgM2. The heavy chains in IgG, IgA, and IgD antibodies have three domains (CH1, CH2, and CH3), whereas the heavy chains in IgM and IgE antibodies have four domains (CH1, CH2, CH3, and CH4). The immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domains can be from any immunoglobulin isotype, including subtypes. The antibody chains are linked together via inter-polypeptide disulfide bonds between the CL domain and the CH1 domain (i.e. between the light and heavy chain) and between the hinge regions of the antibody heavy chains. The term \"antibody\" refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, and includes, for instance, chimeric, humanized, human, and bispecific antibodies. An \"antibody\" is a species of an antigen binding protein. An intact antibody will generally comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains. Antibody sequences can be derived solely from a single species, or can be \"chimeric,\" that is, different portions of the antibody can be derived from two different species as described further below. Unless otherwise indicated, the term \"antibody\" also includes antibodies comprising two substantially full-length heavy chains and two substantially full-length light chains provided the antibodies retain the same or similar binding and/or function as the antibody comprised of two full length light and heavy chains. For example, antibodies having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residue substitutions, insertions or deletions at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the heavy and/or light chains are included in the definition provided that the antibodies retain the same or similar binding and/or function as the antibodies comprising two full length heavy chains and two full length light chains. Furthermore, unless explicitly excluded, antibodies include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and synthetic antibodies. In some sections of the present disclosure, examples of antigen binding proteins are described herein in terms of the hybridoma line number as \"number/letter/number\" (e.g., 25A4). In these cases, the exact name denotes a specific monoclonal antibody derived from a specific hybridoma having a specific light chain variable region and heavy chain variable region. In some sections of the present disclosure, examples of antigen binding proteins are described herein in terms of \"number/letter/number/\"dot\"/number\" (e.g., 25A4.001) or number/letter/number/\"dot\"/number/\"dot\"/number (e.g., 25A4.001.001). In these cases, the name denotes a variant of a specific antibody having a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region that is related to, but distinct from the antibody derived from a hybridoma. That is, for example, an antigen binding protein named 25A4 is not the same as an antibody named 25A4.001 or an antibody named 25A4.001.001. A \"polyclonal antibody\" refers to a population of antibodies that are typically widely varied in composition and binding specificity. A \"monoclonal antibody\" (\"mAb\") as used herein refers to one or more of a population of antibodies having identical sequences. Monoclonal antibodies bind to the antigen at a particular epitope on the antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein is a \"fragment\" or \"antigen binding fragment\" of an antibody. As used herein and unless otherwise specified, an \"antibody fragment\" refers to the Fab, Fab, F(ab)2, and Fv fragments that contain at least one CDR of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. Antibody fragments may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. A Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; a F(ab)2 fragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment has the VH and CH1 domains; an Fv fragment has the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a VH domain, a VL domain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a VH or VL domain (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,846,634, 6,696,245, US App. Pub. No. 05/0202512, 04/0202995, 04/0038291, 04/0009507, Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989)). In certain embodiments, these antibody fragments can be incorporated into single domain single-chain (see Hollinger and Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1126-1136). Other antigen binding proteins envisioned are antibody polypeptides such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199, including fibronectin polypeptide monobodies, the polypeptides as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0238646. In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise at least one CDR set forth in Tables 2 or 6 herein. A \"single-chain variable fragment\" (\"scFv\") is a fusion protein in which a VL and a VH region are joined via a linker (e.g., a synthetic sequence of amino acid residues) to form a continuous protein chain wherein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et al., Science 242:423-26 (1988) and Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83 (1988)). For the sake of clarity, a \"single-chain variable fragment\" is not an antibody or an antibody fragment as defined herein. Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises VH and VL domains joined by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between two domains on the same chain, thus allowing each domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain (see, e.g., Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48 (1993), and Poljak et al., Structure 2:1121-23 (1994)). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites. Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different. The term \"CDR\" refers to the complementarity determining region (also termed \"minimal recognition units\" or \"hypervariable region\") within antibody variable sequences. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest. There are three heavy chain variable region CDRs (CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3) and three light CDRs (CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3). The CDRs in each of the two chains typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically to a specific epitope or domain on the target protein. From N-terminus to C-terminus, naturally-occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform to the following order of these elements: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, NIH, Bethesda, Md.), or Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al., 1989, Nature 342:878-883. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody may be identified using this system. Other numbering systems for the amino acids in immunoglobulin chains include IMGT\u00ae (the international ImMunoGeneTics information system; Lefranc et al, Dev. Comp. Immunol. (Honegger and Pluckthun, J. Mol. Biol. 309(3):657-670; 2001). One or more CDRs may be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an antigen binding protein. In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein of the invention may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The antigen binding molecules may comprise at least one of the CDRs described herein incorporated into a biocompatible framework structure. In one example, the biocompatible framework structure comprises a polypeptide or portion thereof that is sufficient to form a conformationally stable structural support, or framework, or scaffold, which is able to display one or more sequences of amino acids that bind to an antigen (e.g., CDRs, a variable region, etc.) in a localized surface region. Such structures can be a naturally occurring polypeptide or polypeptide \"fold\" (a structural motif), or can have one or more modifications, such as additions, deletions or substitutions of amino acids, relative to a naturally occurring polypeptide or fold. These scaffolds can be derived from a polypeptide of any species (or of more than one species), such as a human, other mammal, other vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, bacteria or virus. Typically the biocompatible framework structures are based on protein scaffolds or skeletons other than immunoglobulin domains. For example, those based on fibronectin, ankyrin, LACI-D1, Z domain and tendamistat domains may be used (See e.g., Nygren and Uhlen, 1997, Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7, 463-469). An antigen binding protein may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For example, an antibody typically has two identical binding sites, while a \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibody has two different binding sites. The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen binding protein or antibody will bind to two different epitopes, which can reside on the same or different protein targets. In some embodiments, the ASGR-1 antigen binding protein is a bispecific antibody. In certain embodiments, a bispecific antibody binds to ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 and PCSK9. In some embodiments, a bispecific antibody will bind to the ASGR-1 CBD and will inhibit ASGR-1 function, in addition to binding to PCSK9 and inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR. Methods of making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. One such method of making a \"bispecific,\" or \"bifunctional\" antigen binding protein or antibody involves the fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann, 1990, Clin. Immunol. 148:1547-1553. Another method involves engineering the Fc portion of the heavy chains such as to create \"knobs\" and \"holes\" which facilitate heterodimer formation of the heavy chains when co-expressed in a cell. U.S. Pat. No. 7,695,963. Still another method also involves engineering the Fc portion of the heavy chain but uses electrostatic steering to encourage heterodimer formation while discouraging homodimer formation of the heavy chains when co-expressed in a cell. WO 09/089,004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The term \"human antibody\" includes antibodies having antibody regions such as variable and constant regions or domains which correspond substantially to human germline immunoglobulin sequences known in the art, including, for example, those described by Kabat et al. (1991) (loc. cit.). The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs, and in particular, in CDR3. The human antibodies can have at least one, two, three, four, five, or more positions replaced with an amino acid residue that is not encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin sequence. The definition of human antibodies as used herein also contemplates fully human antibodies, which include only non-artificially and/or genetically altered human sequences of antibodies as those can be derived by using technologies or systems known in the art, such as for example, phage display technology or transgenic mouse technology, including but not limited to the Xenomouse. A humanized antibody has a sequence that differs from the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293. The term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibody. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibody. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibodies are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first human anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibody. Further, the framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 antibodies, from one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody or antibodies from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity. A \"neutralizing antigen binding protein\" or \"inhibitory antigen binding protein\" antibody\" or \"antagonizing antibody\") refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody, respectively, that binds to a target molecule and reduces and/or prevents the biological effect of that target molecule. This can be done, for example, by directly blocking a site on the target molecule through which the target molecule interacts with other molecules (e.g. blocking a ligand binding site of a receptor) or by indirectly blocking a site on the target molecule through which the target molecule interacts with other molecules (such as structural or energetic alterations in the target molecule). In some embodiments, these terms can also denote an antigen binding protein or antibody that prevents the target molecule to which it is bound from performing a biological function. In assessing the binding and/or specificity of an antigen binding protein, e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or fragment can substantially inhibit binding of a target molecule to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the target molecule by at least inhibition is complete. The measurement of reduction of binding is done using various assays known to those skilled in the art, (e.g., an in vitro competitive binding assay) and performed using relevant control molecules so that actual inhibition is measured. For example, numerous competition assays are well known in the art, with nonlimiting examples being competition ELISA, use of the BiaCore\u00ae platform, the Kinexa\u00ae platform, or the like. Further examples include: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoas say (MA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al., 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al., 1990, Virology 176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., 1990, Scand. J. Immunol. 32:7-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. In some embodiments, in the case of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2, such a neutralizing antigen binding protein or antibody can diminish the ability of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 to bind to a ligand. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is characterized and/or described via a competition assay. In some embodiments, the neutralizing ability is described in terms of an IC50 or EC50 value. The antigen binding proteins in at least Table C are strong neutralizers. In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding proteins neutralize by binding to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and preventing ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from binding to a ligand, including sugars such as lactose, galactose, and/or GalNAc or glycoproteins displaying such sugars, such as fetuin, orosomucoid and/or alkaline phosphatase (or reducing the ability of ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 to bind to ligand). Competitive inhibition can be measured by determining the amount of labelled ligand bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins or antibodies identified by competition assay (competing antigen binding proteins or antibodies) include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit (e.g., reduce) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a target antigen by at least 40-45%, 45-50%, 50-55%, 55-60%, embodiments, binding is inhibited by at least 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, 95-97%, or 97% or more, inhibition. In some embodiments, a ligand binding assay is used where cells expressing the target protein (e.g., ASGR-1) are mixed with antigen binding proteins and incubated for a time period, then washed. These cells are then incubated with labelled ligand (e.g., -GalNAc) for a time period and then washed and analyzed for ligand binding, where reduced ligand binding as compared to a relevant control antigen binding protein indicates inhibition of binding due to the antigen binding protein blocking or inhibiting this binding. Another manner in which the reduction in binding can be measured is the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The IC50 measures the amount or concentration of antigen binding protein that is needed to inhibit a given attribute (e.g., ligand binding) by half. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., human antibodies) have an IC50 value of 90 nM or less, in another embodiment, an IC50 value of 80 nM or less, in another embodiment, 70 nM or less, in another embodiment, 60 nM or less, in another embodiment, 50 nM or less, in another embodiment, 40 nM or less, in another embodiment, 30 nM or less, in another embodiment 25 nM or less. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR-1 monomer. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR-1 oligomer. In further embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR-2 monomer. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR-2 oligomer. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to both ASGR-1 monomers and ASGR-2 monomers. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR oligomer comprising an (ASGR-1)2-(ASGR-2)1 trimer. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR oligomer comprising an (ASGR-1)2 dimer. In further embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR oligomer comprising an (ASGR-1)3 trimer. In yet further embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR oligomer comprising an (ASGR-1)2-(ASGR-2)2 tetramer. In further embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to an ASGR oligomer comprising an (ASGR-1)3-(ASGR-2)2 pentamer. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to a multimeric complex comprising at least two subunits of ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, etc.) bind to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and inhibit ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from binding to a ligand, wherein the antigen binding proteins comprise specific amino acid residues at particular positions in the molecule (e.g., in the VH, VL or CDRs). These residues may be involved in the binding properties of desired molecules (e.g., part of the paratope). A \"paratope\" are used herein is the location in an antibody that binds to the antigen. The paratope can comprise several amino acid residues from the VH and/or VL CDRs, and also can comprise residues from the framework regions. The paratope binds to the antigen's epitope. Paratopes can be determined using methodologies similar to those described determining epitopes. Once the amino acid residues involved in the binding properties of desired molecules, are identified, this information can be used to design antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, etc.) that can bind to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and inhibit ASGR function (e.g., inhibit ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from binding to ligand). The binding site (or interface) between the representative antibodies and human ASGR-1 can be determined/defined a number of ways. For example, binding of representative antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) to human ASGR-1 was analyzed in Example 10 using X-ray crystallography, and the binding site or interface was determined using distance. The crystal structure of the antibody/huASGR1 complex provides information as to which residues of representative antibodies form the interface with human ASGR-1. As mentioned above, one of ordinary skill in the art may use this information to design antigen binding proteins and antigen binding protein variants, including those that contain variable domains having 90% identity or greater, 95% identity or greater, 97% identity or greater, 99% identity or greater, or those antigen binding protein variants that contain variable domains having 20 or less, 15 or less, or 10 or less, or 5 or less insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions within the light chain and/or heavy chain variable domain of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein. One may wish to maintain the amino acids within the interface while altering non-interface residues. Thus, in some embodiments, one may design and create antigen binding proteins and antigen binding protein variants of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein having one or more amino acid additions, substitutions, and/or deletions within one or more CDRs that maintain binding to human ASGR-1 and inhibit ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 function (e.g., inhibit ASGR, ASGR-1 and or ASGR-2 from binding to ligand).

4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or all amino acid residues selected from the group consisting further embodiments, consensus sequences among the antigen binding proteins of the inventions are envisioned. For example, the variable heavy chain and variable light chain regions (VH and VL) and the CDRs (HCDR1/2/3 and LCDR1/2/3) of the invention include consensus sequences derived from groups of related monoclonal antibodies. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) may be related by both sequence homology and function. As described herein, a \"consensus sequence\" refers to amino acid sequences having conserved amino acids common among a number of sequences and amino acids that vary within given amino acid sequences at certain positions. In some embodiments, the varied amino acid at a certain position is a substitution. In some embodiments, the varied amino acid at a certain position is a deletion. In some embodiments, the varied amino acid at a certain position is an addition or insertion. These varied amino acids will be apparent to one of skill in the art when analyzing particular antibody VH, VL and/or CDR sequences. For example, antibody sequences were analyzed using the following methodology. The Smith-Waterman algorithm was used to align amino acid sequences against translated IMGT germline V, D and J genes. The V gene was located first, then the J gene was located in the region downstream from located V gene, and finally the D gene was located in the region between V and J regions. Note, that since D gene is a relatively short sequence that is located in the hypervariable CDR3 region, a spurious match is possible and as such, was taken into consideration. Sequences from each group were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClustalW algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 22:4673-4680). In some cases, the Biosum cost matrix was used with a gap creation penalty of 50 was employed along with a gap extension penalty of 0.1. The sequence logos were generated by Geneious (v8.1.7, Biomatters) once the alignments were made and then exported as PDF images. The consensus sequences were generated in Geneious (v8.1.7, Biomatters) with a 0% threshold and exported as FASTA files. Amino acids that varied within each group were noted with the notation X within each consensus sequence. See Table 19A VH Consensus 1-14 and Table 20A VL Consensus 1-14 in FIG. 55, and Tables 21-48 in FIG. 56 for the consensus sequences resulting from this analysis. In other cases, the consensus sequences were generated in Abinitio. See Table 19A VH Consensus-15-60 and Table 20A VL Consensus 15-54 in FIG. 55, and Tables 49-134 in FIG. 57 for the consensus sequences resulting from this analysis. Alternatively, different methods of analysis readily available to one of skill in the art can be used. For example, consensus sequences can be determined using standard phylogenic analyses of the CDRs corresponding to the VH (i.e., Variable Heavy, etc.) & VL (i.e., Variable Light, etc.) of antibodies. For example, amino acid sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of either VH or VL can be converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies. Next, framework regions of these sequences can be replaced with an artificial linker sequence so that examination of the CDRs alone can be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events (e.g., such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage) while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a VH or VL. VH or VL sequences of this format can then be subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClustalW-like algorithm (see, Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 22:4673-4680). A gap creation penalty of 8.0 can be employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This program likewise generated phylograms (phylogenic tree illustrations) based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) or Neighbor-Joining methods (see, Saitou and Nei, 1987, Molecular Biology and Evolution 4:406-425) to construct & illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping. The original sequence alignments generated can be employed to empirically examine and document the occurrence of amino acids tolerated at each position with a consensus group. Consensus sequences for the groups of similar sequences within each CDR can then be prepared. In another type of approach, CDR consensus sequences can be determined for each separate CDR, independently of their contiguous context within the same sequence corresponding to a VH or VL. In this approach the consensus sequences can be determined by aligning each H-CDR1, H-CDR2, H-CDR3, L-CDR1, L-CDR2, and L-CDR3 in groups, i.e., by aligning the individual H-CDR1 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a H-CDR1 consensus sequence, by aligning the individual H-CDR2 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a H-CDR2 consensus sequence, by aligning the individual H-CDR3 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a H-CDR3 consensus sequence, by aligning the individual L-CDR1 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a L-CDR1 consensus sequence, by aligning the individual L-CDR2 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a L-CDR2 consensus sequence, and by aligning the individual L-CDR3 sequences of the antigen binding proteins to determine a L-CDR3 consensus sequence. Similarities between sequences within each individual CDR sequences can be identified. Consensus sequences for the groups of similar sequences within each CDR can then be prepared.

For example, but not limited to: an antibody that binds human and cynomolgus ASGR-1; an antibody that binds to human, cynomolgus and porcine ASGR-1; an antibody that binds to human, cynomolgus, rat and murine ASGR-2; an antibody that binds human ASGR-1 and human ASGR-2; an antibody that binds human and cynomolgus ASGR-1 and ASGR-2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins specifically bind to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from two or more different species and/or specifically bind ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 from the same species. As discussed herein, the ASGR receptor, and ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 separately, internalize into the cell upon ligand binding. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention provides antigen binding proteins that inhibit or reduce internalization of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention reduce ligand binding and also inhibit internalization of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention inhibit internalization without necessarily inhibiting ligand binding. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) of the invention are pH and/or calcium insensitive molecules, as well as binding to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and inhibiting the binding to a ligand. It is envisioned that these properties are desired to reduce or prevent the molecule from disassociating from the receptor during the endocytotic process in order to extend the half-life of the molecule. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) with pH-independent binding to its antigen such that the affinity for the antigen binding at physiological pH (i.e., pH 7.4) is similar to that at endosomal pH (i.e., pH 5.5-6.0). In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) with calcium-independent binding to its antigen such that the affinity for the antigen binding at assay conditions (i.e., 1 mM calcium) is similar to that in the absence of exogenously added calcium. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins with both pH- and calcium-independent binding to its antigen such that the affinity for the antigen binding at physiologic pH and in the presence of calcium is similar to that at endosomal pH (i.e., pH 5.5-6.0) and in the absence of calcium. Any number of methods known to one skilled in the art can be used to measure pH and/or calcium insensitivity, such as the method described in Example 7C below. ASGR-1, an asialoglycoprotein receptor, contains an N-term cytosolic domain, a transmembrane domain, a stalk region and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (alternatively known as the carbohydrate binding domain, or \"CBD\"). The carbohydrate recognition domain (\"CRD\") structure of ASGR-1 is reported in literature (M. Meier et al, JMB (2000)300, 857-865). The structure of ASGR-1 at a higher resolution than reported, and also when bound to various ligands (e.g., sugars including but not limited to lactose, galactose, and/or GalNAc or glycoproteins displaying such sugars including but not limited to fetuin, orosomucoid and/or alkaline phosphatase) is provided herein (see Example 10 and FIGS. 18-21 herein). Given the importance of this domain to the function of ASGR-1, in some embodiments, it is desirable to target this domain with the antigen binding proteins of the present invention. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of ASGR-1. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of human ASGR-1. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of 148-291, 149-291, In some embodiments, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds to human ASGR-1 CBD within Helix -1 or Helix -2. In some embodiments, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds to human ASGR-1 CBD within residues 174-186 of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds to human ASGR-1 CBD within residues 194-206 of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds to human ASGR-1 CBD at the same or overlapping binding site as where a ligand binds (e.g., sugars including but not limited to lactose, galactose, and/or GalNAc or glycoproteins displaying such sugars including but not limited to fetuin, orosomucoid and/or alkaline phosphatase or other sugars and glycoproteins capable of binding to ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2). In some embodiments, the invention comprises an isolated antigen binding protein that binds to human ASGR-1 CBD within residues 237-273 or residues 240-267 of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of cynomolgus ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of porcine ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of canine ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of murine ASGR-1. In yet some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of rat ASGR-1. In yet some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to the CBD of two or more different ASGR-1 species, for example, but not limited to, human ASGR-1 and cynomolgus ASGR-1, or human ASGR-1, ASGR-1 and murine ASGR-1. In further embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to ASGR-1 and inhibit binding of ligand to ASGR-1. In a specific embodiment, the ligands that are inhibited include, but are not limited to, sugars including but not limited to lactose, galactose, and/or GalNAc or glycoproteins displaying such sugars including but not limited to fetuin, orosomucoid and/or alkaline phosphatase or other sugars and glycoproteins of binding to ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2. The tyrosine at position 272 of ASGR-1 (position 273 of human ASGR-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)) appears to be important for protein stability, as it displays hydrogen bonding to D266 of murine ASGR-1 and several van der Waals of murine ASGR-1 (N208, W210, and lectins, Y272 of murine ASGR-1 may play a role in carbohydrate binding and function of ASGR-1. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to or interact with Y273 of human ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to ASGR-1 at an epitope that comprises Y273 of human ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention bind to ASGR-1 at an epitope that results in Y273 of human ASGR-1 being unable to take part in binding ligand.

In order to relate unique antigen binding protein sequence features to specific functions or binding characteristics, sequences from antigen binding proteins of the invention from various characterization bins can be analyzed. For example, antigen binding proteins of the invention can be tested for their ability to bind a variety of binning probes (e.g., membrane preps from cells expressing ASGR-1 from different species or soluble huASGR-1). For each unique binding bin, the heavy and light chain sequences from each of the antigen binding proteins can be compared and claded based on, for example: 1. the unique VDJ and VJ rearrangements; 2. divergence from germline (ie. unique somatic hypermutation); and 3. relatedness to other antigen binding proteins of the same bin. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins comprising the same or similar sequence features and patterns, will have substantially the same or similar binding characteristics. In specific embodiments, these antigen binding proteins can bind to the same or similar epitope with varying affinities. The exemplary antigen binding proteins described herein have properties based on the epitope on ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 that is bound by the antigen binding protein. The term \"epitope\" includes any determinant capable of being bound by an antigen binding protein, such as an antibody. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by, or interacts with, an antigen binding protein that targets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes specific amino acids that directly contact, or interact with, the antigen binding protein. An epitope can be formed both by contiguous amino acids or non-contiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. A \"linear epitope\" is an epitope where an amino acid primary sequence comprises the recognized epitope. A linear epitope typically includes at least 3 or at least 4, and more usually, at least 5 or at least 6 or at least 7, for example, about 8 to about 10 amino acids in a unique sequence. A \"conformational epitope\", in contrast to a linear epitope, is a group of discontinuous amino acids (e.g., in a polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the polypeptide's primary sequence but that, in the context of the polypeptide's tertiary and quaternary structure, are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein). Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antigen binding proteins specific for a particular target molecule will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target molecule in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. Methods of characterizing the epitope bound by an antigen binding protein are well known in the art, including, but not limited to, binning (competition and/or cross-competition) (Miller et al \"Epitope binning of monoclonal antibodies by a Immunol Methods (2011) 365, 118-25), (e.g., 99, mutagenesis methods as \"Epitope of Ibalizumab, a Humanized Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibody with Patients\" J. Virol. (2010) 84, 6935-6942), alanine scanning (Cunningham and \"High-resolution epitope mapping of interactions by alanine-scanning mutagenesis\" Science (1989) 244, 1081-1085), arginine scanning (Lim et al \"A diversity of antibody epitopes can induce signaling through the erythropoietin receptor\" Biochemistry (2010) 49, 3797-3804), HD exchange methods (Coates et al \"Epitope mapping by amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with immobilization of antibody, on-line proteolysis, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry\" Commun. Mass Spectrom. (2009) 23 NMR cross saturation methods (Morgan et al \"Precise epitope malaria parasite inhibitory antibodies al \"Structure of IL-17A in complex with a potent, fully human neutralizing antibody\" J. Mol. Biol (2009) 394, 905-21). The methods vary in the level of detail they provide as to the amino acids comprising the epitope. Antigen binding proteins of the present invention include those that have an identical or overlapping epitope with an exemplary antigen binding protein described in Tables 2-7. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein has an identical epitope as to the exemplary antigen binding proteins. In other embodiments, the antigen binding protein binds only a subset of the same amino acids as the exemplary antigen binding protein.

Antigen binding proteins that have an identical or overlapping epitope will often compete for binding to the antigen, ASGR, ASGR1 and/or ASGR2. Thus, in certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment thereof) of the invention competes with the antigen binding proteins described in Tables 2-7. In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment thereof) of the invention competes with the antigen binding proteins described in Tables A, B and C. In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment thereof) of the invention competes with the antigen binding proteins described in Table 6. To \"compete\" or \"competition\" means the antigen binding proteins compete for the same epitope or binding site on a target. Such competition can be determined by an assay in which the reference antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment thereof) prevents or inhibits specific binding of a test antigen binding protein. Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if a test molecule competes with a reference molecule for binding. Examples of assays that can be employed include solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al. (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253), solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619), solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay, Luminex (Jia et al \"A novel method of Multiplexed Competitive Antibody Binning for the characterization of monoclonal antibodies\" J. Immunological Methods (2004) 288, 91-98) and surface plasmon resonance ((Song et al \"Epitope Mapping of Ibalizumab, a Humanized Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibody with Activity in Infected Patients\" J. Virol. (2010) 84, 6935-6942). An exemplary method of determining competition is described in Example 7D. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess, it will inhibit binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or 75%. In some instances, binding 97%, 98%, 99%, or more. Besides competition, antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies or antibody fragments thereof) with identical, overlapping, or similar epitopes may be affected by mutagenesis of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 similarly. In brief, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 (e.g., a wild-type antigen) and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated or variant ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 protein. By making a number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified. From the knowledge of these amino acids, the domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain can include the binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. As mentioned above, one specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol (see, e.g., Nanevicz, T., et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem., 270:37, 21619-21625 and Zupnick, A., et al., 2006, Biol. Chem., 281:29, 20464-20473). In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginine residues that exist in the wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding. In Example 7E, scanning arginine/glutamic acid mutagenesis was performed using the human ASGR-1 CBD domain and the effect on exemplary antibodies was determined. Included with the scope of the invention are ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 antigen binding proteins having characteristics such that they are affected in a similar way as an exemplary antibody to mutagenesis. Example 7E describes one such arginine/glutamic acid scanning of ASGR-1 for ASGR-1 antigen binding proteins provided herein. A series of mutant ASGR-1 antigens were created, with each mutant antigen having a single mutation. Binding of each mutant ASGR-1 antigen with various ASGR-1 antigen binding proteins was measured and compared to the ability of the selected antigen binding proteins to bind to human ASGR-1 (SEQ ID NO:5). In certain embodiments, binding of an antigen binding protein of the present invention to ASGR-1 is inhibited by a single mutation in ASGR-1, wherein the single mutation is selected from the group NO:5.

In some embodiments, antibodies that interact with residues in common across different ligands can result in a similar form of inhibition (direct) across the various ligands. Examples of such residues are underlined and in bold in Table D. TABLE D Summary of Binding Characteristics of Representative Antigen Binding Proteins Derived from Examples 7 and 10. Interaction Site Interaction Site Ligand/mAb mAb Epitope (crystal structure <5 can directly inhibit ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand binding. While described herein in greater detail, and while not intended to be limiting by theory, such an interaction can denote that the antibody interacts with the section of ASGR-1 CBD that binds to its ligand directly, such that a paratope or other section of an antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody) directly obstructs the ligand's access to the binding site in ASGR1 CBD. An antigen binding protein or antibody can be designated as a direct inhibitor when it has one or more of the characteristics of the direct inhibitors provided herein, including the examples below (such as example 10, or the crystal structures referenced therein). Some examples of direct inhibition are shown by 72G9, 54E9, 218G4 and 176H4 and are indicated in Table D. In some embodiments, a direct inhibitor can bind to one or more of residues 237-273 or residues 240-267 of SEQ ID NO:5 of ASGR-1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein or antibody can indirectly inhibit ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand binding. While described herein in greater detail, and while not intended to be limiting by theory, this denotes that the antigen binding protein or antibody binds to ASGR-1 CBD, but need not directly obstruct the ligand's access to the binding site in ASGR-1 CBD. An antigen binding protein or antibody can be designated as an indirect inhibitor when it has one or more of the characteristics of the indirect inhibitors provided herein, including the examples below (such as example 10 or the crystal structures provided therein). Some examples of indirect inhibition are shown by 5E5, 4A2, 7E11, 4H6, 22G5, 194A4, and are indicated in Table D. While not limiting, it is noted that indirect inhibition can occur from a variety of interactions or rearrangements. For example, indirect inhibition may occur from a conformational rearrangement of the carbohydrate binding loop occurs which could impair the carbohydrate binding loop from binding to/interacting with ligand (i.e., carbohydrates). In some embodiments, an indirect inhibitor can bind to one or more of the residues in ASGR-1 CBD helix alpha 1 and/or helix alpha 2. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to ASGR-1 and results in the disordering of the CBD. In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein or antibody can have characteristics of both direct and indirect inhibition and/or bind to areas on ASGR-1 CBD that are common to both types of inhibition. Of course, such an embodiment may have sufficient inhibition capability through its direct, indirect, or both direct and indirect interactions. In some embodiments, the distinction between direct and indirect inhibition need not be made. In some embodiments, denoting that an antigen binding protein or antibody provides direct or indirect inhibition means that it provides at least that form of inhibition (e.g., ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand blocking). In some embodiments, an antigen binding protein or antibody that provides direct inhibition, may also provide indirect aspects as well (such as other conformational changes). In addition, as shown in Table D, as the interaction between ASGR-1 CBD and its ligands can vary for each of the noted three ligands, what may be a direct or indirect interaction for one ligand, need not be direct or indirect for another. While the antibodies provided herein that have the properties of direct and/or indirect inhibition will function accordingly, and the guidance provided herein allows for one to screen for and produce additional such antibodies, the fact that an antibody simply binds to ASGR-1 CBD does not necessarily mean that it will bind at the relevant locations on ASGR-1 to allow for direct or indirect inhibition.

In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein or antibody does not bind to two or more variant ASGR-1 proteins, wherein the variant ASGR-1 proteins comprise the single mutations of the group individually. A \"CDR grafted antibody\" is an antibody comprising one or more CDRs derived from an antibody of a particular species or isotype and the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype. A \"multi-specific antibody\" is an antibody that recognizes more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a \"bi-specific antibody\" which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens. An antigen binding protein including an antibody \"specifically binds\" to an antigen, such as ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2, if it binds to the antigen with a tight binding affinity as determined by a equilibrium dissociation constant (KD, or corresponding KD, as defined below) value of 107 M or less. An antigen binding protein that specifically binds to human ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 may be able to bind to ASGR, ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 from other species as well with the same or different affinities. Affinity can be determined using a variety of techniques known in the art, for example but not limited to, equilibrium methods (e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay radioimmunoassay (RIA)), or by a surface plasmon resonance assay or other mechanism of kinetics-based assay (e.g., BIACORE\u00ae analysis or Octet\u00ae analysis (forteBIO)), and other methods such as indirect binding assays, competitive binding assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), gel electrophoresis and chromatography (e.g., gel filtration). These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and/or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul, W. E., ed., Fundamental Immunology, 4th Ed., Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia (1999), which focuses on antibody-immunogen interactions. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoas say comprising the incubation of labeled antigen with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. Further embodiments of the invention provide antigen binding molecules (e.g., antibodies) that specifically bind ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant or KD (koff/kon) of less than 107 M, or of less than 108 M, or of less than 109 M, or of less than 1010 M, or of less than 1011 M, or of less than 1012 M, or of less than 1013 M, or of less than 5\u00d71013 M (lower values indicating tighter binding affinity). Yet further embodiments of the invention are antigen binding molecules that specifically bind ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant or KD (koff/kon) of less than about 107 M, or of less than about 108 M, or of less than about 109 M, or of less than about 1010 M, or of less than about 1011 M, or of less than about 1012 M, or of less than about 1013 M, or of less than about 5\u00d71013 M. In still another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention (e.g., an antibody) that specifically bind ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 has an equilibrium dissociation constant or KD (koff/kon) of between about 107 M and about 108 M, between about 108 M and about 109 M, between about 109 M and about 1010 M, between about 1010 M and about 1011 M, between about 1011 M and about 1012 M, between about 1012 M and about 1013 M. In still another embodiment, an antibody of the invention that specifically bind ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 has an equilibrium dissociation constant or KD (koff/kon) of between 107 M and 108 M, between 108 M and 109 M, between 109 M and 1010 M, between 1010 M and 1011 M, between 1011 M and 1012 M, between 1012 M and 1013 M. It will be appreciated that an antigen binding protein of the present invention (e.g., an antibody or fragments thereof) may have at least one amino acid substitution, providing that the antigen binding protein retains the same or better desired binding specificity (e.g., binding to human ASGR, human ASGR-1, and/or human ASGR-2)(See Example 14). Therefore, modifications to the antigen binding protein structures are encompassed within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein (e.g., but not limited to, an antibody) comprises sequences that each independently differ by 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 single amino acid additions, substitutions, and/or deletions from a CDR sequence of those set forth in Table 2 herein. As used herein, a CDR sequence that differs by no more than a total of, for example, four amino acid additions, substitutions and/or deletions from a CDR sequence shown in Table 2 below refers to a sequence with 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 single amino acid additions, substitutions, and/or deletions compared with the sequences shown in Table 2. These may include amino acid substitutions, which may be conservative or non-conservative that do not destroy the desired binding capability of an antibody. Conservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties. A conservative amino acid substitution may also involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. In some embodiments, the one or more substitutions to one or more of the antibody sequences can be as follows for each noted section in the noted antibody: 1) VH1-08/D6|6-19|RF1/JH4, 25A4 H CDR2 sequence\u2014WMYPN---SGNTGYAQKFQG, where N at 11 can be S or Q and T at 12 can be A or V, such that the sequence can be Trp Met Tyr Pro Asn Ser Gly X1 X2 Gly Tyr Ala Gln Gln Gly (SEQ ID NO: 50259) wherein X1=N or S or Q or a conservative substitution thereof, X2=T or A or V or a conservative substitution thereof. 2) VH111-08/D6|6-19|RF1/JH4, 4A2 H CDR2 sequence\u2014WMHPN---SGNTGYAQKFQG, where N at 11 can be S or Q, and T at 12 can be A or E, such that the sequence can be Trp Met His Pro Asn Ser Gly X1 X2 Gly Tyr Ala Gln Gln Gly (SEQ ID NO: 50260) wherein X1=N or S or Q or a conservative substitution thereof, X2=T or A or E or a conservative substitution thereof. 3) VK4|B3/JK3, 4A2 L CDR3 sequence\u2014QQYYN-----------------------TPVT, where N at 5 can be Q, and T at 29 can be A, such that the sequence can be Gln Gln Tyr Tyr X1 NO: 50261) wherein X1=N or Q or a conservative substitution thereof, X2=T or A or a conservative substitution thereof. 4) VH1-02/D1|1-1|RF1/JH4, 4H6 H CDR3 sequence\u2014DGTS----------------------SFDY, where D at 1 can be S, G at 2 can be A, such that the sequence can be X1 X2 Thr Ser Ser Phe Asp Tyr (SEQ ID NO: 50262) wherein X1=D or S or a conservative substitution thereof, X2=or A or a conservative substitution thereof. 5) VH3|3-33/D4|4-11|RF2/JH6 and VH3|3-07/D4|4-11|RF2/JH6, 7E11 H CDR2 sequence\u2014IIWHD---GSNKYYADSVKG, where D at 5 can be S or E, G at 9 can be A, D at 16 can be E, and S at 17 can be A, such that the sequence can be Ile Ile Trp His X1 X2 Ser Asn Lys Tyr Tyr Lys Gly (SEQ ID NO: 50263) wherein X1=D or S or E or a conservative substitution thereof, X2=G or A or a conservative substitution thereof, X3=D or E or a conservative substitution thereof, X4=S or A or a conservative substitution thereof. 6) VH3|3-33/D6|6-6|RF1/JH6 and VH3|3-07/D6|6-6|RF1/JH6, 5E5 H CDR2 sequence VIWYD---GSNKYYADSVKG, where G at 9 can be A, D at 16 can be E or G, and S at 17 can be A, such that the sequence can be Val Be Trp Tyr Asp X1 Ser Asn Lys Tyr Tyr Ala X2 X3 Val Lys Gly (SEQ ID NO: 50264) wherein X1=G or A or a conservative substitution thereof X2=D or E or G or a conservative substitution thereof X3=S or A or a conservative substitution thereof. 7) VH3|3-33/D6|6-6|RF1/JH6 and VH3|3-07/D6|6-6|RF1/JH6, 5E5 H CDR3 sequence EVYSSGW----------------YDYGMDV, where W at 7 can be F, such that the sequence can be Glu Val Tyr Ser Ser Gly X1 Tyr Asp Tyr Gly Met Asp Val (SEQ ID NO: 50265) wherein X1=W or F or a conservative substitution thereof. In some embodiments, any one or more of the above CDR sequences can be combined with any one or more of the CDR sequences provided herein (e.g., Table 2 in FIG. 49, and Tables 19A-C and Tables 20A-C in FIG. 55). In some embodiments, any one or more of the above CDR sequences can be combined with any one or more CDR sequences provided herein for the designated antibody to provide antibody of 6 CDRs (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3, HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3). For example, any one or more of the above CDRs can be used as one of the CDRs for the antibodies provided in Table 2 in FIG. 49 and/or Tables 19A, 19B, 19C, 20A, 20B and/or 20C in FIG. 55. In some embodiments, the variant positions provided in the above consensus sequences can be further combined as optional variations with the variations of sequence provided in Table 2 in FIG. 49, and Tables 19A-C and Tables 20A-C in FIG. 55, such that any demonstrated combination of sequences in one consensus sequence (e.g., for an antibody, such as 4A2 H CDR2 above) can be combined with all permissible options outlined for the relevant antibody in Table 2 in FIG. 49, and Tables 19A-C and Tables 20A-C in FIG. 55 (e.g., the corresponding 4A2 H CDR2), which can further be combined with any of the other 4A2 sequences in Table 2 in FIG. 49, and Tables 19A-C and Tables 20A-C in FIG. 55 (e.g., HCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3). Of course, 4A2 L CDR3 noted above can similarly be combined, and/or combined with the immediate combination as well. Thus, such sequences are not disclosed herein as needing to be alternative sequences, but are contemplated as additional options for the noted sequences. In some embodiments, variants of such sequences are also contemplated. Such variants can retain or have superior desired activity. Examples of such aspects are provided in Example 14 and tables 6 and 7. In some embodiments, any one or more of the FR regions in tables 6 and 7 can be combined with any one or more of the CDR sequences provided herein. In some embodiments, any one or more of the FR regions provided in Table 6 or 7 can be combined with the corresponding CDR set for the corresponding antibody (as a set of 6 CDRs). Thus, variants of antibody 4A2 are particular sequence of which can be from any of the designated sequences for antibody 4A2 provided herein (the present paragraph, Tables 2, 6 and/or 7, tables 19A, 19B, and 19C, 20A, 20B and 20C, etc). Non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one class of amino acids or amino acid mimetics for a member from another class with different physical properties (e.g. size, polarity, hydrophobicity, charge). In certain embodiments, such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of a human antibody that are homologous with non-human antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule. Moreover, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations. A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the antigen binding protein as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides as has been describe above. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure. Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues. In some embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify residues that may be changed that result in enhanced properties as desired. For example, an amino acid substitution (conservative or non-conservative) may result in enhanced binding affinity to human ASGR, human ASGR-1, and/or human ASGR-2, or enhanced binding affinity to other species of ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2. One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou Biochem., 47:251-276 and Chou et al., Biophys. J., 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(1):244-247 (1999). Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include D., Curr. supra (1997)). In certain embodiments, variants of the antigen binding protein include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of a parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines. Desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. In certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of antibodies to the target of interest, or to increase or decrease the affinity of the antibodies to the target of interest described herein. According to certain embodiments, desired amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physiochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al.

While specific embodiments relating to the antigen binding protein identified as 4A2 are set forth above with particularity, the embodiments of the present invention are not intended to be limited in scope to this individual embodiment.

It is fully anticipated that the embodiments of the present invention include antigen binding proteins comprising heavy chain variable domains containing one or more VH CDR1 (HCDR1), VH CDR2 (HCDR2) and/or VH CDR3 (HCDR3) and/or light chain variable one in Tables 2-7 in FIGS. 49-57, respectively, as well as Tables 19A-C and Tables 20A-C in FIG. 55, Tables 21-134 in FIGS. 56 and 57, and Tables A, B and C. TABLE A Exemplary Heavy and Light Chain Variable Regions Ab SEQ ID NOs: SEQ ID NOs: Exemplary Heavy and Light Chain Variable Regions and Heavy and Light Chain CDR1/2/3 In the exemplary embodiments described above, the antigen binding proteins maintain desired binding to the various desired species of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In another embodiment, the light-chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is at to the sequence of a light chain variable domain listed above. In another embodiment, the light chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is polynucleotide sequence listed above. In another embodiment, the light chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under moderately stringent conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide that encodes a light chain variable domain selected from the sequences listed above. In another embodiment, the light chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide that encodes a light chain variable domain selected from the group consisting of the sequences listed above. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is at to the sequence of a heavy chain variable domain selected from the sequences listed above. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is nucleotide sequence that encodes a heavy chain variable domain selected from the sequences listed above. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under moderately stringent conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide that encodes a heavy chain variable domain selected from the sequences listed above. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that is encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the complement of a polynucleotide that encodes a heavy chain variable domain selected from the sequences listed above. In the exemplary embodiments described above, the antigen binding proteins maintain desired binding to the various desired species of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. Antigen binding proteins of the invention (e.g., antibodies) can comprise any constant region known in the art. The light chain constant region can be, for example, a kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region, e.g., a human kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region can be, for example, an alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy human alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant region. Techniques are known for deriving an antibody of a different subclass or isotype from an antibody of interest, i.e., subclass switching. Thus, IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See also Lanitto et al., Methods Mol. Biol. 178:303-16 (2002). In one embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention further comprises the constant light chain kappa or lambda domains or a fragment of these. Exemplary sequences of the light chain constant regions and polynucleotides encoding them are provided in Table 15 below, and are generally well known in the art. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention further comprises a heavy chain constant domain, or a fragment thereof, such as the IgG1 or IgG2 heavy chain constant region provided in Table 15. The antigen binding proteins (for example, antibodies) of the present invention include those having a desired isotype (for example, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab)2 fragments thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al., 1997, Protein Science 6:407, (incorporated by reference herein) to alleviate a tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies. Generation of Antibodies Antibodies of the invention may be prepared by techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, by immunizing an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat or rabbit) and then by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art, e.g., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. See, for example, Antibodies; Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1st Edition, e.g. from 1988, or 2nd Edition, e.g. from 2014). In one embodiment, a humanized monoclonal antibody comprises the variable domain of a murine antibody (or all or part of the antigen binding site thereof) and a constant domain derived from a human antibody. Alternatively, a humanized antibody fragment may comprise the antigen binding site of a murine monoclonal antibody and a variable domain fragment (lacking the antigen-binding site) derived from a human antibody. Procedures for the production of engineered monoclonal antibodies include those described in Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323, Liu et al., 1987, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439, Larrick et al., 1989, Bio/Technology 7:934, and Winter et al., 1993, TIPS 14:139. In one embodiment, the chimeric antibody is a CDR grafted antibody. Techniques for humanizing antibodies are discussed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,619; 5,225,539; 5,821,337; et al., 2000, J. Immunol. 164:1432-41, Zhang, W., et al., Molecular Immunology. 42(12):1445-1451, 2005; Hwang W. et al., Methods. 36(1):35-42, 2005; Dall'Acqua W F, et al., Methods 36(1):43-60, 2005; and Clark, M., Immunology Today. 21(8):397-402, 2000. An antibody of the present invention may also be a fully human monoclonal antibody. Fully human monoclonal antibodies may be generated by any number of techniques with which those having ordinary skill in the art will be familiar. Such methods include, but are not limited to, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of human peripheral blood cells (e.g., containing B lymphocytes), in vitro immunization of human B-cells, fusion of spleen cells from immunized transgenic mice carrying inserted human immunoglobulin genes, isolation from human immunoglobulin V region phage libraries, or other procedures as known in the art and based on the disclosure herein. Procedures have been developed for generating human monoclonal antibodies in non-human animals. For example, mice in which one or more endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been inactivated by various means have been prepared. Human immunoglobulin genes have been introduced into the mice to replace the inactivated mouse genes. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci (see also Bruggemann et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. For immunoglobulin transgenes may be mini-gene constructs, or transloci on yeast artificial chromosomes, which undergo B-cell-specific DNA rearrangement and hypermutation in the mouse lymphoid tissue. Antibodies produced in the animal incorporate human immunoglobulin polypeptide chains encoded by the human genetic material introduced into the animal. In one embodiment, a non-human animal, such as a transgenic mouse, is immunized with a suitable immunogen. Examples of techniques for production and use of transgenic animals for the production of human or partially human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,318, 5,569,825, and 5,545,806, Davis et al., Production of human antibodies from transgenic mice in Lo, ed.

Biotechnol. 8:455-58; al., 1995 Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 764:525-35. In addition, protocols involving the XenoMouse\u00ae (Abgenix, now Amgen, Inc.) are described, for example in U.S. Ser. No. 05/011,8643 and WO 05/694879, WO 98/24838, WO 00/76310, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,064,244. Lymphoid cells from the immunized transgenic mice are fused with myeloma cells for example to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use in such fusions include Bul; examples rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6. The lymphoid (e.g., spleen) cells and the myeloma cells may be combined for a few minutes with a membrane fusion-promoting agent, such as polyethylene glycol or a nonionic detergent, and then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybridoma cells but not unfused myeloma cells. One selection media is HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine). After a sufficient time, usually about one to two weeks, colonies of cells are observed. Single colonies are isolated, and antibodies produced by the cells may be tested for binding activity to, for example, human ASGR-1, using any one of a variety of immunoassays known in the art and described herein. The hybridomas are cloned (e.g., by limited dilution cloning or by soft agar plaque isolation) and positive clones that produce an antibody specific to, for example, human ASGR-1, are selected and cultured. The monoclonal antibodies from the hybridoma cultures may be isolated from the supernatants of hybridoma cultures. Thus the present invention provides hybridomas that comprise polynucleotides encoding the antigen binding proteins of the invention in the chromosomes of the cell. These hybridomas can be cultured according to methods described herein and known in the art. Another method for generating human antibodies of the invention includes immortalizing human peripheral blood cells by EBV transformation. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,456. Such an immortalized B-cell line (or lymphoblastoid cell line) producing a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to, for example, human ASGR-1, can be identified by immunodetection methods as provided herein, for example, an ELISA, and then isolated by standard cloning techniques. The stability of the lymphoblastoid cell line producing an antibody may be improved by fusing the transformed cell line with a murine myeloma to produce a mouse-human hybrid cell line according to methods known in the art (see, e.g., Glasky et al., Hybridoma 8:377-89 (1989)). Still another method to generate human monoclonal antibodies is in vitro immunization, which includes priming human splenic B-cells with antigen, followed by fusion of primed B-cells with a heterohybrid fusion partner. See, e.g., Boerner et al., 1991 J. Immunol. 147:86-95. In certain embodiments, a B-cell that is producing a desired antibody is selected and the light chain and heavy chain variable regions are cloned from the B-cell according to molecular biology techniques known in the art (WO 92/02551; U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,052; Babcook et al., Proc. Sci. and described herein. B-cells from an immunized animal may be isolated from the spleen, lymph node, or peripheral blood sample by selecting a cell that is producing a desired antibody. B-cells may also be isolated from humans, for example, from a peripheral blood sample. Methods for detecting single B-cells that are producing an antibody with the desired specificity are well known in the art, for example, by plaque formation, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, in vitro stimulation followed by detection of specific antibody, and the like. Methods for selection of specific antibody-producing B-cells include, for example, preparing a single cell suspension of B-cells in soft agar that contains antigen. Binding of the specific antibody produced by the B-cell to the antigen results in the formation of a complex, which may be visible as an immunoprecipitate. After the B-cells producing the desired antibody are selected, the specific antibody genes may be cloned by isolating and amplifying DNA or mRNA according to methods known in the art and described herein. An additional method for obtaining antibodies of the invention is by phage display. See, e.g., Winter et al., 1994 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:433-55; Burton et al., 1994 Adv. Human or murine immunoglobulin variable region gene combinatorial libraries may be created in phage vectors that can be screened to select Ig fragments (Fab, Fv, sFv, or multimers thereof) that bind specifically to TGF-beta binding protein or variant or fragment thereof. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Huse et al., 1989 Science 246:1275-81; Acad. Sci. USA et al., Strategies in Molecular Biology 3:1-9 (1990); Kang et al., 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. 227:381-388; Schlebusch et al., 1997 Hybridoma 16:47-52 and references cited therein. For example, a library containing a plurality of polynucleotide sequences encoding Ig variable region fragments may be inserted into the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or a variant thereof, in frame with the sequence encoding a phage coat protein. A fusion protein may be a fusion of the coat protein with the light chain variable region domain and/or with the heavy chain variable region domain. According to certain embodiments, immunoglobulin Fab fragments may also be displayed on a phage particle (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,426). Heavy and light chain immunoglobulin cDNA expression libraries may also be prepared in lambda phage, for example, using lmmunoZap(H) and ImmunoZap(L) vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Briefly, mRNA is isolated from a B-cell population, and used to create heavy and light chain immunoglobulin cDNA expression libraries in the ImmunoZap(H) and ImmunoZap(L) vectors. These vectors may be screened individually or co-expressed to form Fab fragments or antibodies (see Huse et al., supra; see also Sastry et al., supra). Positive plaques may subsequently be converted to a non-lytic plasmid that allows high level expression of monoclonal antibody fragments from E. coli. In one embodiment, in a hybridoma the variable regions of a gene expressing a monoclonal antibody of interest are amplified using nucleotide primers. These primers may be synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art, or may be purchased from commercially available sources. (See, e.g., Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.), which sells primers for mouse and human variable regions including, among others, for VHa, These primers may be used to amplify heavy or light chain variable regions, which may then be inserted into vectors such as ImmunoZAPH or ImmunoZAPL (Stratagene), respectively. These vectors may then be introduced into E. coli, yeast, or mammalian-based systems for expression. Large amounts of a single-chain protein containing a fusion of the VH and VL domains may be produced using these methods (see Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988). In certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention are obtained from transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that produce \"heavy chain only\" antibodies or \"HCAbs.\" HCAbs are analogous to naturally occurring camel and llama single-chain VHH antibodies. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,507,748 and 8,502,014, and U.S. Patent Application US2009/0307787A1, US2011/0314563A1, US2012/0151610A1, WO2008/122886A2, and WO2009/013620A2. Once cells producing antibodies according to the invention have been obtained using any of the above-described immunization and other techniques, the specific antibody genes may be cloned by isolating and amplifying DNA or mRNA therefrom according to standard procedures as described herein. The antibodies produced therefrom may be sequenced and the CDRs identified and the DNA coding for the CDRs may be manipulated as described previously to generate other antibodies according to the invention. In certain embodiments, antibodies are generated by first identifying antibodies that bind to cells expressing, for example, human ASGR, human ASGR-1 and/or human ASGR-2, and/or compete for binding with the antibodies described in this application. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that some proteins, such as antibodies, may undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of these modifications often depends on the host cell line used to express the protein as well as the culture conditions. Such modifications may include variations in glycosylation, methionine oxidation, diketopiperizine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine frequent modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine) due to the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, R. J. Journal of Chromatography 705:129-134, 1995). An alternative method for production of a murine monoclonal antibody is to inject the hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of a syngeneic mouse, for example, a mouse that has been treated (e.g., pristane-primed) to promote formation of ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and purified by a variety of well-established techniques. Such isolation techniques include affinity chromatography with Protein-A size-exclusion chromatography, and 2.9.1-2.9.3; Baines et al., \"Purification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\" in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 10, pages 79-104 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992)). Monoclonal antibodies may be purified by affinity chromatography using an appropriate ligand selected based on particular properties of the antibody (e.g., heavy or light chain isotype, binding specificity, etc.). Examples of a suitable ligand, immobilized on a solid support, include Protein A, Protein G, an anticonstant region (light chain or heavy chain) antibody, an anti-idiotype antibody, and a TGF-beta binding protein, or fragment or variant thereof. Molecular evolution of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the center of the antibody binding site also has been used to isolate antibodies with increased affinity, for example, those as described by Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551. Accordingly, such techniques are useful in preparing antibodies of the invention. Although human, partially human, or humanized antibodies will be suitable for many applications, particularly those involving administration of the antibody to a human subject, other types of antigen binding proteins will be suitable for certain applications. The non-human antibodies of the invention can be, for example, derived from any antibody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate (for example, monkey such as cynomologous or rhesus monkey) or ape (e.g., chimpanzee)). Non-human antibodies of the invention can be used, for example, in in vitro and cell-culture based applications, or any other application where an immune response to the antibody of the invention does not occur, is insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. An antibody from a particular species can be made by, for example, immunizing an animal of that species with the desired immunogen or using an artificial system for generating antibodies of that species (e.g., a bacterial or phage display-based system for generating antibodies of a particular species), or by converting an antibody from one species into an antibody from another species by replacing, e.g., the constant region of the antibody with a constant region from the other species, or by replacing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody so that it more closely resembles the sequence of an antibody from the other species. In one embodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid sequences derived from antibodies from two or more different species. Antibodies also may be prepared by any of a number of other conventional techniques. For example, they may be purified from cells that naturally express them (e.g., an antibody can be purified from a hybridoma that produces it), or produced in recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See, for example, Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Kenneth et al. (eds.), Plenum Press, New York (1980); and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Land (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988). Where it is desired to improve the affinity of antibodies according to the invention containing one or more of the above-mentioned CDRs can be obtained by a number of affinity maturation protocols including maintaining the CDRs (Yang et al., J. Mol. Biol., 254, 392-403, 1995), chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology, 10, 779-783, 1992), use of mutation strains of E. coli. (Low et al., J. Mol. Biol., 250, 350-368, 1996), Biotechnol., (Thompson et J. Mol. Biol., 256, 7-88, 1996) and additional PCR techniques (Crameri, et al., Nature, 391, 288-291, 1998). All of these methods of affinity maturation are discussed by Vaughan et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 16, 535-539, 1998). Single chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (VL and VH). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining VL and VH-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879; Ward et al., 1989, Nature 334:544, de Graaf et al., 2002, Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-87. Antigen binding fragments derived from an antibody can also be obtained, for example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody, for example, pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies according to conventional methods. By way of example, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment termed F(ab)2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce 3.5S Fab monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using papain produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et in Methods in Enzymology 1:422 (Academic Press 1967); and by Andrews, S. M. and Titus, J. A. in Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan J. E., et al., eds), John Wiley & Sons, New York (2003), pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10A. 1-2.10A. 5. Other methods for cleaving antibodies, such as separating heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments (Fd), further cleaving of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical, or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. Another exemplary form of an antigen binding protein is a peptide comprising one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody. CDRs can be obtained by constructing polynucleotides that encode the CDR of interest. Such polynucleotides are prepared, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region using mRNA of antibody-producing cells as a template (see, for example, Larrick et al., Methods: A Companion to Methods Antibodies: Production, Engineering and Clinical Application, Ritter et al. (eds.), page 166 (Cambridge University Press 1995); and Ward et al., \"Genetic Manipulation and Expression of Antibodies,\" in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Birch et al., (eds.), page 137 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995)). The antibody fragment further may comprise at least one variable region domain of an antibody described herein. Thus, for example, the V region domain may be monomeric and be a VH or VL domain, which is capable of independently binding a desired target (e.g., human ASGR-1) with an affinity at least equal to 107M or less as described herein. The variable region may be any naturally occurring variable domain or an engineered version thereof. By engineered version is meant a variable region that has been created using recombinant DNA engineering techniques. Such engineered versions include those created, for example, from a specific antibody variable region by insertions, deletions, or changes in or to the amino acid sequences of the specific antibody. One of ordinary skill in the art can use any known methods for identifying amino acid residues appropriate for engineering, such as the amino acid residues depicted with shading in Tables 21-48 of FIG. 56. Additional examples include engineered variable regions containing at least one CDR and optionally one or more framework amino acids from a first antibody and the remainder of the variable region domain from a second antibody. Engineered versions of antibody variable domains may be generated by any number of techniques with which those having ordinary skill in the art will be familiar, including but not limited to the methods outlined in Example 14 below. The variable region may be covalently attached at a C-terminal amino acid to at least one other antibody domain or a fragment thereof. Thus, for example, a VH that is present in the variable region may be linked to an immunoglobulin CH1 domain. Similarly a VL domain may be linked to a CK domain. In this way, for example, the antibody may be a Fab fragment wherein the antigen binding domain contains associated VH and VL domains covalently linked at their C-termini to a CH1 and CK domain, respectively. The CH1 domain may be extended with further amino acids, for example to provide a hinge region or a portion of a hinge region domain as found in a Fab fragment, or to provide further domains, such as antibody CH2 and CH3 domains. Derivatives and Variants The nucleotide sequences of the antigen binding proteins of the present invention, encoding the corresponding amino acid sequences of the antibodies of the present invention, can be altered, for example, by random mutagenesis or by site-directed mutagenesis (e.g., oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis) to create an altered polynucleotide comprising one or more particular nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or insertions as compared to the non-mutated polynucleotide. Examples of techniques for making such alterations are described in Walder et al., 1986, Gene 42:133; Bauer et al. 1985, Gene 37:73; Craik, BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19; Smith et al., 1981, Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Plenum Press; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462. These and other methods can be used to make, for example, derivatives of the antigen binding proteins that have a desired property, for example, increased affinity, avidity, or specificity for a desired target, increased activity or stability in vivo or in vitro, or reduced in vivo side-effects as compared to the underivatized antibody. Other derivatives of the antigen binding proteins within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of the antigen binding proteins, with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. Antigen binding protein-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of antigen binding protein (e.g., poly-His). An antigen binding protein also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp et al., Bio/Technology 6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). In another embodiment, the antigen binding proteins within the scope of this invention include antibody conjugates where antibody is conjugated to a non-proteinaceous chemical (drug) to form an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Generally the ADC comprises an antibody conjugated to a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a cytotoxic agent, a agent, a toxin, or a radioactive agent. A linker molecule can be used to conjugate the drug to the antibody. A wide variety of linkers and drugs useful in ADC technology are known in the art and may be used in embodiments of the present invention. (See US20090028856; US2009/0274713; US2007/0031402; WO2005/084390; WO2009/099728; U.S. Pat. No. Pat. Nos. 5,475,092; 5,585,499; 6,436,931; 6,372,738; and incorporated herein by reference). In another embodiment, oligomers that contain one or more antigen binding proteins may be employed in certain embodiments of the present invention. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more antigen binding protein are contemplated for use, with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple antigen binding proteins joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to the antigen binding proteins. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of antigen binding proteins attached thereto, as described in more detail below. In particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four antigen binding proteins. The antigen binding proteins of the oligomer may be in any form, such as any of the forms described above, e.g., variants. In one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn et al., 1990, Nature 344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 \"Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins\", in Current Protocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1-10.19.11. One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing an antigen binding fragment of an anti-ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2 antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer. The term \"Fc polypeptide\" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns. One suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG1 antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors. In some embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of a desired antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain. Alternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple antigen binding proteins, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,751,180 and 4,935,233. Another method for preparing oligomeric antigen binding proteins involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al., 1994, Semin. Immunol. 6:267-78. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins comprising a desired antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant. In another embodiment, the antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) can be conjugated to a suitable vehicle to enhance the half-life thereof. Suitable vehicles include, but are not limited to Fc, albumin, transferrin, and the like. These and other suitable vehicles are known in the art. Such conjugated CDR peptides may be in monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric, or other form. In one embodiment, one or more water-soluble polymer is bonded at one or more specific position, for example at the amino terminus, of a binding agent. In an example, an antibody derivative comprises one or more water soluble polymer attachments, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol. 4,301,144, 4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. In certain comprises one or more of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of such polymers. In certain embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymer is randomly attached to one or more side chains. In certain embodiments, PEG can act to improve the therapeutic capacity for a binding agent, such as an antibody. Certain such methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be chemically bonded with polymers, lipids, or other moieties. Nucleic Acids Encoding Antigen Binding Proteins In another embodiment, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode the antigen binding proteins of the present invention. In addition, provided are vectors comprising the nucleic acids, cell comprising the nucleic acids, and methods of making the antigen binding proteins of the invention. The nucleic acids comprise, for example, polynucleotides that encode all or part of an antigen binding protein, for example, one or both chains of an antibody of the invention, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides sufficient for use as hybridization probes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide, anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleotide, and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids can be any length as appropriate for the desired use or function, and can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example, regulatory sequences, and/or be part of a larger nucleic acid, for example, a vector. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and/or DNA nucleotides, and artificial variants thereof (e.g., peptide nucleic acids). Nucleic acids encoding antibody polypeptides (e.g., heavy or light chain, variable domain only, or full length) may be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been immunized with antigen. The nucleic acid may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chain variable regions are included herein. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, each of the polypeptide sequences disclosed herein is encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleotide sequence encoding each antigen binding protein of the invention. The invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. As defined herein, for example, a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5\u00d7 sodium chloride/sodium (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM 8.0), buffer of about 50% formamide, 6\u00d7SSC, and a hybridization temperature of 55\u00b0 C. (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of 42\u00b0 C.), and washing conditions of 60\u00b0 C., in 0.5\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6\u00d7SSC at 45\u00b0 C., followed by one or more washes in 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68\u00b0 C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by, for example, Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA. Changes can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using, for example, a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment, one or more randomly selected residues is changed using, for example, a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made, a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property. Mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues. In one embodiment, a nucleotide sequence provided herein for of the antibodies of the present invention, or a desired fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, is mutated such that it encodes an amino acid sequence comprising one or more deletions or substitutions of amino acid residues that are shown herein for the light chains of the antibodies of the present invention or the heavy chains of the antibodies of the present invention to be residues where two or more sequences differ. In another embodiment, the mutagenesis inserts an amino acid adjacent to one or more amino acid residues shown herein for the light chains of the antibodies of the present invention or the heavy chains of the antibodies of the present invention to be residues where two or more sequences differ. Alternatively, one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. In another embodiment, the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, viral vectors, non-episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors, for example, recombinant expression vectors. The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells (e.g., SV40 early gene enhancer, Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter), those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences, see Voss et al., 1986, Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:287, Maniatis et al., 1987, Science 236:1237, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition (e.g., the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (see id.). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein. In another embodiment, the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell or eukaryotic cell. Prokaryotic host cells include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells, yeast cells, and established cell lines of mammalian origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or their derivatives such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (see Rasmussen et al., 1998, Cytotechnology 28:31) or CHO strain DXB-11, which is deficient in DHFR (see Urlaub et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (see Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), AM-1/D cells (described U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,924), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, the CV1/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CV1 (ATCC CCL 70) (see McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:2821), human embryonic human epidermal A431 cells, Colo205 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60, U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier, New York, 1985). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e.g., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Additional selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die), among other methods. The transformed cells can be cultured under conditions that promote expression of the polypeptide, and the polypeptide recovered by conventional protein purification procedures. Polypeptides contemplated for use herein include substantially homogeneous recombinant mammalian antibody polypeptides substantially free of contaminating endogenous materials. Cells containing the nucleic acid encoding the antigen binding proteins of the present invention also include hybridomas. The production and culturing of hybridomas are discussed in the antibody section above. In some embodiments, a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule as described herein is provided. In some embodiments, the invention comprises a host cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule as described herein. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the antigen binding protein as described herein is provided. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one antigen binding protein described herein is provided. Antigen Binding Protein Production The antigen binding proteins of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of proteins (e.g., antibodies), in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques. Recombinant expression of the antigen binding proteins requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antigen binding proteins. Once a polynucleotide encoding the antigen binding proteins molecule has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antigen binding proteins may be produced by recombinant DNA technology. An expression vector is constructed containing the antigen binding proteins coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antigen binding proteins of the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains of an antibody may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below. A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antigen binding proteins of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. Bacterial cells such as E. coli, and eukaryotic cells are commonly used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio/Technology 8:2 (1990)). In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, COS, 293, 3T3, or myeloma cells. For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule. A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine (Lowy et al., Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk, hgprt or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate gpt, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1981)); neo, which confers the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991)); and hygro, confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N Y (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N Y (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, N Y (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, \"The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells\" (DNA Cloning, Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)). The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, for example, the first vector encoding an antibody heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding an antibody light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, for example, both antibody heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA. Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and size-exclusion chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification. In some embodiments, the present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to a polypeptide. Fused or conjugated antibodies of the present invention may be used for ease in purification. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication et al., J. Immunol. 146:2446-2452 (1991). Moreover, the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the \"HA\" tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \"flag\" tag. Antibody Effector Function In some embodiments, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) with altered effector function (e.g., decreasing or increasing effector function). Nonlimiting examples of methods for increasing effector function can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821, 6,602,684, 7,029,872, U.S. WO 04/029207, WO03011878, WO05044859, WO 06071856, and WO 06071280. Methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art (e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004/016750, both to Koenig et al., which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc gamma RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC gamma RIIA; see, also, PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/58572 to Armour et al., WO 99/51642 to Idusogie et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,272 to Deo et al.). Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to Fc gamma RIIB are also known in the art (e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01/79299, both to Ravetch et al.). Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for Fc gamma RIIIA and/or Fc gamma RIIA as compared with a wildtype Fc region have also been described (e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 2004/063351, to Stavenhagen et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety). Antibody effector function may also be modified through the generation of antibodies with altered glycosylation patterns. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase or decrease the ADCC ability of antibodies, as desired. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. Half-Life Alteration In some embodiments, the present invention provides for antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) which have an extended half-life in vivo. In particular, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins which have a half-life in a mammal (for example, but not limited to, a human), of greater than 3 days, greater than 7 days, greater than 10 days, greater than 15 days, greater than 25 days, greater than 30 days, greater than 35 days, greater than 40 days, greater than 45 days, greater than 2 months, greater than 3 months, greater than 4 months, or greater than 5 months. To prolong the serum circulation of antigen binding proteins (for example, monoclonal antibodies) or antibody fragments (for example, Fab fragments) in vivo, for example, inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG) can be attached to the antibodies (including antibody fragments thereof) with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antigen binding proteins. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antigen binding proteins-PEG conjugates by size-exclusion or by ion-exchange chromatography. PEG-derivatized antigen binding proteins can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, by immunoassays described herein. In certain embodiments, antibodies having an increased half-life in vivo can also be generated by introducing one or more amino acid modifications (i.e., substitutions, insertions or deletions) into an IgG constant domain, or FcRn binding fragment thereof (e.g., Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment). See, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98/23289; International Publication No. WO 97/34631; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Conjugates In some embodiments, covalent modifications of the antigen binding proteins of the invention are included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antigen binding proteins, if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of the antigen binding proteins are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues. Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with alpha-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Similarly, iodo-reagents may also be used. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0. Lysyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing .alpha.-amino-containing residues and/or e-amino-containing residues with glyoxylate. Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginyl residues generally requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the epsilon-amino groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group. The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using I125 or I131 to prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay. Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R\u2014NCN\u2014R), where R and R are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl)carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions. Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively. These residues are deamidated under neutral or basic conditions. The deamidated form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention. Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl the .alpha.-amino groups of arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), acetylation the N-terminal amine, and any C-terminal carboxyl group. Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the antibody. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the antibody in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N- or O-linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981). RNA In some embodiments, the present invention provides polynucleotide compositions that target ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and are useful for methods for treatment, therapy, and prophylaxis in disease related to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 expression, where reduction or inhibition of the expression or function of a selected target polynucleotide sequence is desired. Examples of polynucleotides that can be used to target ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 sequences and reduce ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 expression include, but are not limited to, antisense oligonucleotides, and RNA interference (RNAi) agents, including short or small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). 6,107,094; 5,898,031; 6,573,099; and European Patent No. 1,144,623. See also, for example, U.S. patent application publication nos. 2015/0259689; 2015/0197746; 2011/0092565; U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,877,917; 8,507,455; and 7,579,451. In certain embodiments, a composition for inhibiting the function or expression of a target polynucleotide sequence (e.g. ASGR-1 mRNA sequence, ASGR-2 mRNA sequence) in a mammalian cell, according to this invention, comprises an agent that provides to a mammalian cell an at least partially double-stranded RNA molecule (e.g., an interfering RNA molecule). A double-stranded RNA molecule may include chemical modifications to ribonucleotides, including modifications to the ribose sugar, base, or backbone components of the ribonucleotides, such as those described herein or known in the art. Any such modifications, as used in a double-stranded RNA molecule (e.g. siRNA, shRNA, or the like), are encompassed by the term \"double-stranded RNA\" for the purposes of this disclosure. Thus, in general, the term \"RNA\" may also include RNA-DNA hybrids and polynucleotides comprising one or more modified nucleotides (e.g. nucleotides with modifications at the 2 position of the ribose ring), except where specified otherwise, e.g., where a 2-OH group of ribose is required for a particular linkage. In some embodiments at least 10% of a partially double-stranded RNA molecule is double-stranded. Alternatively, the double stranded portion of these RNA molecules can be at least 30% of the length of the molecule. In another embodiment, the double stranded portion of these molecules can be at least 50% of the length of the molecule. In still another embodiment, the double stranded portion of these molecules can be at least 70% of the length of the molecule. In another embodiment, the double stranded portion of these molecules can be at least 90% of the length of the molecule. In another embodiment, the molecule can be double stranded over its entire length. Alternatively, the double-stranded portion of these molecules can occur at either or both termini, or in some middle portion of the molecule, if the molecule is linear. Similarly, the double-stranded portion can be in any location if the molecule is circular. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the double-stranded portion of the RNA molecule becomes double-stranded only when the molecule is in the mammalian cell. In still other embodiment of this invention, the partially double-stranded molecule is an RNA/DNA hybrid, for example, a single strand containing RNA and DNA, prepared in vitro; or a duplex of two such single strands or portions thereof. In yet another embodiment, the RNA molecule, made in vivo or in vitro, is a duplex comprised of an RNA single strand and a DNA single strand. In some embodiments, the partially double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a polynucleotide sequence that is substantially homologous to the target polynucleotide sequence in order to effectively reduce or inhibit the function or expression thereof. The necessary homology may be suitably defined by use of a computer algorithm. As known in the art and discussed herein, \"homology\" or \"identity\" means the degree of sequence relatedness between two polypeptide or two polynucleotide sequences as determined by the identity of the match between two lengths of such sequences. Both identity and homology can be readily calculated by methods in the prior art [See also, e.g., COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, (1988); BIOCOMPUTING: INFORMATICS AND GENOME PROJECTS, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, (1993); COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA, PART I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, (1994); SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, (1987); and SEQUENCE ANALYSIS PRIMER, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, (1991)]. While there exist a number of methods to measure identity and homology between two polynucleotide sequences, the terms \"identity\", \"similarity\" and homology are well known to skilled artisans [H. Carillo and D. Lipton, SIAM J. Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988)]. Methods commonly employed to determine identity or homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in Guide to Huge Computers, Martin J. Bishop, ed., Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, and H. Carillo and D. Lipton, SIAM J. Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988). Preferred methods to determine identity or homology are designed to give the largest match between the two sequences tested. Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in computer programs. Preferred computer program to determine identity and homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the algorithm BESTFIT from the GCG program package [J. Devereux Nucl. Acids Res., 12(1):387 (1984)], the related MACVECTOR program (Oxford), and the FASTA (Pearson) programs. For instance, searches for sequence similarities in databases between significant naturally occurring mammalian polynucleotide sequences and target polynucleotide sequences enable the design of suitable RNA molecules desired for use in the invention. The algorithm and/or the degree of homology necessary for any particular RNA molecule may be selected by one of skill in the art, depending on the identity of the target, and/or the closeness of homology of the target sequence to any naturally occurring mammalian sequence, which is desired to be left functioning normally after use of the methods of this invention. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide composition for reducing the expression or function of ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 sequences is an RNAi agent comprising a double-stranded RNA molecule which comprises two antiparallel strands of contiguous nucleotides that are sufficiently complementary to each other to hybridize to form a duplex region. \"Hybridize\" or \"hybridization\" refers to the pairing of complementary polynucleotides, typically via hydrogen bonding (e.g. Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding) between complementary bases in the two polynucleotides. The strand comprising a region having a sequence that is substantially complementary to a target sequence (e.g. target mRNA) is referred to as the \"antisense strand.\" The \"sense strand\" refers to the strand that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand. In some embodiments, the sense strand may comprise a region that has a sequence that is substantially identical to the target sequence. As used herein, a first sequence is \"complementary\" to a second sequence if a polynucleotide comprising the first sequence can hybridize to a polynucleotide comprising the second sequence to form a duplex region under certain conditions, such as physiological conditions. Other such conditions can include moderate or stringent hybridization conditions, which are known to those of skill in the art. A first sequence is considered to be fully complementary (100% complementary) to a second sequence if a polynucleotide comprising the first sequence base pairs with a polynucleotide comprising the second sequence over the entire length of one or both nucleotide sequences without any mismatches. A sequence is \"substantially complementary\" to a target sequence if the sequence is about a target sequence. Percent complementarity can be calculated by dividing the number of bases in a first sequence that are complementary to bases at corresponding positions in a second or target sequence by the total length of the first sequence. A sequence may also be said to be substantially complementary to another sequence if there are no more than 5, 4, 3, or 2 mismatches over a 30 base pair duplex region when the two sequences are hybridized. Generally, if any nucleotide overhangs, as defined herein, are present, the sequence of such overhangs is not considered in determining the degree of complementarity between two sequences. By way of example, a sense strand of 21 nucleotides in length and an antisense strand of 21 nucleotides in length that hybridize to form a 19 base pair duplex region with a 2 nucleotide overhang at the 3 end of each strand would be considered to be fully complementary as the term is used herein. In some embodiments, a region of the antisense strand comprises a sequence that is fully complementary to a region of the target RNA sequence (e.g. ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 mRNA). In such embodiments, the sense strand may comprise a sequence that is fully complementary to the sequence of the antisense strand. In other such embodiments, the sense strand may comprise a sequence that is substantially complementary to the sequence of the antisense strand, e.g. having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 mismatches in the duplex region formed by the sense and antisense strands. In certain embodiments, it is preferred that any mismatches occur within the terminal regions (e.g. within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5 and/or 3 ends of the strands). In one embodiment, any mismatches in the duplex region formed from the sense and antisense strands occur within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5 end of the antisense strand. In certain embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand of the double-stranded RNA may be two separate molecules that hybridize to form a duplex region, but are otherwise unconnected. Such double-stranded RNA molecules formed from two separate strands are referred to as \"small interfering RNAs\" or \"short interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs). strand and the antisense strand that hybridize to form a duplex region may be part of a single RNA molecule, i.e. the sense and antisense strands are part of a self-complementary region of a single RNA molecule. In such cases, a single RNA molecule comprises a duplex region (also referred to as a stem region) and a loop region. The 3 end of the sense strand is connected to the 5 end of the antisense strand by a contiguous sequence of unpaired nucleotides, which will form the loop region. The loop region is typically of a sufficient length to allow the RNA molecule to fold back on itself such that the antisense strand can base pair with the sense strand to form the duplex or stem region. The loop region can comprise from about 3 to about 25, from about 5 to about 15, or from about 8 to about 12 unpaired nucleotides. Such RNA molecules with at least partially self-complementary regions are referred to as \"short hairpin RNAs\" (shRNAs). The length of a single, at least partially self-complementary RNA molecule can be from about 35 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, from about 45 nucleotides to about 85 nucleotides, or from about 50 to about 60 nucleotides and comprise a duplex region and loop region each having the lengths recited herein. In some embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a sense strand and an antisense strand, wherein the antisense strand comprises a region having a sequence that is substantially or fully complementary to an ASGR-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence and/or ASGR-2 mRNA \"ASGR-2 mRNA RNA sequence, including splice variants, encoding an ASGR-1 protein or ASGR-2 protein, including ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 protein variants or isoforms from any species (e.g. mouse, rat, non-human primate, human). The sense strand of the double-stranded RNA molecule typically comprises a sequence that is sufficiently complementary to the sequence of the antisense strand such that the two strands hybridize under physiological conditions to form a duplex region. A \"duplex region\" refers to the region in two complementary or substantially complementary polynucleotides that form base pairs with one another, either by Watson-Crick base pairing or other hydrogen bonding interaction, to create a duplex between the two polynucleotides. The duplex region of the RNA molecule should be of sufficient length to allow the RNA molecule to enter the RNA interference pathway, e.g. by engaging the Dicer enzyme and/or the RISC complex. For instance, in some embodiments, the duplex region is about 15 to about 30 base pairs in length. Other lengths for the duplex region within this range are also suitable, such as about 15 to about 28 base pairs, about 15 to about 26 base pairs, about 15 to about 24 base pairs, about 15 to about 22 base pairs, about 17 to about 28 base pairs, about 17 to about 26 base pairs, about 17 to about 24 base pairs, about 17 to about 23 base pairs, about 17 to about 21 base pairs, about 19 to about 25 base pairs, about 19 to about 23 base pairs, or about 19 to about 21 base pairs. In one embodiment, the duplex region is about 17 to about 24 base pairs in length. In another embodiment, the duplex region is about 19 to about 21 base pairs in length. For embodiments in which the sense strand and antisense strand are two separate molecules (e.g. RNAi is a siRNA), the sense strand and antisense strand need not be the same length as the length of the duplex region. For instance, one or both strands may be longer than the duplex region and have one or more unpaired nucleotides or mismatches flanking the duplex region. Thus, in some embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises at least one nucleotide overhang. As used herein, a \"nucleotide overhang\" refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that extend beyond the duplex region at the terminal ends of the strands. Nucleotide overhangs are typically created when the 3 end of one strand extends beyond the 5 end of the other strand or when the 5 end of one strand extends beyond the 3 end of the other strand. The length of a nucleotide overhang is generally between 1 and 6 nucleotides, 1 and 5 nucleotides, 1 and 4 nucleotides, 1 and 3 nucleotides, 2 and 6 nucleotides, 2 and 5 nucleotides, or 2 and 4 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the nucleotide overhang comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 nucleotides. In one particular embodiment, the nucleotide overhang comprises 1 to 4 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the nucleotide overhang comprises 2 nucleotides. The nucleotides in the overhang can be ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, or modified nucleotides as described herein. The nucleotide overhang can be at the 5 end or 3 end of one or both strands. For example, in one embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 5 end and the 3 end of the antisense strand. In another embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 5 end and the 3 end of the sense strand. In some embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 5 end of the sense strand and the 5 end of the antisense strand. In other embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 3 end of the sense strand and the 3 end of the antisense strand. The double-stranded RNA molecules may comprise a single nucleotide overhang at one end of the molecule and a blunt end at the other. A \"blunt end\" means that the sense strand and antisense strand are fully base-paired at the end of the molecule and there are no unpaired nucleotides that extend beyond the duplex region. In some embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 3 end of the sense strand and a blunt end at the 5 end of the sense strand and 3 end of the antisense strand. In other embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a nucleotide overhang at the 3 end of the antisense strand and a blunt end at the 5 end of the antisense strand and the 3 end of the sense strand. In certain embodiments, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises a blunt end at both ends of the double-stranded RNA molecule. In such embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand have the same length and the duplex region is the same length as the sense and antisense strands (i.e. the molecule is double-stranded over its entire length). The sense strand and antisense strand can each independently be about 15 to about 30 nucleotides in length, about 18 to about 28 nucleotides in length, about 19 to about 27 nucleotides in length, about 19 to about 25 nucleotides in length, about 19 to about 23 nucleotides in length, about 21 to about 25 nucleotides in length, or about 21 to about 23 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand are each about 18, about 19, about 20, about 21, about 22, about 23, about 24, or about 25 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand have the same length but form a duplex region that is shorter than the strands such that the double-stranded RNA molecule has two nucleotide overhangs. For instance, in one embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises (i) a sense strand and an antisense strand that are each 21 nucleotides in length, (ii) a duplex region that is 19 base pairs in length, and (iii) nucleotide overhangs of 2 unpaired nucleotides at both the 3 end of the sense strand and the 3 end of the antisense strand. In another embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises (i) a sense strand and an antisense strand that are each 23 nucleotides in length, (ii) a duplex region that is 21 base pairs in length, and (iii) nucleotide overhangs of 2 unpaired nucleotides at both the 3 end of the sense strand and the 3 end of the antisense strand. In other embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand have the same length and form a duplex region over their entire length such that there are no nucleotide overhangs on either end of the double-stranded molecule. In one such embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule is blunt ended and comprises (i) a sense strand and an antisense strand, each of which is 21 nucleotides in length, and (ii) a duplex region that is 21 base pairs in length. In another such embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule is blunt ended and comprises (i) a sense strand and an antisense strand, each of which is 23 nucleotides in length, and (ii) a duplex region that is 23 base pairs in length. In other embodiments, the sense strand or the antisense strand is longer than the other strand and the two strands form a duplex region having a length equal to that of the shorter strand such that the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises at least one nucleotide overhang. For example, in one embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises (i) a sense strand that is 19 nucleotides in length, (ii) an antisense strand that is 21 nucleotides in length, (iii) a duplex region of 19 base pairs in length, and (iv) a single nucleotide overhang of 2 unpaired nucleotides at the 3 end of the antisense strand. In another embodiment, the double-stranded RNA molecule comprises (i) a sense strand that is 21 nucleotides in length, (ii) an antisense strand that is 23 nucleotides in length, (iii) a duplex region of 21 base pairs in length, and (iv) a single nucleotide overhang of 2 unpaired nucleotides at the 3 end of the antisense strand. Off-target toxicity is a constant concern in the development of pharmaceutical products. With interfering RNA agents, the potential exists for homology with certain endogenous polynucleotide sequences that could lead to unintended toxic effects in the patient receiving the interfering RNA. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the RNA molecule comprises a polynucleotide sequence that is also substantially non-homologous to any naturally occurring, normally functioning, and essential mammalian polynucleotide sequence, so that the RNA molecule does not adversely affect the function of any essential naturally occurring mammalian polynucleotide sequence, when used in the methods of this invention. Such naturally occurring functional mammalian polynucleotide sequences include mammalian sequences that encode desired proteins, as well as mammalian sequences that are non-coding, but that provide for essential regulatory sequences in a healthy mammal. Preferably, the RNA molecule useful in the methods of the invention must be sufficiently distinct in sequence from any mammalian polynucleotide sequence expressed in the target cells (e.g. liver cells) for which the function is intended to be undisturbed after any of the methods of this invention are performed. As described for determining the homology to the target sequence above, one of skill in the art may resort to the above-identified computer algorithms to define the essential lack of homology between the RNA molecule polynucleotide sequence and the normal mammalian sequences expressed in the target cells. For example, in a specific embodiment, the homology between the sequence of an RNAi agent and the selected normal sequence expressed in the target cells is less than the homologies of the formulae described above. In some embodiments, there is almost no homology at all between the sequence of an RNAi agent and any normal mammalian sequence. The double-stranded RNA molecules used in the methods of the invention may comprise one or more modified nucleotides. A \"modified nucleotide\" refers to a nucleotide that has one or more chemical modifications to the nucleoside, nucleobase, pentose ring, or phosphate group. The double-stranded RNA molecules may comprise combinations of modified nucleotides, ribonucleotides, and deoxyribonucleotides. Incorporation of modified nucleotides into one or both strands of double-stranded RNA molecules can improve the in vivo stability of the RNA molecules, e.g., by reducing the molecules' susceptibility to nucleases and other degradation processes. The potency of double-stranded RNA molecules for reducing expression of the target gene can also be enhanced by incorporation of modified nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the modified nucleotides have a modification of the ribose sugar. These sugar modifications can include modifications at the 2 and/or 5 position of the pentose ring. A 2-modified nucleotide refers to a nucleotide having a pentose ring with a substituent at the 2 position other than H or OH. Such 2-modifications include, but are not limited to, 2-O-alkyl at the 5 position of the pentose ring include, but are not limited to, 5-methyl (R or S); 5-vinyl, and 5-methoxy. The double-stranded RNA molecules employed in the methods of the invention may also comprise one or more modified internucleotide linkages. As used herein, the term \"modified internucleotide linkage\" refers to an internucleotide linkage other than the natural 3 to 5 phosphodiester linkage. In some embodiments, the modified internucleotide a boranophosphate. In one embodiment, a modified internucleotide linkage is a 2 to 5 phosphodiester linkage. In the modified internucleotide linkage is a non-phosphorous-containing internucleotide linkage and thus can be referred to as a modified internucleoside linkage. Such non-phosphorous-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, morpholino linkages (formed in part from the sugar portion of a nucleoside); siloxane others having mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts. In one embodiment, the modified internucleoside linkage is a peptide-based linkage to create a peptide nucleic acid or PNA, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262. Other suitable modified internucleotide and internucleoside linkages that may be employed in the double-stranded RNA molecules are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,693,187, U.S. Pat. No. 9,181,551, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2016/0122761, and Deleavey and Damha, Chemistry and Biology, Vol. 19: 937-954, 2012, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Interfering RNA Delivery The interfering RNA compounds can be administered by any method suitable for administration of nucleic acid agents, such as a DNA vaccine or gene therapy vectors. These methods include gene guns, bio injectors, and skin patches as well as needle-free methods such as the micro-particle DNA vaccine technology disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,389, and the mammalian transdermal needle-free vaccination with powder-form vaccine as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,168,587. Additionally, intranasal delivery is possible, as described in, inter al. (1998), Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol., 88(2), as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,375) and microencapsulation can also be used. Biodegradable targetable microparticle delivery systems can also be used (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,471,996). In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Such formulations can be prepared using standard techniques. The materials can also be obtained commercially from, for example, Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. The interfering RNA molecule may be conjugated to one or more carbohydrate moieties to optimize one or more properties of the interfering RNA molecule. In many cases, the carbohydrate moiety will be attached to a modified subunit of the interfering RNA molecule or at the 5 or 3 end of one of strands of the interfering RNA molecule. E.g., the ribose sugar of one or more ribonucleotide subunits of an interfering RNA molecule can be replaced with another moiety, e.g., a non-carbohydrate (preferably cyclic) carrier to which is attached a carbohydrate moiety. A cyclic carrier may be a carbocyclic ring system, i.e., all ring atoms are carbon atoms, or a heterocyclic ring system, i.e., one or more ring atoms may be a heteroatom, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur. The cyclic carrier may be a monocyclic ring system, or may contain two or more rings, e.g. fused rings. The cyclic carrier may be a fully saturated ring system, or it may contain one or more double bonds. The carbohydrate moiety may be attached to the polynucleotide via a carrier. The carriers include (i) at least one \"backbone attachment point,\" preferably two \"backbone attachment points\" and (ii) at least one \"tethering attachment point.\" A \"backbone attachment point\" as used herein refers to a functional group, e.g. a hydroxyl group, or generally, a bond available for, and that is suitable for incorporation of the carrier into the backbone, e.g., the phosphate, or modified phosphate, e.g., sulfur containing, backbone, of a ribonucleic acid. A \"tethering attachment point\" (TAP) in some embodiments refers to a constituent ring atom of the cyclic carrier, e.g., a carbon atom or a heteroatom (distinct from an atom which provides a backbone attachment point), that connects a selected moiety. The moiety can be, e.g., a oligosaccharide and polysaccharide. connected by an intervening tether to the cyclic carrier. Thus, the cyclic carrier will often include a functional group, e.g., an amino group, or generally, provide a bond, that is suitable for incorporation or tethering of another chemical entity, e.g., a ligand to the constituent ring. In some embodiments the interfering RNA molecule of the invention is conjugated to a carbohydrate moiety via a carrier, wherein the carrier can be cyclic group or acyclic group; in specific embodiments, is selected from serinol backbone or diethanolamine backbone. Targeting the Interfering RNA Given that ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 is expressed on the surface of liver cells (e.g. hepatocytes), in certain embodiments, it is desirable to deliver the interfering RNA molecules to those liver cells so that the interfering effect can be exerted specifically within liver cells. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the interfering RNA molecules are specifically targeted to liver cells using various methodologies known in the art and described herein. For example, in certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins (e.g. antibodies) or other targeting moieties disclosed herein below can be used to specifically target the interfering RNA molecules to the hepatocytes using various different receptors expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. In certain embodiments, the interfering RNA molecules are targeted to liver cells using the surface expressed ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In these embodiments, it is envisioned that this can result in a self-regulating system that reduces the amount of RNAi agent delivered to the liver cells as expression of ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2 is reduced due to the effect of the targeted interfering RNA. A wide variety of targeting moieties can be coupled to the oligonucleotides of the present invention. In some embodiments, the targeting moieties are coupled, e.g., covalently, either directly or indirectly via an intervening tether. In some embodiments, a targeting moiety alters the distribution, targeting or lifetime of the molecule into which it is incorporated. In preferred embodiments a targeting moiety provides an enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment, receptor e.g., a cellular or organ compartment, tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g., compared to a species absent such a targeting moiety. Targeting moieties providing enhanced affinity for a selected target are also termed targeting moieties. Some targeting moieties can have endosomolytic properties. The endosomolytic targeting moieties promote the lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition of the invention, or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. The endosomolytic targeting moietymay be a polyanionic peptide or peptidomimetic which shows pH-dependent membrane activity and fusogenicity. In one embodiment, the endosomolytic targeting moiety assumes its active conformation at endosomal pH. The \"active\" conformation is that conformation which the endosomolytic targeting moietypromotes lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition of the invention, or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. Exemplary endosomolytic targeting moietiesinclude the GALA the EALA et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118: 1581-1586), and their derivatives (Turk et al., Biochem. 2002, 1559: 56-68). In one embodiment, the endosomolytic component may contain a chemical group (e.g., an amino acid) which will undergo a change in charge or protonation in response to a change in pH. The endosomolytic component may be linear or branched. In certain embodiments, targeting moieties can improve transport, hybridization, and specificity properties and may also improve nuclease resistance of the resultant natural or modified oligoribonucleotide, or a polymeric molecule comprising any combination of monomers described herein and/or natural or modified ribonucleotides. In some embodiments, targeting moieties in general can include therapeutic modifiers, e.g., for enhancing uptake; diagnostic compounds or reporter groups e.g., for monitoring distribution; cross-linking agents; and nuclease-resistance conferring moieties. General examples include lipids, steroids, vitamins, sugars, proteins, peptides, polyamines, and peptide mimics. Targeting moieties can include a naturally occurring substance, such as a protein (e.g., human serum albumin (I), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density chitosan, inulin, or hyaluronic acid); or a lipid. The targeting moiety may also be a recombinant or synthetic molecule, such as a synthetic polymer, e.g., a synthetic polyamino acid, an oligonucleotide (e.g. an aptamer). Examples of polyamino acids include polyamino acid is a polylysine (PLL), an alpha helical peptide. Targeting moieties can also include other targeting groups, e.g., a cell or tissue targeting agent, e.g., a lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein, e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a kidney cell. A targeting group can be a thyrotropin, melanotropin, lectin, lipophilic cholesterol, AP. Targeting moieties can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a specific affinity for a co-moiety, or antigen binding proteins, such as antibodies; e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a liver hepatocyte. Targeting moieties may also include hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide. The targeting moiety can be a substance, e.g, a drug, which can increase the uptake of the interfering RNA molecule into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The drug The targeting moiety can increase the uptake of the interfering RNA molecule into the cell by activating an inflammatory response, for example. Exemplary targeting moieties that would have such an effect include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1 beta, or gamma interferon. In one embodiment, the targeting moiety is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. Such a lipid or lipid-based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g., human serum albumin (I). A serum protein binding targeting moiety, in certain embodiments, allows for distribution of the conjugate to a target tissue, e.g., a non-kidney target tissue of the body. For example, the target tissue can be the liver, including hepatocytes or parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind serum proteins can also be used as targeting moieties. For example, naproxen or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based targeting moiety can (a) increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport into a target cell or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum protein. A lipid based targeting moiety can be used to modulate, e.g., control the binding of the conjugate to a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based targeting moiety that binds to a serum protein more strongly will be less likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to be cleared from the body. A lipid or lipid-based targeting moiety that binds to a serum protein less strongly can be used to target the conjugate to the kidney, if so desired. In one embodiment, the lipid based targeting moiety binds human serum albumin. In a specific embodiment, it binds human serum albumin with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a non-kidney tissue. In certain embodiments, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the human serum albumin targeting moiety binding cannot be reversed. In another preferred embodiment, the lipid based targeting moiety binds human serum albumin weakly or not at all, such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to the kidney. Other moieties that target to kidney cells can also be used in place of or in addition to the lipid-based targeting moiety. In another embodiment, the targeting moiety is for example a vitamin, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a target cell, e.g., a proliferating cell. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary vitamins include B vitamins, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up by cells. Also included are low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In another embodiment, the agent, is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase. The targeting moiety can be a peptide or peptidomimetic. A peptidomimetic (also referred to herein as an oligopeptidomimetic) is a molecule capable of folding into a defined three-dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide. The peptide or peptidomimetic moiety can be about 5-50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acids long. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be, for example, amphipathic Tyr, Trp or Phe). The peptide moiety can be a dendrimer peptide, constrained peptide. In another moiety can include membrane exemplary hydrophobic MTS-containing peptide RFGF having the amino acid sequence AAVALLPAVLLALLAP. An RFGF analogue (e.g., amino acid sequence AALLPVLLAAP) containing a hydrophobic MTS can also be a targeting moiety. The peptide moiety can be a \"delivery\" peptide, which can carry large polar molecules including peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein across cell membranes. For example, sequences from the HIV Tat protein (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) and the Drosophila Antennapedia protein (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) have been found to be capable of functioning as delivery peptides. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be encoded by a random sequence of DNA, such as a peptide identified from a phage-display library, or one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library (Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84, 1991). In some embodiments, the peptide or peptidomimetic tethered to an interfering RNA molecule via an incorporated monomer unit is a cell targeting peptide such as an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide, or RGD mimic. A peptide moiety can range in length from about 5 amino acids to about 40 amino acids. The peptide moieties can have a structural modification, such as to increase stability or direct conformational properties. Any of the structural modifications described below can be utilized. An RGD peptide can facilitate targeting of an interfering RNA molecule to cells of a variety of other tissues, including the lung, kidney, spleen, or liver (Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 8:783-787, 2001). The RGD peptide can be linear or cyclic, and can be modified, e.g., glycosylated or methylated to facilitate targeting to specific tissues. For example, a glycosylated RGD peptide can deliver an interfering RNA molecule to a cell expressing V3 (Haubner et al., Jour. Nucl. Med., 42:326-336, 2001). Peptides that target markers enriched in proliferating cells can be used. E.g., RGD containing peptides and peptidomimetics can target cells, in particular cells that exhibit an integrin. Thus, one could use RGD peptides, cyclic peptides containing RGD, RGD peptides that include D-amino acids, as well as synthetic RGD mimics. In addition to RGD, one can use other moieties that target the integrin ligand. A \"cell permeation peptide\" is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell, such as a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial cell-permeating peptide can be, for example, an -helical or bactenecin), or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39 or indolicidin). A cell permeation peptide can also include a nuclear localization signal (NLS). For example, a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide, such as MPG, which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV-1 gp41 and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003). In one embodiment, a targeting can be an amphipathic -helical peptide. Exemplary amphipathic -helical peptidomimetic targeting moietiesinclude those having naturally occurring or modified peptides, e.g., D or L peptides; , , or peptides; N-methyl or more amide, i.e., peptide, linkages replaced with one or more urea, thiourea, carbamate, or sulfonyl urea linkages; or cyclic peptides. The targeting moiety can be any moiety that is capable of targeting a specific receptor. Examples are: folate, GalNAc, galactose, mannose, mannose-6P, cluster, mannose cluster, galactose cluster, or an apatamer. A cluster is a combination of two or more sugar units. The targeting moieties also include integrin HDL moieties. The targeting moieties can also be based on nucleic acid, e.g., an aptamer. The aptamer can be unmodified or have any combination of modifications disclosed herein. Other exemplary endosomal release agents include imidazoles, poly PEIs, steroids, binding agents, PEG, vitamins etc. Examplary PK modulators include, but are not limited to, comprise a number of phosphorothioate linkages are also known to bind to serum protein, thus short oligonucleotides, e.g. oligonucleotides of about 5 bases, 10 bases, 15 bases or 20 bases, comprising multiple of phosphorothioate linkages in the backbone are also amenable to the present invention as targeting moieties (e.g. as PK modulating moieties). In addition, aptamers that bind serum components (e.g. serum proteins) are also amenable to the present invention as PK modulating moieties. When two or more targeting moieties are present, the targeting moieties can all have same properties, all have different properties or some targeting moieties have the same properties while others have different properties. For example, a targeting moiety can have targeting properties, have endosomolytic activity and/or have PK modulating properties. In certain embodiments, all the have different properties. In some embodiments, a targeting moiety can be conjugated to nucleobases, sugar moieties, or of nucleic acid molecules. Conjugation to purine nucleobases or derivatives thereof can occur at any position including, endocyclic and exocyclic atoms. In some embodiments, the 2-, 6-, 7-, or 8-positions of a purine nucleobase are attached to a conjugate moiety. Conjugation to pyrimidine nucleobases or derivatives thereof can also occur at any position. In some embodiments, the 2-, 5-, and 6-positions of a pyrimidine nucleobase can be substituted with a conjugate moiety. Conjugation to sugar moieties of nucleosides can occur at any carbon atom. Example carbon atoms of a sugar moiety that can be attached to a conjugate moiety include the 2, 3, and 5 carbon atoms. The 1 position can also be attached to a conjugate moiety, such as in an abasic residue. Internucleosidic linkages can also bear linkages the like), the conjugate moiety can be attached directly to the phosphorus atom or to an O, N, or S atom bound to the phosphorus atom. For amine- or amide-containing internucleosidic linkages (e.g., PNA), the conjugate moiety can be attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine or amide or to an adjacent carbon atom. It is envisioned that any suitable targeting moiety in the field of RNA interference may be used, although the targeting moiety is typically a carbohydrate e.g. monosaccharide the nucleic acid include those discussed herein. For example, the targeting moiety can be one or more GalNAc derivatives attached through a bivalent or trivalent branched linker. In certain embodiments, cleavable linking groups are utilized. A cleavable linking group is one which is sufficiently stable outside the cell, but which upon entry into a target cell is cleaved to release the two parts the linker is holding together. In one embodiment, the cleavable linking group is cleaved at least 10 times or more, and in some embodiments, at least 100 times faster in the target cell or under a first reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent intracellular conditions) than in the blood of a subject, or under a second reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent conditions found in the blood or serum). Cleavable linking groups are susceptible to cleavage agents, e.g., pH, redox potential or the presence of degradative molecules. Generally, cleavage agents are more prevalent or found at higher levels or activities inside cells than in serum or blood. Examples of such degradative agents include: redox agents which are selected for particular substrates or which have no substrate specificity, including, e.g., oxidative or reductive enzymes or reductive agents such as mercaptans, present in cells, that can degrade a redox cleavable linking group by reduction; esterases; endosomes or agents that can create an acidic environment, e.g., those that result in a pH of five or lower; enzymes that can hydrolyze or degrade an acid cleavable linking group by acting as a general acid, peptidases (which can be substrate specific), and phosphatases. A cleavable linkage group, such as a disulfide bond can be susceptible to pH. The pH of human serum is 7.4, while the average intracellular pH is slightly lower, ranging from about 7.1-7.3. Endosomes have a more acidic pH, in the range of 5.5-6.0, and lysosomes have an even more acidic pH at around 5.0. Some linkers will have a cleavable linking group that is cleaved at a preferred pH, thereby releasing the cationic lipid from the moiety inside the cell, or into the desired compartment of the cell. A linker can include a cleavable linking group that is cleavable by a particular enzyme. The type of cleavable linking group incorporated into a linker can depend on the cell to be targeted. For example, liver targeting targeting moieties can be linked to the cationic lipids through a linker that includes an ester group. Liver cells are rich in esterases, and therefore the linker will be cleaved more efficiently in liver cells than in cell types that are not esterase-rich. Other cell-types rich in esterases include cells of the lung, renal cortex, and testis. Linkers that contain peptide bonds can be used when targeting cell types rich in peptidases, such as liver cells and synoviocytes. In general, the suitability of a candidate cleavable linking group can be evaluated by testing the ability of a degradative agent (or condition) to cleave the candidate linking group. It will also be desirable to also test the candidate cleavable linking group for the ability to resist cleavage in the blood or when in contact with other non-target tissue. Thus one can determine the relative susceptibility to cleavage between a first and a second condition, where the first is selected to be indicative of cleavage in a target cell and the second is selected to be indicative of cleavage in other tissues or biological fluids, e.g., blood or serum. The evaluations can be carried out in cell free systems, in cells, in cell culture, in organ or tissue culture, or in whole animals. It may be useful to make initial evaluations in cell-free or culture conditions and to confirm by further evaluations in whole animals. In some embodiments, useful candidate compounds are cleaved at least 2, 4, 10 or 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as compared to blood or serum (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions). In some embodiments, redox cleavable linking groups are utilized. Redox cleavable linking groups are cleaved upon reduction or oxidation. An example of reductively cleavable linking group is a disulphide linking group (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014). To determine if a candidate cleavable linking group is a suitable \"reductively cleavable linking group,\" or for example is suitable for use with a particular interfering RNA molecule and particular targeting agent one can look to methods described herein. For example, a candidate can be evaluated by incubation with dithiothreitol (DTT), or other reducing agent using reagents know in the art, which mimic the rate of cleavage which would be observed in a cell, e.g., a target cell. The candidates can also be evaluated under conditions which are selected to mimic blood or serum conditions. In a specific embodiment, candidate compounds are cleaved by at most 10% in the blood. In some embodiments, useful candidate compounds are degraded at least 2, 4, 10 or 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as compared to blood (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions). The rate of cleavage of candidate compounds can be determined using standard enzyme kinetics assays under conditions chosen to mimic intracellular media and compared to conditions chosen to mimic extracellular media. In yet some embodiments, phosphate-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by agents that degrade or hydrolyze the phosphate group. An example of an agent that cleaves phosphate groups in cells are enzymes such as phosphatases in cells. Examples of phosphate-based \u2014O\u2014P(O)(OH)\u2014O\u2014. These candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above. In some embodiments, acid cleavable linking groups, which are linking groups that are cleaved under acidic conditions, are envisioned. In some embodiments acid cleavable linking groups are cleaved in an acidic environment with a pH of about 6.5 or lower (e.g., about 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, or lower), or by agents such as enzymes that can act as a general acid. In a cell, specific low pH organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes can provide a cleaving environment for acid cleavable linking groups. Examples of acid cleavable linking groups include but are not limited to hydrazones, esters, and esters of amino acids. Acid cleavable groups can have the general formula \u2014CNN\u2014, C(O)O, or \u2014OC(O). A specific embodiment is when the carbon attached to the oxygen of the ester (the alkoxy group) is an aryl group, substituted alkyl group, or tertiary alkyl group such as dimethyl pentyl or t-butyl. These candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above. In some embodiments, ester-based cleavable linking groups, which are cleaved by enzymes such as esterases and amidases in cells, are envisioned. Examples of ester-based cleavable linking groups include but are not limited to esters of alkylene, alkenylene and alkynylene groups. Ester cleavable linking groups have the general formula \u2014C(O)O\u2014, or \u2014OC(O)\u2014. These candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above. In yet further embodiments, peptide-based cleavable linking groups, which are cleaved by enzymes such as peptidases and proteases in cells, are envisioned. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are peptide bonds formed between amino acids to yield oligopeptides (e.g., dipeptides, tripeptides etc.) and polypeptides. Peptide-based cleavable not include the amide group (\u2014C(O)NH\u2014). The amide group can be formed between any alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene. A peptide bond is a special type of amide bond formed between amino acids to yield peptides and proteins. The peptide based cleavage group is generally limited to the peptide bond (i.e., the amide bond) formed between amino acids yielding peptides and proteins and does not include the entire amide functional group. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups have the general formula \u2014NHCHRAC(O)NHCHRBC(O)\u2014, where RA and RB are the R groups of the two adjacent amino acids. These candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above. As used herein, \"carbohydrate\" refers to a compound which is either a carbohydrate per se made up of one or more monosaccharide units having at least 6 carbon atoms (which may be linear, branched or cyclic) with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom; or a compound having as a part thereof a carbohydrate moiety made up of one or more monosaccharide units each having at least six carbon atoms (which may be linear, branched or cyclic), with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom. Representative carbohydrates include the sugars (mono-, di-, tri- and oligosaccharides containing from about 4-9 monosaccharide such as starches, glycogen, cellulose and polysaccharide gums. Synthesis of Interfering RNA The interfering RNA molecules that can be employed in the methods of the present invention can readily be made using techniques known in the art, for example, using conventional RNA solid phase synthesis. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,877,917. The polynucleotides of the double-stranded RNA molecules can be assembled on a suitable nucleic acid synthesizer utilizing standard nucleotide or nucleoside precursors (e.g. phosphoramidites). Automated nucleic acid synthesizers are sold commercially by several vendors, including DNA/RNA synthesizers from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.), MerMade synthesizers from BioAutomation (Irving, Tex.), and OligoPilot synthesizers from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, Pa.). The 2 silyl protecting group can be used in conjunction with acid labile dimethoxytrityl (DMT) at the 5 position of ribonucleosides to synthesize oligonucleotides via phosphoramidite chemistry. Final deprotection conditions are known not to significantly degrade RNA products. All syntheses can be conducted in any automated or manual synthesizer on large, medium, or small scale. The syntheses may also be carried out in multiple well plates or glass slides. The 2-O-silyl group can be removed via exposure to fluoride ions, which can include any source of fluoride ion, e.g., those salts containing fluoride ion paired with inorganic counterions e.g., and potassium fluoride or those salts containing fluoride ion paired with an organic counterion, e.g., a tetraalkylammonium fluoride. A crown ether catalyst can be utilized in combination with the inorganic fluoride in the deprotection reaction. Preferred fluoride ion fluoride or a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g., dimethylformamide). The choice of protecting groups for use on the phosphite triesters and phosphotriesters can alter the stability of the triesters towards fluoride. Methyl protection of the phosphotriester or phosphitetriester can stabilize the linkage against fluoride ions and improve process yields. Since ribonucleosides have a reactive 2 hydroxyl substituent, it can be desirable to protect the reactive 2 position in RNA with a protecting group that is orthogonal to a 5-O-dimethoxytrityl protecting group, e.g., one stable to treatment with acid. Silyl protecting groups meet this criterion and can be readily removed in a final fluoride deprotection step that can result in minimal RNA degradation. Tetrazole catalysts can be used in the standard phosphoramidite coupling reaction. Preferred catalysts include e.g., tetrazole, S-ethyl-tetrazole, p-nitrophenyltetrazole. also, Technology, ed. S. T. Crooke, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2001. The protected monomer compounds can be separated from a reaction mixture and further purified by a method such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, or recrystallization. As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, further methods of synthesizing the compounds of the formulae herein will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Other synthetic chemistry transformations, protecting groups (e.g., for hydroxyl, amino, etc. present on the bases) and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M.

Methods of Treatment In further embodiments of the present invention, a method of treating a human subject, comprising administering a therapeutic dosage of the antigen binding proteins or antibodies or interfering RNA (e.g., siRNA or shRNA) of the present invention is provided. In one embodiment, the antigen binding proteins are monoclonal antibodies. In one embodiment, the antigen binding proteins are human antibodies. In another embodiment, the antigen binding proteins or antibodies are humanized antibodies. In another embodiment, interfering RNA (e.g., siRNA or shRNA) is administered. As used herein the term \"subject\" refers to a mammal, including humans, and can be used interchangeably with the term \"patient\". Given the results of the Icelandic study presented in the examples below, there need not be any particular further manipulation downstream in a host receiving a therapy involving administering the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) to the host. That is, in some embodiments, the antibody (or RNAi) need simply be one or more of the antibodies (or RNAi) described herein, which binds to (and inhibits) ASGR (such as ASGR1), and be administered in an amount, and at a frequency sufficient to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, or other disorders provided herein. In some embodiments, the antibody (or RNAi) is administered in an amount sufficient to result in a lowering of non-HDL cholesterol. In some embodiments, the antibody (or RNAi) is administered in an amount sufficient to result in lowering LDL cholesterol. While not intended to be limiting unless expressed otherwise, below is a description of various embodiments through which ASGR can have an impact on various disorders, and thus, how the various antibodies (or RNAi) provided herein (which can inhibit (e.g., reduce) ASGR function) can have an impact on the various disorders provided herein. In some embodiments, the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) operates through ASGR's role in platelet clearance. Inhibiting (e.g., reducing) the receptor results in a reduction in clearance of old platelets. Such older platelets do not coagulate as well as new platelets and as a result, the blood is thinner. As a result, plaques can lessen and there can be a positive impact (e.g., stroke is lessened) for the subject. In some embodiments, the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) binds to ASGR to alter inflammation. For example, reducing the ASGR-1 receptor results in a modification of the immune response. Normally, there can be an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. These proinflammatory cytokines are circulating in the native state (one where the ASGR1 receptor is not reduced). However, ALP (alkaline phosphatase) can have an anti-inflammatory role thereby reducing inflammation and coagulopathy systemically. In some embodiments, the mechanism of action involves reducing ASGR1 which increases ALP and therefore reduces inflammation. In some embodiments, and without intending to be limited by theory (unless expressed otherwise), the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) can reduce an activity due to ASGR interacting with one or more other molecules, either directly or indirectly. For example, various embodiments for various proteins are provided herein in Examples 18 and 19. As noted above, this selection of proteins can also be useful for determining the effectiveness of the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) (and/or the amount of the antibody and/or identification of a subject who can respond to the therapy (or RNAi)) by monitoring one or more of these proteins as a Cardiovascular Disease marker. Thus, these markers are useful as markers and, without intending to be limited by theory, in some embodiments, one or more of the proteins disclosed below is the protein through which (directly or indirectly) ASGR1 modulation achieves its benefit for one or more of the disorders provided herein, including cardiovascular disease. In addition to the marker proteins described in Examples 18 and 19 herein (which also allow for various mechanisms of action and monitoring the effectiveness of various ASGR inhibitors (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) and dosage regimes), the following proteins of interest are those that interact with ASGR, and ASGR-1 in particular, directly by binding to them. Thus, these are additional interactions that can be inhibited (e.g., reduced) for various embodiments provided herein, by various ASGR inhibitors (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi). While not intending to be limited by theory (unless explicitly stated otherwise), ASGR-1's binding to one or more of the following proteins can be inhibited (e.g., reduced) by using an ASGR-1 inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding protein or antibody or RNAi) provided herein that inhibits (e.g., reduces) the noted binding. While in some embodiments, the protein interactions are contemplated as resulting mechanisms of action that occur downstream from when ASGR levels are effectively reduced by an ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding protein or antibody binding or via RNAi), the following list is a list of proteins that directly bind to ASGR1, and thus whose direct binding to ASGR-1 can be inhibited (e.g., reduced) by one or more of the antigen binding proteins or antibodies provided herein (or RNAi). In some embodiments, the ASGR-1 inhbiitor (e.g., antigen binding protein or antibody or RNAi) inhibits (e.g., reduces) ASGR-1's binding to one or more of: Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (aka Fetuin A) (see Tozawa et al, J Biol Chem (2001) 276:12624-12628); Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (see Stockert et (1977) Science 197:667-668), Orosomucoid (aka alpha-1-acid glycoprotein) and Scholtens H B, D K, J. Liver. 1982 March; 2(1):14-21), LDL and chylomicrons et al Fibronectin (see et al Hepatology (1998) 28:475-485), and IgA (see Stockert et al PNAS (1982) 79:6229-6231). In some embodiments, the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding protein or antibody or RNAi) antibody binds to ASGR and inhibits (e.g., reduces) ASGR's interaction with a molecule that has a terminal gal or galNAc, including, but not limited to protein ligands, synthetic polysaccharides, solid substrates, etc. In some embodiments, the ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding proteins or antibodies or RNAi) inhibits (e.g., reduces) ASGR1's ability to bind to an asialylated molecule.

The term \"treatment\" encompasses alleviation of at least one symptom or other embodiment of a disorder, or reduction of disease severity, and the like. An antigen binding protein, in particular a human antibody according to the present invention, need not effect a complete cure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of a disease, to constitute a viable therapeutic agent. As is recognized in the pertinent field, drugs employed as therapeutic agents may reduce the severity of a given disease state, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as useful therapeutic agents. Simply reducing the impact of a disease (for example, by reducing the number or severity of its symptoms, or by increasing the effectiveness of another treatment, or by producing another beneficial effect), or reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising administering to a patient an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that reflects the severity of the particular disorder. The term \"prevention\" encompasses prevention of at least one symptom or other embodiment of a disorder, and the like. A prophylactically administered treatment incorporating an antigen binding protein, in particular a human antibody according to the present invention, need not be completely effective in preventing the onset of a condition in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent. Simply reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. The term \"non-HDL cholesterol\" encompasses all cholesterol-containing and chylomicron. Non-HDL cholesterol levels are calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol levels from total cholesterol levels. As is understood in the pertinent field, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antigen binding proteins and/or interfering RNA are administered to a subject in a manner appropriate to the indication and the composition. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprise the human antibodies of the present invention. In another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprise interfering RNA. Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by any suitable technique, including but not limited to parenterally, topically, or by inhalation. If injected, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered, for example, via intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, by bolus injection, or continuous infusion. Delivery by inhalation includes, for example, nasal or oral inhalation, use of a nebulizer, inhalation of the antigen binding protein in aerosol form, and the like. Other alternatives include oral preparations including pills, syrups, or lozenges. Advantageously, the antigen binding proteins or interfering RNA are administered in the form of a composition comprising one or more additional components such as a physiologically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent. Optionally, the composition additionally comprises one or more physiologically active agents. In various particular embodiments, the composition comprises one, two, three, four, five, or six physiologically active agents in addition to one or more antigen binding proteins (e.g, human antibodies) or interfering RNA. Kits for use by medical practitioners are provided including one or more antigen binding proteins or interfering RNA and a label or other instructions for use in treating any of the conditions discussed herein. In one embodiment, the kit includes a sterile preparation of one or more human antibodies, or one or more interfering RNA which may be in the form of a composition as disclosed herein, and may be in one or more vials. Dosages and the frequency of administration may vary according to such factors as the route of administration, the particular antigen binding proteins or interfering RNA employed, the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the size and general condition of the subject. Appropriate dosages can be determined by procedures known in the pertinent art, e.g. in clinical trials that may involve dose escalation studies. An antigen binding protein, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, or interfering RNA may be administered, for example, once or more than once, e.g., at regular intervals over a period of time. In particular embodiments, an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA is administered over a period of at least once a month or more, e.g., for one, two, or three months or even indefinitely. For treating chronic conditions, long-term treatment is generally most effective. However, for treating acute conditions, administration for shorter periods, e.g. from one to six weeks, may be sufficient. In general, the antigen binding protein or interfering RNA is administered until the patient manifests a medically relevant degree of improvement over baseline for the chosen indicator or indicators. One example of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous injection of an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA once a week, or once every two weeks, or once every month, once every other month, once every three months, once every six months or longer, at an appropriate dosage, to treat a condition in which it is desired to target cells expressing ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. Weekly or monthly administration of antigen binding protein could be continued until a desired result is achieved, e.g., the subject's symptoms subside. Treatment may resume as needed, or, alternatively, maintenance doses may be administered. In some embodiments, one or more of the markers in Tables 18.1, 18.2, 19.3, and 19.4 can be used to determine whether or not the amount of ASGR inhibitor (e.g., antigen binding protein and/or antibody and/or RNAi) administered is sufficient for its intended therapeutic application. In some embodiments, when one or more of the alterations in protein level, for the proteins outlined in one or more of Tables 18.1, 18.2, 19.3, and 19.4 changes in response to administering the antigen binding protein, antibody and/or RNAi, the antigen binding protein, antibody and/or RNAi is having an effect in the host. In some embodiments, the amount is sufficient when it alters the level of non-HDL cholesterol to a desired amount or reduces it by a desired amount. In some embodiments, the markers used can be one or more of those in one or more of Tiers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Table 19.4. In some embodiments, the markers used can be one or more of those in one or more of Tiers 1 and 5 of Table 19.4. Combination Therapies Particular embodiments of methods and compositions of the invention involve the use of at least one antigen binding protein and/or interfering RNA and one or more other therapeutics useful for treating or preventing cardiovascular disease, for example. In one embodiment, antigen binding proteins and/or interfering RNA are administered alone or in combination with other agents useful for treating the condition with which the patient is afflicted. Examples of such agents include both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous drugs. When multiple therapeutics are co-administered, dosages may be adjusted accordingly, as is recognized in the pertinent art. \"Co-administration\" and combination therapy are not limited to simultaneous administration, but also include treatment regimens in which an antigen binding protein is administered at least once during a course of treatment that involves administering at least one other therapeutic agent to the patient. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA is administered prior to the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA is administered concurrent with the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an antigen binding protein or interfering RNA is administered subsequent to the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the at least one antigen binding protein or antibody and/or the interfering RNA is administered to a subject in combination with an anti-PCSK9 antibody (e.g., Repatha\u00ae, Praluent\u00ae, bococizumab). In another embodiment, the at least one antigen binding protein or antibody and/or the interfering RNA is administered to a subject in combination with at least one other cholesterol-lowering (serum and/or total body cholesterol) agent. In some embodiments, the agents that increase the expression of LDLR, have been observed to increase serum HDL levels, lower LDL levels or lower triglyceride levels. Exemplary agents include, but are not limited (ADVICOR (VYTORIN (ZOCOR and ZETIA) and/or lipid modifying agents. In some embodiments, the at least one antigen binding protein and/or interfering RNA is combined with PPAR gamma arteriosclerosis obliterans treatments. In some embodiments, the at least one antigen binding protein and/or interfering RNA is combined with an agent that increases the level of LDLR protein in a subject, such as statins, certain cytokines like oncostatin M, estrogen, and/or certain herbal ingredients such as berberine. In some embodiments, the at least one antigen binding protein and/or interfering RNA is combined with an agent that increases serum cholesterol levels in a subject (such as certain anti-psychotic agents, certain HIV protease inhibitors, dietary factors such as high fructose, sucrose, cholesterol or certain fatty acids and certain nuclear receptor agonists and antagonists for RXR, RAR, LXR, FXR). The combination of the two can allow for the undesirable side-effects of other agents to be mitigated by the antigen binding protein or interfering RNA. Diagnostic Uses In one embodiment, antigen binding proteins of the invention are useful for detecting the presence of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 in a biological sample. The term \"detecting\" as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments, a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue. In certain embodiments, such tissues include tissues that express ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 at higher levels relative to other tissues. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 in a biological sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an antigen binding protein of the invention under conditions permissive for binding of an antigen binding protein to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the antigen binding protein and ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disorder associated with increased or decreased expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a test cell with an antigen binding protein; determining the level of expression (either quantitatively or qualitatively) of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 by the test cell by detecting binding of the antigen binding protein to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2; and comparing the level of expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 by the test cell with the level of expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 by a control cell (e.g., a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 at levels comparable to such a normal cell), wherein a higher or lower level of expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased or decreased expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased or decreased expression of ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. In certain embodiments, a method of diagnosis or detection, such as those described above, comprises detecting binding of an antigen binding protein of the invention to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 expressed on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 on its surface. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell with an antigen binding protein under conditions permissive for binding of an antigen binding protein of the invention to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the antigen binding protein of the invention and ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 on the cell surface. An exemplary assay for detecting binding of an antigen binding protein of the invention to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 expressed on the surface of a cell is a \"FACS\" assay. Certain other methods can be used to detect binding of antigen binding protein of the invention to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. Such methods include, but are not limited to, antigen-binding assays that are well known in the art, such as western blots, In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins of the invention are labeled. Labels include, but are not limited to, labels or moieties that are detected directly (such as fluorescent, chromophoric, electron-dense, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels), as well as moieties, such as enzymes or ligands, that are detected indirectly, e.g., through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, the radioisotopes 32P, 14C, 125I, 3H, chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like. In certain embodiments, antigen binding proteins of the invention are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization entails separating the antigen binding protein of the invention from any ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the antigen binding protein of the invention before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (see, e.g., Bennich et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,760), or by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the antigen binding protein of the invention after formation of a complex between the antigen binding protein of the invention and ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.

EXAMPLES Example 1\u2014Identification of Rare Sequence Variants that Disrupt ASGR-1 Function and Lower Non-HDL Cholesterol and Protect Against Coronary Artery Disease The level of circulating non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol is heritable and strongly correlated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infraction (MI). Whole-genome sequencing offers the potential to search for rare sequence variants that have large effects on serum lipid levels and hence the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as CAD and MI. Methods Study Participants: Details of the population sample sets from Iceland, Denmark and The Netherlands, used to measure the various lipids traits (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ferritin, and vitamin B12, are outlined in Table 1.2. The dataset for ferritin is not shown. The coronary artery disease case-control sample sets that were a part of the study are outlined in Table 1.1. Icelandic Study Population Study participants were enrolled as part of various genetics programs at deCODE. Blood lipid levels (total cholesterol, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol density cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides), alkaline phosphatase and vitamin B12 levels were obtained from three of the largest laboratories in Iceland: 1) Landsp\u00edtali\u2014The National University Hospital of Iceland (LUH), Reykjav\u00edk (measurements performed between the years 1993 and 2012, hospitalized and ambulatory patients), 2) The Laboratory in Mj\u00f3dd (RAM), Reykjavik (measurements performed between 2004 and 2012, ambulatory patients) and 3) Akureyri Hospital, The Regional Hospital in North Iceland, Akureyri (performed between 2004 and 2010, hospitalized and ambulatory patients). Information on the participants is outlined in Table 1.2. Lipid levels were adjusted for sex, year of birth and age at measurement, lipid lowering medication and measurement site, using the average of multiple measurements for an individual, and then normalized to a standard normal distribution using quantile normalization. To obtain effect estimates in mmol/L the estimates from the regression analysis were multiplied by the estimated standard deviation of lipid level in the population. Given their approximately log-normal distribution, triglyceride levels were log-transformed before adjustment and the corresponding effect estimates are presented as percentage change instead of units of mmol/L. The total number of individuals with non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in Iceland is shown in the Table 1.3 below. For each lipid, the number of chip-typed and directly imputed individuals and those with familial imputations is also shown. TABLE 1.3 Lipid levels of Icelandic Study Participants Icelandic individuals with lipid values used in the study and the breakdown into those that were chip-typed and directly imputed (Direct imputation) and those that were first and second degree relatives of chip-typed individuals and had their genotypes inferred based on genealogy (Familial imputation). Non-HDL cholesterol was obtained by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol and measures the amount of cholesterol carried within all atherogenic lipoprotein particles (VLDL, IDL, LDL, chylomicrons and Lp(a)). The the Friedewald equation (for triglyceride levels<4.00 mmol/L) (Friedewald, W. T., Levy, R. I. & Fredrickson, D. S. Estimation of the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma, without use of the preparative ultracentrifuge. Clin. Chem. 18, 499-502 (1972)). Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol values are a mixture of fasting and non-fasting values, whereas triglycerides are fasting values exclusively. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as a) individuals in the MONICA registry who suffered myocardial infarction (MI) before the age of 75 in Iceland between 1981 and 2002 and satisfied the MONICA criteria (Gudbjartsson, et al., Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population. Nature genetics 2015), b) subjects with CAD discharge diagnoses (ICD 9 codes with significant angiographic CAD (see defined below) identified from a nationwide clinical registry of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions at LUH between the years 1987 and 2012, d) subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures at LUH between the years 2002 and 2011 or e) cause of death or contributing cause of death listed as MI or CAD (ICD 9 or 10 codes) on death registries between the years 1996 and 2009. Coronary angiograms in the nationwide registry were evaluated by an interventional cardiologist. Patients were considered to have significant angiographic CAD if one or more of the three major epicardial coronary vessels or the left main coronary artery was found to have at least 50% stenosis by visual estimation. Non-Icelandic Study Populations Characteristics of the non-Icelandic sample sets are outlined in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2. All the studies outlined in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by appropriate bioethics and/or data protection authorities. For samples from the Nijmegen Biomedical Study, Netherlands, the lipid values (namely, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) were all non-fasting values. For samples from the Danish Inter99 and Addition studies, the lipid values were all fasting values. All participating subjects donating biological samples signed informed consents. Personal identities of the phenotypes and biological samples were encrypted by a third party system provided by the Icelandic Data Protection Authority. Data Generation and Analysis Whole-Genome Sequencing, SNP Calling, and Illumina microarrays (Samani N J et al., Genomewide association analysis of coronary artery disease. The New England journal of medicine 2007; 357:443-53). The whole-genomes of 2,636 Icelanders were sequenced using the standard TruSeq methodology (Illumina) to a mean depth of at least 10\u00d7 (median 20\u00d7)(Samani N J et al., Genomewide association analysis of coronary artery disease. The New England journal of medicine 2007; 357:443-53). For improved sequencing coverage of the GC-rich intron 4 in ASGR-1 gene, the whole-genome sequence data generated for 738 Icelanders was analyzed using TruSeq PCR-free method from Illumina (mean depth of 30\u00d7). The del12 variant in intron 4 of ASGR-1 was in this dataset. Single-Track SNP Genotyping: Centaurus (Nanogen) platform (Gretarsdottir S, et al., Genome-wide association study identifies a sequence variant within the DAB2IP gene conferring susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm. Nature genetics 2010; 42:692). The del12 variant was genotyped using a PCR based method with the following primers: forward primer (NED labelled) 5-TTCATCTTTCTTCCCACATTGC-3 (SEQ primer 5-GGGCCTGAGAGAGACGTTCA-3 (SEQ ID NO: 32601). An internal size standard was added to the resulting PCR products and the fragments were separated and detected on an Applied Biosystems model 3730 sequencer, using in-house Allele genotypes and serum lipids (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), ALP, ferritin and vitamin B12 levels in the Icelandic dataset were tested using a generalized linear regression, assuming an additive genetic model (Samani N J et al., Genomewide association analysis of coronary artery disease. The New England journal of medicine 2007; 357:443-53; and Olsen M H, et al., N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, but not high sensitivity C-reactive protein, improves cardiovascular risk prediction in the general population. European heart journal 2007; 28:1374-81). For the Icelandic dataset, logistic regression was used to test for association between the del12 variant and coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, treating the disease status as the response and the number of copies of del12 an individual carries as the explanatory variable. Coronary artery disease case-control association analysis for the non-Icelandic sample sets was done using the NEMO software (Jorgensen A B, et al., Loss-of-function mutations in APOC3 and risk of ischemic vascular disease. The New England journal of medicine 2014; 371:32-41) assuming a multiplicative risk model. Results for the Icelandic and the non-Icelandic sample sets were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects model. To estimate the effect of the del12 variant on myocardial infarction-free survival, Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated for survival to first myocardial infarction in heterozygous carriers and non-carriers (Hoogendoorn E H, et al., Thyroid function and prevalence of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in a population with borderline sufficient iodine intake: influences of age and sex. Clinical chemistry 2006; 52:104-11) by dividing the corresponding chi-square statistic by 1.36 for non-HDL cholesterol, 1.57 for HDL cholesterol, 1.40 for triglycerides, 1.53 for ALP, 1.30 for vitamin B12, 1.71 for coronary artery disease and 1.48 for myocardial infarction. To obtain a reliable imputation of the del12 variant, 3,799 Icelandic individuals were genotyped for the del12 variant and those genotypes were used as a training set for imputation of the del12 variant into the rest of the Icelandic population. The imputation information for del12 was 0.99. The Icelandic samples were genotyped using Illumina microarrays as described above (Gudbartssoon, D F, et al., Large Scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population. Nature Genetics 2015). The of 2,636 Icelanders were sequenced using Illumina standard TruSeq methodology to a mean depth of at least 10\u00d7 (median 20\u00d7) (Di Angelantonio E, et al., Major and risk of vascular disease. Jama 2009; total of 35.5 million autosomal SNPs and INDEL's were identified using the Genome Analysis Toolkit version 2.3.9. Information about haplotype sharing was used to improve variant genotyping, taking advantage of the fact that all sequenced individuals had also been chip-typed and long-range-phased. Variants were annotated using Ensembl release 72 and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 2.8. Of the 35.5 million sequence variants found, 25.3 million variants passed the quality threshold and were imputed into 104,220 Icelanders who had been genotyped using Illumina chips. Additionally, using the Icelandic genealogy, genotype probabilities were calculated for 294,212 untyped individuals who are first and second degree relatives of the chip-typed individuals born after 1880 (Gudbartssoon, D F, et al., Large Scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population. Nature Genetics 2015). The informativeness of genotype imputation (imputation information) was estimated by the ratio of the variance of imputed expected allele counts and the variance of the actual allele counts: where is the allele count. Var(E(|chip data)) was estimated by the observed variance of the imputed expected counts and Var() was estimated by p(1p), where p is the allele frequency. For improved sequencing coverage of the GC-rich intron 4 in ASGR-1 gene, whole-genome sequence (\"WGS\") for 738 Icelanders was analyzed using TruSeq PCR-free method from Illumina (mean depth of 30\u00d7). This PCR-free method gave much better coverage of GC-rich regions including the ASGR-1 intron 4. The del12 variant in intron 4 of ASGR-1 was detected in five individuals in this dataset. To provide improved coverage of the associated region (1 Mb centered on ASGR-1), a new dataset was analyzed that included an additional 5,817 WGS individuals (on top of the 2,636 WGS Icelanders). additional individuals were free or TrueSeq Nano methods. These Illumina TrueSeq methods give enhanced sequence coverage as compared to the standard Illumina TrueSeq method (median sequencing depth 32\u00d7). were imputed into 150,656 Icelandic chipped-typed individuals, and with the use of genealogy information, into primary and secondary relatives of chip-typed individuals that were un-typed. In this expanded dataset, we identified another rare (0.027%), novel variant, W158X. The W158X variant is a four by INDEL in exon 7 of ASGR-1 (NM_001671.4:c. 469_472dupAACT) that causes frameshift and introduction of premature stop codon at amino acid 158 out of the 291 amino acid full length protein (NP_001662.1:p.Trp158X). A total of 345 individuals were Sanger-sequenced based on the imputation predicted carriers and non-carriers of c. 469_472dupAACT. In this dataset, 79 c. 469_472dupAACT carriers and 270 non-carriers were identified. This genotype data was then used to re-impute the variant into the Icelandic dataset. For non-HDL cholesterol, a larger sample set (n=136,261) was used in the association analysis outlined in Tables 1.4A and 1.4B. Associations between imputed genotypes and serum lipids (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), ALP and vitamin B12 levels in the Icelandic dataset were tested using a generalized linear regression, assuming an additive genetic model (Gudbjartsson D F, et al., Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population. Nature genetics 2015; and Steinthorsdottir V, et al., Identification of low-frequency and rare sequence variants associated with elevated or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Nature genetics 2014; 46:294-8). All measurements were adjusted for age, sex and measurement site, and average was taken over the available measurements after adjustment and inverse normal transformation. The lipid measurements were further adjusted for statin use. Removing individual known to take lipid lowering drugs in the Icelandic dataset did not alter the association with non-HDL cholesterol. The effect, in standardized units, changed from 16,295 individuals, out of 119,146 individuals with non-HDL cholesterol information. The lipid, ALP and vitamin B12 measurements from the Danish Inter99 study, ADDITION Denmark screening cohort, and the Nijmegen biomedical study, were adjusted and transformed in the same way and tested for association with allele count of del12 and rs186021206 using the linear regression implemented in the R software package. Results from the different populations were combined using the inverse variance fixed-effects method with METAL (Willer C J, et al., METAL: fast and efficient meta-analysis of genomewide association scans. Bioinformatics 2010; 26:2190-1). Effect estimates from the regression analysis are expressed in units of standard deviation (SD). To obtain effect estimates in mg/dL for non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, the estimates from the regression analysis were multiplied by the estimated SD of the population distributions. Triglyceride, ALP and vitamin B12 levels were log-transformed before adjustment as their distributions are approximately log-normal, and the corresponding effect estimates are presented as percentage change. For the Icelandic dataset, logistic regression was used to test for association between the del12 variant and coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, treating the disease status as the response and the number of copies of the deletion an individual carries as the explanatory variable. Other available individual characteristics that correlate with disease status were also included in the model as nuisance variables (Gudbjartsson D F, et al., Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population. Nature genetics 2015). Coronary artery disease case-control association analysis for the non-Icelandic sample sets was done using the NEMO software (Gretarsdottir S, et al., The gene encoding phosphodiesterase 4D confers risk of ischemic stroke. Nature genetics 2003; 35:131-8) assuming a multiplicative risk model. Results for the Icelandic and the non-Icelandic sample sets were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity in the effect estimate was tested assuming that the estimated odds ratios for different groups follows a log-normal distribution using a likelihood ratio test with degrees of freedom equal to the number of groups compared minus one. To estimate the effect of the del12 variant on myocardial infarction free survival, we estimated the Kaplan-Meier curves for survival to first myocardial infarction in heterozygous carriers and non-carriers stratified by sex and tested the difference in survival between carriers and non-carriers using the Cox proportional model. The analysis was performed using the survival library in the R software package. The survival analysis was based on 87,718 chip genotyped Icelanders and 44,655 Icelandic first and second degree relatives of chip typed individuals after restricting our analysis to those who lived to be at least 40 years old. Death was treated as a censoring event. Functional Characterization of the Del12 Variant in ASGR-1 cDNA Preparation, Amplification, Sanger Sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing: RNA was isolated from blood samples from carriers and non-carriers of del12. Following cDNA generation, the region between exon 3 and 5 in ASGR-1 was PCR amplified and the identified PCR products (two for del12 carriers and one for non-carriers) were Sanger sequenced using standard methodology to determine the sequence difference between the identified cDNA products. To quantify the ratio between the two amplified cDNA PCR products, they were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq instrument with the MiSeq v2 kit. Analysis: The wild type ASGR-1 cDNA and ASGR-1 cDNA with the 22 bp deletion were transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells to determine if ASGR-1 transcripts with the 22 bp deletion generated stable truncated ASGR-1 protein as evaluated by western blot analysis. RNA was isolated from blood samples using a Qiagen RNA maxi kit. Concentration and quality of the RNA was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), all samples had RIN values over 7. Following cDNA generation, the region between exon 3 and 5 in ASGR-1 was PCR amplified using the Advantage\u00ae 2 Polymerase kit (Clontech) with the forward primer, CACTCAGGTCCTTCTGCTGTTTC (SEQ ID NO: the reverse primer, 5-ACCTCGCCTCCTCCTGCT-3 (SEQ ID NO: 32603). The resulting products were resolved on agarose gel and the identified PCR products (two for del12 carriers and one for non-carriers) were Sanger sequenced using standard methodology to determine the sequence difference between the identified cDNA products. To quantitate the ratio between the two amplified cDNA PCR products, they were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq with the MiSeq v2 reagent kit. Transient Overexpression of Wild Type and Mutated ASGR-1 Harbouring the 22 bp Deletion at the End of Exon 4 in HeLa Cells. Generation and Cloning of Wild Type and Mutated ASGR-1 cDNA: cDNA of ASGR-1 was obtained by PCR on liver marathon ready cDNA (BD biosciences Clontech). primers used The resulting cDNA contained all including the start and stop codons of ASGR-1. PCR product was run on 1.6% Agarose gel and a band of the correct size was excised out and purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN 28704) following the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen K4800-01), 20 of the gel extraction product was used and the manufacturer's protocol was followed resulting in pcDNA3.1_ASGR-1_WT. Transformed TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen C4040-10) were plated on LB plates containing 50 g/ml ampicillin. Colonies were expanded in 3 ml LB medium containing 50 g/ml ampicillin. Plasmids were purified plasmid 12125) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing Introduction of 22 bp deletion in ASGR-1: In order to generate a cDNA representative of the del12 carrier mRNA, targeted mutagenesis was The Q5 England BioLabs E0554S) and the pcDNA3.1_ASGR-1_WT plasmid was used as a template. In short, a PCR reaction was performed using the following primers double-stranded DNA fragment representing the entire pcDNA3.1_ASGR-1_WT plasmid lacking the 22 bp at the end of exon 4. Following the manufacturers recommendation, 1 uL of the PCR reaction was used in the KLD reaction (New England BioLabs E0554S) wherein the PCR fragment is phosphorylated, re-circularized and the non-mutated template plasmid is removed. Mutated plasmids were transformed into NEB 5-alpha Competent cells (New England BioLabs C2987H) and plated on LB plates containing 50 g/ml ampicillin. Colonies were expanded in 3 ml LB medium containing 50 g/ml ampicillin. Plasmids were purified 12125) following the manufacturer's protocol. ASGR-1_22_bp_del sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Expression of ASGR-1 in Cultured Cells: Two days prior to transfection, 100,000 HeLa cells (Public Health England 93021013) were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate in 3 mL of DMEM medium CO2 in a humidified incubator. The day before transfection, media was replaced with the without antibiotics. On the day of transfection, for each transfected well, 2.5 ug of plasmids containing or with 125 uL of Opti-Mem. Subsequently, the diluted plasmid solution was mixed with the Lipofectamine 3000 solution at a 1:1 ratio and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before the addition of 250 uL of the combined solution to each transfected well. 24 hours post transfection, the spent media was replaced with fresh without antibiotics. Selected wells were supplemented with 10 uM MG132 (TOCRIS 1748) for 4.5 hours prior to harvesting of cells. 48 hours post transfection cells were harvested for analysis by washing wells 2\u00d7 with PBS (ThermoFisher 14190-250) followed by an 8 minute incubation with 1 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS (ThermoFisher 15575-020). Next, the EDTA solution was aspirated and cells dislodged by pipetting of 2 mL of fresh media. 3\u00d76-wells were pooled for each experimental condition and cells were spun down at 300\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The equivalent of 2\u00d76-wells were lysed in 200 uL of RIPA buffer for Western blot analysis. The remainder of cells were split in two and lysed in 300 uL RLT buffer (Qiagen 74106) Tissue and Cell lysis solution (Epicentre MTC096H) and snap frozen on dry ice for RNA and DNA extraction respectively. Three different transient expression experiments were done and all gave the same results. Quantitative PCR Analysis: RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen 74106) according to manufacturer's recommendations, and concentration and quality was determined with Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using the High capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit (ThermoFisher). DNA was isolated from cells using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre MCD85201) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Analysis of gene expression and transfection efficiency was performed on total cDNA and DNA respectively, with real-time PCR on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence run in parallel to verify normalization of input cDNA and DNA. Western Blot Analysis: Cells corresponding to two wells of a 6 well plate were lysed using 200 l of RIPA buffer with 1:100 Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific 78442). Lysates were kept on ice for 10 min with agitation followed by sonication for 20 sec (Branson 2510) and additional agitation on ice for 10 min. Lysates were spun down at 4\u00b0 C. for 15 min at 14,000\u00d7g. Total protein amount of lysates was estimated using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific 23227). Samples were prepared using Novex Bolt LDS sample buffer (4\u00d7) (Life technologies B0007) and Novex Bolt sample reducing agent and on Novex Nupage 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Life technologies NP0335BOX). Total protein amount per lane was 24 g and PageRuler (Thermo scientific 26616) was used to estimate protein size. The gel was run at a constant of 200V for 50 min. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Life technologies IB23002) using iBlot2 (Life technologies). Membranes were allowed to dry and were then hydrated with MQ water before blotting. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature using Odyssey blocking buffer PBS (Li-Cor 927-40000). Primary antibodies used were -ASGR-1 incubated in blocking buffer with the addition of 0.1% Tween for 3 hours at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were -Rabbit PBST+0.01% SDS for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the membrane it was allowed to dry and then scanned using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Other Diseases and Traits in deCODE Database: The deCODE Genetics phenotype database contains medical information on diseases and traits obtained through collaboration with specialists in each field. This includes information on cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction, coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome and stroke), metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome), psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression), addictions (e.g., nicotine, alcohol), inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and asthma), musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., osteoarthritis, osteoporosis), eye diseases (e.g., glaucoma), kidney diseases (e.g., kidney stones, kidney failure) and 29 types of cancer. Anthropometric measures have also been collected through several of these projects. Routinely measured traits from patient workups (e.g., sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, immunoglobulins, iron, vitamins, lipids, liver function tests and more) were obtained from the Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, and the Icelandic Medical Center Laboratory in Mjodd (Laeknasetrid), Reykjavik. The number of independent and uncorrelated secondary traits tested for association with del12 amounts to 400. Results Association of Sequence Variants with Non-HDL Cholesterol Levels Sequence variants were first identified through whole-genome sequencing (\"WSG\") of 2,636 Icelanders to a median These variants were imputed (assisted by long-range phased haplotypes) the of (SNP) arrays. In addition, Icelandic genealogical information was used to calculate genotype probabilities for 294,212 close relatives to those genotyped. Using these data we screened for novel rare variants that associated with non-HDL cholesterol levels (n=119,146). A set of seven correlated (pairwise rare non-coding SNPs on chromosome 17p13.1 associated with non-HDL cholesterol level. The seven variants span 80 kb, including the asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 and 2 (ASGR-1 and ASGR-2) genes. The strongest association was represented by rs186021206 (minor allele frequency (MAF)=0.43%) located downstream of ASGR-1 that with 8.9\u00b11.5 mg/dl lowering of non-HDL cholesterol (P=1.4\u00d710-9)(Table 1.4B). The associated region was well covered by the whole-genome sequencing except for intron 4 of ASGR-1. This intron is 79 base pairs (bp) long and very GC rich. To explore this region further 738 individuals were whole genome sequenced with PCR-free sequencing (Illumina), that gave enhanced coverage of the intron and led to the identification of a 12 bp deletion within the intron; NM_001671.4:c. 284-36_283+33delCTGGGGCTGGGG here after referred to as del12. Following direct genotyping of del12 and imputation into the Icelandic dataset, we that del12 (MAF=0.41%) is highly correlated with rs186021206 (r2=0.86) and the six other correlated SNPs and associates even more strongly with lowering of non-HDL cholesterol levels (decrease of 10.2\u00b11.5 mg/dl, P=2.5\u00d710-10) (Table 1.9A). Del12 also increases HDL cholesterol and decreases triglyceride (TG) levels, albeit to a much lesser degree than for non-HDL cholesterol (Tables 1.4A and 1.9B). None of the seven SNPs maintained a significant association with non-HDL cholesterol after adjusting for del12 indicating that del12 is sufficient to explain the non-HDL association. To validate the del12 association with non-HDL cholesterol levels, del12 in samples from The Netherlands (Nijmegen Biomedical Study18) and Denmark (Danish Inter9919 and Danish Addition study20) were genotyped. Del12 associated with non-HDL cholesterol in each sample set with similar effect size as in Iceland (Table 1.2, Tables 1.4A and 1.4B and Table 1.9B). When all three datasets were combined with the Icelandic discovery data, it was established that del12 lowers non-HDL cholesterol by 11.6\u00b11.5 mg/dl (P=1.0\u00d710-16)(Table 1.9B). To identify additional loss of function variants in ASGR-1, an extended dataset was screened based on sequence variants identified through whole-genome sequencing (\"WSG\") of an additional group of 5,817 WGS Icelanders on top of the 2,636 described above. In this dataset, a rare four by insertion mutation was identified; namely, MAF=0.027%; NM_001671.4:c. 469_472dupAACT. As mentioned throughout, this frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 158 out of the 291 amino acid full length protein (NP_001662.1:p.W158X). Potential carriers and non-carriers were directly genotyped using Sanger sequencing. Those genotypes were then used to re-impute p.W158X into 150,656 Icelandic chipped typed individuals and their first and second degree relatives. In this dataset, c. 469_472dupAACT associates significantly with a decrease in non-HDL cholesterol (21.6 mg/dL, 95% C1-34.2 to 9.6) and an increase in ALP (45.3% increase, 95% CI 20.4 to 68.2, P=7.9\u00d7106) (Table 1.8). The direction of the effects of c. 469_472dupAACT and the effect sizes are similar to that of del12 (Table 1.8). Given that a single test was performed, these results provide a significant replication of the ASGR-1 loss of function effect on non-HDL and ALP. Furthermore, since W158X is not correlated with del12 (i.e. there was no overlap between individuals carrying W158X and del12), the W158X variant provides yet further proof that the loss of function in the ASGR-1 gene is responsible for the observed changes in non-HDL, Triglycerides, Alkaline Phosphatase, Ferritin and Vitamin B12 levels. For coronary artery disease, the odds ratio for W158X (c. 469_472dupAACT) was 0.65 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.40; P=0.24). As mentioned above, the W158X (c. 469_472dupAACT) variant is independent of del12 and none of the 79 carriers found in Iceland carried del12. The variant also appears to be specific to the Icelandic population as it is not detected in large population databases such as (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), Exome dbSNP. Del12 within Intron 4 of ASGR-1 Causes a Splicing Error Resulting in a Frameshift Since del12 is located in intron 4 of ASGR-1, we examined its effect on splicing between exons 4 and 5. The region between exon 3 and 5 in cDNA generated from blood samples from 12 non-carriers and 12 heterozygous carriers of del12 was PCR amplified (FIG. 4). The PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis demonstrating a band of 239 bp in non-carrier. In del12 carriers, however, a smaller 217 bp band was noted in addition to the expected 239 bp PCR product (FIG. 4B). Upon Sanger sequencing of the cDNA products we identified in the 217 bp cDNA fragment a 22 bp deletion at the end of exon 4 (FIG. 4C). The deletion of these 22 bp from the ASGR-1 transcript appears to be driven by a pseudo 5-splice site in exon 4 (FIG. 4D). It causes a frameshift in carriers such that, if translated, the resulting protein would lack both the oligomerization and carbohydrate recognition domains. To quantify this splicing defect we used the Illumina TruSeq method for direct digital counting of sequencing reads that were generated by sequencing the two cDNA products found in del12 carriers. On average, 32\u00b113% of the total ASGR-1 transcripts were accounted for by the incorrectly spliced isoform (FIG. 4E). This form could not be detected in non-carriers (FIG. 4E). Together, these data identify ASGR-1 as the target gene for the non-HDL association at this locus and are consistent with the associated mutation, del12, disrupting the function of the ASGR-1 protein. ASGR-1 is the major subunit of the hepatic asioaloglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) known to recognize and mediate the endocytosis and degradation of a wide variety of desialylated glycoproteins that contain terminal galactose (Gal) or N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal-NAc) residues on their N-linked carbohydrate chains (Morell A G, Gregoriadis G, Scheinberg I H, Hickman J, Ashwell G.

The Del12 Variant in ASGR-1 and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Given the effect of del12 on non-HDL cholesterol levels, its impact on risk of CAD in 33,090 cases and 236,254 controls from Iceland and 8,558 cases and 11,120 controls from the USA, the UK, New Zealand and Denmark was assessed. It was found that carriers of del12 have a lower risk of CAD than non-carriers (odds 0.66; to P=6.3\u00d710-6) (FIG. 5A). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across the eight study populations (Phet=0.96). Del12 also decreases risk of MI in Iceland (hazard ratio 0.64; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.80; P=8.5\u00d710-5) (FIG. 5B). In addition, del12 carriers have a 1.5 years longer lifespan than non-carriers (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8 years; P=0.020). There is a strong positive correlation between the effect of sequence variants on non-HDL cholesterol levels and risk of CAD (Haddad L, Day I N, Hunt S, Williams R R, Humphries S E, Hopkins P N. Evidence for a third genetic locus causing familial hypercholesterolemia. A non-LDLR, non-APOB kindred. Journal of research 1999; 40:1113-22; Timms K M, Wagner S, Samuels M E, et al. A mutation in PCSK9 causing autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia in a Utah pedigree. 114:349-53; Varret M, Rabes J P, Saint-Jore B, et al. A third major locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia maps to 1p34.1-p32. American journal of human genetics 1999; 64:1378-87; Hunt S C, Hopkins P N, Bulka K, et al.

Common variants associated with plasma triglycerides and risk for coronary artery disease. Nature genetics 2013; 45:1345-52) (FIG. 6, Table 1.5). However, several published variants, deviate from the overall trend. For example, LPA and ANGPTL4 variants have a substantially greater effect on CAD than their non-HDL effects would predict while the effect of the APOE variants is weaker than predicted by the non-HDL effect. Del12 in ASGR-1 is another example of a variant whose effect on CAD is stronger than predicted by the effect non-HDL cholesterol effect (FIG. 6, Table 1.5). Association of Del12 with Serum Levels of Alp and Vitamin B12 To determine the overall effect of del12 in ASGR-1, its effect on a variety of human diseases and other traits in the Icelandic dataset was screened. A highly significant association of del12 with higher levels of circulating alkaline was observed (Tables 8A and 8B and Table 18). An increase in ALP levels may reflect liver disease, however, there was no increase in del12 carriers in serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase or other measures of liver function that commonly parallel changes in ALP in liver disease (Table 1.6). The del12 association with higher levels of ALP and vitamin B12 in individuals from the Danish Inter99 study with comparable effect sizes (P=9.9\u00d710-69 for ALP and P=9.9\u00d710-14 for vitamin B12) was replicated (Table 1.10). A common variant upstream of ASGR-1 (rs314253; MAF=35.1%) has been reported to associate modestly with both LDL cholesterol and ALP levels (Chambers J C, Zhang W, Sehmi J, et al. Genome-wide association study identifies loci influencing concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma. Nature genetics 2011; 43:1131-8; Willer C J, Schmidt E M, Sengupta S, et al. Discovery and refinement of loci associated with lipid levels. Nature genetics 2013; 45:1274-83). This common variant association is replicated in the data of the present invention (strongest association for both ALP and non-HDL with the correlated rs56093546; MAF=21.6%) and that its associations with ALP and non-HDL are independent of the rare signal represented by del12 (r2<0.001, Table 1.5) as demonstrated. As for del12, this common variant has opposite effects on ALP and non-HDL; the allele that increases ALP decreases non-HDL (see Chambers; Willer) (Table 1.7).

Serum was collected from male and female animals after a 4 hr fast and tested in an Olympus AU640 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. Compared to wild-type mice, serum ALP is elevated p<0.05; one-way ANOVA transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were not significantly different between the groups. These data are summarized in FIG. 7 herein. WT=wild-type; HE=heterozygous; HO=homozygous. Example 3\u2014RNAi Material and Methods siRNA TABLE 3.1 Primary Vendor Gene Target SEQ matched SEQ Vendor catalog# Target isolated from the HepG2, CHOs stable cell lines, or liver tissues treated with scrambled siRNA, matched control siRNA or siRNAs against hASGR-1, mASGR-2 using the Qiacube and standard Qiagen RNA isolation protocol. The RNA was DNase treated using the RQ1 DNase kit (Promega). Quantitative PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol on the Quantstudio 7 using the indicated set used and normalized with 18S internal control. siRNA Transfection Cells were transfected with 10 nM indicated manufacturer's RNAi reverse transfection microplates (Greiner bio-one) for internalization assay as well as in 96 well clear tissue culture plates (Corning) for QPCR and Western blotting. Western Blotting Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing inhibitors 3-4 days after siRNA transfection. Cell lysates were passed through a 21 gauge syringe five times and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm at 4 C for 15 mins. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined. If needed, 30 ug of protein was deglycosylated using the deglycosylation kit (Genzyme). 10 ug-30 ug of total protein was loaded in each well. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane was blocked with 5% blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT. Membrane was then probed and mouse anti -actin (1:5000, Thermo Fisher or Cell signaling) o/n at 4 C. The membrane was further probed with anti-mouse and anti-rat secondary antibodies to detection the indicated bands. Ligand Internalization Assay CHO stable cell lines were treated with scrambled siRNA, matched control siRNA or 96-well plate. Biotin-GalNAc-PAA was incubated and strepavidin-Alexa488 was further added to cells. Draq5 was used to counterstain cells (for both cytoplasm and nuclei). Cells were scanned with Operetta Image System and data analyzed by Columbus. Animal Study All animal housing conditions and research protocols were approved by the Amgen Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were housed in a specified-pathogen free, AAALAC, Intl-accredited facility in ventilated microisolators. Procedures and housing rooms are positively pressured and regulated on a 12:12 dark:light cycle. All animals received reverse-osmosis purified water ad libitum via an automatic watering system. 10-12 week old C57BL/6J animals (The Jackson Laboratory) were singly housed and were fed standard chow (2020\u00d7 Teklad global soy protein-free extruded rodent diet; Harlan). siRNAs modified for in vivo studies were formulated with Invivofectamine 3.0 (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, siRNAs were pre-mixed with complex buffer (provided by manufacturer) and Invivofectamine 3.0, and then incubated at 50\u00b0 C. for 30 minute and further diluted by PBS before injection. Mice were i.v. injected with buffer, indicated siRNA and matched control siRNA at 1-2 mg/kg body weight in 0.25 ml buffer at indicated time. Liver total RNA from harvested animals was processed for qPCR analysis. Data from these studies is provided in FIGS. 8-17 herein. Example 4\u2014Y272C Mutant Data Stable pools of Chinese ovary (CHO) expressing C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged murine wild-type Y272C ASGR-1 were generated by established methods using puromycin selection. Cell surface expression of ASGR-1 was confirmed by FACS using anti-FLAG antibody both during selection process and at the time of the experiment. Ligand binding was assessed by FACS using -GalNAc-PAA-biotin (Glycotech Corporation) and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE). Briefly, ligand added to 100 ul cells (1\u00d7106 cells) in Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium plus 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated on ice for 60 minutes. Cells were then washed 3\u00d7 with DMEM without phenol red plus 2% BSA. Streptavidin-PE was then added at 1 g/ml for 20 minutes on ice followed by 3 more washes in DMEM without phenol red plus 2% BSA, at which point the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml DMEM without phenol red plus 2% BSA and 5 ul of 0.1 mM SyTOx Blue viability dye and analyzed on a BD LSR II (BD Biosciences). Data are presented as Median Fluorescence Intensity as shown in Table 4.1, below. Example 5\u2014Generation of Antibodies TABLE 4.1 ASGR-1 Y272C has reduced ligand binding compared to wild-type ASGR-1 ug/ml Anti-FLAG 0 recombinant ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 vectors, cDNA sequences were synthesized, obtained from a commercial source or compiled from RNA sequencing data (Amgen). Human, mouse and rat ASGR cDNA clones were from obtained commercially (OriGene Technologies, Inc.). All other ASGR cDNAs were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). GenBank accession numbers are as follows: human entry cynomologus ASGR-2 was a partial amino acid sequence (NCBI protein accession # EHH57653), the complete nucleotide sequence was compiled through the analysis of the cyno genome (genome build Macaca_fascicularis_5.0; GenBank accession number and RNA sequencing data (Amgen) from cyno liver, heart and skin tissue. For transient or stable mammalian expression, cDNAs were cloned into pTT5 (National Research Council of Canada), pSLX235a (SureTech) or pJiFl (Boyce Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital, U.S. Pat. No. 7,192,933). For individual recombinant protein production in mammalian cells, most sequences were tagged at their C-termini with a 6\u00d7His purification tag. For complexes of huASGR-1 and huASGR-2, huASGR-2 was expressed without the 6\u00d7His tag. For recombinant expression in E. coli, sequences were cloned into pET21a (Novagen, EMD Millipore). The amino acid sequences of the resultant ASGR proteins are shown in Table 1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins Generation of Stable CHO\u2014S Cell Pools for Recombinant Protein Expression CHO\u2014S(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) cells were transfected with the pSLX235a vector encoding ASGR-1 or ASGR-2 using Lipfectamine LTX according to the manufacturer's recommendations (ThermoFisher Scientific). Stable pools were selected using 10 ug/ml puromycin (single selections) or 10 ug/ml puromycin and 400 ug/ml hygromycin (double selections) and by culturing the cells in fresh media every 2 days. Stable pools were then used for recombinant protein production. Recombinant Protein Production and Purification from CHO\u2014S Cell Stable Pools Cells from the selected stable pools were expanded in growth medium. When sufficient cell numbers had been obtained, cultures were seeded in 2 L conical flasks in a volume of 1 L of growth medium at a viable cell density of 8\u00d7105 cells/ml. Cells were then cultured in suspension at 37\u00b0 C., in 5% CO2 for three days, after which the temperature was dropped to 31\u00b0 C. for the final 7 days of production. Centrifugation was used to pellet the cells, and the resulting supernatant was filtered to generate conditioned medium. Individual recombinant proteins were purified via the 6\u00d7His tag using Ni-Excel resin (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 1.4 L of conditioned medium was loaded onto 3\u00d75 ml Ni-Excel Hi-trap columns and then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted from the columns with 7 column volumes of elution buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 400 mM imidazole). The eluted fractions were loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 column via 2\u00d710 ml injections and eluted with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2. The final fractions were collected based on their expected molecular weight. The identity of the proteins in each eluted peak was confirmed by LC-TOF-MS after deglycosylation (with N-glycanase, O-glycanase and sialidase) and reduction. ASGR-1/ASGR-2 complexes were purified by pre-incubating the ASGR-1-6\u00d7His Tag conditioned medium with ASGR-2-no 6\u00d7His Tag conditioned medium. These conditions permitted association of both proteins giving a complex that could be purified via the standard two-step Ni-Excel/SEC method. Recombinant Protein Production and Purification from E. coli E. coli codon optimized sequences were cloned into the pET21a expression plasmid. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Star (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) and individual clones were selected using carbinicillin. For expression, cells were grown in 1 L TB growth medium (supplemented with carbinicillin) in a 4 L flask at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking. When an optical density of 2 was achieved, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG (final concentration). After 4 hours of induction at 37\u00b0 C., the cell paste was harvested by centrifugation (recovering between 7 and 14 g cell paste/L culture). Protein localization into the insoluble fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Inclusion bodies were recovered from the cell paste and solubilized in 6M guanidinium containin 10 mM DTT. Successful protein refolding was established by screening a matrix of 32 conditions that included a variety of buffers, pHs, denaturants, stabilizing agents and reducing agents. The refolding procedure was initiated by rapidly diluting the dissolved inclusion bodies at a ratio of 1:15 into the appropriate refold buffer, maintaining approximately 1 mg of protein per condition. The samples were then incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 60 hours. The resulting batches were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Ion Exchange chromatography to identify the optimal refolding conditions. For the ASGR-1 (148-291), 20% glycerol, 4 mM cysteine and 4 mM cystamine. Generation of Anti-ASGR Immune Responses Mouse Strains Fully human antibodies to human ASGR were generated by immunizing XENOMOUSE\u00ae transgenic mice (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,114,598; 6,162,963; 6,833,268; 7,049,426; 7,064,244, which are incorporated herein by references in their entirety; Green et al., 1994, Nature Genetics 7:13-21; Mendez et al., 1997, Nature Genetics 15:146-156; Green and Jakobovitis, 1998, J. Ex. Med, 188:483-495; Kellerman and Green, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13, 593-597, 2002). Animals from the XMG2-K, XMG2-KL, XMG4-K and XMG4-KL strains were used for all immunizations. Mouse anti-human ASGR antibodies were generated by immunizing BALB/c, C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, San Diego, Calif.) as well as B6.12954-ASGR-1tm1Sau/SaubJxmJ (ASGR-1 KO mice) and C57BL6\u00d7129 F1 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, Calif.). Fully human, heavy chain only antibodies (HCAbs) were generated by immunizing the VH4 and 8V3 strains of transgenic Harbour mice (Janssens et al. 2006, PNAS 103:15130-15135; Harbour Biologics, Rotterdam, Netherlands). Rat anti-mouse ASGR antibodies were generated using Brown Norway Rats (Charles River Laboratories, San Diego, Calif.). Immunizations Multiple immunogens and routes of immunization were used to generate anti-human ASGR immune responses. For genetic immunizations, mice were immunized 12-14 times over 6-8 weeks using the Helios Gene Gun system according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.). Briefly, expression vectors encoding wild type human or mouse ASGR-1 (or both huASGR-1+huASGR-2, muASGR-1+muASGR-2) were coated onto gold beads (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.) and delivered to the epidermis of a shaved mouse or rat abdomen. For cell-based immunizations, mice and rats were immunized with CHO-s cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or 293-6E cells (National Resource Council of Canada) transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding human or mouse ASGR-1 (or both huASGR-1+huASGR-2, muASGR-1+muASGR-2). Animals were immunized with cells mixed with Alum prepared from aluminum potassium sulfate (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, N.J.) and CpG-ODN (Eurofins MWG Operon LLC, Huntsville, Ala.) 10 times over 6 weeks using a protocol that alternated between sub-cutaneous and intraperitoneal injections. The initial boost was comprised of 4\u00d7106 cells while subsequent boosts contained 2\u00d7106 cells. For soluble protein immunizations, mice were immunized with a variety of human ASGR recombinant proteins representing the complete extracellular domain (ECD), the carbohydrate binding domain (CBD) or the complex of ASGR-1 and ASGR-2 ECDs (Table 5.1). Animals were immunized with recombinant protein (or recombinant protein conjugated to KLH using standard methods) mixed with Alum and CpG-ODN, Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Sigma), or MPL+Adjuvant (Sigma) 10 times over 4-6 weeks using sub-cutaneous injections. The initial boost was comprised of 10 g while subsequent boosts contained 5-10 g. Human ASGR-1-specific serum titers were monitored analysis on an Accuri flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Animals with the highest antigen-specific serum titers were sacrificed and used for hybridoma generation (Kohler and Milstein, 1975). TABLE 5.1 Soluble, Recombinant Protein Antigens Used for Hybridoma Animals exhibiting suitable serum titers were identified and lymphocytes were obtained from spleen and/or draining lymphnodes. Pooled lymphocytes (from each immunization cohort) were dissociated from lymphoid tissue by grinding in a suitable medium (for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM); Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). B cells were selected and/or expanded using standard methods, and fused with a suitable fusion partner using techniques that were known in the art. Antigen Enrichment of Hybridoma Pools Fused hybridoma pools from each immune tissue harvest were used as a source of material for FACS-based enrichments using a variety of probes. To enrich for hybridomas expressing antibodies specific to native (full length, on-cell) human, cyno, mouse, rat, dog, or pig ASGR-1 (and native human ASGR-2) membranes were prepared from 293T cells transiently expressing the relevant ASGR cDNA construct. 24 hours after transfection using 293-fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.), cells were biotinylated with E-Z link NHS-LC-LC-Biotin according to the manufacturer's recommendation (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.). After biotinylation, cells were homogenized with a needle and syringe to form membrane fragments and referred to as \"membrane preps\". The biotinylated membrane preps were then used to detect hybridomas expressing surface antibodies specific to the target of interest via standard biotin-streptavidin chemistry. To enrich for hybridomas capable of binding to the recombinant ASGR-1 ECD or CBD, soluble, 6\u00d7His-tagged ASGR-1 proteins were used (Amgen). To enrich hybridoma pools for the antigen of interest, they were first incubated with the appropriate membrane prep or soluble probe. For soluble forms of ASGR-1, the recombinant protein probes were added to the hybridomas and allowed to bind. Excess probe was then washed away and the antigen-specific hybridomas were identified by simultaneous detection of surface IgG (with an Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (Gt anti-mouse Fc for transgenic mouse hybridomas)) and the soluble ASGR-1 probe via its 6\u00d7His tag (using an Amgen-derived anti-6\u00d7His monoclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa 647 via an Alexa 647 labeling kit (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc). Hybridomas expressing surface IgG and binding antigen were detected by FACS analysis on an Accuri flow cytometer. Dual positive events were sorted as single cells into 384-well plates on a FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). For native forms of ASGR-1, biotinylated membrane preps were prepared as described from 293T cells transiently expressing the appropriate antigen. After washing away unbound probe, dual positive hybridomas expressing cell surface IgG and binding antigen were detected using an Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody (to detect IgG) and streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) to detect antigen. These events were sorted as single cells into 384-well plates on a FACS Aria cell sorter. After several days of culture, the hybridoma supernatants containing monoclonal antibodies were collected and used in the screening assays described in the examples below. Example 6: Identification of ASGR-1 Specific Antibodies The following Table 6.1 summarizes the approximate numbers of antibodies assayed: Example 6-A: Initial Selection of ASGR-1 Specific Binding Antibodies TABLE 6.1 Summary of the identification and selection of huASGR-1 binding, ligand blocking antibodies. ASGR-1 (disclosed in Table 3) Hybridoma supernatants (monoclonal antibodies) were screened for binding to human ASGR-1 transiently expressed on Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells using the Cell Insight High Content Imaging Platform (ThermoFisher Scientific). Human ASGR-1 was transiently expressed on host HEK 293 cells by transfection using human ASGR-1 DNA, Gibco Opti-MEM\u00ae media and 293Fectin reagents following the protocol set out by the manufacturer. Transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the human ASGR-1, hybridoma control samples, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody and Hoechst 33342 stain were mixed and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Samples were then washed and analyzed on the CellInsight system. Supernatants were counter-screened against HEK 293 cells transfected with empty parental vector (referred to as mock). Analysis was done using irrelevant IgG antibody supernatant sample signal; hybridoma supernatant samples showing two times or greater signal over irrelevant IgG antibody sample were considered to be exhibiting ASGR-1-specific binding profiles and selected for further characterization. See Table 6.1. Example 6-B: Identification of ASGR-1 Receptor-Ligand Blocking Antibodies ASGR-1-binding hybridoma supernatants were tested for their ability to block ASGR-1 from binding ligand. Competitive binding assays were performed on the antigen specific hybridoma supernatant samples using FACS on either HEK 293 cells transiently expressing human ASGR-1 or CHO\u2014S cells stably expressing Human ASGR-1 as follows. HEK 293 cells or CHO\u2014S cells expressing human ASGR-1 were mixed with the antibody sample (hybridoma supernatants specific for ASGR-1) and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C., and then washed twice. Cells with bound sample were then incubated with precomplexed -GalNAc-PAA-Biotin (GlycoTech, Gaithersburg, Md.)/Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647-Streptavidin minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The concentration of -GalNAc-PAA-Biotin was used at the binding EC50 concentration on the specific cell line. The concentration of Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 Streptavidin was used at a 2:1 molar ratio to -GalNAc-PAA-Biotin. The 7-AAD cell viability stain was then added and the cells incubated for a further 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. Where tolerated by cell viability, FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM Calcium Chloride was used in all steps. Samples were analyzed using a BD Accuri Flow Cytometer and an Intellicyt HyperCyt Autosampler. done using irrelevant (non-ASGR-1 specific) IgG antibody supernatant control signal on both mock transfected HEK 293 cells and Human ASGR-1 transfected HEK 293 cells to determine maximum and minimum -GalNAc-PAA-Biotin binding signal. Using these maximum and minimum binding signals, the % -GalNAc-PAA-Biotin binding inhibition was determined. ASGR-1 antibodies having the ability to reduce ligand binding 60% were identified (Table 6.1), and sequenced using methods available to those skilled in the art. The sequences of unique ASGR-1-specific, ligand blocking antibodies are displayed in Table 2-7 herein. The unique ASGR-1-specific, ligand blocking antibodies were then tested for their ability to block the GalNAc ligand under more stringent conditions using a single, known antibody concentration (5 ug/ml). The receptor-ligand blocking assays were performed using 293T cells transiently expressing ASGR-1 or CHOs cells that had been stably transfected with ASGR-1. ASGR-1 antibodies having the ability to reduce ligand binding 50% were identified. See Table 6.1. Example 7: Antibody Characterization Assays A. competing antibody samples were tested for binding to ASGR-1 from other species (cynomologus monkey ASGR-1, mouse ASGR-1, rat ASGR-1, dog ASGR-1, and pig ASGR-1) as well as to human ASGR-2 in FACS binding assays at normalized antibody concentrations. For cell-based assays, HEK 293 cells expressing the appropriate antigen of interest were mixed with antibody sample or controls, incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C., and then washed twice. Cells with bound antibody were then incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody and 7-AAD viability stain for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were analyzed using a BD Accuri Flow Cytometer and an Intellicyt HyperCyt Autosampler. As a negative control, supernatants and controls were also screened against HEK 293 cells transfected with empty parental vector. Analysis was done using irrelevant (non-ASGR-1 specific) IgG antibody supernatant sample signal; hybridoma supernatant samples showing at least two times the signal over irrelevant IgG antibody sample were considered to be exhibiting ASGR-1-species specific binding profiles. For membrane-prep binding assays, ASGR-1 species specific membrane preps were used to coat LumAvidin\u00ae microspheres (beads) and tested for binding to selected hybridoma supernatants or controls. Briefly, ASGR-1 species specific membrane preps were incubated with streptavidin-coated LumAvidin\u00ae beads for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature and washed twice. Beads were resuspended in FACS buffer containing Stabilguard\u00ae. Antigen-bound beads were then incubated with normalized antibody sample for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature, washed twice, incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature, washed once and finally resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were analyzed using an Intellicyt iQue Screener Platform. FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM Calcium Chloride was used in all steps. As a negative control, supernatants and controls were also screened against a non-ASGR-1 antigen membrane prep coated on the LumAvidin\u00ae beads. Analysis was done using (non-ASGR-1 specific) IgG antibody supernatant sample signal; hybridoma supernatant samples showing at least two times the signal over irrelevant IgG antibody sample were considered to be exhibiting specific binding profiles. See Table 7.1. Human ASGR-1-specific, ligand competing hybridoma supernatant samples were screened for binding to the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC HB-8065) at normalized antibody concentrations. For FACS binding assays, HepG2 cells were mixed with normalized antibody samples or controls, incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C., and washed twice. Cells with bound antibody were then incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody and 7-AAD viability stain for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were analyzed using a BD Accuri Flow Cytometer and an Intellicyt HyperCyt Autosampler. For high content imaging binding assays, HepG2 cells were mixed with normalized antibody samples or controls, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and washed twice. Cells with bound antibody were then incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody and Hoechst 33342 stain for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed twice and analyzed on the CellInsight system. Where tolerated by cell viability, FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM Calcium Chloride was used in all steps. Analysis was done using irrelevant (non-ASGR-1 specific) IgG antibody supernatant sample signal; hybridoma supernatant samples showing two times or greater signal over irrelevant IgG antibody sample were considered to be exhibiting HepG2 ASGR-1 specific binding profiles.

Relative Binding Affinities for ASGR-Specific mAbs To assess antibody and antigen interaction strength (relative binding affinity), ASGR-1 specific, ligand competing antibody hybridoma supernatants were tested in a limiting antigen binding assay. Titrated amounts of recombinant, soluble ASGR-1 biotinylated protein was incubated with streptavidin-coated LumAvidin Beads\u00ae for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature and washed twice. Beads were resuspended in FACS buffer containing then incubated with normalized hybridoma supernatant sample or controls for 18 hours in the dark at room temperature, washed twice, incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 IgG fragment-specific detection antibody for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature, washed once and finally resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were analyzed using an Intellicyt iQue Screener Platform. FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM Calcium Chloride was used in all steps. Analysis was done using irrelevant (non-ASGR-1 specific) IgG antibody supernatant sample signal; hybridoma supernatant samples showing at least two times or greater signal over irrelevant IgG antibody sample were considered to be exhibiting ASGR-1 specific binding profiles. In this assay method, the antibody binding signal correlates with antibody affinity. Antibody binding data for a representative antigen coating concentration that fell in the linear range of the instrument signal detection is shown in Table 7.2. The degree of antibody binding to the target (ASGR-1) correlates with the measured fluorescent intensity and thus allows a relative comparison of affinities across the panel. TABLE 7.2 Limited Antigen Binding Assay to Assess Relative Affinities of selected mAbs Soluble Soluble Soluble Soluble ASGR-1 ASGR-1 and Calcium Sensitivity This Example characterizes ASGR-1 antibodies based on the effect of pH and/or calcium on their ability to bind the target. For this example, a label-free, kinetic antibody-ASGR-1 binding assay was employed to assess the sensitivity of the antibodies to changes in pH and calcium. Briefly, the ASGR-1-specific, ligand-competing antibodies were first immobilized and then allowed to bind recombinant, soluble huASGR-1 under physiological conditions (ie. pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2). The amount of binding was determined and set to 100%. In order to determine if the antibody-ASGR-1 interaction was sensitive to changes in pH or Ca, the assay buffer was then changed to conditions lacking calcium, a reduced pH (pH 5.6) or both lacking calcium and reduced pH (pH 5.6), and dissociation of ASGR-1 from the mAbs monitored. The amount of ASGR-1 remaining bound under each condition was assessed and expressed as a percent of the starting signal. If a >10% difference in ASGR-1 binding signal was calculated (when compared to that measured under physiological conditions), a particular antibody was classified as being sensitive to that condition. Using this method, the selected antibodies were classified into 5 categories: 1. affected by the removal of calcium 2. unaffected by the removal of calcium or drop in pH 3. affected when both calcium is removed and pH is dropped 4. affected by calcium removal, pH drop and both combined 5. affected by the drop in pH The relative dissociation of ASGR-1 from antibodies was measured using a label-free assay on an OctetHTX instrument (Fortebio). Antibody samples were captured on anti-HuFc kinetic biosensors (ForteBio cat #18-5064) at 5 ug/mL in buffer Tris, 0.1% Triton, NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM CaCl2, pH7.4) for three minutes. A one minute baseline stabilization step was performed in assay buffer. Soluble ASGR-1 (Amgen) at 6 ug/ml in assay buffer was added and association to the antibodies was monitored for two minutes. Subsequent dissociation of ASGR-1 from the antibodies was performed by incubating the ASGR-1-mAb complexes for 10 minutes under each of the following conditions: pH 7.4 + calcium 10 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2 pH 7.4 calcium 10 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4 pH 5.6 + calcium 10 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 5.6, 1 mM CaCl2 pH 5.6 calcium 10 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 5.6 The binding signal at the end of the 2 minute association phase for each dissociation experiment was set to 100% and used to represent the maximal level of ASGR-1 binding. After 1 minute of dissociation, the percentage of ASGR-1 remaining bound was calculated. The lower the percent remaining at a given time point indicates increased levels of dissociation in response to the test conditions (ie. different pH and/or calcium concentrations). The change in the percentage of ASGR-1 remaining bound in response to each test condition relative to the percent remaining in the control conditions (ie. pH 7.4+calcium) was determined. Cut-offs for an antibody to be categorized as being sensitive to a particular condition were set to >10% (ie. if >10% of the ASGR-1 dissociates from the antibody under a particular test condition compared to control condition, it was deemed sensitive to that condition). The analysis was done using the 1 minute dissociation time point (except for mAb 149A1 which was binned based on the 4 minute dissociation time point). Using this analysis, the ASGR-1-binding, receptor-ligand blocking antibodies were separated into groups according to their dissociation profiles in response to pH and calcium (Table 7.3). Antibodies belonging to each category were observed.

D. Relative Epitope Binning/Profiling A common way to characterize epitopes is through competition experiments. Antibodies that compete with each other can be thought of as binding the same or overlapping site on the target. This example describes a method of determining competition for binding to hASGR-1 and the results of the method when applied to a number of antibodies described herein. Binning experiments can be conducted in a number of ways, and the method employed may have an effect on the assay results. Common to these methods is that ASGR-1 is typically bound by one reference antibody and probed by another. If the reference antibody prevents the binding of the probe antibody then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The order in which the antibodies are employed is important. If antibody A is employed as the reference antibody and blocks the binding of antibody B the converse is not always true: antibody B used as the reference antibody will not necessarily block antibody A. There are a number of factors in play here: the binding of an antibody can cause conformational changes in the target which prevent the binding of the second antibody, or epitopes which overlap but do not completely occlude each other may allow for the second antibody to still have enough high-affinity interactions with the target to allow binding. In general, if competition is observed in either order the antibodies are said to bin together, and if both antibodies can block each other then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely. For this example, a modified antibody-antibody competition assay was used to determine the relative epitope binning profiles of the ASGR-1 specific, ligand blocking antibodies in a high throughput manner. Briefly, individual antibodies were tested for their ability to compete for binding with a panel of reference antibodies chosen based on their different binding characteristics (eg. species cross reactivity, HEPG2 binding, etc.) and primary sequences. The pattern of competition/binding of each test antibody with the reference antibody panel was then determined and compared to those produced from the other test antibodies. The degree of correlation between the individual test antibody competition/binding profiles was then compared. Antibodies that showed similar competition/binding profiles were binned (grouped) together (eg. Binning Profile A, B, etc.). Biotinylated recombinant soluble human ASGR-1 protein was coupled (LumAvidin Microspheres, Cat#L101-LXXX-01; Luminex Corp., Austin, Tex., U.S.A.) for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature and washed twice. The reference antibody hybridoma supernatant samples were incubated with the antigen-coated beads for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature and washed three times. Beads were resuspended in FACS buffer containing Stabilguard\u00ae. The antigen-coated, reference antibody-bound beads were pooled and then divided into individual sample wells containing a normalized (2.5 ug/ml) test antibody (hybridoma supernatant) sample (or negative control), incubated for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature and washed twice. The samples were then incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 IgG fragment-specific detection antibody for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature, washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer. FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM Calcium Chloride was used in all steps. Samples were analyzed using an Intellicyt iQue Screener Platform. To determine the antibody competition/binding profiles of the individual test antibodies, the reference-only antibody binding signal was subtracted from the reference plus test antibody signal for each competition/binding reaction (ie. across the entire reference antibody set). An individual antibody binding profile was defined as the collection of net binding values for each competition/binding reaction. The degree of similarity between individual profiles was then assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination between each of the test antibody profiles. Test antibodies showing high degrees of similarity (R20.8) to each other were then grouped into common binning profiles. Separate binning profiles were only defined if there were two or more samples with a high degree of correlation. If individual unique antibody binning profiles were observed (ie. they displayed a low degree of similarity to other test antibody binding profiles), the bin was classified as unknown. Using this method, the ASGR-1-binding, receptor-ligand blocking antibodies were sub-divided into 14 unique binning profiles (A, B, C, D, E, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T and unknown) (Table 7.4). Antibodies that displayed a unique binning profile (as defined above) but shared a relatively high degree of similarity to another profile (R2=0.6-0.8) were categorized as a sub-bin (ie. A. 1, A. 2, etc.) of that profile. TABLE 7.4 Relative Epitope Binning/Profiling T Epitope Mapping\u2014Arginine/Glutamic Acid Mutational Profiling This Example characterizes ASGR-1 antibodies based on the effect of mutagenesis of ASGR-1 on their ability to bind the target. Previous data indicated that the ASGR-1 CBD is primarily responsible for antibody binding for the panel of antibodies. As such, only the ASGR-1 CBD was considered structurally in the context of the full length ASGR-1 in the design of mutation sites. Arginine/Glutamic acid mutational mapping was used to characterize epitopes bound by human ASGR-1-specific, ligand blocking antibodies. Briefly, 144 individual point mutations were made across the CBD domain of human ASGR-1 protein (SEQ ID NO:5) starting at position 148. Ninety-one constructs, representing surface residues (modelled using the ASGR-1 crystal structure in the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.8; Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.)) and therefore potentially accessible for antibody binding, were selected for these assays. Mutant hASGR-1 variants were constructed such that non-arginine residues were changed to arginine and where wild type arginine residues were mutated to glutamic acid. Each mutant hASGR-1 sequence was then cloned into a mammalian expression vector and used to transiently transfect CHOs cells. The ability of human ASGR-1-specific, ligand competing antibodies to bind to the mutant hASGR-1 proteins was assessed by FACS as described above. Antibodies were tested for binding to the individual mutant and wild type ASGR-1 constructs using normalized antibody concentrations (5 ug/ml). CHO\u2014S cells transiently expressing the appropriate mutated or non-mutated antigen of interest were mixed with antibody sample or controls, incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C., and then washed twice. Cells with bound antibody were then incubated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 IgG Fc fragment-specific detection antibody and 7-AAD viability stain for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were analyzed using a BD Accuri Flow Cytometer and an Intellicyt HyperCyt Autosampler. As a negative control, supernatants and controls were also screened against CHO\u2014S cells transfected with empty parental vector (referred to as mock). In order to exclude mutants that were poorly expressed or produced mis-folded antigen, only constructs that yielded a binding data average of at least 25% or greater compared to the average binding observed on wildtype hASGR-1 was used for further analysis. Because mutant hASGR-1 expression levels varied relative to each other, sample binding data for each construct was normalized for expression by dividing the binding data from an antibody not affected by the mutations (e.g., 65C12) by the binding values of each test antibody on a given mutant construct. Also, because the antibody binding affinities varied amongst the samples, the expression corrected data (above) was further normalized by comparing test antibody binding on each mutant construct to wild type hASGR-1. Identification of specific mutations that affected test antibody binding was performed by an interquartile range (IQR) analysis to determine statistical outliers. A mutation was identified as a \"hit\" if the calculated values were 3\u00d7 the IQR (above the 3rd quartile/upper fence) for a given mutant construct. Although IQR analysis was used here to determine significance and identify hits, one skilled in the art will recognize that a number of methods could be employed in order to normalize the data (eg. using epitope-tagged constructs or other ASGR-1-binding antibodies directed against non-CBD epitopes). Any statistically significant reduction in antibody binding signal to a mutant construct (compared to that determined for binding to wild type ASGR-1) determined by these methods could be used for hit identification. For illustrative purposes, Table 7.5 shows the IQR analysis with a single mutant construct (i.e., H203). TABLE 7.5 IQR analysis (representative data for construct H203) Antibody Binding Expression Normalization to FACS Binding 60D2, 59F2, 60E8, and 65E9 in Table 7.5 represent the statistically significant hits (i.e., 3\u00d7 the IQR) whose binding was affected by mutations H203. A summary of the hASGR-1 residues important for binding of the representative antibodies is shown in (FIG. 60, labeled as Table 7.6 in the figure). In addition, this analysis revealed that the mutation of some ASGR-1 residues had more dramatic effects on a given antibody binding than others. This likely reflects the relative contribution or importance that these residues have in mediating interactions with specific test antibodies. The degree by which each mutation impacted the ability of a test antibody to bind was determined by calculating the magnitude of an individual binding data point above the upper gate determined by each IQR analysis. The relative impact of each mutation on the binding of a given test antibody was then ranked using this method and displayed as a heatmap in FIG. 60. Dark grey shading indicates the data point deviated dramatically from the upper gate (ie. a large effect on antibody binding), while light grey/white shading indicates the data point was very close to the cut offs (ie. 3\u00d7 the IQR) (FIG. 60). When aligned with the relative epitope profiling bin assignments (Example 7D above), this analysis reveals a set of core ASGR-1 amino acid positions that, when mutated, disrupt test antibody binding. As such, these positions are likely part of the ASGR-1 epitopes bound by the selected antibodies. These amino acid residues either directly contact or are involved in the interaction with the antibody, or are in close enough proximity that, when mutated, interfere with antibody binding. Amino acid positions identified as statistically significant hits, but barely made the cut offs, and map to surface ASGR-1 locations distinct from the main epitope bins (FIG. 47) may represent residues that, when mutated, disrupt the conformation of ASGR-1 such that an antibody that binds to a distinct epitope is affected (ie. an indirect effect). mAb 197G3 is an example of an antibody displaying a range of binding sensitivities in this assay, yet the most important residues (R274 and R271) can be identified by rank ordering them as described. In order to compare the mutational hit patterns of the individual test antibodies with each other, the coefficient of determination between the test antibodies was determined. The expression and antibody binding normalized data set was used to generate binding profiles for each test antibody across the mutant panel. The resulting profiles for each individual test antibody were then compared for their degree of similarity to all of the other test antibodies. The coefficient of determination (R2) for each combination was determined and converted into a heat map in order to visualize the resulting patterns (FIG. 46). For simplicity, a representative antibody from each unique mutational profile (Reference Antibody) is shown in FIG. 46. This analysis revealed 7 predominant hit patterns or mutational clusters. Test antibodies affected by the 7 predominant mutational clusters correspond to those from competition/binding binning profiles A, B, C, E and L (3 distinct hit/mutational clusters of bin A antibodies and 1 distinct hit/mutational cluster of bin B, bin C, bin E and bin L antibodies). The remaining antibodies, categorized as displaying separate binning profiles (compared to bins A, B, C, E and L), are affected by distinct mutations in ASGR-1, but also include residues that partially overlap with test antibodies belonging to the predominant bins. This data indicates the selected antibodies bind to epitopes that partially overlap with the 7 predominant epitope regions. The residues important for the binding of antibodies belonging to the 7 predominant epitope regions were then mapped onto a computer representation of the surface of the ASGR-1 structure using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.8; Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.) (FIG. 47). A residue on the surface of ASGR-1 was considered part of the same epitope region if at least one antibody from a distinct binning profile (ie. A, B, C, E and L) was identified as being sensitive to mutation. For example, the predominant epitope region for antibodies belonging to binning profile C binding of antibody 147E9 is affected by mutation of all of these residues, while antibody 184E7 is only disrupted by mutation of P241, D243 and E253. Thus, the predominant epitope region of ASGR-1 bound by antibodies belonging to binning profile C is defined as including one or more of (but not limited to) P241, D242, D243, Y245, G251 and note that the antibody 194A4 was classified as belonging to Bin C as determined in Example 7D, however, the results of this arginine/glutamic acid mutational profiling (as well as the results from crystal structure analysis of the ASGR-1 CBD/194A4 complex described in Example 10H) suggests that the relative epitope profiling may have been inaccurate. Antibodies belonging to binning profile A were further sub-divided into 3 distinct mutational clusters. These clusters mapped to ASGR-1 surface positions that overlap with, or are in extremely close physical proximity to, each other consistent with a common binning profile. Antibodies that displayed binning profiles distinct from the 5 major bins (i.e., A, B, C, E and L) also showed distinct patterns of mutations that affected their binding (FIG. 46). Some binning profiles (R, O, M, M. 1 and T) share significant overlap with antibodies from binning profile L, and can be considered sub-bins of this profile. Taken together, this data indicates that antibodies capable of blocking ASGR-1-ligand interactions bind to 5 major epitope regions. In addition, blocking antibodies were identified that bind to partially overlapping epitopes of these major regions. Example 8: ASGR Internalization Assay To determine whether the antibodies bind and also prevent internalization of ASGR-1 into cells expressing ASGR-1, an in vitro internalization assay is performed of various antibody samples. Human ASGR-1 Internalization Cellular Imaging Assay #165305 was use on cells U2OS Cell Plating and Culturing: U2OS cells were grown to 75-85% confluence in T175 before plating into a 96 well plate. 1. The U2OS culture medium was aspirated off the cells in the T175 flask 2. Cells were washed with 10 mls of DPBS and aspirated off 3. 3 mls of Cell Dissociation Buffer was added to the cells and incubated for 5 minutes inside a cell incubator (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2) to detach the cells from the T175 flask. 4. The detached cells were diluted with 7 mls of the growth medium 5. 1 ml of cells were used to count the number of cells available to plate 6. The cells were diluted in growth medium to give a final concentration of 28,000 cells/well and BacMam virus (huASGR-1: GS: SNAP26f) was also added to the cells at this time with the desired concentration (MOI). 7. The cells were mixed together with the BacMam virus for 1-2 minutes and then plated on the 96 well imaging plate at a volume of 100 ul/well. 8. The plate was placed inside an incubator (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2) for 16-20 hours before treatment. Treatment of Cells (16-20 Hours Incubation) 1. The next day, the medium on the 96 well plate was dumped out and washed once with DPBS. 2. McCoy's 5A Medium plus 10 mM of Hepes buffer (assay buffer) was added to the cells (100 ul) for 1 hour inside the incubator. 3. After the 1 hour incubation, the medium was dumped out and washed once with DPBS containing Ca and Mg. 4. Pitstop2 and Pitstop2 negative control were prepared in assay buffer at 20 uM. 5. Volume of 100 ul per well of the inhibitors were added to the U2OS cells for 15 minutes inside the incubator. 6. GalNAc-biotin (100 nM) and strepavidin-Alexa633 (100 nM) were pre-mixed in assay buffer and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. 7. SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 546 (2.5 uM) was prepared in assay buffer. 8. After the 15 minutes incubation, both GalNAc-biotin-strepavidin-Alexa633 and SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 546 were directly added (10 ul) to the medium containing Pitstop2 inhibitors for 30 minutes inside the incubator. 9. After the 30 minutes incubation, medium was dumped out and the cells were washed once with DPBS. 10. The cells were fixed by adding 50 ul of 4% Paraformaldehyde (8% paraformaldehyde was diluted with DPBS) containing Hoechst dye (1:5000 dilution) to the cells for 10 minutes at room temperature. 11. After 10 minutes incubation, the cells were washed twice with DPBS and 100 ul of DPBS was added to each well. 12. The plate was imaged on the Operetta instrument with three channels measuring the different fluorescence dyes. 1) Hoechst was measured using filters in the range of excitation: 360-400 nm and emission: 410-480 nm 2) GalNAc-biotin-strepavidin-Alexa633 excitation: 600-630 nm and emission: 640-680 nm 3) SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 546 was measured using filters in the range of excitation: 520-550 nm and emission: 560-630 13. Harmony 3.5 software (Perkin Elmer) was used to identify and quantify internalized spots for fluorescence dyes added in the assay. This internalization assay can be performed to assay the antigen binding proteins of the invention to determine how much they reduce or inhibit internalization of ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2. Example A. Asialofetuin Bovine fetuin (AHSG) was obtained commercially (Sigma) and purified using a CaptoQ Impres (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) matrix. Briefly, the material was loaded in 25 mM TRIS pH 7.9 at up to 17 mg/ml resin, resolved in 20 mM BisTRIS (pH6.5) with a gradient of sodium chloride. The main peak was gradient pooled (0.15M NaCl final) and resolved on a SuperDex200 SEC (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.9). The purified AHSG was then concentrated and incubated with Innolink Biotin 354S (EMD Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylated protein was then desalted by gel filtration and concentrated once again. The purified, biotinylated protein was subsequently desialated by incubation with C. perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma; 1 unit/10 mg protein for 12 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 9 mM HEPES, 0.12M NaCl, pH6). The resulting material was harvested and digested for an additional 3 hours with A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (QAbio; 0.5 units/10 mg protein at 37\u00b0 C.). The digested sample was diluted 3 fold with 20 mM HEPES containing 0.15M NaCl (pH 7.5) (HBS) to neutral pH and applied to a monomeric Avidin agarose (Pierce) HR16/10 column, run at 60 cm/hour. The loaded column was held for 15 minutes then washed with four column volumes of HBS. The biotinylated, desialated protein was finally eluted with three column volumes of HBS containing 2 mM Biotin plus an additional two column volumes of 0.1M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.8), which was immediately neutralized during collection with 50 mM TRIS Base). Protein-containing fractions from both types of elutions were identified, pooled, concentrated, dialyzed extensively against 10 mM HEPES, 0.14M NaCl (pH 7.5), re-concentrated and finally filtered sterilized. The purified lots were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry prior to use in the described assays. B. Orosomucoid Bovine orosomucoid (AGP) was obtained commercially (Sigma) and purified over SuperDex200 resin equilibrated in HBS (pH7.9) by size exclusion chromatography. The front of the main AGP peak was combined from 3 individual runs to generate hyperglycosylated AGP, with the remainder of the main peaks (from the 3 combined runs) to generate hypoglycosylated AGP. For biotinylation, the purified AGP was mg/ml and incubated with Innolink Biotin 354S as described. The biotinylated protein was then desalted by gel filtration and concentrated. After biotinylation, the protein was desialated by incubating it for 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with one unit of C. perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma) per 10 mg protein in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 9 mM HEPES, 0.12M NaCl (pH6). The resulting material was harvested and digested for an additional 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with 0.5 units A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (QAbio) per 10 mg protein. The sample was diluted 3 fold with HBS to achieve a neutral pH and applied to a monomeric Avidin agarose (Pierce) HR16/10 column, run at 60 cm/hour. The loaded column was held for 15 minutes and then washed with four column volumes of HBS. The biotinylated, desialated protein was subsequently eluted with three column volumes of HBS containing 2 mM Biotin, plus two column volumes 0.1M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.8), which was immediately neutralized during collection with 50 mM TRIS Base. Protein-containing fractions from both types of elutions were identified, pooled, concentrated, dialyzed extensively against 10 mM HEPES, 0.14M NaCl (pH 7.5), re-concentrated and finally filtered sterilized. The purified lots were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry prior to use in the described assays. These ligands can be used in additional ligand binding assays to determine antigen binding protein inhibition of ligand binding to ASGR, ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2. Example Crystal Stucture Analysis of Interaction Between Ligands and ASGR-1 and Antibodies and ASGR-1 A. Crystal Structures of ASGR-1 Carbohydrate Binding Domain with Ligand Bound Introduction The crystal structure of ligand free ASGR-1 CBD (carbohydrate binding domain) has been previously described (1). Protein expression of ASGR-1 CBD (SEQ ID NO:5), purification and crystallization was performed similar to the published method, however the structures described here differ from the published crystal structure. Analysis of these structures shows extra N- and C-terminal amino acids compared to the published structure, how various ligands interact with the ASGR-1 carbohydrate binding domain, and possible selectivity determinants between ASGR-1/ASGR-2 for various saccharides. Results Lactose Binds in the Carbohydrate Binding Pocket of ASGR-1 Protein crystals of the ASGR-1/Lactose complex were grown and the crystal structure was determined at 2.05 . Although a method similar to that of the published structure was followed, clear electron density is present for the lactose disaccharide in the carbohydrate binding pocket. See FIGS. 18A and 18B. In this structure, the galactose ring of the lactose disaccharide sits on top of the calcium ion at the carbohydrate binding domain and forms the majority of the contacts with the ASGR-1 protein. Hydrogen bonds are formed between lactose and ASGR-1 amino acids Q240, D242, E253, and N265. Additionally, van der Waals interactions are formed with at least W244 (SEQ ID NO:5). See FIG. 18C. Analysis of the crystal structure identifies specific amino acids involved in the interaction between ASGR-1 and lactose. Interacting with at least these amino acids by an alternate molecule can completely or partially affect the interaction between ASGR-1 and lactose. ASGR-1/Lactose Analysis (Distances Below were Calculated with PyMOL): Amino acids with at least one non-hydrogen atom 4.5 or less to the bound lactose molecule were identified with at least one non-hydrogen atom 5 or less to the bound lactose molecule were identified at least one non-hydrogen atom 5-8 from the bound lactose molecule the Carbohydrate Binding Pocket of ASGR-1 Similar to Lactose Protein crystals of the ASGR-1/Galactose complex were grown and the crystal structure was determined at 2.4 . Although a method similar to that of the published structure was followed, clear electron density is present for the galactose saccharide in the carbohydrate binding domain. See FIGS. 19A and 19B. In this structure, galactose sits on top of the calcium ion at the carbohydrate binding site and forms contacts with the ASGR-1 protein. Hydrogen bonds are formed between galactose and ASGR-1 acids Q240, D242, ID NO:5). Additionally, van der Waals interactions are formed with at least W244. See FIG. 19C. Analysis of the crystal structure identifies specific amino acids involved in the interaction between ASGR-1 and galactose. Interacting with at least these amino acids by an alternate molecule may completely or partially affect the interaction between ASGR-1 and galactose. Distances below were calculated with PyMOL. ASGR-1/Galactose Analysis (Distances Below were Calculated with PyMOL): Amino acids with at least one non-hydrogen atom 4.5 or less to the bound galactose molecule with at least one non-hydrogen atom 5 or less to the bound lactose molecule were identified at least one non-hydrogen atom 5-8 from the bound lactose molecule structures, the galactose rings of each saccharide superimpose very well. One difference in the proteins in the two structures is the conformation of R237, an amino acid in close proximity to the carbohydrate binding site. In the superimposition shown in FIG. 20, the ASGR-1/Lactose structure is shown in white and the ASGR-1/Galactose structure is shown in black. N-Acetyl-D-Galactosamine (GalNAc) Binds in the Carbohydrate Binding Pocket of ASGR-1 Similar to Galactose, Buts Forms Additional Interactions Protein crystals of the ASGR-1/GalNAc complex were grown and the crystal structure was determined at 2.2 . Although a method similar to that of the published structure was followed, clear electron density is present for the GalNAc saccharide in the carbohydrate binding pocket. See FIG. 21A and FIG. 21B. In this structure, GalNAc sits on top of the calcium ion at the carbohydrate binding site and forms contacts with the ASGR-1 protein. Hydrogen bonds are formed between GalNAc and ASGR-1 amino acids Q240, D242, E253, and N265. Additionally, van der Waals interactions are formed with at least W244. In this structure, R237 is in a similar conformation as observed in the galactose complex. However, in this case hydrogen bonds are formed between R237 and the acetyl of GalNAc. These additional interactions with R237 help explain both the observed tighter binding of GalNAc (than galactose) to ASGR-1, and the tighter binding to GalNAc to ASGR-1 (than ASGR-2, in which this amino acid is Ala rather than Arg). See FIG. 21C ASGR-1/GalNAc Analysis (Distances were Calculated with PyMOL): Analysis of the crystal structure identifies specific amino acids involved in the interaction between ASGR-1 and GalNAc. Interacting with at least one of these amino acids by an alternate molecule may completely or partially inhibit the interaction between ASGR-1 and GalNAc. Amino acids with at least one atom 4.5 or less to the bound GalNAc molecule were with at least one non-hydrogen atom 5 or less to the bound lactose molecule were identified at least one non-hydrogen atom 5-8 from the bound lactose molecule the ASGR-1 CBD/GalNAc crystal structure complex are presented in Table 10.1. Methods ASGR-1 Expression and Purification For all crystallography experiments in Example 12, Human ASGR-1 CBD protein (SEQ ID NO:5) was expressed in E. coli and refolded and purified. ASGR-1 Crystallization Purified human was concentrated to 8-12 mg/ml. ASGR-1/carbohydrate complex crystals grow in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.8, 0.08 M ammonium sulfate, 21-23% PEG 8000 in the presence of 20 mM ligand (lactose, galactose or GalNAc). Data Collection and Structure Determination Datasets for ASGR-1 CBD complexes were collected on a Rigaku FR-E X-ray source (ASGR-1/Lactose and ASGR-1/Galactose) or at Berkeley Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.2 (ASGR-1/GalNAc). All datasets were processed with iMosflm(2) with AIMLESS(3) from the CCP4 program suite(4). ASGR-1/Lactose crystals grow in the C2 space with unit cell dimensions a=113.5, b=32.3, c=40.4 , =92.3\u00b0 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.05 resolution. The ASGR-1 structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER(5) using the published ASGR-1 structure(1) as the starting search model. The structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Coot(6) and refinement with PHENIX(7). The refined structure has R=18.9 and Rfree=24.4. ASGR-1/Galactose crystals grow in the C2 space with unit cell dimensions a=113.1, b=32.7, c=40.7 , =91.6\u00b0 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.4 resolution. The ASGR-1/Lactose structure was used as the starting molecule for molecular replacement, and model building and refinement were performed as described for the ASGR-1/Lactose complex to R=15.8 and Rfree=22.9. ASGR-1/GalNAc crystals grow in the C2 space with unit cell dimensions a=112.7, b=32.3, c=40.5 , =91.7\u00b0 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.2 resolution. The ASGR-1/Lactose structure was used as the starting molecule for molecular replacement, and model building and refinement were performed as described for the ASGR-1/Lactose complex to R=16.5 and Rfree=23.0. Structure analysis and distance calculations were performed with the program PyMOL(8). References - 1. Meier, M., Bider, M. D., Malashkevich, V. N., Spiess, M., and Burkhard, P.

Crystal Structure of ASGR-1 Carbohydrate Binding Domain (CBD) with 5E5 The present example presents the crystal structure of the ASGR-1 CBD bound to the Fab fragment of 5E5, determined to 1.95 resolution (the conditions for which are described in the below). This structure, depicted in FIGS. 22A&B, shows that when 5E5 binds to/interacts with ASGR-1, a conformational rearrangement of the carbohydrate binding loop occurs, impairing the carbohydrate binding loop from binding to/interacting with ligand (i.e., carbohydrates). This demonstrates that the 5E5 Fab indirectly inhibits the ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand binding. The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core ASGR amino acid residues for the interaction interface of 5E5 with ASGR-1. This was defined as residues that are within 5 of the 5E5 protein. The core residues were also used to identify boundary ASGR-1 amino acid residues for the interaction interface with 5E5. These residues were ASGR-1 residues that were from 5-8 of the 5E5 protein. The boundary amino acid residues of the interaction interface with ASGR-1 were defined as 5E5 residues that are within 5 of the ASGR-1 protein. The core 5E5 residues of the interaction interface with ASGR-1 were defined as 5E5 residues that are 5-8 from the ASGR-1 protein. The Purification of Protein Samples The 5E5 Fab fragment was generated by cleaving the 5E5 mAb with caspase 3. Post caspase cleavage, the Fab was isolated by purification on a MonoS ion exchange column. Ni Sepharose Excel subtraction was then performed to ensure the Fc domain was removed from the sample. 5E5 ASGR-1 CBD/5E5 Fab complex was made by mixing a molar excess of ASGR-1 CBD with 5E5 Fab. The complex was separated from excess ASGR-1 by purification on a size exclusion chromatography column. The ASGR-1 CBD/5E5 Fab complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and crystallizes in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 12% PEG 4000. Data Collection and Structure Determination The dataset for the ASGR-1 CBD/5E5 Fab complex crystal was collected on beamline 5.0.2 at the Berkeley synchrotron and processed with Mosflm1/Aimless2. ASGR-1 CBD/5E5 Fab complex crystals grow in the P21 space group with unit cell dimensions a=62.93, b=41.75, c=118.89 and =97.16 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 1.95 resolution. The ASGR-1 CBD/5E5 Fab complex structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Molrep2. The structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Coot3 and refinement with Phenix4, to a final R=25.9/Rfree=30.5. While the electron density for the ASGR-1 CBD and 5E5 Fab variable domain (along with the corresponding interface) is quite good, the electron density for the 5E5 constant domain is poor (most likely due to poor packing within the crystal lattice). This likely explains the higher R/Rfree observed from this structure refinement. Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as being all amino acid residues with at least one non-hydrogen atom less than or equal to 5 from the partner protein. 5 was chosen as the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms within a van der Waals radius plus a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids were determined as all amino acid residues with at least one non-hydrogen atom less than or equal to 8 from the partner protein but not included in the core interaction list. Less than or equal to 8 was chosen as the boundary region cutoff distance to allow for the length of an extended arginine amino acid. Amino acids that met these distance criteria were calculated with the program PyMOL5. References - 1. Battye, T. G., Kontogiannis, L., Johnson, O., Powell, H. R. & Leslie, A.

Crystal Structure of ASGR-1 Carbohydrate Binding Domain (CBD) with 22G5 The present example presents the crystal structure of the ASGR-1 CBD bound to the Fab fragment of 22G5, determined to 2.1 resolution (the conditions of which are described above in B). This structure, depicted in FIGS. 23A&B, shows that when 22G5 binds to/interacts with ASGR-1, a conformational rearrangement of the carbohydrate binding loop occurs, impairing the carbohydrate binding loop from binding to/interacting with ligand (i.e., carbohydrates). This demonstrates that the 22G5 Fab indirectly inhibits the ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand binding. The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core ASGR amino acid residues for the interaction interface of 22G5 with ASGR-1. This was defined as residues that are within 5 of the 22G5 protein. The core residues were also used to identify boundary ASGR-1 amino acid residues for the interaction interface with 22G5. These residues were ASGR-1 residues that were from 5-8 of the 22G5 protein. The boundary amino acid residues of the interaction interface with ASGR-1 were defined as 22G5 residues that are within 5 of the ASGR-1 protein. The core 22G5 residues of the interaction interface with ASGR-1 were defined as 22G5 residues that are 5-8 from the ASGR-1 protein. The were followed as described above in Example 10B except for the following changes: The 22G5 Fab fragment was generated by cleaving the 22G5-IgG4 mAb with papain; The ASGR-1 CBD/22G5 Fab complex was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and crystallized in 0.1 Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.2 sodium malonate, 20% PEG 3350; The dataset was processed with XDS/Aimless; ASGR-1 CBD/22G5 Fab complex crystals grow in the P212121 space group with unit cell dimensions a=46.04, b=80.34, c=169.14 with one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.1 resolution; and The structure was improved with multiple rounds of model building with Coot3 and refinement with Phenix4, to a final R=17.8/Rfree=22.5. D. Crystal Structure of ASGR-1 Carbohydrate Binding Domain (CBD) with 4A2 The present example presents the crystal structure of the ASGR-1 CBD bound to the Fab fragment of 4A2, determined to 2.15 resolution (the conditions of which are described above in section B of this Example). This structure, depicted in FIGS. 24, 25 and 26, shows that when 4A2 binds to/interacts with ASGR-1, a conformational rearrangement of the carbohydrate binding loop occurs, impairing the carbohydrate binding loop from binding to/interacting with ligand (i.e., carbohydrates). This demonstrates that the 4A2 Fab indirectly inhibits the ASGR-1 CBD/Ligand binding. The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core ASGR amino acid residues for the interaction interface of 4A2 with ASGR-1.

Interaction Between GalNAc, ASGR-1 and Certain Antibodies The structure of the 72G9/ASGR-1 complex (Item G above) was overlaid on the ASGR-1/ligand (GalNac) structure (Item A above) and the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 31B. The structure of the 54E9/ASGR-1 complex (Item I above) was also overlaid on the ASGR-1/ligand (GalNac) structure (Item A above) and the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 35B. The structure of the 218G4/ASGR-1 complex (Item J above) was overlaid on the ASGR-1/ligand (GalNac) structure (Item A above) and the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 38. The structure of the 176H4/ASGR-1 complex (Item K above) was overlaid on the ASGR-1/ligand (GalNac) structure (Item A above) and the result of this combination is depicted in FIG. 40. These figures demonstrate areas on ASGR-1 which can be usefully targeted to inhibit ASGR-1 interaction with a ligand, e.g., GalNac. These figures show that 72G9, 54E9, 218G4 and 176H4 directly interact with a subset of amino acid residues that are specifically involved in binding to the ligand (e.g., GalNAc). As noted above, analysis of the crystal structures identified specific amino acids involved in the interaction between ASGR-1 and the partner proteins (the core and boundary regions of the interface on the ASGR-1 surface) and the spatial requirements of these partner proteins to interact with ASGR-1. The structures suggest ways to inhibit the interaction between ASGR-1 and a ligand, GalNAc. First, as noted above, binding an agent to ASGR-1 where it shares residues in common with the binding site of a ligand such as GalNAc would inhibit the interaction between ASGR-1 and the ligand. Second, an agent that binds outside of the residues in common can sterically interfere with the ligand that are either N- or C-terminal to the ligand to prevent the interaction between ASGR-1 and a ligand. In some embodiments, the residues that are involved in both ligand binding and are close to the areas where the above noted antigen binding proteins bind are especially useful for manipulating ASGR-1 binding to ligand. For example, amino acid residues from interfaces in common in both the core region and boundary region for the different binding partners are listed in Table 10.5 below. TABLE 10.5 Parameters Amino acid position(s) 72G9/GalNAc both under As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins bind to and/or block at least one of the above noted residues. Antigen binding proteins and molecules that interact with the relevant areas or residues of the structure of ASGR-1 (including those areas or residues within 15, 15-8, 8, 8-5, 5, or fewer angstroms from where ligands, such as GalNAc, or the antibodies, interact with ASGR-1) depicted in the figures (e.g., FIGS. 19-42) and/or their corresponding positions on the structures from the coordinates are also contemplated. Example 11: Determination of the Binding Affinity of ASGR-1 Specific Antibodies To quantitate the binding affinity of specific antibodies for ASGR-1 (either purified from hybridoma supernatants or made recombinantly), association and dissociation rates can be measured using a ForteBio Octet instrument. The antibodies were covalently coupled to AR2G tips to load levels close to 2 nm and then bound to the soluble human ASGR-1 carbohydrate binding domain (CBD; amino acid residues 154-281; N-terminal 6\u00d7His tag) in a 3-fold serial dilution series starting typically at 30 nM with either 3-point or 6-point dilution series. Experimental kinetic results were globally fit to a 1:1 binding model in order to determine the association and dissociation rate constants as well as the equilibrium dissociation constant. Association and dissociation times were chosen to ensure that curvature was present during association curves and measured dissociation levels dropped at least 5% from starting levels. All Octet buffers contained 10 mM Tris (pH7.5), 150 run at 27\u00b0 C. Because this assay only measures binding to the ASGR-1 CBD, antibodies that recognize epitopes partially or entirely outside the CBD and/or recognize ASGR-1 in the context of a native ASGR complex, for example, as could occur on cell membranes, may not score as positive in this assay. Data provided for representative antibodies in TABLE 11.1. Example 12: CHO\u2014S:huASGR-1 Cell Binding Assay TABLE 11.1 Octet Octet 3.5 CHO\u2014S stable high-expressing cell line were developed for both human ASGR-1 as well as mouse ASGR-1. A typical 384 well plate multiplex flow cytometery-based cell binding method is described as followed: Parental CHO\u2014S cells and CHO\u2014S:huASGR-1 cells were respectively labeled using a CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (ThermoFisher Catalog #C34554) and CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation Kit (ThermoFisher Catalog#C34557) CHO\u2014S:muASGR-1 were not labeled. 20 ul of cells at 4 C were added to duplicate wells of the 384 well plate. The cells were equally mixed from all three cell lines (30K cells/well). Then 20 ul of the ASGR-1 antibodies (either purified from hybridoma supernatants or made recombinantly) were added in an 11-point dose response using a 1:2 fold serial dilution starting at 100 nM. The cells and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at 4 C and then spun down and washed twice with FACS buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2. 30 ul of anti-huIgG-APC secondary antibodies were then added at a 1:1000 dilution) for 30 min at 4 C and then washed once with the same buffer. 60 ul of PI (1:1000) was added and then the cells were read by a core flow cytometry facility. The cells were gated first for live cells, then for single cells and finally for the cell dyes to separate the mixed cells into the three different cell populations. Histograms of signal vs count representing the binding profile of each antibody at each antibody concentration were automatically analyzed for the median of the binding signal and then a binding graph was made with log 10 antibody concentration in nM on the X axis with standard deviation of the median signals from the duplicate wells on the Y-axis. The binding curves were fit with a standard four parameter sigmoidal binding curve and EC50's reported for all graphs with full curves. Data provided for representative antibodies in TABLE12.1. TABLE 12.1 Cell binding Cell binding Ab name EC50 (nM) Ab name cells expressing C-terminal His-tagged human ASGR-2 were resuspended in cold flow buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 2% fetal bovine serum) and 1.5\u00d710e6 cells per well were added to a 96-well, v-bottom plate in a volume of 80 ul. 80 ul of antibody at 400 nM was then added to each well. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 3 min and then washed twice in cold flow buffer. The cells were then resuspended in 120 ul of anti-human IgG-APC (diluted 1:1000 in flow buffer) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes, centrifuged and washed twice as before, and resuspended in 200 ul cold flow buffer, and then analyzed on a BD-LSR II flow cytometer. Data provided for antibody 7F4 in FIG. 43. Example 13: CHO\u2014S:huASGR-1 Ligand Blocking Assay All ASGR-1 antibodies that bound either human or mouse ASGR-1 stable CHO\u2014S cells were then tested for ligand blocking using both a protein ligand and a synthetic sugar ligand. The method in brief is as follows: first, 20 ul of either CHO-Shuman or mouse ASGR-1 cells were added to wells of a 384 well plate (30 k cells/well) followed by spin and discarding the supernatant. Second, 10 ul of the antibodies (either purified from hybridoma supernatants or made recombinantly) were added in duplicate to the cells in a dilution series (200 nM top concentration, 1:2 serial dilution, 11 point curve) and were incubated for 30 min at 4 C. Third, 10 ul of the minimally biotinylated ligands were added at 2\u00d7 their binding EC05, so that the wells contained a final 20 ul volume with Ab starting at 100 nM and the ligand at their EC50. After 30 min incubation at 4 C, the plate was spun and washed twice with FACS buffer+1 mM CaCl2 followed by the detection streptavidin-AF647 at 1:1000 dilution. After 30 min at 4 C, the cells were spun and washed once and then 60 ul PI added at 1:1000 dilution and the plates delivered to a core flow cytometry facility. The plates were read and processed similarly to the cell binding method except the signal now represents an inhibition curve and typically decreases a function of increasing antibody concentration. IC50 nM potency and % Inhibition were Example biotinylated GALNAc-PAA were used as ligands with measured binding EC50s of 10.7 and 5.4 nM. Differences in the ability of antibodies to block these two ligands could occur as a result of differences in, for example, avidity stemming from differences in the number and/or orientation of the ASGR binding terminal sugar residues of each ligand, steric hindrance between antibody and each ligand, and/or changes in the conformation of ASGR induced by antibody binding that selectively alters the binding of each ligand.

See for example, ASGR-1 specific antibody sequences in Tables 6 and 7. Certain high risk motifs included: (1) CDR 'NG' CDR3 tryptohphans prone to oxidation. Bioinformatics and structural analyses were used to identify substitutions likely to retain binding affinity to the ASGR-1 CBD. Typically, substitution identities were derived from from sequence-related ASGR-1 CBD-binding mAbs. These substitutions modeled into a homology model of the unbound mAb using the software MOE (CCG)1 to predict structural fitness. For cases in which the bioinformatics or structural analyses did not provide a clear substitution identity, residue types chemically similar to the parent residue were identified. Variable domain sequence motifs violating multiple sequence alignment-based pair-wise residue covariance trends2 were also engineered out of ASGR-1 specific antibodies. Substitution identities for covariance violators were identified using a hybrid bioinformatics/structural approach similar to that used to remediate degradation sites.

Method of Correlated Mutational Analysis to Improve Therapeutic Antibodies. US Patent Application PCT/US2012/028596 filed Mar. 9, 2012. Custom peptide microarrays were obtained commercially (PEPperPRINT GmbH). For epitope mapping using linear arrays, the antigen (ASGR-1) was translated into 291 different overlapping 15 amino acid (aa) peptides printed in duplicate (582 peptide spots per array copy). For epitope mapping using cyclized arrays, the antigen (ASGR-1) was translated into 888 different overlapping 7 aa, 10 aa and 13 aa peptides printed in duplicate (1,776 peptide spots per array copy). Peptide cyclization was accomplished using N- to C-terminal thioether formation with and without an additional scaffold for varying conformational restriction. Each PEPperCHIP\u00ae Peptide array is framed by Flag (DYKDDDDKAS) and HA (YPYDVPDYAG) control peptides. Assay buffer was PBS-T (PBS, pH7.4, 0.05% Tween 20), blocking buffer was Immunochemicals), staining buffer was assay antibody was goat anti-human Control antibodies were anti-FLAG M2 DyLight800, anti-HA DyLight680. Arrays were scanned on Li-Cor Odyssey with an offset of 0.65 mm, 21 um resolution. Array staining and detection was per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, arrays were pre-stained with secondary antibodies for 30 minutes, washed and scanned to detect background binding. Arrays were then stained with commercially available primary antibodies overnight, followed by washing and 30 minute incubation with labeled secondary antibodies. Arrays were scanned to detect binding of anti-ASGR-1 antibodies. Finally, arrays were stained with control antibodies for 45 minutes prior to washing and scanning to detect control peptides. Antigen binding proteins with desired binding properties can be identified using this assay. Example 16: In Vivo Studies RNAi constructs that reduce expression of ASGR-1 and/or ASGR-2 and/or antigen binding proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, that inhibit ligand binding to ASGR, ASGR-1, and/or ASGR-2 in vitro can be administered in vivo to a relevant animal model and levels and/or activity of endogenous blood proteins like alkaline phosphatase measured. In addition, the clearance of exogenously administered ASGR ligands (for example asialoglycoproteins, certain non-asialylated proteins, synthetic ligands, etc.) can be inhibited by pre-treatment with RNAi or a co- or pre-administered antibody. Additionally, physiologic effects of the antigen binding proteins or RNAi can be evaluated in relevant animal models of cardiovascular disease using readouts including blood pressure, primary and secondary hemostasis, heart function and morphology, endothelial function, LDL cholesterol levels, non-HDL cholesterol levels, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Example 17: Effect of ASGR-1 Antibody 4A2 on Serum Cholesterol and Alkaline Phosphatase in Normal and Obese Cynomolgus Monkeys The purpose of the study was to evaluate the LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering activity of anti-ASGR inhibitors. In general, cynomolgus monkeys do not have high levels of total cholesterol, HDL-C or LDL-C. Therefore, both normal and dyslipidemic models were utilized in this example. In the dyslipidemic model, monkeys were selected if their LDL levels were at least 100 mg/dL (normal is 40-60 mg/dL), and if there body mass index was over 41 kg/m2 (normal is below 35 kg/m2). Animals that met these criterea on standard diet were classified as spontaneously obese dylipidemic. Other animals were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 4.15 kcal/gm, 32% fat) prior to inclusion in the study and were classified as HFD obese dyslipidemic. monkeys of anti-ASGR-1 antibody 4A2.001 (IgG1z-SEFL2) (10 9% sucrose, 0.01% polysorbate-80, pH 5.2). Na\u00efve male and female normal cynomolgus monkeys were given a single intravenous injection of anti-ASGR-1 antibody 4A2.001 (IgG1z-SEFL2)(100 sodium acetate, 9% sucrose, 0.01% polysorbate-80, pH 5.2). Blood was collected from overnight fasted animals to monitor LDL-C and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels post-antibody injection. Blood was collected 70, 118, 190 and 268 hours post-injection (dyslipidemic models) and at 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168, 240, 336, 504, 672, 840, 1008, and 1176 hours post-injection (normal). LDL-C decrease (%) and ALP increase (%) were the main endpoints of the study and were measured on Roche C311 and C501 chemistry analyzers. Baseline levels of LDL-C and ALP were established from blood collected 7 days prior to antibody administration.

Introduction As described above in Example 1, ASGR1 loss-of-function (LOF) was found to be associated with a beneficial phenotype (protected from coronary artery disease, lower LDL cholesterol and longer life span) in human.1. To understand the mechanism of action underlying this association and find potential biomarkers, proteomic measurement of human serum samples were performed and compared to changes in circulating protein levels between the ASGR1 LOF variant carriers and controls. Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Proteomic Profiling A total of 333 human serum samples were acquired from the deCODE Icelandic population study, including 100 ASGR1 del12 heterozygous carriers (cases group) and 233 non-carriers (controls group). The Case/Control Groups are well matched by sex, age and collection time/freezer storage time. 150 ul serum samples were shipped to SomaLogic Inc, where 1310 proteins were measured by the SOMAscan Assay 1.3 k. The 1310 proteins were SOMAmer\u00ae Reagents Generated to Human Proteins, the complete list of tested proteins are summarized in the SOMAscan Assay 1.3K Content, Rev 1 (Effective: Sep. 21, 2015) which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The SOMAscan assay measured serum protein concentration using a Slow Off-rate Modified DNA Aptamer (SOMAmer)-based capture array. Each of the 1310 proteins is bond by its respective fluorescently labeled SOMAmer in the assay and their concentrations are reflected by the respective SOMAmer's relative fluorescence units (RFU). Data Analysis 2 Samples were removed due to low volume that did not meet Somascan requirements and 13 samples were removed because they had been treated with EDTA. The RFU data of each measured protein was log transformed, then centered and scaled to calculate standardized RFU values for this protein. Principle components (PCs) were derived from 1310 standardized RFU values by principle components analysis. An outlier removal based on Hotellings T2 distribution of PC1 and PC2 was applied and excluded another 8 samples from further analysis. After QC, the remaining 93 ASGR1 Del12 heterozygous Carriers (cases group) and 217 samples without the Del12 allele (controls group) and their standardized RFU values of each protein were analyzed by a linear model adjusting for Age, Sex, FreezerTime and the first 10 PCs, Yi=0+1Gi+2AGEi+3SEXi+4FTi+5PC1i+ . . . +15PC10i+i where Yi is the standardized RFU value for the i th sample for a particular protein, Gi is the Del12 genotype the i th sample and 1 capture the estimates of the mean difference between human samples with Del12 and without Del12. Since 1310 tests were performed for the proteins on Somascan platform, we calculated the significant threshold by Bonferroni method (0.05/1310=3.82\u00d7105) assuming these are independent tests. However, the Bonferroni correction is likely too stringent because proteins are often correlated with each other therefore these tests are not independent. Thus a realistic threshold of significance (5.19\u00d7105) was obtained by performing 100,000 permutations using the method by Sham and Purcell 20143. Results and Discussion Using the permutation threshold, 41 Proteins were identified to have significant serum levels between human ASGR1 del12 carriers and non-carriers (P<5.19\u00d7105). Of those, 26 show significant increase in the carriers (Table 18.1) and 15 decrease significantly in the carriers (Table 18.2). These changes are likely to mediate the beneficial effects resulting from ASGR1 loss of function seen in the del12 carriers. The levels of these proteins in blood can serve as biomarkers for ASGR1 loss of function and be used to assess ASGR1-targeted therapy during drug development.

Introduction As described above in Example 1, ASGR1 loss-of-function (LOF) was found to be associated with a beneficial phenotype (protected from coronary artery disease, lower LDL cholesterol and longer life span) in human1. Certain ASGR-1 antigen binding proteins disclosed herein were found to mimic the LOF effects, and can be useful in the treatment of coronary artery disease. In brief, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with certain ASGR-1 specific, ligand blocking antibodies in order to study the PK-PD profile of these antibodies. Moreover, a dose-dependent elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels was observed in the Ab-treated cynos, which resembles the ALP elevation seen in human ASGR1 LOF carriers. In addition to ALP, proteomic profiling in human serum identified 41 proteins that potentially underlie the beneficial effects caused by ASGR1 LOF as described above in Example 18. To compare effects of anti-ASGR1 antibody treatment with the human ASGR1 LOF and identify comparable signatures in cynomolgus monkey, proteomic measurement of the serum samples from this study was conducted. The list of proteins with altered levels in the antibody-treated animals is compared to the ones identified in human LOF carriers. Materials and Methods Sample Selection and Proteomic Profiling 6 animal groups with 3 animals in each group were selected for proteomic profiling. The 6 groups include 5 antibody-treated groups (mAb1/25A4, mAb2/4A2, mAb3/7E11, mAb4/5E5 and mAb8/4H6) and a vehicle control group (mAb6). The animals were dosed once at 100 mg/kg. Serum samples from time points 0, 168, 336, 504, 672 and 1176 hours were collected for each animal (Table 19.1 & 19.2). The only exception is group mAb8/4H6, where time point 1008 hour is used instead of 1176 hour. 120 ul serum samples were shipped to SomaLogic Inc, where 1310 proteins (see table 18.0) were measured by the SOMAscan Assay 1.3 k. The SOMAscan assay measures serum protein concentration using a Slow Off-rate Modified DNA Aptamer (SOMAmer)-based capture array. Each of the 1310 proteins is bond by its respective fluorescently labeled SOMAmer in the assay and their concentrations are reflected by the respective SOMAmer's relative fluorescence units (RFU).

As a result, SOMAscan measurements of these proteins would have low credibility and may not reflect the true protein levels. A simple criterion was defined to determine the credibility of the measurements, assuming the serum levels of a given protein are in relatively close range in human and cynomolgus monkey. The mean and range of each protein level in human are calculated based on the 217 human control samples from the human proteomic study described in Example 18. The mean and range of each protein level in cynomolgus monkey are calculated based on a total of 48 samples including measurements of all time points for the SEFL-2 control group and the pre-treatment (D0) and washout period (D50) measurements of all the other groups. A protein measurement would be assigned low credibility if (1) its range in cynomolgus monkey is not overlapping with human; and (2) there is a 5 fold difference between the mean level of this protein in human and cynomolgus monkey. A total of 162 proteins were determined as low-credibility by these criteria and were excluded (FIG. 58, which depicts a summary of the credibility of protein measurements in cynomolgus monkey). In FIG. 58, log 10 RFU of mean protein levels in the two species are plotted and the ones with low credibility (light shading) and high credibility (black) are marked. One sample in the 4H6 group was removed due to low volume that did not meet the requirements for the SOMAscan assay. No outliers were found in the principle components analysis. A linear mixed model adjusting for potential confounding factors was used to test whether the ASGR1 antibody treatment changes each protein level differently from the control group over time points, Yti=0+1TREATGROUPi+2TIMEti+3(TREATGROUPi)(TIMEti)+4COVti+ . . . +m+4COVti+b0i+ti which is determined by the p-value for 3 (i.e., treatment by time interaction; mean difference in slopes between treatment conditions). The random effect b0i captures individual animal heterogeneity. The TREATGROUP is coded as (25A4=4A2=7E11=5E5=4H6=1; SELF-2=0) and TIME is coded as (D8=D15=D22=D29=1; D0=D50=0) to test for the ASGR1 antibodies effect after treatment comparing to pre-treatment and washout period. Since multiple tests were performed for the proteins on SOMAscan platform, a Bonferroni corrected significant threshold (5\u00d7105) was used. Results and Discussion 33 proteins were identified to have significant serum level changes after ASGR1 antibody treatment (Table 19.3; P<5\u00d7105). Interestingly, all the 33 proteins show increased levels (1.3610.18 fold) after ASGR1 antibody treatment. TABLE 19.3 Proteins with significant changes after ASGR1 antibody treatment in Cynomolgus monkey. Estimated Fold P-value Change Gene Full Name 1.87E13 10.18 TNFSF8 Tumor ligand alpha 2.15E06 1.36 type II integral membrane protein 2.39E05 1.36 GFRA2 GDNF family receptor alpha-2 To compare results from this study with the human proteomic study, a list of proteins made by the 33 proteins in Table 19.3 and the top 41 proteins identified in human was compiled. This results in a list of 64 proteins total. The estimates of protein level change and p-value of the changes in the studies were compared (Table 19.4). Based on concordance of change in the cyno (in response to ASGR1 antibody treatment) and human (in response to ASGR1 LOF) studies, the proteins are classified into 5 tiers. Tier 1 includes 10 proteins that pass the stringent Bonferroni corrected significance level (p<5\u00d7105) in both studies with the same direction of changes. The number of proteins supported by strong evidence in both studies are much higher than the number one would expect by chance (p=1.58\u00d7108; Fisher's exact test). It indicates that ASGR1 Ab treatment can induce a serum protein levels change in cyno that is similar to the effect of del12 LOF variant in Human. Therefore, these proteins are the core biomarkers. For example, the strongest biomarker TNFSF8 had more than 10 fold increase after ASGR1 Antibody treatment (FIGS. 59A-59D, which depict the results of serum protein levels of TNFSF8 in cyno and human studies). Tier 2 contains 12 proteins with strong evidence (p<5\u00d7105) in the cyno study and suggestive evidence (p<0.05) in human with the same direction of changes. Both Tier 1 and 2 proteins have increased levels in both studies. Tier 3 includes 11 proteins that are found significant only in the cyno study but not human. These proteins are likely to be biomarkers specific for the drug modality or for cynomolgus monkeys. For example, the soluble secreted form of ASGR1 increased more than 10 fold after antibody treatment but no significant difference was observed in human between the ASGR1 del12 carriers and non-carriers. Tier 4 contains 17 proteins with significant evidence (p<5\u00d7105) in the human study but not supported by the cyno study. Majority of the proteins in Tier 4 has decrease levels in human del12 carriers. This observation may indicate a difference between antibody treatment and constitutive gene LOF. It could also possibly be due to species difference or simply caused by lower statistical power in the cyno study. Lastly, there are 14 proteins with significant changes in human classified as Tier 5 because they were excluded in the cyno study due to the low credibility of their SOMAmer reagents. In summary, the two studies show high degree of concordance between the antibody treatment in cynomolgus monkey and ASGR1 LOF in humans, with 10 proteins (Tier 1) showing very significant changes in the same direction in both studies. The ASGR-1 antibody treatment is working well as a way of mimicking the effects of ASGR1 LOF in humans and can be useful in the treatment of coronary artery disease.
