The barefoot doctor, a product of Mao Zedong'sCultural Revolution/ came into being in 1965 and represented adeliberate governmental effort to expand basic health coverage tovast regions of China lacking any medical facilities. Thephysician assistant/ who also dates from 19651 and whose futureposition is still evolving/ was a reflection of changes in theU.S. health care system since the Second World War. Theseincluded a growing emphasis on specialization and the neardisappearance of the family physician.In each country these mid-level health providers wereintended to supplement rather than replace the care provided byfull-fledged physicians. Yet/ particularly in the Soviet Unionand China/ their role has become so essential that it isdifficult to picture the national health system operating withoutthem.All mid-level practitioners share a common purpose/ that ofbringing health care to thoLe who need it most. This paper willsurvey the history and background of these practitioners, studytheir method of operation and attempt to evaluate theircontributions. It will not speculate on what their applicationsmay be elsewhere. However/ by studying in depth the successes,failures and problems of mid-level practitioners in threedifferent societies/ we may be better able to gain anunderstanding of their potential for strengthening the healthcare systems of both developed and undeveloped countries. 3Most studies of mid-level health practitioners are limitedto their activity in individual countries. Dr. N.R.E. Fendall, aBritish physician and Doctor of Public Health who had first handexperience in Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore and Kenya, has been theonly authority I could find who has studied the mid-level healthprofessional in general theoretical terms. Calling this personthe medical \"auxiliary\" in medicine, he stated that \"most of thetime lag between the discovery of knowledge and its extensiveapplication lies in the reluctance and inability to admit thatlesser-trained persons can carry out routine tasks in medicine\"(1972, 1292).Dr. Fendall defined auxiliary as \"helper\" and saidsuch persons should have a middle school education of seven tonine years and a \"technical education that is limited in breadth,depth and timr\" (1967, 474).In one of his many articles on the subject, he gave thefollowing statistics: In the developed world one physiciangraduates for every 350 babies born, while in the underdevelopedworld the ratio is 1:3,500 or more. In order to have onephysician for every 770 people, another three and one halfmillion physicians would be needed at a cost of $87.5 billion(1972, 1293).In addition, he noted the pr,blem of physicianmaldistribution, i.e. attracting and keeping doctors in ruralareas.Dr. Fendall envisioned the medical auxiliary as being \"muchnearer to the people he serves in thought, culture and way oflife.\"To stay in rural areas he would have to be content \"with AI 1 4a less sophisticated way of life\" (1968, 617). In 1972 Dr.Fendall published the book Auxiliaries in Health Care: Programsin Developing Countries, based on his first hand experiences as apublic health office': in the third world.In 1979, Doris Storms wrote Training and Use of AuxiliaryHealth Workers: Lessons From Developing Countries, which coveredmuch of the same mterial. Both of these books mainly aimed togive practical advice to health planners and administrators inusing auxiliaries in third world countries. In her introductionDr. Storms says, \"the desirability of training auxiliary healthworkers is as much a political decision as a technicalone...Health care delivery may appear to be a neutral entity, butit is not\" (5-6). This paper will demonstrate that this is truein every society, and that the health practitioner's role isalmost always influenced by the political situation.In 1969, Edward and Judith Forgotson studied the roles ofthe intermediate health workers in the United Kingdom and theSoviet Union.In their report for the Rand Corporation, theyconclude that neither the British nor the Soviet model could beused in the United States, but that the U.S. could be guided bytheir flexible approach to the use of medical auxiliaries.Alfred Yankauer, in the New Health Professionals, gives abrief historical background of mid-level health practitioners,saying that \"whenever there has been a perceived scarcity ofqualified physician services, society has granted permission todiagnose and treat disease and disability to others 'less 5qualified\" (1982, 250). Two studies briefly compared thephy-4ician assistant to the Soviet feldsher (Storey, 1972 andPickard, 1987). Milton Terris, in 1977, proposed solutions toend what he saw as a crisis in primary health care in the UnitedStates.He briefly mentioned the feldsher and the barefootdoctor but concluded that these approaches would not work here.James Cawley and Archie Golden came to the same conclusion in:983 when they wrote about problems facing physician assistantsand nurse practitioners. In both these articles the focus was onthe United States, and the question studied was whether or notcne country's experience could be directly transferred to another country. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this paper is to analyze the conditions whichgave rise to the profession of mid-level health practitioner inthe U.S.S.R., China and the U.S. and to examine the work of thefeldsher, barefoot doctor and the physician assistant. Anunderstanding of how these three countries have faced the problemof bringing health care to large populations may help developingcountries that are trying to bring modern health care to theirown populations. 6 Statement of the Problems 1.Why did the U.S.S.R., China and the U.S. have a need for mid-level health practitioners? 2.Who are these mid-level health practitioners? a.What is the educational background of the mid-levelhealth practitioner? b.What is the function of the mid-level health practitionerin the general health care system? 3.How does a country's geography, transportation system andlevel of development affect the number, role and status of themid-level health practitioner? 4.How do social conditions, level of unrest and politics affectthe work of the mid-level health practitioner over a period oftime? 5.How does an improvement in a country's health care deliveryaffect the role of the mid-level health practitioner? Hypotheses The mid-level health practitioner is a vital member of thehealth care team, one who plays a particularly important role intimes of social upheaval and unrest and is of particular value incountries with remote or scattered populations. 1.The mid-level health practitioner becomes essential to a 7society's health care system when there is a shortage of fullytrained physicians. 2.The mid-level health practitioner is of particular valuewhen a country or region is so vast that it has many people wholive beyond the reach of state of the art medical care. 3.Mid-level health practitioners increase in number andimportance when popular unrest or upheaval challenge establishedsystems or traditions of health care. 4.Centralized governments can institute crash programs tocreate mid-level health practitioners in an effort to upgrade thepublic health system. Limitations The study is confined to three types of current mid-levelhealth practitioners: the feldsher of the Soviet Union, thebarefoot doctor of the People's Republic of China and thephysician assistant of the United States. It also examines avreviously important mid-level health practitioner, the barber-surgeon of pre-modern Europe. Particular emphasis is placed onthe feldsher and the barefoot doctor because these models havebecome part of the mainstream medical care systems of theircountries.Except in the case of nurse practitioners in theU.S., who perform similar functions to physician assistants, thispaper does not deal with nurses.Only English language sources were used.This was not so 8much of a problem with China because considerable material isavailable in English. Since 1972, when travel to China from theUnited States became possible, many Americans have visited thecountry and written about its health care system. Translationsof material originally written in Chinese have been availablesince the early seventies. The Chinese Medical Journal has beenpublished in English since 1973 and the Barefoot Doctor's Manualhas actually gone through two American editions. There is anexcellent account in English of medical care in China from 1949to 1965 in Joshua Horn's book Away With All Pests. Several otheraccounts of this period appear in British medical journals. Itwould have been useful to have more material available in Englishfrom the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to 1972.Finding material in English on the Soviet Union is more ofa problem.Two American physicians, William Knaus and MarkField, have written authoritative books on the Soviet health caresystem, while reports of its deficiencies and merits appear quiteoften in American newspapers and magazines as well as inscholarly publications. The Current Digest of the Soviet Presscomes out weekly and translates major stories from newspapers,magazines and scholarly journals into English. Pravda is nowavailable in English. Feldsher I Akusherka (Feldsher andMidwife) is not available in Engli3h nor are there Englishabstracts of the articles. It would have been useful to gothrough this journal to learn about the current activities of thefeldsher as well as his education and status. I have not found 1 i; 9any Soviet medical journals available in English.Keeping up with the recent rapid changes in the Soviet Unionand China is virtually impossible. The beginnings of Westernstyle capitalism, as I will show, have already had an effect onmedical care in China; but we will not know for several yearswhat their effect on the barefoot doctor will be.In March, 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev opened a new era in Soviethistory.It is too soon to tell how glasnost (openness, candor)and perestroika (restructuring), will affect the country's healthcare system in the long term. There are already some documentedchanges, however. These include increased educationalrequirements for physicians and the opening of the first fee-based hospital in Moscow. Some of these changes will be brieflycovered.I have tried to make this paper as current as possibleas of January, 1990. Operational Definitions of Terms Mid-Level Health Practitioner or Provider - a person whoprovides medical or health treatment and advice without holdingthe rank of physician, yet possesses at least a basic knowledgeof medicine.This knowledge may be the result of practicalexperience or elementary medical education, but is ideally acombination of both. 10Importance of the Stud A study of the mid-level health practitioner will 1.give historical perspecti-.re to a vital member of thehealth establishment. 2.examine his or her present function and future role inproviding health care to a huge popu/ation. 3.add information in the field of comparative analysis ofhealth care systems. Many countries are facing the same problemsof a lack of access to medical care for a large percentage oftheir population due to a scarcity and maldistribution ofphysicians.Although the problems are similar, the approaches tosolving these problems may be quite different. By examiningthese same problems and issues and noting the similarities anddifferences in solving them, it is possible to learn of different soll;tions.Of course one country's approach can never be fullytransolanted to another. \"A health care system reflects thehistcrical, cultural and political as well as economic contextwithin which it develops\" (Field 1989, 5).4. assist health planners and administrators in actuallydeveloping and setting up programs in which mid-level healthpractitioners play a role in bringing medical care to anindividual community or nation. This could benefitunderdeveloped countries. For example, developing countries inAfrica, Asia, South and Central America are using auxiliaryhealth workers to provide primary health care. Communities in I S developed countries which lack doctors also rely on mid-levelhealth practitioners. Methodology11 Information in this paper comes from extensive libraryresearch and interviews. Scholarly books, journals andperiodicals as well as government documents were consulted,supplemented by journalistic sources in magazines and newspapers.In the case of China, I was able to interview a doctor oftraditional Chinese medicine studying in the U.S. who had workedwith red guard doctors and had first hand knowledge of thecountry's health care system.With respect to the U.S., I interviewed a physicianassistant in New York City who works with homeless people. Ialso talked to a free lance medical journalist from the SovietUnion who now lives in the United States who, without adding anyfirst hand inffIrmation, confirmed what I had been reading inbooks and articles about Russia.in addition, I interviewed Dr. Ruth Sidel, professor ofsociology at Hunter College of the City University of New York, aleadina authority on health care in China. She and her husbandhave also studied the feldsher in the Soviet Union.The next chapter will begin with a review of the role of thebarber-surgeon, the first mid-level health practitioner tofunction on an organized and systematic ba.lis. This will be 12followed by a study of the feldsher in the Soviet Union, thebarefoot doctor of the People's Republic of China and thephysician assistant of the United States. 13 Chapter II The Mid-Level Practitioner: Historical Background Mid-level practitioners have existed in many societies,functioning in the past under various names: midwives, herb-gatherers, salve dealers, drug dispensers, bone-setters, barbersurgeons, even wizards and faith-healers (Garrison 1929, 118).In modern times they have been known as feldshers barefootdoctors and physician assistants. Despite differences in time,place, education and training, their function has been largelythe same: to provide medical treatment and advice to patients wholack ready access to top level physicians.In ancient times, actually, more people were served by whatwe should now call \"mid-level\" practitioners than doctors of thehighest rank.Physicians, few in number, placed their skills--such as they were--at the disposal of members of the elite,leaving the less skilled practitioners, in Will Durant's phrase,\"to gather the crumbs and heal the poor\" (1942, 182).Upper class patients, however, were not necessarily betteroff medically then fellow citizens in ancient civilizations.Many supposedly learned physicians dealt in theories rather thanin practical medicine. Some of them regarded disease as aconsequence of the movement of the stars. Before the time ofHippocrates (c. 400 B.C.) Greek medicine \"was regarded simply as 14a branch of philosophy\" (Kitto 1957, 188). Lacking such abstruse\"knowledge,\" the ordinary healers relied basically on empiricalobservation and homemade and natural remedies.Even in midwifery, perhaps the oldest medical profession,ttere was a split between those employed by the common people andthose used by upper classes. Garrison calls the midwife \"one ofthe most ancient of professional figures\" (1929, 31), while theEncyclopedia of Medical Histou says she is \"as old as birthitself\" (McGrew 1985, 203). Most midwives were uneducated wowenwho acquired their skills by experience and apprenticeship.However, particularly in France and England, elite groups wereestablished of middle-class, better educated women who foundmidwifery a respectable way to support themselves and develop acareer.Only in the nineteenth century, with the development ofgynecology and obstetrics as medical specialties, did midwivesgive way to male physicians taking charge of childbirthprocedures.In recent years there has been a modest revival inthe use of midwives, who are usually registered nurses withspecialized training. Thereemergence of midwives is a result,in part, of the movement towards a more natural approach tobirth, one free of excessive medical intervention.The activities of midwives in ancient times gave many ofthem a reputation as \"wise women,\" whose skillful use of herbsand drugs to ease labor pains could perhaps be helpful intreating other conditions (Ehrenreich 1973: 15).A few women inancient Rome actually practiced a more generalized medicine 15(Jackson 1988, 86-87). Full fledged female physicians were notvery common until the modern era.Neither ancient Greece nor ancient Rome developed a systemof professioaalized medicine in any way comparable to that ofmodern times.There were no medical schools; aspiring physicianslearned as best they could from those already in practi-:e(Garrison 1929, 91). Similarly, no real system of reguLation orlicensing existed, although certain individuals in Athensreceived a designation as \"public physicians.\" The RomanE,through town councils, designated certain physicians as medici,indicating a superior status (Jackson 1988, 37).Less elitepractitioners, however, were far more plentiful, their (root-gatherers), pharmacopoloe(drug-peddlers), unguentarii (salve dealers), obstetricoe (mid-wives) and others (Garrison 1929, 118).Most important, perhaps, in the development of practicalthough still primitive medical and surgical treatment, were themilitary practitioners who learned their trade literally from theground up by treating wounded warriors on the field on which theyhad fallen.According to Homeric legends, these field-doctorswere themselves soldiers who displayed an aptitude for medicalwork.In Xenophon's account of his invasion of Persia with10,000 Greek troops, he refers to eight surgeons who accompaniedthe expedition (Garrison 1929, 91). The Romans, whose armiesoccupied much of Western Europe and Britain, organized a far moresystematic military medical corps, but in times of peace most of 16the practitioners, especially those in the lower hierarchy, fadedinto local communities, joining the herb-gatherers, drug-sellersand humbler physicians in their work (Jackson 1988, 137). TheRussian feldshers, those modern mid-level practitioners who alsodeveloped from military medical service, could, if they wished,traoe their lineage back to the Roman empire.The coming of the Middle Ages brought little change in themedfcal hierarchy, with the overwhelming bulk of the populationcontinuing to be medically dependent upon the \"humblerpractitioners.\" No true medical profession yet existed. TheOxford English Dictionary ascribes the earliest use of the word\"profession\" to the sixteenth century, and it was at least twocenturies later that a medical profession and governmentalreg-Ilations for education and practice, came into being in Europe(Mc:3rew 1985, 181). Medical schools developed slowly. TheSchool of Salerno is documented as beir.g the first; it was inexistence by 1100 but certain sources say it goes back to theninth century (Garrison 1929, 147). Prior to that, medicaleducation of any kind was obtainable principally through dorkingas an apprentice with an established physician or perhaps byentering a monastery, for medieval monks developed considerablemedical lore.They treated their fellow monastics who fell ill,using an extensive pharmacology of herbs.r.lring the twelfth century other European cities beganfollowing the lead of Salerno by establishing medical schools.Those of Bologna, Montpellier and Paris were especially well 17known (McGrew 1985, 79). However, the number of skilledphysicians such institutions turned out was very small. In themid-fourteenth century, when the Black Death struck Europe, therewere, according to the historian Barbara Tuchman, only twenty-four physicians in Venice, a city of over 100,000 (1970, 100).In The Dictionary of the Middle Ages, Michael McVaugh'sstatistics for Paris, London and Valencia, indicate that justprior to the Black Death there was an average of three full-fledged physicians and three full-fledged surgeons per 10,000 ofurban population in these three cities (1982, 254).Obviouslywith figures like these, most medical care had to be provided byhealers without academic credentials of any kind.The important place held by such practitioners isdemonstrated by the career of the Swiss physician Paracelsus(1493-1541), one of the most famous of medical pioneers.Paracelsus began his medical career as a barber-surgeon in thearmy of Charles I of Spain. Although he eventually obtained amedical degree, becoming the official city physician of Basel,and taught at the university there, he got his basic medicalknowledge from talking and working with barbers, midwives,executioners, bathkeepers, gypsies and fortune tellers, thusobtaining, according to the medical historian Fielding Garrison,\"an unusual knowledge of folk-medicine and a permanent taste forlow company\" (19290 204).Paracelsus put himself at odds with contemporary physiciansby disdaining the medical th,lories of the past, which they 18revered.He publicly burned the classical treatises of Galen and;Wicenna, and lectured insteal to his students about his ownpractical experiences. He contended that medical knowledge wasto be gleaned, \"not by strictly adhering to the rules of theancients, but exclusively by studying nature and using theexyeriences we have gained in long years of practice\" (Durant1957, 878).Although the medical establishment of his dayremained hostile, Parcelsus became famous for his treatments andhi! cures.When he died in Salzburg, Austria/ he left hisinstruments to the barber-surgeons of the town, for it was as abarber-surgeon that he had gained most of his knowledge.who were these barber-surgeons and what did they do? Thequestion is important to any study of medical history andparticularly to one that is devoted essentially to mid-levelmedical practitioners. The barber surgeons were the first mid-level practitioners to be described as functioning in asystematic manner. Their existence is documented from .--bout1100, the time they began to form themselves into guilds. Theyheld a high position in the hierarchy of medical practice, wellbelow that of university medical school graduates, but muchhigher than the herb-gatherers and faith healers. Urban dwellerswho could afford to pay for treatment depended upon the barbersurgeons for their major medical needs (Ackerknecht 1984, 546).The barber-surgeons also functioned in rural areas, travelingfrom village to village (Lindberg 1978, 407).Surgery in medieval times was regarded as an inferior branch 19of medicine.The early medical schools did not teach it,regarding it as a branch of artisanal or manual labor.University-trained physicians considered themselves to beobservers and consultants, not active participants in the healingprocess.Surgery was beneath their dignity. In Paris, themedical faculty required their students to swear they wouldperform no surgery, not even blood letting (McGrew 1985, 204).Surgeons wishing to become physicians first had to renounce theirformer craft (Strayer 1983, 82).'Although it is not completely clear how the functions ofbarbers and surgeons became combined, the process probablystarted in the early middle ages when barbers were trained forthe purpose of both shaving and bleeding the occupants ofmonasteries (Garrison 1929, 172). Blood letting was one of themost common medical procedures for centuries. The barber's pole,still in almost universal use, is a symbol that goes back to themedieval barber-surgeons, with the stripes indicating the ribbonused for bandaging the arm in bleeding. As their tradedeveloped, the barber surgeons rendered a tremendous variety ofsurgical and other medical scrvices. Treatment of trauma was amajor function. They reduced fractures, amputated mangled limbs,cared for wounds, repaired hernias, removed cataracts, and cutout urinary tract stones. At the same time they pursued theiroriginal calling of hair trimming and shaving. They also pulled 'Ironically,whereas modern surgeonscommand someof thehighest feesin the medical profession, in medieval times theywere at the bottom end of the scale. 20teeth.Apparently there was little difference between theinstruments they used for barbering and for performing surgery; arazor sharp knife was their primary requisite. They made someattempts at anesthesia, using sponges dipped in opium, mandrake,hemlock and other soporifics (Strayer 1983, 99). Hans Sachs, thecobbler, poet and singer who lived in Nuremberg from 1494 to 1576and who was immortalized by Richard Wagner in his opera DieMeistersinger, described the legal occupations of the barber-surgeons in a set of rhyming texts he wrote for a series ofwoodcuts: I am called everywhereI can make many healing salvescan cure new woundsAlso fractures and chronic affectionsSyphilis, Cataract, Gangrene, pull teethShave, wash and cut hairI also like to bleed (Ackerknecht 1984, 545-546). with the importance of their role as health-care providersso extensively recognized, the barber-surgeons established guildssetting their cwn standards, regulations and qualifications. Ofcourse, there were individuals who continued to practice medicineon their own without membership in a guild, but these \"laypractitioners,\" including faith-healers, never receivedauthorization of any kind (Webster 1979, 182-184).The barber-surgeons, on the other hand, gained official orsemi-official status through their guilds, which were theequivalent of the guilds established by other tradesman and 21artisans.Usually guild membership involved inscription in theguild records, the swearing of an oath, agreement to abide byregulations and the payment of a fee (Strayer 1983, 99).Through all these developments, the barber surgeonscontinued to learn their craft through practical experiencerather than through enrollment at medical institutions. In somecities they had to serve as many as eight years of apprenticeshipbefore the guilds authorized them to function independently.Meanwhile medical schools attached to universities continued toemphasize theory rather than practical methods, and manyphysicians graduated with little or no actual experience intreating patients. John Hale wrote that in the fifteenth century\"the physician was often perceived as someone who charged a greatdeal but whose plume failed to disguise his lack of success\" (1971).Many barber-surgeons, by contrast, with plenty of practicalexperience, were forced to work among the poorer classes where,despite their guild membership, they barely scraped byeconomically (Strayer 1983, 100). Nevertheless, they were the\"doctors\" who for hundreds of years treated the majority of thepopulation throughout Europe and England and were, according toErwin Ackerknecht, the true \"ancestors of today's medicalpractitioners\" (1984, 545-546).The barber-surgeons were also the largest group ofpractitioners offering genuine medical treatment, by faroutnumbering the university trained physicians.In Geneva the 22ratio of physicians to barber-surgeons was 8:90 during thefifteenth century and 3:40 during the first half of the sixteenthcentury.As late as 17900 Zurich had four university trainedphysicians, eight midwives and thirty-four barber surgeons. InLucerne, in 1800, the ratio was sixteen university doctors toninety five barber-surgeons. Even in medieval Paris, auniversity center, the university doctors were always outnumberedby the barber-surgeons (Ackernecht 1984, 546).In London the Barbers Guild received its first royal charterin 1462, although it had been in existence for many yearsearlier.In 1520 the barbers joined forces with a group calledthe Fellowship of Surgeons to form the \"Mystery and Communalitycf Barbers and Surgeons of London\" or the Barber-Surgeons Companyas it became known (Webster 1979, 173).Margaret Felling and Charles Webster have made aquantitative stuay of the various types of medical practitionersfunctioning in London during the period 1580-16000 when the totalpopulation was around 200,000. Here are some of their findings:Physicians50 (including 20 who were still candidates i.e.students)Barber-surgeons - 100 (members of the Barber-SurgeonsCompany)Apothecaries - 100 (herb compounders and sellers whobelonged to the Grocers Guild)Lay Practitioners - 250 (most of these were unlicensedindividuals who functioned without authorization. Nursesand midwives were not included.)The Barber-Surgeons Company was the largest organized groupin London specifically dedicated to medical-surgical practice, 3{1 23and by the sixteenth century had grown so strong that it couldchallenge the authority of the smaller College of Physicians,which represented the university trained doctors. For example,it persuaded the civic authorities to grant its members the useof the bodies of executed criminals for dissection rather thanleaving these under the control of the university physicians.The Barbers Company also won the right to conduct lectures inanatomy apart from the College of Physicians (Webster 1979, 176).\"It is difficult to avoid the impression that the elite of theBarber-Surgeon Company were, in the last decades of the sixteenthcentury, making a more active and original contribution tomedicine than were their colleagues in the College of Pbysicians\"observe Margaret Felling and Charles Webster.Licenses to practice medicine in the Middle Ages were issuedeither by the universities or, at least in the case of England,by ecclesiastical authorities. However, in England as well as inItaly and France, a document of membership in a barber-surgeonsorganization was considered adequate official authorization topractice (Webster 1979, 215).Naturally the rise of the barber-surgeons to a significantplace in the medical hierarchy was irksome to many of theuniversity physicians, and certainly to the organizations thatrepresented them. The College of Physicians in London metperiodically to consider methods to curtail the \"bold andignorant multitude of empirics practicing medicine\" (Webster1979, 182). The university trained physicians in England tried to 31 24restrict the activities of the Barber-Surgeons Company. Theyalso brought lawsuits against individuals. Such persecutionswere frequently aimed at female practitioners, with twenty-ninesuch cases recorded between 1550 and 1600 (Webster 1979, 186-187).Nevertheless, the mid-level practitioners grew at a fasterrate than the physicians, with most patients regarding thebarber-surgeons as \"far more useful than the pretentious bookdoctors\" (Ackerknecht 1984, 547).Despite the enmity of the university physicians, the barbersurgeons kept gaining in stature until, in the era of theRenaissance (basically in the sixteenth century), they began towin acceptance even from the full fledged doctors. Recognition oftheir improving status began as early as 1210 when a disputeoccurred at the College of St. Cosme, a new medical school inParis.Certain students at the college, who wore long robes,were entitled to perform surgery freely, while others, who woreshort robes, could do so only after passing a specialexamination.Many faculty members \"disliked the pretensions ofthe long-robed surgeons\" and accordingly formed an alliance withthe barber-surgeons guild, in an effort to break the monopoly ofthe lona-robes. For the first time the barber surgeons werepermitted to attend lectures by the medical faculty (McGrew 1985, 31).This spirit of cooperation lasted at the school for manyyears, ending only when the barber-surgeons made demands that thefaculty considered excessive--such as the right to have cadaversof their own for anatomical demonstrations. 32 25A spirit of reconciliation between the barber-surgeons andphysicians continued to grow in many cities, even if that growthwas intermittent and sporadic. In many medical schools whencadaver dissections were performed a physician read from atextbook (often Galen) while a barber-surgeon performed theactual dissection. Theory and practice thus came together,however warily. As a result of the achievements of the barber-surgeons, more and more university trained physicians began todemand instruction in surgery and to practice it themselves. Inthe fifteenth century the Universities of Padua and Bolognaestablished chairs of surgery.The increase in training and skills of university-educatedsurgeons gave a new respectability to the surgical craft, and itmoved medicine in general away from purely theoreticalconsiderations toward greater practicality (Webster 1979, 328-331).Although the barber-surgeons thus faced increasedcompetition, they also benefited from the fact that surgery wasnow on a much higher level than previously. It was almost as iftheir activities all along were now receiving an endorsement fromthe universities. ,By the sixteenth century in England, barber surgeons,university surgeons and university physicians actually beganworking together. In the town of Norwich, the Barbers Companychanged its name to \"Barber-Surgeons and Physicians\" in 1550,while in the town of York the guild became known as the Barbersand Surgeons rather than the Barber-Surgeons (Webster 1979, 26 213).A few years later the college of Physicians and theBarber-Surgeons Company of London entered into an alliance.Oneof the first things they did was to attempt to curtail themedical activities of the \"empiric\", meaning apothecaries andlay-practitioners.Eventually, the rise of surgeons to a status equal tophysicians, spelled the end of the barber-surgeons in WesternEurope, although as noted, they managed to persist in severalcities into the beginning of the nineteenth century. As mid-level practitioners, they had provided the backbone of medicalcare for millions of people, most of them poor, through aturbulent and troubled period of history. Surveying the threebasic healers of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, physicians,surgeons and barber-surgeons, the great medical historian, Dr.Fielding H. Garrison, has written: \"The lay barber...was, insome respects the most worthy of all three since he was driven tostudy nature at first hand.\"Another form of the mid-level health practitioner was theOfficier de Lante of France, who was actually incorporated intothe formal medical system of the land in 1803.This officialgrade of Officier de Sant' Franscois de Fourcroy ascientist and educator charged by Napoleon with reorganizing theFrench medical care system. The Officier de Sante/was created toalleviate health manpower shortages in the armed services andrural regions. The title was used both in civilian and military :?.I 27health care (Nouveau Petit Larousse 1952, 706). Educationalqualifications included six years of apprenticeship with aphysician plus five years of hospital work or three years studyat a medical school. An examination was required, and specificlimits were placed on the Officier's functions--for example, theywere permitted to perform only operations. This appeared to bethe first time in history that the qualifications and duties of amid-level health officer were formally spelled out (Cawley 1985,135).Such officiers were officially designated as \"doctors (Heller 1978, 25).However, the Officier de Sante/didnot prove to be apermanent addition to France's health care system. Social andeconomic conditions improved, the physicians demamded a singlequalifying degree for the medical profession, and the new mid-level rank was attacked as fostering inferior practitioners. TheOfficier de Sante/began to decline in use and numbers, and thegrade was officially abolished in 1892 (Heller 19780 37). Itwould remain for other countries to blend mid-level healthpractitioners into their public health systems on a continuingand permanent basis. This development took place in eighteenthcentury Russia and twentieth century China, with the rise,respectively, of the feldsher and the barefoot doctor. These twomid-level practitioners will be considered in detail in the nexttwo chapters. Following that, I will discuss the physicianassistant of the United States, a mid-level practitioner who rosein somewhat different circumstances. 35 28 Chapter III The Feldsher of the Soviet Union The Soviet Health Care System Today The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the largestcountry in the world, occupying one sixth of the earth's landsurface.Its land area covers 8.6 million square miles and hasvaried geography and all extremes of climate. The population in1989 was 287,015,000 and included over 100 distinct nationalgroups.Approximately 64% of the people live in urban areas(World Almanac 1989, ;25).The USSR is divided into fifteen geopolitical divisionscalled republics. Each republic is subdivided into oblasts(regions), and each oblast into rayons. The population of anoblast ranges frog half a million to several million, that of arayon from a few thousand in rural areas to half a million in acity.This organizational structure is used for healthadministration, with the rayons divided into. uchastocks(community units served by a physician). Each republic has itsown Ministry of Health responsible to the Ministry of HealthProtection, USSR, located in Moscow. 3 6 29Soviet health services are based on the premise that thehealth of the people is the responsibility of the state. TheSoviet or All Union Minster of Health is ultimately responsiblefor all the medical and health activities of the fifteenrepublics.In 1990 this person is Yevgeni I. Chazov (PermanentMission of the U.S.S.R. to the United Nations, Telephonecommunication, April 5, 1990) a prominent cardiologist and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize (Field 1988,330). This positionis always filled by an eminent physician who usually combinesadministrative duties with a limited clinical practice. He isadvised by a thirty member Medical Collegium composed of keypersons in the Ministry, top medical administrators andresearchers, representatives of trade unions, and Communist Partyfunctionaries. The Collegium reviews and evaluates proposalsoriginating from the Semachko Institute which does healthresearch in medical care organizations. It is the Soviet or AllUnion Ministry of Health that administers the work of thefeldshers' as well as most other branches of the Soviet healthsystem.3 2Althoughfeldshershouldbeunderlinedsinceit isaforeignword, Ihave chosen not to underline it because it isrepeated so frequently.2There isalso a Departmental Health System which consistsof facilities reserved for employees of specific ministries withspecific medical needs such as the KGB, Ministry of Railroads andMinistryof Defense.Theseare not formally the responsibilityof the All Union Minister of Health (Saltman 1988, 317). 3 '1 30 The Feldsher - History The feldsher, today's mid-level health care practitioner inthe Soviet Union, reaches further back into history than any ofhis or her counterparts in other countries, and probably plays amore important role in their nation's medical system. Thefeldsher's role has changed as Russian history has changed, and,despite efforts of the Soviets to replace feldshers he or she islikely to go on serving an important function well into thefuture.According to Vincente Navarro, the former editor of theInternational Journal of Health Services, no comprehensivehistory exists of feldsherism in Russia.Closeness to the population is still one of the feldshersmost significant characteristics, and it has been since theiremergence on the scene some 200 years before the appearance ofthe French Officier de Sante.In 1620, Russia established its first official medicaladministration with the creation of the Apothecary Board toappoint military surgeons, distribute drugs and examinecredentials of doctors from abroad. A need for lower levelmedical care was soon apparent to the authorities, so in 1654 theboard set up a training school for \"lekers,\" these being theforerunners of feldshers. \"A leker or treater was equivalent tothe barber-surgeon of the West, who treated patients but knewvery little medicine. A doctor, by contrast, knew medicine but 3S 31did not usually treat patients\" (Field 1967? 17). In other wordseducated physicians were strong on theory but did very littlepractical work except among the aristocracy. Lekers, who hadfour to six years of training, served in the military. The lekerschool had only a brief existence, its function being taken overby military hospitals such as those in Smolensk in 1656 and inMoscow in 1678. The Apothecary Board went through several namechanges and finally became the Medical Collegium in 1763 (Field1967, 17).Russian medicine owes a great deal to Peter the Great (1672-1725), who was himself an amateur surgeon (Navarro 1977, 10). Inan effort to raise medical standards he established Russia'sfirst medical school in Moscow in 1706. Similar schools (thesewere called hospital schools and later \"mediosurgical schools\")were then established in St. Petersburg (1710) and Kronstadt(1720).A medical faculty began functioning in conjunction withMoscow University in 1764 which was followed by other schoolsconnected to universities. In 1721, he authorized a licensingsystem by which the state reserved the right to determine who wascompetent to practice medicine and in many cases wanted to knowwhat the physician did. By 1802, there were 1,519 physiciansregistered in Russia instead of the 150 doctors and lekers of acentury before (Field 1967, 19).Peter the Great's main contribution may have been in makingRussian medicine part of mainstream European medicine. Heimported scientists, books and scientific collections from Europe 32and visited European medical schools. The Academy of Science,which still exists, was founded a year after his death.Peter the Great also introduced the leker into the Russianarmy.with a huge military establishment and a minuscule numberof physicians (few wanted to enter the service), there was anurgent need for practitioners with at least minimal skills. Themedieval barber-surgeon provided an obvious answer. In fact,military medical personnel at first were called \"tsiriulniks,\" orbarbers.The term \"feldsher,\" which came into use later, derivesfrom two German words: Feld - (battle) field and Scherer - barber(Vlassov 1989, 28). The early feldshers were drawn from thelower social classes, the sons of peasants, petty tradesmen orminor clergy.Although an ability to read and write was aprerequisite, many possessed only a bare functional literacy.Essentially, they learned their skills on the job, in militaryhospitals or small field infirmaries: bandaging, bloodletting andbone setting.The first training program was launched in the1740s when a small number began to study at the KronstadtMilitary Hospital near St. Petersburg.Since military service in the Czarist army until 1874 wasfor a term of twenty-five years, the feldshers had plenty of timefor their training on the job. Even wlth ten years off for goodbehavior, the number of feldshers who survived to retire was not large.However, those who did often became civilian feldshers,charging fees for their services. In many areas they were theonly health care providers available to the peasant population 33((enyon 1985, 25). They were called rotnye, or company feldshersbecause of their previous military service.Due to the lack ofreal qualifications, the care they provided to their patients wasrarely of the best. According to Samuel Ramer, AssistantProfessor of History at Tulane University, their popular imagewas that of an invincibly ignorant older man, often an alcoholic,who had been so beaten down by army life that their mostprominent traits were servility, avarice and cunning.Thisappraisal is reflected in a popular saying that went: \"Feldsherdon't cure you, they only cripple you\" (Ramer 1976, 215). Asimilar picture is given in the book Russian Medicine in an Eraof Reform and Revolution: 1856-1905 by Nancy Frieden who, indescribing hospitals of the period, referred to the \"coarsetreatment by drunken feldshers\" (1981, 85).The Crimean War (1853-1856) was one of the most costly inhuman terms ever fought until that time.It provided a turningpoint for feldshers, as for most other components of the Russianmedical system. The hard-fought struggle between the British,French and Ottoman 'Dirks on one side, and the Russians on theother, brought such suffering to the casualties on both sidesthat improvements had to be made in military medicine, includingthe development of the nursing professional by FlorenceNightingale (Sidel, V. and R., 1983, 181).Another turning point in the development of Russian medicineand medical organization in the nineteenth century was thecreation of the \"Zemstvo\" system of local government, established 34in 1864 by Alexander II (1855-1881), as part of the reformsintroduced after the Emancipation Proclamation (1861) which freedthe serfs (Field 1967/ 20). \"Zemstvos were local districtassemblies charged with administering programs of education,public health, charity and law enforcement\" (Pickard 1987, 163).The word zemstvo itself comes from the word zemilia which meansthe \"land\", in contrast with large urban areas (Field 1957, 1).Zemstvos' functions included road building, supervising prisons/education, public welfare, social assistance, and medical careand public health. The inhabitants of a district (the smallestadministrative territorial unit) elected the zemstvo assemblywhich in turn elected an executive board or committee which sentdelegates to the provincial land assemblies, the nextadministrative unit. The central government appointed provincialgovernors who still had the right to intervene in the work of thezemstvos (Field 1967, 20). According to Navarro, zemstvomedicine represents the \"first case in the world of organizingmedicine and hospital care services on a large scale\" (1977, 9).The feldsher system developed rapidly under zemstvogovernment administration. In fact, the basis was laid for itsoperation to this day. The zemstvos were always short of fundsand spent little on health matters. As late as 1886, only 8.3%of a typical zemstvo budget went to health.Feldshers could behired for far less than doctors. In fact, few doctors wereavailable for employment in rural areas, and these mainly werecircuit physicians who went from village to village seeing 35patients on market days (Field 2, 1957). The circuit system wasabolished in 1890, and physicians were appointed by the Zemstvoassemblies to practice in specified areas. Nevertheless, mostpeasants continued to seek their medical help from feldshers, whooutnumbered physicians three to one (Ramer 1976, 216).The zemstvo system brought the first real effort to givefeldshers at least a partial medical education, but the schoolswere poorly equipped and staffed. In 1864 five such institutionsopened, offering two years of training. By the end of thenineteenth century there were thirty-two schools, and theduration of training had increased to three years at some, fourat others.Graduates of feldsher schools were called shkolnye,meaning \"of schools,\" while those who learned their trade in thearmed forces, continued to be called rotnye, meaning military.Although this education gave the feldshers some degree ofprofessional autonomy previously lacking, it brought them noheightened status and certainly did not improve the quality oftheir equipment and surroundings. This was true not only offeldshers but of all medical workers including pbysicians.Medical conditions and facilities in Russia were the poorestin Europe.The playwright Anton Chekhov, who as a young medicalgraduate worked briefly as a zemstvo physician, described a ruralhospital as a \"picture of filth and dirt, of drunken attendantswho sleep in the same room with the patients, of the almost totallack of instruments, of resigned superstitious patients and ofthe absence of what the Russians call culture\" (Field 1, 1957). 13 36Chekhov noted that in a social sense feldshers were \"neither fishnor fowl\" and thus typified the largely ignored middle groups innineteenth century Russia who had \"left the people and not yetarrived as members of the intelligentsia\" (Ramer, 1976, 217).In this situation the feldshers found it difficult to wineither respect or reward. \"The work of the feldsher wasexhausting, unrelieved by holidays, poorly paid and hazardous.Their standard of living was little better than the peasantry orurban working class. Their legal status as medical practitionerswas poorly defined and the title of feldsher carried a socialstigma\" (Ramer 1976, 217).An important barrier to an improved status for feldshers wasthe hostile attitude of Russian physicians of whom Chekhov istypical.Rather than regardincj the mid-level practitioners asallies or even assistants, doctors looked on them as enemies, orat least a necessary evil eventually to be made extinct by thetraining of more physicians. It is interesting to observe thatthis still is the official, although very distant goal of theSoviet government today. Naturally, this antagonism wasreciprocated by the feldshers, who in articles in the medicalpress charged the physicians with \"arbitrariness, castediscrimination and even physical brutality\" (Ramer 1976, 219).Feldshers faced a further obstacle in their quest foradvancement because of a conflict within their own ranks: theshkolnye feldshers with a formal education vs. the rotnyefeldshers from the military. The shkolnye group professed a 4 37superior attitude and barred the rotnye from their societies.The law substantiated this attitude by restricting the rotnye tohospital practice under the direct supervision of the physician.The rotnye, for their part, resented such limitation.: andemphasized their own practical skills, field experience andsocial proximity to their patients. Some shkolnye feldshersacknowledged the abilities of the rotnye and urged the creationof a standard examination for all, a view espoused in the journalFeldsher, established in 1891 by Dr. Bois Oks.Eventuallytraining for all feldshers was standardized (Ramer 1976, 200).After the Revolution of 1905, which failed to overthrow theCzar, the government increased its efforts to train much neededhealth providers. By 1915 there were sixty-five schools fortraining civilian feldshers and feldsher-midwives with a combinedenrollment of nearly 9,000. Feldsher-midwives (feldsheristka-akusherka) are mid-level health practitioners, invariably female,qualified to be of service obstetrically as well as medically.There were two reasons why the Zemstvos liked havingfeldsher-midwives, one practical and one that had the goal ofimproving health care in Russia. In the 1870's medical reformershad set up over twenty schools for training midwives, mainly withthe goal of replacing the povitukhi (older peasant women withoutformal education who were experienced in delivering babies) whopracticed in the countryside. The prevailing medicalestablishment doubted the competence of the povitukhil althoughthere was no proof that graduates of midwife schools were any 45 38better.Experience showed that a combined feldsher midwifetended to promote the obstetric practice of the female feldsher,making new inroads on the territory of the povitukhi. Although by1905 there were 10,000 trained midwives, they were present atonly two percent of rural births. Ten thousand was still very fewfor a population of 125 million, but an even greater problem wasone of maldistribution (a common theme throughout this paper).Most graduates of midwife school preferred the city, where thestandard of living was higher and there were more salariedpositions.The Zemstvos also preferred to combine the functions offeldsher and midwife because that meant they only had to hire oneperson to do two jobs. Feldshers often assisted at birth becausethey were often the only health care practitioners available tothe peasants.The peasants often trusted feldshers more thanmidwives as birth attendants since they knew them from treatingtheir other illnesses. The first combined course for trainingfeldsher-midwives was given in 1879 in a school in Kishinev andeventually all feldshers whether male or female were giventraining in obstetrics and gynecology (Ramer 218-234, 1978).In addition to the schools for civilian feldshers andfeldsher-midwives, there were ten military feldsher schools, 'There was one formal attempt to upgrade the skills of thepovitukhi.In 1888 in Saratov Province a group was given a onemonthcrash course in modern obstetrics with the idea that theparticipants would return to the countryside to practice (Ramer1978, 231). This was quite similar to the philosophy behind thetraining of the barefoot doctor in modern China which will bediscussed in the next chapter. 39mainly in central Russia. The schools varied in curricula andadmission requirements, but most gave three or four-year courses.Graduates who passed a state examination received a diploma andthe title of feldsherUnionization of workers, which began on a large scale in thetwentieth century, also benefitted the feldshers. They and otherlower rank hospital personnel were among the first to form unionsat the very start of the century (Navarro 1977, 20). Physiciansestablished their own organization, the All-Union of MedicalPersonnel, in 1905 (Field 1967, 28).5With the start of the Revolutionary Period in 1917,feldshers and physicians found themselves deeply involved in thepolitical struggle on opposite sides. The physicians generallysupported Alexander Kerensky's provisional government. They were staunchly opposed to the Bolshevikleadership, whose proposals for widespread healthreforms posed a threat to the autonomy and privilegedlivelihood enjoyed by the profession. Lenin's notionof medicine as a collective endeavor involving citizenparticipation in control and decision making was atsharp variance with the bourgeois concept of anindividualistic, biological medical model (Pickard1987, 166). Physicians tended to hold \"liberal\" rather than\"proletarian\" views, while the Bolsheviks looked upon the doctors(except those who had made common cause with them) as \"bourgeois\" TodayallhealthworkersintheSovietUnionarerepresentedin one Union, the Union of Medical Workers.Thereare different sections for each type of health worker (Ryan 1978,67). 40class enemies (Field 1967, 28). Instead of the physicians, theBolsheviks turned to the feldshers (who now numbered about30,000) and the feldsher unions for support \"because they wereamong the former exploited classes\" (Field 1967, 29) and hadbegun to occupy a more favored position in society. Feldsherswere urged to assume leadership in health affairs and to \"cut thephysicians down to size\" (Field 1967, 29). The regime establishedone union for all health personnel, but initially physicians,pharmacists and veterinarians refused to join. Finally, in 1920,pharmacists and veterinarians joined, but physicians remainedoutside (Field 1957, 63). When membership in the union became acondition for employment in health posts, the physicians finallyjoined up.when the Bolsheviks seized power, there were only 20,000physicians for a population of 150 million, one for every 7,500.The inadequacy of health care was complicated by the outbreak ofa typhus epidemic. In 1920 one in every twenty-five people hadthe disease, with five million deaths reported (Sidel, V. and R.,1983, 187-189). At the height of the epidemic, Lenin told theSeventh Congress of Soviets: \"Either the lice defeat socialism orsocialism defeats the lice\" (Field 1967, 62).The Bolsheviks were dedicated tJ guaranteeing medicalservice to all without charge. In order to train badly neededhealth care personnel quickly, they opened new medical schools.Initially Lenin granted preference for admission to children ofworking class or peasant background (Pickard 1987, 166). But 41even in these recruiting efforts, emphasis was placed uponacademic merit and examination results (Sidel, V. and R., 1983,189).During the medical expansion of the early Bolshevik era,attempts were made to diminish the role of the feldsher andelevate that of the physicians. \"Feldsherism was consideredsecond-class rural medicine and in trying to equalize carebetween rural and urban areas the Soviets planned that thefeldsher was to be upgraded or replaced by physicians. No newfeldsher schools were to be established, and younger feldsherswere to be sent to medical schools to be trained as physicians\"(Sidel, V. and R. 1968, 935). Four year technical midwifecolleges with upgraded admission requirements were set up.Medical education, facilities and personnel underwent a hugeexpansion during the industrialization period of 1928 to 1941.The number of medical students vastly increased, as did thosebeing trained in middle-level health care schools, includingfeldshers, nurses, midwives and pharmacists. At the same time,the health care sector became more hierarchical, centralized andstratified.Physicians were regarded as far more important thanfeldshers and nurses. Nevertheless, the Soviets in effectabandoned their initial intention of eliminating feldshers; theysimply performed too valuable a function in providing health careto areas and populations that would otherwise lack it. As willbe shown, after World War II, the role of the feldsher becamemore specialized, and feldsher training became more uniform. 42 Role of the Feldsher In urban and rural areas feldshers have developed verydifferent roles. In cities, their role is complementary orsubordinate to the physician (Storey 1972, 8).In rural areas,their role may be as a substitute or an alternative to thephysician (Kenyon 1985, 26).Recently the feldshers' role has diminished in urban areasthough they still are important in the ambulance service, inindustrial health centers and in schools. In rural areasfeldshers play an important part in delivering health care; thesmaller or more remote the location, the larger the role of thefeldshers.Many of these places could not provide adequatehealth care without them.The following sections discuss the location and theresponsibilities and importance of the feldsher in cities and inrural areas. The Feldsher in Urban Settings 1. Polyclinics and hospitals. In the Soviet Union, thepolyclinic is the site of primary medical care as well as ofoutpatient specialized care. The feldshers may give first aid,perform minor surgery, give immunizations and maintain records.Their duties are somewhat similar to those of an American nurse 43in an outpatient department, except for performing minor surgery.Many of the feldshers in polyclinics are medical studentspart way through their training. They consider this experience,which twenty- live percent of them have had, as valuablepreparatory work. They do not function as feldshers to earnmoney, since medical education is free and many medical studentsget stipends (Sidel, V.,1968, 935).The experience gained isoften significant. \"In hospitals under the direction of adoctor, a feldsher is allowed to open abscesses, remove foreignbodies, make plasters, perform stomach washouts, and so on.\"(Ferguson 1973, 1411).2. Industrial health stations. These are located infactories, plants and other heavy industry installations. Inmany of these stations, the feldsher's role is crucial. In fact,the feldsher health post is the primary unit of industrial healthcare in the Soviet Union, with a responsibility \"to provideinitial medical care before the arrival of the physician in casesof sudden illness or injury, and to carry out preventive hygienicmeasures on industrial premises\" (World Health Organization 1974, 31).Patrick Storey lists some of the feldsher's specific tasksin industrial health stations:a).Rendering emergency care in case of catastrophicillness or injury.b).Getting the patient quickly and safely into the systemof emergency care. 44 c).Organizing periodic medical examinations and referringpatients to a medical specialist under the supervision of aphysician.d).Observing the industrial health program of a shop,monitoring adverse conditions, and if necessary preparingproposals to improve those conditions from a health standpoint. e).Writing monthly reports about diseases or illnessescausing temporary incapacity for work.f).Administering injections and other treatments which thepatient is scheduled to receive on a recurrent basis.It should be emphasized that in performing such duties, thefeldsher is always responsible to a physician, usually at anearby polyclinic; actual medical diagnosis amd decisions aremade by the doctor (Storey 172, 10).A good example of the scope and significance of work done byfeldshers in industrial health stations is provided by a hugetractor factory in Uzbekistan. There twelve feldshers work andlive in a medical facility. The health stations are open twenty-four hours a day. The feldshers are responsible for routinephysical examinations, immunizations, periodic radiologicscreenings and gynecological checkups. In addition, they aretrained to provide stress counseling and what they refer to assex therapy--actually, sex education.The feldshers also havethe responsibility of sampling air, water and soil around thefactory for possible toxic content (Kenyon 19850 29).3. Subway stations and other public areas.Health stations 45in large Soviet cities are located in certain centers of activitywhere people congregate, including some subway stations.Theseare somewhat more sophisticated than simple first-aid stations.The feldsher here has two basic functions: to render appropriate\"dovrachebnaya\" care and, if necessary, to activate the medicalcare system.Dovrachebnaya, meaning predoctor, refers to thekind of care that is rendered while waiting for a physician toarrive.The health station of the Komosmolskaya subway stop inMoscow is staffed by five feldshers. Its facilities includeample, clean quarters with bed space for one person, variousfirst-aid equipment, and appropriate drugs. About 500 peoplevisit the health station per month. Usually they want nothingmore than an aspirin or to have a foreign body removed from an eye.Sometimes, however, the onset of a serious illness may bedetected (Storey 1972, 9).4. Ambulance service. Working on ambulances that provideemergency medical services probably is the most demanding andstressful and accordingly most prestigious position of all forthe feldshers.In'urban areas, the feldsher's major contributionis as an ambulance worker, where they function like members ofthe emergency medical service in the United States (Sider., R.Interview, Fall, 1987).The Soviet Union's emergency service, called the SkorayaPomesch (First Aid, or literally, \"Quick Help\") dates from 1931(Torrey 1971, 45) and is highly advanced with an unusual degree 46of specialization. A citizen may dial 03 on any telephone forhelp.All calls go to a central switchboard where physiciansdecide whether to dispatch an ambulance, to have the patienttreated at home by an emergency care physician, or to refer thepatient to a local polyclinic. Russian hospitals do not haveemergency rooms (Knaus 1981, 230), so for many patients the\"Quick Help\" call provides entry into the medical system.Each ambulance carries a physician, a driver and at leastone feldsher, specially trained for emergency functions (Storey1972, 8).Seven types of specialized ambulances are in use,equipped specifically for cardiac, toxicological, psychiatric,pediatric, resuscitation-surgical, obstetric and traumaticemergencies (Kenyon 1985, 26). The coronary care ambulancecarries a physician and two feldshers and is equipped for EKGdiagnosis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and direct-currentdefibrillation of the heart (Storey 1972, 8). The feldsher'swork in the ambulance is under the supervision of the physician,whom they assist in carrying out emergency procedures. However,the feldshers also perform some procedures independently,including the use of breathing apparatus, administration ofnitrous oxide, anesthesia, application of splints, dispensingdrugs and preparing dressings (World Health Organization 1974,35).Victor Sidel has described a ride he took with a Sovietambulance team consisting of one physician, two feldshers and thedriver, as they answered a call: \"Everyone knew his role 47precisely.The physician was the unquestioned captain of theteam...But the feldsher(s) acted with little or no instructionfrom the physician ...There appeared an easy comraderie amongfeldshers and physicians from which the driver was left out.Their discussion was on the case they had just seen, on thenature of the Soviet health service and on the relative merits ofthe various types of vodka\" (Sidel, V. 196S, 936).Work on the Skoraya appears to be a prized position.Thereis a great preponderance of young physicians and feldshers withan unmistakable esprit de corps concerning their work (Storey1972, 9). Sixty percent of Skoraya Pomoshch ambulance feldshersare women, as compared to eighty to ninety percent of feldshersin all services. These figures are consistent with theproportions of women to men among Soviet physicians.Seventypercent of doctors are women although more than half of hospitaladministrators are men (Du Plessix Gray, 19 Feb. 1990, 58).womens' equality is written into the Soviet constitution and manyhave gone into medicine. However most of the specialists are men(Du Plessix Gray, 19 Feb. 1990, 58). Ninety percent of women arein primary care, the lowest level of medical practice, and fewerstill are in important policy making positions at the republicand All-Union level (Raffel 1984, 504).The large number ofwomen orezrating at the primary level may reflect the low pay ofthe average ordinary doctor, around 250 rubles a month comparedto the 450 or more earned by a skilled industrial worker (DuPlessix Gray, 19 Feb. 1990, 70). 485.Schools.Feldshers have a place in urban school systems.They assist physicians in carrying out preventive exams, and mayalso be called upon to provide first aid.School feldshers aresupervised by physicians in the children's polyclinic (World units.Feldshers working there assist physicians in avariety of tasks, including inspection of food, water, housing,waste disposal, vermin extermination and communicable diseasecontrol (Roemer 1962, 384). They also assist sanitarians inassuring the effectiveness of measures instigated by thesanitation-epidemiological service in workshops, catering placesand other establishments.7. Rest homes and sanatoriums. In a sense, these serve as abridge between the urban and rural, for patients come from bothbackgrounds.The rest homes are health resorts for workers andtheir families and are free or charge rates below cost.Patientsstay for twenty-four days and have individualized programs ofdiet, exercise and sports. Special medical treatments mayinclude mud baths, mineral applications and ultra-violetexposure.At a typical rest home on the Baltic Sea, besidesmonitoring medications and treatments, the resident feldsher actsas a social director, planning team sports events and otheractivities.In his book Inside Russian Medicine, Dr. WilliamKnaus, who is critical of many aspects of the Soviet health care 5t; 49system, writes favorably of the sanatoriums.He concludes:\"Sanitorium treatment is one of the most desired services theSoviet medical care system provides. For twenty-four days eachperson receives individual attention, in itself a rare Sovietprivilege\" (251).The increase in the number of physicians now working inurban areas in the Soviet Union has inevitably led to acontraction in the activities of feldshers, who are found lessfrequently than before in hospitals and polyclinics.However,they remain very much in use in industrial plants and especiallyin the ambulance service. In all cases they are not doctorsubstitutes, but rather extensions of the doctor. In a factoryor a health station, a feldsher will tell an employee that heneeds medical care, but it is always the physician at thepolyclinic who is responsible for the patient. In all aspects ofurban health activities, even in the emergency service, thefeldsher is under the direct supervision of a physician.This isin direct contrast to their activities inr'1 areas. The Feldsher in Rural Settings According to the most recent estimates, the Soviet Union has995,600 physicians cr 374 per 100,000 population.This figuregives it the second highest rate for any developed countryfollowing Israel. It is estimated that nearly one-third of theworld's physicians are in the U.S.S.R (Raffel 1984, 493). r- 50Yet the Soviet Union faces the same problem as many otherindustrialized countries: a maldistribution of physiciansresulting from their reluctance to work in rural areas. Tocombat this situation, the authorities assign most new physiciansto rural areas for the first three years of their practice. Oncethere, they are encouraged to remain, through incentives likelarge apartments, generous retirement provisions, increasedsalaries and the right to purchase an automobile.Yet very fewstay. Some succeed in avoiding rural service altogether, eitherthrouah advanced training (available only to those withoutstanding averages in medical school) or through usingpolitical connections to avoid rural work. One survey found thatthirty percent of all interns fail to show up for ruralassignments.Partly because of the lack of physicians, feldshers in ruralareas tend to develop more independent roles than their urbancounterparts, and in some cases become substitute doctors. Asurvey in 1968 showed that in rural settlements feldshersoccupiedeight percent of the 'posts designated for sectorgeneral physicians, and 12.7 percent of the posts for sectorpediatricians.The feldsher's duties are spelled out in the \"RegulationsConcerning the Rights and Duties of the Feldsher\"/ ratified bythe Ministry of Health of the U.S.S.R. on June 6, 1946 andprinted in translation in the U.S. government publication \"TheSoviet Feldsher as a Physician's Assistant.\"According to this 5S 51document, feldsher's work at rural health stations includes\"epidemic control measures; reduction of childhood morbidity andmortality; early case finding, observation and medical servicesfor tuberculosis, malignant tumors and other diseases; provisionof pre-doctor medical aid to adults and children and othertherapeutic procedures prescribed by the doctor; sanitary andhygienic measures to improve the living and working conditions ofthe people engaged in farm production; and health education\"(Sidel, V. and R., 1983, 201).The feldsher's role in rural areas must be viewed against abackground of the diminished hospital care available in thecountry-side as opposed to the city. Rural district hospitalshave only between 35 and 50 beds. For advanced medical treatmentit is necessary to go to the \"rayon\" hospitals, which havebetween 200 and 250 beds and also provide specialized care.Particularly important in rural areas are the feldsher-midwife posts, usually located on the outskirts of medicaldistricts and serving a population that ranges from 700 to 3,000.Feldsher-midwife posts are also found on state farms, mechanizedlumbering centers and tractor repair centers. Sometimes theseare almost the equivalent of a hospital in miniature.Midwivesrun an outpatient surgery for gynecological cases, monitorpregnant women and take care of infants up to one year of age.Following is a description of the conditions at a typical midwifepost from the Los Angeles Times. 59 52The atmosphere of Natasha's cleanly swept three roompost - cheery-looking even on a grey midwinter morning - isreminiscent of a rural American country doctor's office of60 years ago.There is a freshly painted white medicine cabinetstanding on the linoleum floor behind a desk. Thecabinet contains bandages, a thermometer and a fewsimple instruments. A poster on the wall warns of thedangers of alcoholism.Outside, near the front door, an old fashionediron-handled pump rises out of the snow, the post'sonly source of running water.But it is Natasha, wearing a white coat and aRussian medic's high domed cap who dominates the scene(Nelson 1988, 19). In 1972 there were 89,718 feldsher-midwife posts, the mostnumerous of the health service units in the country (Ryan 1978,72).Both feldshers and midwives work 6 1/2 hours a day andaverage from seven to ten outpatients daily (World HealthOrganization 1974, 40).The extensive use of feldshers and midwives in rural areashas not been without its critics in the Soviet health community.The basic complaint is that feldshers in many regions are doingmore than they have been trained to do. Under governmentregulations, feldshers are supposed to refer patients withanything more than minor complaints to the nearest polyclinic orhospital, and physicians are supposed to visit feldsher postsevery two weeks. In actuality, this often is not done, becausephysicians are not available in sufficient strength, and becauseof their reluctance to practice in rural areas.In the recent past, attention has also been drawn to themedical shortcomings of the feldshers themselves. A 1966 study (1,9 53in Meditsinskaya Gazeta (Medical Gazette), the journal of theU.S.S.R. Ministry of Health and the Central Committee of theUnion of Medical Workers, reported that feldshers had particulardifficulty in recognizing diphtheria, dysentery and tuberculosis,and had also made errors in diagnosing cardiovascular disease.The study was based on a total population of 130,000 of whom 75.4percent lived in areas served by feldsher-midwife posts (Ryan1978, 75).The study concluded Partly responsible for all this is the lack ofday-by-day control of the feldsher's work. In manyinstances errors are the result of carelessness andnegligence...The main work of the medical personnel ofthe feldsher-midwife stations concerns prevention. Incases of serious illness it is the duty of thefeldsher, after having diagnosed the disease andrendered first aid, to send the patient immediately toa specialist.But this rule is very often disregarded.Some instances give rise to great alarm (Sidel, V.1968, 938). Reports like these had the effect of bringing about policychanges in certain areas. In 1967 the Health Minister of Georgiadeclared: \"We consider that the rural population should visitonly a doctor for initial medical care.\" As a result, manyfeldsher-midwife posts were shut down in Georgia and replaced byambulatories (clinics) staffed by doctors. The proportion ofpatients receiving initial medical care in Georvia rose to eightypercent (Ryan 1978, 76). A similar reorganization was ordered inthe Ukraine.Soviet authorities would like to believe that even wherefeldshers continue to substitute for physicians, the situation is 1;1 54only temporary. Their official contention is stated in thesewords: \"One of the chief sources of pride in the Soviet medicalsystem is that every Soviet citizen, no matter where he lives,has access to a physician\" (Knaus 1981, 257).However, Soviet health-care planners are realistic enough toaccept the fact that eliminating the feldsher as a doctorsubstitute in many rural areas will be a difficult task lastingmany years if, indeed, it is ever fully accomplished. Lack ofpopulation density, smallness of village size, limitedcommunication, adverse climactic conditions, and difficulty ofretaining doctors in the backwoods all are stubborn problems thatmust be overcome.Consequently, not all the Soviet Republics are following theexample of Georgia and the Ukraine in attempting to replacefeldshers with physicians. Instead, as an alternative, some aretrying to upgrade the feldsher-midwife services by institutingcourses to improve their clinical competence, and providingtraining in laboratory techniques - a process that is lessexpensive and more practical in achieving medical services.The Uzbekistan Republic in south central Asia, with apopulation of eight million, has set up new medical collegesaimed at improving the qualifications of mid-level medicalworkers and has also established seminars, conferences and ten-day courses for them at district medical centers. The Republichas adopted a deliberate policy of relying extensively onfeldshers and midwives particularly in rural areas. The Republic 55has thirty-one physicians and eighty-six mid-level medicalpersonnel (i.e., feldshers and midwives) per 1,000 population.Uzbekistan's former Health Minister, Dr. A. Khudaibergenov,in an article in World Health Forum in 1986, points out how thefeldsher's activities in recent years have undergone expansion: Today (the feldsher's work) no longer consists merelyof carrying out vaccinations, monitoring conditions ofhygiene and providing health education, but alsoincludes performing preventive examinations,maintaining a watch on the health of women and childrenand organizing health education courses; measures arealso taken in connection with the observation andclinical treatment of the sick (Khudaibergenov 1986,239). In other words, the feldsher is alive and well inUzbekistan. 56 Education and Status Training for a feldsher is 2 1/2 years for those with elevenyears of primary schooling and 3 1/2 years for those with eightyears of primary schooling (Sidel, V., 1968, 64). In addition tostandard medical courses, students also study politicalphilosophy and are required to take physical education. All theteachers are physicians, not feldshers, and training emphasizesthe theoretical rather than the practical. All graduates mustpass a standard oral exam. Training is free and livingaccommodations are sometimes provided. The top five percent ofthe graduates may apply to medical school, while the rest mayapply after two to three years of work. It is estimated thattwenty to thirty percent of physicians in the Soviet Union wereinitially trained as feldshers (Kenyon 1986, 26).Until Mikhail Gorbachev took power, training for a physicianhad been six years. In an attempt to improve medical care in theSoviet Union, training has been lengthened to seven years.Atthe end of seven years the physician will have to pass anexamination not only on theory but on practical skills. \"Not allof those who finish higher school will receive a physician'sdiploma.Those who cannot cope with the full program willreceive a feldsher's diploma\" (Current Digest of the SovietPress 1987, 4). It is too soon to know how feldshers' trainingwill be affected by the Gorbachev era. Perhaps higher standards 6,1 57and a longer period of training will be required. The monthlyjournal Feldsher and Midwife celebrated its fiftieth anniversaryin 1986, and feldshers are encouraged to attend conferences withcontinuing education being honored and rewarded.The number of feldshers reported varies from a half millicn(Knaus 1981, 256) to one million (Kenyon 1985, 26) with a 1975study estimating the number at 545,000 (Nelson 1988, 19). Abo-.:t300000 new feldshers enter the field each year and they make uptwenty-two percent of the total number of middle medical workers.The rest are nurses, midwives, dental doctors, dental techniciansand pharmacists (Raffel 1984, 505).The status of the feldsher is high relative to other medicalworkers such as nurses* and lab personnel but low in relation tcthat of the physician. He or she holds the place of one who hasgraduated from a secondary vocational school and not from auniversity.Beginning salaries range from 70-90 percent ofstarting salaries of physicians which are less than 250 rubles amonth. However, established rural feldshers often earn more thannew physicians since their salary increases with experience.Feldshers in rural areas are given allotments to buy homes orapartments which provide an incentive to stay in the area (Kenvcn1985, 26).Most of the feldshers who work in the rural areascome from such areas themselves. One reason is that many of *Nurses'trainingisa yearshorterthanthatofthefeldsher in the USSR (Anthony-Tkach 19850 45). Based on the bockInside Russian Medicine (1981) their functions sound more similarto that of a nurse's aide in this country. 58these areas require only eight years of schooling rather than tenyears which means rural graduates are eligible for middle medicalworker schools but not medical institutes (Sidel, V. 1968, 986).However Frank Field also points out that since the feldshers areof peasant origin themselves they \"are not too reluctant toreturn to the village with the added prestige of the educatedperson\" (1967, 127).This situation may have its advantage. \"The feldsherinderstands the psychology of the rural population much betterthan the doctor fresh from the city, he can speak local dialectsand is considered by the local people as one of their own.\"Finally, as already noted, many Soviet doctors resist working inrural areas because they would rather become specialists, whichmeans studying and practicing in a large urban center with accessto a specialty hospital. Ruth Sidel said in 1988 that the onlyphysicians who would practice in rural areas in the Soviet Unionwould be doctors from the rural areas themselves. \"You can'ttrain somebody from Moscow and expect them to settle in Siberia\"(Sidel, R., Interview). Perhaps the Soviets should try toencourage people from rural areas to become doctors instead offeldshers.Although the feldsher will never hold the status of aphysician, in rural areas the importance of his or her role isgenerally acknowledged and accepted. Meditsinskaya Gazeta hashad praise for the feldsher. \"Thousands of rural feldshers andmidwives set magnificent examples of selfless work and of an Et; 5 9eager desire to improve medical services to the villagepopulation; they display creative initiative and extensiveknowledge in the course of their work\" (Sidel, V. 1968, 988). f\") 60 Conclusion The institution of feldsherism continues to have problems.Feldshers are not considered independent health care providersand do not report to senior feldshers but to physicians.Thistends to lower their prestige and weaken their status'. Even inrural areas where the feldsher may be the only health careprovider for miles, technically he or she is still responsible tothe district physician. They do not have their own organization,but are part of the Union of Medical Workers. This paper alreadyhas mentioned that their medical expertise has been questioned.Some feldshers would like to have doctors working with them.Tanya, a feldsher in Western Siberia, complained that she had nodoctor to work with for over three years. \"We did have a doctorfor a few months but there wasn't enough for him to do in thewinter and he didn't like any of the girls, so he went to staywith a friend in Moscow\" (Knaus 1981, 258).Not all feldshers are pleased with the amount of recognitionthey get.Victor-Sidel quotes a feldsher who says, \"There arelarge numbers of feldshers who have given many years of theirlife to their noble work - the care of the health of the people.In what way has this selfless toil been rewarded?We know thatthere exists in our country the title of Honored Physician. Butthere is no title Honored Feldsher\" (Sidel, V. 1968, 987).However, in the Uzbek Republic, evidence is growing that the f; S 61Soviet Union is slowly beginning to accept the permanentexistence of the feldsher and is no longer treating feldsherismas second class rural medicine. A. Khudaibergergenov, the formerMinister of Health of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, wrotein 1986, \"Clearly, the volume of medical care below the physicianlevel provided for the most part at feldsher/midwife posts isconsiderable\" (Khudaibergenov 1986, 238). This republic Day\" and \"Feldsher's Day\" for the bestworkers, \"honored feldsher\" is not far off.\"Large number of feldshers will certairly continue for several decaeies to come\" (Ryan1978, 76).According to an article that appeared in the Los AngelesTimes on May 15, 1988, the role of the feldsher is alive andwell.He or she is still a vital part of the emergency medicalservice, \"an area where the Soviets have matched or even outdonethe accomplishments of Western medicine,\" even though his or herrole may be diminishing in other urban areas. However themajority of people in rural areas still use the feldsher as theirpoint of entry into the health care system.Judging from articles published in the journal FeldsherAkusherka (Feldsher and Midwife) from the years 1985 to 1988, thefeldsher's role is varied with an emphasis towards healtheducation, although he continues active in treatment as well.Some titles are \"The Role of the Feldsher in Fighting DrugAbuse\", \"Pathogenesis, Clinical Picture, Treatment, Epidemiology 62and Prevention of AIDS,\" \"Angina\" and \"Diet Therapy in Obesity.\"Topics that listed materials for giving health education talksincluded sex education for girls, advice for women in controllingdrunkenness, and organization of an evening for the health ofyouth.Several articles were on the history of the feldsher andone celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Feldsher I Akusherka. There may be definite advantages to be gained if the SovietUnion accepts the existence of feldsherism, upgrades his or hertraining program and gives each feldsher the recognition he orshe deserves.Being from rural areas, feldshers can speak thelanguage of the people and understand their traditions andcustoms.It may not be realistic for the Soviets to expect thatphysicians will settle permanently in rural areas when suchregions are still so underdeveloped and without the stimulationand amenities of cities. Finally the fact that the feldsher'srole has lasted since the eighteenth century may in itself be asign that it is appreciated in the population. As will be seenin the next two sections, other countries are studying theinstitution of the feldsher, learning from its good and badpoints, and adapting it in their own versions of the middlemedical worker. 63 Chapter IV The Barefoot Doctor of China The Chinese Health Care System Today On the basis of size alone, China would need extraordinarymethods to provide adequate health care to its people. Itspopulation, 1,069,628,000 (World Almanac 1990/ 699), is theworld's largest, with 80 percent living in rural areas.Unfortunately, China is still very poor, with a per capita 1983GNP that is only 1/30th that of the United States. Consequently,there are vast numbers of people who could benefit from medicalcare but insufficient wealth to support a large, sophisticatedmedical system (Sidel, V. and R. 1983, 210).Impressive improvements have nevertheless been made since1949 when Mao Zedong formally established the People's Republicof China.From that year to 1981, average 3ife expectancy almostdoubled', infant mortality declined sharply and malaria was allbut wiped out. The barefoot doctors who were involved not only 'In 1950, theaverage life expectancy was thirty-two years.By 1985 it had increased to sixty-nine years (Worden 1988, 90). 71 64in primary medical care but in carrying out disease preventionpolicies and health education played a significant role in thesedevelopments.Health care in China is more decentralized than in theSoviet Union with more planning and decision making occurring onthe local level. The Ministry of Health in Beijing sets generalguidelines to be carried out on the provincial level. Eachprovincial health department is in charge of the medical schoolsin its area and oversees its hospital system. Although theprovincial authorities supervise medical schools and the hospitalsystem in cities and rural counties, they do not directly managelocal hospitals or health activities (Raffel 1984, 134). Unlikein the Soviet Union, health care is not free, with patientspaying for their own primary care, sometimes with the aid ofinsurance.These economic aspects will be discussed later.Health care on the local level in China is organized in athree tier system in both urban and rural areas. In urban areas,the first tier consists of paramedical personnel known as workeror red guard doctors. They are employed in factory andneighborhood Red Cross stations and deliver basic primary care.More serious cases are referred to the district hospital, and themost serious are referred to municipal hospitals. However, manygovernment agencies and state enterprises bypass this system andsend their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals(Hsiao 1984, 933).In rural areas, the first tier is made up of barefoot 65doctors who deliver primary care out of village medical centers.For more serious cases, patients are referred to the communehealth center where there are assistant doctors, and then to thecounty hospitals which are staffed by senior doctors with degreesfrom five year medical schools (Worden 1988, 90). For millionsof Chinese it is the barefoot doctor who provides basic healthcare. The barefoot doctor or first tier, is the basis of primaryhealth care in rural China. Unlike the feldsher of the SovietUnion, the barefoot doctor is a product of modern times. On June26, 1965, Mao Zedong issued a directive which said, \"In healthand medical work, put the stress on rural areas\" (Schram 1974,233).It was after this date that the barefoot doctor was bornand his training began.Barefoot doctors come from the peasantry, serve thepeasantry and to a varying extent remain part of the peasantry.They provide some basic medical treatment, but they do so withoutceasing to perform productive agricultural work. The name\"barefoot doctor\".came into use because in the south peasantsactually worked barefoot in the rice paddies (Sidel, V. 1972,1293). -.3 66 Health Care in China, 1949-1965: Before the Barefoot DoctorPrior to Liberation (1949) Prior to 1949, there were about 40,000 doctors of Westernmedicine to serve a population of approximately 540 million people.Preventive medicine was almost non-existent.Mostdeaths were due to infectious diseases complicated bymalnutrition.Almost all the doctors were concentrated in largecities (Sidel, V. 1972, 1293). Peasants in the rural areas andthe poor people of the cities relied on the practitioners oftraditional Chinese medicine whose training and experience varied considerably.Chinese traditional medicine, which is believed to have beencodified in 2500 B.C. in Huanydi Neiiing (The Yellow Emperor'sClassic of Internal Medicine), differs from most other currentsystems of folk medicine.Like other systems, it makes use of empirical observation, questioning patients and physical examination.For therapy, it relies heavily on medicinal herbs.It also employs, however, such distinctively Chinese treatments as acupunctureand moxibustion (the application of heat to sites on the skin)(Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 20).In addition it has a unique philosophical basis, by which a balance is supposed to bemaintained between the forces of yin and yang. Yin representsthe feminine and negative principle, as of passivity, depth, 67darkness, cold and wetness; while yang represents the masculineand positive principle, reflected in activity, height, light,heat and dryness. The concept is religious and metaphysicalrather than medical, yet traditional Chinese medicine holds thatyin and yang must be in balance within the human system if thebody is to be in good health (Walton 1986, 1480).Before 1949, no real attempt was made to systematicallynumber the practitioners of traditional medicine in China. A1930 study, made for the League of Nations, estimated that therewere about 1.2million traditional practitioners in China plusseven million\"druggists\" or dispensers of herbs. However, RalphCroizier, who has examined the relat' Alship between Chinesetraditional and modern Western medicine in greater depth than anyother scholar, expressed disbelief at these figures, noting thatthey \"probably included every kind of old style healer and drugpeddler\" (1968, 37). When the Peking government did attempt anofficial listing in 1955, it registered 486,700 traditional stylephysicians.However, the actual number of those practicing thistype of medicine was undoubtedly higher, for the governmenttotals did not include thousands of part-time herbalists,bonesetters or acupuncturists.Whatever their number, traditional doctors often ignored themass of poor peasants in favor of the landed gentry or governmentofficials who were better able to pay them.Dr. Joshua H. Horn,an Englishphysician who worked in China from 1954 to 1969,reported that before the advent of the Communist regime, 68traditional doctors \"were closely linked with the landlords andofficials,\" with many of them demanding transportation costs inaddition to a fee when they 7isited a patient (Horn 1969, 124).As a result, peasants often went to other healers, includingpractitioners of magic and witchcraft. However, there alwayswere a number of traditional doctors who pursued their callingconscientiously without excessive fees.Dr. Horn, after fifteen years of practicing medicine inChina, gives some insight into the training and effectiveness ofthe traditional practitioner: In many villages, a peasant with a flairfor acupuncture or manipulation wouldgradually acquire a reputation and wouldbe called in to treat the sick. He wouldoften train his son who, in turn, wouldextend his skill by learning to recognizeand infuse wild medicinal herbs. Althoughthese village doctors were illiterate andalthough the medicine they practiced wascrude and rudimentary, they did a certainamount of good and created the socialclimate for the subsequent training of truepeasant doctors (Horn 1969, 124-125). From Liberation to the Great Leap Forward (1949 - 1957) On October 1, 1949, the Communist government, headed by MaoZedong, assumed control of the entire country of China andproclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China iPeking.From the start, the new government made health care ahigh priority. The first National Health Congress was held in 7t; 69Peking in August, 1950 (Sidel V. and R. 1982, 28).Fournational principles were laid out: 1.Medicine should serve the workers,peasants and soldiJrs.2.Preventive medicine should take precedenceover therapeutic medicine.3.Chinese traditional medicine should beintegrated with Western scientific medicine.4.Health work should be combined with massmovements (Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 28). The new government actually put these principles into actionand, as a result, China has made impressive health gains.Beforethe liberation life expectancy at birth was estimated to be about,thirty-five years while in 1981 it was 69.6 years for women and67.0 years for men (Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 94).This change waslargely due to a reduction in the infant mortality rate , butthere were other significant factors, like a decline in theincidence of infectious disease and a sharp drop in malnutrition.Infectious diseases have been replaced by cancer, stroke andheart disease as the leading causes of death, thereby bringingChinese mortality tables into closer alignment with those of theWest.These health gains have been brought about in part byimprovements in nutrition, sanitation and the general livingstandard, but a major role has been played by the changes inhealth and medical care (Sidel, V. and R. 1983, 210-211). To In Shanghai, the infant mortality rate fell from 150per1,000 births in 1948 to 12.6 per 1,000 births today. In the sameperiod malaria sufferers fell from5.5 percent of the populationto 0.3 percent (Sidel, V. and R. 1983, 210). .77 70carry out the first principle, \"Serve the workers, peasants andsoldiers,\" Chairman Mao's regime ordered an immediate increase inthe numbers of health personnel. The Soviet model of educationwas used, and Russian medical authorities were called in toprovide technical advice and assistance. New medical schools andteaching hospitals were established, and some of the olderinstitutions were moved from cities on the east coast:furtherwest, where the need was greater and facilities fewer. At manyof the older institutions, class sizes were greatly expanded(Sidel, V. and R. 1982* 28-29).Emphasizing modern, Western-style medicine, higher medicaleducation now consisted of a six year curriculum following thecompletion of twelve years of previous schooling. The ChinaMedical College developed an eight-year curriculum, butconcentrated on the training of teachers and researchers (Sidel,V. and R. 1982, 29). More than fifteen times as many doctorsgraduated between 1949 and 1964 as in the preceding twenty years(Horn 1969, 327). By 1957, Theodore Fox, the editor of Lancet,estimated that there were 70,000 physicians practicing modernmethods, almost double the number in 1949 (1957, 936). By 1967,there was a total of 150,000 practicing physicians, a ratio ofone doctor per 5,000 people, for the population of between 750and 800 million (Sidel, V. 1972, 1293). In industrializedcountries in 1967, the ratio was usually one doctor per 1,000(Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 29). While still lagging behind theWest, the Chinese had narrowed the gap considerably, since in 711949 the ratio had been one doctor per 25,000 people.Unfortunately, most doctors in the 1950's remainedconcentrated in cities, despite efforts by the Ministry of Healthto channel new manpower into the countryside. In 1963, theMinistry stationed most of the 25,000 graduating physiciansin county hospitals and mining enterprises (Sidel, V. and R.1973, 24).Nevertheless, the majority of health care workersremained in urban areas.During the early fifties, Chinese health officials followedthe Soviet model, not only in training large numbers of fullyfledged doctors, but in creating a vastly enlarged corps of mid-level medical workers, including assistant doctors (comparable tothe Soviet feldsher), nurses, midwives, pharmacists, techniciansand sanitarians. Most of these middle medical workers had two crthree years technical training after nine years of generalschooling (Sidel, V. and R. 1972, 1293). By 1967, there wereapproximately 172,000 assistant doctors, 186,000 nurses, 42,000mids.ives arid 100,000 pharmacists, technicians and sanitarians.These newly trained mid-level personnel, like physicians, wereconcentrated in urban areas.In addition, lay people in the community were mobilized toperform many health-related tasks themselves, accomplishingtogether what they could not do individually.One of the bestknown of these campaigns, initiated in 1952, was aimed ateliminating the \"four pests\": flies, mosquitos, rats and grain-eating sparrows (Rosenthal 1987, 79).When it became apparent, 7 2within a few years, that the destruction of sparrows was havingunwanted ecological effects, lice, cockroaches and bedbugs weresubstituted for the birds as targets of the \"Patriotic HealthCampaign\" organized by the government.The regime also encouraged people to build sanitationfacilities and to keep their neighborhoods clean. Campaignsagainst specific diseases and opium use were also mounted. Oneparticularly noteworthy drive was launched in DPcember, 1955against schistosomiasis, a helmetic disease contracted by workingbarefoot in contaminated water. Snails are a reservoir for theworms, so that peasants were organized to fight against snails.They were given extensive information about the disease throughlectures, films, posters and radio programs. Special healthstations were set up in infested areas to co-ordinate anddirect eradication efforts (Public Health in the People'sRepublic of China 1986, 33). Voluntary labor was called in tojoin with the peasants, including students, teachers, officeworkers and soldiers. \"They drained the rivers and ditches,buried the banks of the river and smoothed down the t-aried dirt\"(Sidel, V. and R. 1983, 224). As a result, by 1985 the diseasehad been totally eradicated in Shanghai and Guangdong and wasalmost completely eliminated in all other areas of infestation(Public Health in the People's Republic of China 1986, 34).Although the mass campaigns against certain disease carrierswere very successful, other high-priority efforts of theCommunist government moved much more slowly. Among these was an 73effort to integrate Chinese traditional medicine known as Chuno-iwith Western scientific medicine, known as Hsi-i (Quinn 1973, 8- 9).Chairman Mao laid down as one of the four nationalprinciples at the National Health Congress in 1950 that \"Chinesetraditional medicine should be integrated with Western scientificmedicine.\"This effort involved three main goals: 1.To make full use of those elements of Chinesemedicine that had been found effective.Acupuncture,for instance, was one of the basic tools of Chung-i andits usefulness was well-documented. The new healthadministrators had no intention of abandoning it. 2.To provide greater acceptance of Western techniquesin rural areas. The peasantry for generations had beenaccustomed to traditional practices, and it was felt thatWestern techniques must be introduced gradually and side-by-side with these older methods if they were to be accepted atall.3.To efficiently employ the large number ofpractitioners of traditional medicine. With China'sshortage of medical health personnel, obviously there was aneed to keep the Chung-i doctors at work along with thosemore attuned to modern methods (Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 32). In November, 1958, for the first time, a class of modernChinese doctors followed the newly instituted modern curriculumby also studying Chinese traditional medicine at the PekingChinese Medical Research Institute. Ralph Croizier, describedthe purpose of the training:The objective is a new type of doctor, versedin both Chinese and Western medicine, and onewho has acquired Communist consciousnessunder the immediate leadership of Partycommittees...In other words, a new type ofdoctor was wanted--not just Red and expert,but Red, Chinese and expert (Crozier 1968,185). 74The kind of doctor Croizier is describing clearly embodiespolitical virtues as well as medical expertise; he or she is asymbol of the new China, reflecting a willingness to utilize thescientific advances of the West, yet still taking pride inindigenous Chinese technical methods and cultural values.In 1959, the Chinese Medical Association for the first timeagreed to include traditional doctors in its membership; 3,000 ofthem enrolled. Nevertheless, the integration efforts ran intomany problems(Croizier reviews them extensively in hisTraditional Medicine in Modern China).Basically, both sides--the traditional Chung-i doctors and the doctors trained inWestern medicine--resented the integration campaign. TheWestern-style doctors resented Chung-i because of itspractitionersinability to explain its theoretical framework(such as the \"balance\" between yin and yang) in scientific terms.They also regard some of the traditional therapeutic methods asuseless.Some of the Western-style doctors dropped out ofclasses in traditional medicine whenever possible; they alsoignored traditional doctors on the staff of hospitals, or turnedhopeless cases over to them. Traditional c ctors, for theirpart, remained unconvinced in many cases of the superiority ofmodern western methods over what they regard as the tried andtrue practices of Chung-i (Rosenthal 1987,40).One result of this mutual resentment is that today there are two typfts ofmedical schools in China, the Western and thetraditional, as well as two types of hospitals offering either S2 75modern scientific or Chung-i treatment. Patients are offeredtheir choice. From \"The Great Leap Forward\" (1958-1960)to the Cultural Revolution (1965) In 1958, China launched its second five-year plan, designedto accelerate industrial and agricultural development. Known as\"The Great Leap forward\", its objective was to utilize thecountry's vast manpower to achieYe economic improvement withoutforeign help.Cooperatives were merged into people's communes,industry was spread out and all agricu:.tural resources weremobilized (Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars 1972, 411).Both industrially and agriculturally, the Gieat Leap Forwardwas a failure, lead.thg to extensive crop failures, and wasabandoned after a little over two years. However, in the healthfield it achieved a number of positive results. It brought aneffort to improve both treatment and prevention of disease inrural areas.The Great Leap Forward led to the creation ofpeople's communes, large groupings of agricultural workers, andthese orgtnizations were in the forefront of the new efforts atdisease control. Many of them established medical clinics and,equally important, launched the first tentative attempts atdisease prevention procedures (Horn 1969, 127). The campaignagainst the \"four pests\", begun four years earlier, wasaccelerated and expanded. 76Big city doctors trained in Western medicine continued to bereluctant to settle in the countryside; it was not until the mid-1960's that the Ministry of Health began to assign some of themthere on a regular basis. However, determined to carry the GreatLeap Forward into rural health care, the Ministry sent in mobileteams of urban doctors, nurses and assistants starting in thelate 1950's (Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars 19720 238).While these roving medical squads seldom treated patientsthemselves, they performed two valuable functions. They guidedand instructed local practitioners in disease prevention work.In addition, they gave training for six months or a year toindigenous health workers, including classroom instruction andclinical practice. Most of the health care in rural areascontinued to be provided by traditional local medical workers,some of whom still helped in the fields, but at least they hadthe benefit of special instruction and exposure to newtechniques.They also had, at least by implication, a kind ofendorsement from the Central Ministry of Health, which had sentthe urban doctors in to train them. The urban doctors, oncetheir six months or year was up, returned to the cities, leavingthe rural medical workers, with their added instruction andtraining, to cope with local health problems.It was these localworkers, trained under the Great Leap Forward, who were todevelop into the \"barefoot doctors\" who have played such asignificant role in China's recent health history. However, these S.1 77\"peasant doctors\", as Joshua Horn described them, did not have aneasy time.The patients on the whole welcomed them, but some _fMao's opponents within the regime and the urban medicalestablishments felt that the kind of treatment and therapy theyoffered were inadequate following the Great Leap Forward.As aresult, from about 1962 to 1965 the policy of training peasanthealth workers was suspended and emphasis shifted back toeducating doctors in modern medicine in the cities.Political factors are never far beneath the surface inChina.The reason for the turnaround in medical education andemphasis was that economic conditions had improved (grain, cottonand agricultural production rose in the early 1960's), and socialconditions were relatively stable. Witold Rodzinski, a Polishscholar of modern China, labeled the 1962-1965 period \"RespiteBefore the Storm\" (1988, 90-91).When the country began its recovery following the Great LeapForward, the effort to educate peasant doctors weakened and theiractual numbers began to decline. Figures for the country as awhole are hard to come by, but in the Shanghai area alone thenumber of peasant doctors dropped from 3,900 to 300 in the fouryears from 1961 to 1965 (Risse 1973, 131). Furthermore, a reportwas issued condemning the work of health workers in ruralcommunes and urging them to go back to their agricultural tasks.A few years later, during the Cultural Revolution, this samereport was denounced as \"revisionist\" (Sidel V. and R. 1973, 79). 78 The Barefoot Doctor Reaches Its Peak:The Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976 China, like many other countries, needs manymore doctors and needs them quickly.Chinalike all other countries, needs doctors whoare completely devoted to the welfare of theordinary people, who understand them, who arenot separated from them by barriers of cashor class and who can serve both theirimmediate and long-term needs. (Horn 1969, 135). Introduction and Definition The Cultural Revolution provided China with its greatestpolitical upheaval and unrest since the Communists gained controlof the country in 1949. By no coincidence, it also saw the riseof barefoot doctors to their position of greatest importance aminfluence.On June 26, 1965, Mao Zedong blasted the Ministry ofPublic Health (Wei-sheng:pu) which had been shaping health policyfrom 1949 to 1965. Tell the Ministry of Public Health that itonly works for fifteen per cent of the totalpopulation of the country and that thisfifteen per cent is mainly composed ofgentlemen, while the broad masses of thepeasants do not get any medical treatment.First they don't have any doctors; secondthey don't have any medicine. The Ministryof Public Health is not a Ministry of PublicHealth for the people, so why not change itsname to the Ministry of Urban Health, theMinistry of Gentlemen's Health, or even toMinistry of Urban Gentlemen's Health? 79Medical education should be reformed. There'sno need to read so many books. How manyyears did Hua T'o spend at college? How manyyears education did Li Shih-chen of the Mingdynasty receive? In medical education thereis no need to accept only higher middleschool graduates or lower middle schoolgraduates. It will be enough to give threeyears to graduates from higher primaryschools.They would then study and raisetheir standards mainly through practice. Ifthis kind of doctor is sent down to thecountryside, even if they haven't muchtalent, they would be better than quacks andwitch doctors and the villages would bebetter able to afford to keep them. The morebooks one reads the more stupid one gets. Themethods of medical examination and treatmentused by hospitals nowadays are not at allappropriate for the countryside, and the waydoctors are trained is only for the benefitof the cities. And yet in China over 500million of our population are peasants...In medical and health work put the emphasison the countryside! However sincere Mao may have been in his desire to bringhealth care to as wide a populace as possible, his programinevitably had its political aspects. Stressing health care inrural areas was part of Mao's broader socialist policy inbringing medical care to as many of the common people aspossible. There were those who continued to prefer that doctorsbe concentrated in the cities, in effect they maintained\"expensive specialized facilities for an urban elite\" (Risse1973, 43).Among the proponents of favoring the cities over thecountryside was Liu Shao-chi, slated to be Mao's successor aschairman of the People's Republic of China.During the Cultural Revolution itself, the urban medical S7 80establishment came into disrepute, with young students and theirleaders (known as \"Red Guards\") denouncing some Western-stylephysicians as intellectuals, \"revisionists\" and part of thebourgeoisie (Gittings 1989, 93). So during the decade of theCultural Revolution, which saw the triumph of Mao over Liu,China's medical showpiece became not the skilled medicalspecialist of the cities, but the village-based \"barefoot doctor\"who served the peasantry.The term \"Barefoot Doctor\" first appeared in print inSeptember, 1968 in an article in Hung Ch'i (Red Flag), the maintheoretical journal of the Chinese Communist party. \"Barefootdoctors,\" the article said, \"is an affectionate title that thepoor and lower-middle peasants on the outskirts of Shanghai havegiven to health workers who spend part of their time farming/ andpart in medical work\" (Risse 1973/ 132). Obviously the term hadbeen in use for some time before it was picked up by themagazine; in fact, by the time the article appeared there wereapproximately 4,500 barefoot doctors already functioning in theshanghai area. They had begun operating there around 1965 whenthe Ministry of Health resumed sending mobile medical teams intothe countryside. Unlike the roving squads of the late 1950s,these teams aztually delivered some medical services themselves,but they also gave groups of peasants medical training, so theycould provide treatment for their neighbors even while continuingto do farm work themselves.Both men and women were included among these barefoot ss 81doctors, with their over-all proportion approximately equal(Widmeyer 1984, 66). Like other commune members, the barefootdoctors were paid on the basis of work-points, and their incomewas the same as or slightly higher than that of other communeworkers.Since they didn't wear shoes when working in the ricepaddies, the peasants started calling them \"barefoot doctors\"(Wen 1974, 77). After the article in Hung Ch'i was published,the Shanghai model for barefoot doctors was implementednationally, aided considerably by Mao Zedong's endorsement.There is a problem translating \"barefoot doctors\" intoEnglish, the Chinese term being chijiao yisheng. Victor and RuthSidel argue that it is dangerous to equate yisheng with doctor,although that is what the term literally means (1973, 80).Theypoint out that Chinese health officials do not equate the chijiaoyisheng with regularly trained doctors, and that patients usuallyrefer to them not as yisheng bi!t as tongzhi, comrade, the commonform of address for everybody in China. The Sidels also notethat every barefoot doctor they came across in China in 1971 and1972 was wearing shoes. They report this definition given by anunnaMed official: \"A barefoot doctor is a peasant who has hadbasic medical training and gives treatment without leavingproductive work. He gets the name because in the south peasantswork barefooted in rice paddies\" (1973, 80).The Sidels feel that a more appropriate term would be\"peasant doctor\" or \"peasant health worker,\" which is the termJoshua Horn first used in describing their activities.Dr. 82Bernard Berelson, a former president of the World PopulationCouncil, wonders whether there would be so much interest inbarefoot doctors if they had been called ANMs--auxiliary nursemidwives--the term used for a somewhat similar low or mid-levelworker in India's health system (National Institute of Health,Public Health Service 1980, 43). Despite such opinions, theChinese peasants continue to refer to the health workers amongthem as barefoot doctors, as do the majority of Western observersand writers. Education/ Training/ Selection of the Barefoc).; Doctor Mao Zedong's order in 1965 to \"put the stress on ruralareas\" in health matters helped bring the barefoot doctor intobeing, but it did not spell out the methods of his development.As a result, for several years after 1965, the selection,training and education of the barefoot doctor was somewhathaphazard, varying from commune to commune, year to year,barefoot doctor to barefoot doctor. Very little wasstandardized.On the one hand, the result was a lack ofuniformity, which meant that medical care in rural areas variedwidely from place to place. On the other hand, training could betailored to meet a commune's need, including its specificeconomic situation.The most common mechanism of education was through themobile teams of urban doctors and other health personnel sent 83into the countryside to carry out Mao's edict to bring healthcare to rural areas. Some went as volunteers; Joshua Horndescribes a team of 107 being organized at his hospital in Pekingin 1965 to travel to northern Hopei, several hundred miles away(Horn 1969, 129). But other urban medical workers were assignedto stations in the countryside. There, they trained barefootdoctors for varying periods, ranging from three months to oneyear.Since bringing medical help to the countryside became apatriotic as well as a practical act, the People's LiberationArmy joined in enthusiastically, dispatching its own physiciansand other personnel. By June, 1969 the Army had sent more than4,000 medical teams and 300000 personnel to the countryside.Many of its own medical trainees remained in rural areas to workwith the barefoot doctors. In 1970, no fewer than 6,000 militarymedical teams were active in the Chinese countryside (Quinn 1973,151).Once again political ideology played a part in determininghealth policies. \"The intent (of the mobile teams) was not merelyto impart medical knowledge but to evolve a new kind of socialistminded rural health worker who would retain the closest linkswith the peasants and be content to stay permanently in thecountryside\" (Horn, 19690 135).In 1978, China's Ministry of Health reported that over threeyears approximately ten to fifteen percent of all medical doctorshad worked for varying periods in rural areas as members of :41 84mobile medical teams. They had been assisted by approximately140,000 medical professionals. One specific instance cited wasof Beijing Maternity Hospital, where eleven percent of themedical and nursing staff traveled to a rural area fifty milesnorth of the city to train barefoot doctors in family planningand child health (National Institute of Health, Public Service1980, 54-55).By 1970, some of the communes in rural areas had begun apolicy of sending their own barefoot doctors to the nearestcounty or urban hospital to undergo further training by thephysicians there. In such cases the communes themselves selectedthe barefoot doctor who was to be sent for training and paid hisexpenses (Risse 1973, 136). Training also was sometimes given bymore experienced barefoot doctors. Usually these senior barefootdoctors were those who had begun to practice during the GreatLeap Forward, then were forced to cut back or terminate theirservices in the early 1960s, and now had come back into favor.Thus there were four methods of training barefoot doctors in theyears of the Cultural Revolution: by mobile medical teams fromurban hospitals, by army medical teams, by physicians at urbanhospitals to which the barefoot doctors were sent, andoccasionally by other barefoot doctors (Hsu 1974, 124).Initially barefoot doctors studied from three to six months,althourr-.-:Ludied up to one year and some as little as onemonth.A survey of 751 brigade barefoot doctors in ShanghaiCounty in 1980 found that fifty-one percent of barefoot doctors 85trailled from three to six months, twenty-nine percent trained sixto twElve months, twelve percent more than one year and eightpercent less than three months (You Long 1982, 59). The barefootdoctors studied anatomy and physiology, bacteriology, pathologyand environmental sanitization, epidemiology, clinical medicine,pharmaco:ogy, elements of traditional Chinese medicine, familyplanning and health care of pregnant women (National Institute ofHealth, Public Health Service 1980, 55).In all of these areas, training was en a beginning ratherthan an advanced level. In the laboratories, the student.; werepermitted to dissect pigs, but not human cadavers. The skillsthey developed in clinical medicine were simple: how to use astethoscope, measure blood pressure, administer injections, takea medical history and diagnose the most common diseases. Theylearned how to use forty or fifty drugs and some herbal medicinesand were taught forty or fifty acupuncture puints out of apossible 300 to 400. They received sufficient training inbactcriology and pathology to allow them to identify germs incontaminated water. Some theory was taught, but the students didnot understand much of it and concentrated on practical aspectsof their work (Gu, Personal Communication).The barefoot doctor's training did not necessarily end afterhis initial three to six months training. Supervision usuallycontinued when they started actual work at their commune withphysicians from county hospitals or more advanced barefootdoctors overseeing their performance. Dr. Hsu Chia-yu, deputy 86chief of internal medicine at 3uichin Hospital in Shanghai, forexample, described how he lived with a barefoot doctor and hisfamily, even sharing a pillow with them. Befcre going to sleephe and the barefoot doctor would discuss the day'scases (Sidel1973, 85).At the Chiangchen Commune, Chuansha month on\"collective exchange of experience\"(Chinese medical Journal1975, 162).At the Four Seas Clinic in Shanghai which served15,000 peasants, the barefoot doctors had three periods of full-time instruction at yearly intervals. During the second period,they studied all diseases of a particular organ system, not justthe commonones, and also visited Beijing hospitals tosee moreadvanced techniques (riorn 1969, 139). Other writers told ofbarefoot doctors who traveled twice monthly to their communehospitals for training in Western medicine and once monthly fortraining in herbal medicine.In addition,an occasional one daytrainingcourse was given on such special subjects as settingfractures, treating drinking water, providing inoculations andtreating snakebites (National Institute of Health, Public HealthService 1980, 50).Since the middle 1970s, more advanced courses have beenoffered in such areas as family planning, acupuncture or herbalmedicineAdvanced training is more likely to be provided incounty or provincial hospitals than initial training, which isusually provided in commune hospitals.Essentially, three models of barefoot doctor training 87developed concurrently during the cultural revolution, and theyhave continued, with some modifications, into the present(Rosenthal 1987, 10-12). Model 1 provides barefoot doctors witha minimal level of training, one to three months. This is almostentirely practical training, supervised by a physician.When thebrief course is completed, the barefoot doctors are entrustedwith only the simplest tasks: giving vaccinations, treatingcommon ailments, offering health education and family planningadvice.Usually this model is found where mote advanced healthfacilities are within reach and referrals can be made to communehospitals or other institutions.Under Model 2, the barefoot doctors receive more trainingand are more Involved in patient care at the comrune hospitallevel.Although the length of training seldom exceeds threemonths, the instruction is more intense than in Model 1, with thesupervising physlcian emphasizing the areas of surgery andinternal medicine. The Model 2 barefoot doctor is sometimesasked to perform minor surgery at the commuae hospital.Model 3 provides the most sophisticated and advancedtraining for the barefoot doctor. He or she receives thepreliminary three munth course ')f model two, sometimes expandedto six months. Following this comes a rigorous training periodat the district hospital lasting from 2 1/2 to 3 years. Abarefoot doctor with Model 3 training can function largely on hisor her min, treating uncomplicated illnesses, performing surgeryand functioning successfully in the areas of internal medicine, 88dermatology and emergency medical care. He or she can alsosupervise health aides who have received two to three months oftraininc, primarily in first aid and sanitation work (19878 10- 12)9.Model 3 doctors are expected to continue taking follow-upin-service training at the nearest large hospital one day a week.Barefoot doctors are trained in elements of both Western andChinese medicine. Paul Picowicz, an authority on Chinese medicalhistory, observes that Chiaa is one of the few third worldcountries that has not abandoned traditional medicine in favor of\"all-out Westernization\" (1973, 138). It is unclear whatpercentage of traditional versus Western medicine was actuallyused by the barefoot doctor, but many accounts suggest thattraditional medicine is more common, with a heavy emphasis on theuse of local herbs and on acupuncture. This i3 more economicalfor the commune and it encourages local self-reliance, which wasa goal of the Cultural Revolution.Robert Hsu and Ralph Crozier note that the barefoot doctorswere encouraged to grow as many of their own herbs as possibleand experiment with them. This made good economic sense sincethe herbs could be grown right at the commune which could thensell the surplus (Hsu 1974, 24). However, this may have led tothe dangerous use of some herbs since there was no way to establish their safety or effectiveness (Hsu 197!, 125-126).In the 1970s instruction manuals for barefoot doctors began 9 The authorsdid not provide any estimates forthe numberof communes that have used the three models)f; 89to appear.Apparently they existed in several versions.According to Paul Picowicz, the Instruction Manual for BarefootDoctors was published in June, 1970 by the People's MedicinePublisher, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health inBeijing and distributed by the New China Book Company, a stateagency.The first edition, with 591 pages, had a print run of5000000 and cost one yuan (forty cents).After several laudatory chapters about the barefoot doctorand his importance, the manual discusses prevention and treatmentof various common diseases, outlines methods of pest control andelimination, and offers an extensive catalogue of herbalmedicines--the largest section of the book. Diagrams and chartsillustrate the book, and sample case histories are given (Risse1973, 140-143).About the same time the Hunan People's Publishers publishedBarefoot Doctor Handbook (Chilia2YigkejajglalultE9,) in HunanProvince in the south under the supervision of the Hunan ChineseMedical and Pharmaceutical Institute Revolutionary Committee.This Handbook consists of seven broad chapters: Recognition ofthe Human Body, Common Sense of Hygiene, Some Knowledge ofDiagnosis, Some Knowledge of Treatment, Birth Control, Diagnosisand Treatment of Common Diseases, Traditional and Herb Medicines.Each chapter has many subdivisions, in which specific proceduresare recommendedw. IQ A complete listing oftheTableofContents oftheHandbook may be foundin MedicineandPublic Health inthePeople's Republic of China. The book also contains a \"Standard 7 90Such handbooks found an eager audience. According to theChina Medical Journal, official publication of the ChineseMedical Association, sales of the earliest published printedmaterials for barefoot doctors reached 1,120,000 copies. Dr.David Eisenberg, who has visited China intermittently from 1977to 1985, reports one example of its use during the CulturalRevolution era; \"After being chosen the local 'barefoot doctor'in the mountains of northwest China, the eighteen-year-old SunLi-zhe was given a copy of the Barefoot Doctor's Manual, a fewneedles, and a few herbs; so armed, he was expected to deliverprimary medical care to the masses.\" (Eisenberg 19850 162). SunLi-zhe turned out to be an extraordinarily apt pupil. He readseveral advanced medical textbooks on his own arm \"with theequivalent of only a high school education and three months offormal training\" was able to perform more than 100 successfulabdominal operations on his own. (Eisenberg 1985, 163).The barefoot doctors were encouraged to keep up withdevelopments in their field and, perhaps to feel a greater senseof professionalism, with the publication The Barefoot DoctorsJournal, which the government-backed People's Medicine Publisherbegan putting out in 1972. In 1981, with the Cultural Revolutionover, the publishing house decided to rename the publicationRural Medical Sciences, perhaps suggesting a broader and List ofItems Included in a BarefootDoctor's Bag,\" higher a circulation of \"several hundred thousand,\" thehighest in its history (Raifeng 1984, 68, 151).During the Cultural Revolution era, the development of thebarefoot doctor had ideological as well as medical significance.Being a barefoot doctor was a symbol of socialist commitment.The new health workers received political training along withtheir health instruction. According to the Chinese MedicalJournal, \"to start with, (the barefoot doctors) study the worksof Marx, Lenin and Chairman Mao, and are given political andideological education to prepare them for wholehearted service tothe people.\"The barefoot doctors thus were taught to regardthemselves not only as providers of health care to theirneighbors but as exemplars of the Communist system that wascreating the new China.As part of this ideological campaign the barefoot doctorswere given three articles by Chairman Mao to read: \"Serve thePeople,\" \"In Memory of Norman Bethune \" and \"The Foolish OldMan Who ,mcved the Mountains.\"At the end of theirindoctrination course, \"every trainee expressed his wish tobecome a barefoot doctor wholeheartedly serving the poor andlower-middle peasant.\" (Horn 1968, 577).According to an articlein China's Medicine, after two years of practice all barefoot \"Norman Bethune, (1890-1939) a Canadian surgeon, became anational hero ofChina because ofhis medicalservicethereduring their war with Japan in 1938.He was medical chief of theChineseCommunistArmy,servingasbattlefieldsurgeonandorganized hospitals in the field. 92doctors could prescribe a hundred different medicines and couldtreat such illnesses as measles, pneumonia and pleurisy. \"Someof them,\" the article went on, \"have shown greater ability inpractical work than some of the doctors in the commune clinic,who are graduates of medical schools but lack practicalexperience.\"I have never seen similar claims elsewhere aboutthe barefoot doctors' powers. It should be noted that China'sMedicine was a journalistic proponent of the Cultural Revolutionset up in January, 1967 to replace tne respectable ChineseMedical Journal. China's Medicine later ceased publication, andChinese Medical Journal reappeared in 1973. (Sidel, V. and R.1973, 37).Barefoot doctors were selected by their neighbors and fellowbrigade members on the basis of general integrity, highideological standards and a sworn interest in health care. Theyhad to have a desire to \"serve the people and care for others\"(Contreras 1979, 32). The amount of previous education was notconsidered an important factor, although most had at least sixyears of schooling. Their range of previous education was fromtwo years of primary school to the completion of middle school,about eight years (Hsu 1974, 1251.Class background was also a criterion for selection, andpreference was given to children of poor and lower middle class parents.While the majority of barefoot doctors were youngproduction brigade members of poor and lower middle peasantorigin, some were young intellectuals (middle school graduates) 93sent from the cities to the countryside to work among thepeasants.According to Dr. Qin Gu, a Chinese doctor oftraditional medicine who studied in the period immediatelyfollowing the Cultural Revolution, these \"young intellectuals\"made up a very large proportion of the barefoot doctors.One of the most spectacular examples of the ideologicalcampaign built up around the barefoot doctor was a feature filmcalled Spring Shoots produced in 1976.Its announced design wasto reflect \"the maturing of barefoot doctors and new socialistsprouts in the thick of the struggle between the proletariat andthe bourgeoisie.\" The heroine was Chun-miao, a young womanpeasant who seeks to become a barefoot doctor but whose effortsto learn are \"obstructed by the bourgeoisie.\" She is toldscornfully that \"using an injection needle is not the same aswielding a hoe.\" Despite a plot to frame her by administeringpoison to a poor peasant for whom she is caring, she triumphsover her foes and assumes her rightful place in the communehospital (Gittings 1989, 92).Shortly after this film appeared, a political upheaval tookplace and the Cultural Revolution ended.The movie,consequently, was denounced as slanderous and an affront to trueCommunist leadership. A play called Loyal Hearts, staged in1978, depicted sympathetically an old doctor who had been falselyaccused during the Cultural Revolution of being a \"bourgeoisspecialist\" when all he had really wanted to do was conductresearch into heart disease. (Gittings 1989, 92). 1 94With the end of the Cultural Revolution barefoot doctorslost some of their glamor as well as the almost superhumanqualities with which they had sometimes been endowed by theregime's propagandists. But so extensively had theyproliferated, so intensively had they been trained, and soeffectively had they performed, that they carried over into thesucceeding period and became an integral part of the Chinese health system. 95 Changes Since the Cultural Revolution: \"Ideals YieldTo Certification Exams,\" 1976 - Present Mao Zedong died on September 9, 1976. With his death theCultural Revolution may be said to have ended. Deng Xiaopingeventually became the most powerful leader in China, holding theposition of Central Military Commissioner of the Ruling CommunistParty.Deng did not win without a struggle; he had to overcomethe opposition of the so-called \"Gang of Four,\" an ultra-leftistfaction by Mao's The \"Gang,\" which hadencouraged the student \"Red Guards\" at the peak of the CulturalRevolution, was arrested in October, 1976, a few weeks afterMao's death.They were subsequently tried and sentenced to longprison terms.According to Witold Rodzinski, the area most adverselyaffected in China by the Cultural Revolution was education, withthe intelligentsia characterized as \"enemies of the nine,\" the ninth category of enemies afterlandlords/ rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements,rightists, renegades, enemy agents and capitalist roaders(Rodzinski 1988, 222).Standards in higher education, including medicalinstruction, fell. In the first outburst of the CulturalRevolution, many medical schools were actually shut down. The 96entire medical establishment came under attack for beingalienated from the masses (Risse 1973, 42).Medical schools wereperceived as being instruments of the old-style establishment,totally indifferent to the needs of the peasants and workers(Sidel, V. and R. 1973, 114). Richard P. Suttmeier cites a poemcomposed by revolutionary students at the China Medical College,which had an eight-year course of study: These eight years in the old China Medical College--The havoc they wrought!In three years, no medicine did we glean;In five years, no patients were seen;A full eight years, and no contact with workers andpeasants brought (Quinn 1973, 1984). In 1969 medical schools began to resume admission of newstudents, but on a somewhat different basis than previously. Theeducational process was speeded up, with many of the studentsgraduated within two-and-a-half or three years.The emphasis wasplaced on practice rather than theory; there were no grades orcompetitive placement. In selecting students for admission, moreweight may have been given to their ideological soundness chantheir intellectual capacity or previous schooling (Sidel, V. and R. 1983, 225). \"For ten years no full-length courses in Westernmedicine were given in China with the result that no onegraduated as a fully qualified doctor\" (Garside, 1981, 71). KeyFung who graduated from medical school in China after theCultural Revolution and who is now studying in the United States,felt that while the rest of the world went forward in health careFl 97and medicine during the revolutionary period, China made noprogress at all (Dr. Key Fung, Personal Communication).When Deng Xiaoping took full power in 1979, he instituted aprogram of \"four modernizations\" in industry, agriculture,science and technology, and national defense, with all goals tobe attained by the year 2000 (Garside 1981, 70). As a pragmaticleader, Deng realized the need for higher standards of educationif his goals were to be achieved.In medical schools, trainingwas changed from two-and-a-half or three years to five to eightyears--the duration prior to the Cultural Revolution. Admissionrequirements again were based on grades and examinations (Sidel,V. and R. 1983, 326).Although barefoot doctors' education also underwent someimprovement, Deng himself was not among their greatest admirers.He felt that their healing powers had been exaggerated. Once,during the Cultural Revolution, he walked out of a movie thatshowed a barefoot doctor going way beyond his training toadminister a cure. Shortly afterwards he told a visiting publichealth delegation: Barefoot doctors cannot reach heaven at asingle bound.The barefoot doctors have onlyjust begun; their knowledge is slight.Theycan only treat a few common illnesses. Aftersome years they will put on straw shoes, thatis, their knowledge will have grown.A fewyears more and they will wear cloth shoes(Garside 1981, 71). In early 1976, when the \"Gang of Four\" were trying to keep 5 98Deng out of office, they cited this comment against him: \"Theunrepentant capitalist roader (Deng) has even advocated thatbarefoot doctors wear cloth shoes and leather shoes....This meanswearing capitalist shoes and following the revisionist road\"(Mann 1985, 11).Just as the initial training and responsibilities of thebarefoot doctors have varied since 1977, so have the changes in their roles and education. For example, rich brigades andcommunes have more extensive barefoot doctor programs thanpoor ones.It is these relatively rich communes that visitors aretaken to see and write about. Training has become longer andmore theoretically based.Initial training now takes a minimumof six months, and some or all of it is given at the countyhospital rather than the commune hospital (the three-month Model 1 has been expanded.) There is more study of the preclinicalsciences such as microbiology and pharmacology.Continuingeducation has been greatly expanded.Specialized courses are nowgiven at the commune or county hospital in three-month periods insuch fields as traditional medicine, basic surgery or otherprimary care responsibilities. Some provinces have set upschools for barefoot doctors offering courses that last a year.These courses are usually given during quiet periods ofagricultural activity (Sidel, V. and R. 1982, 42). One commune set up aspecial three-times-a-week, four-year television course(Rosenthal 1987, 22).It is interesting that just as feldshers do not teach other I I1; 99feldshers in the Soviet Union, barefoot doctors nowadays rarelytrain other barefoot doctors in China. Doctors from urbanhospitals travel to commune or county hospitals to give thetraining.More of this is provided by physicians permanentlyassigned on a salaried basis to the commune. The role of mobilemedical teams, so important initially, is now diminishing (Sidel,V. 1982, 42).Perhaps the greatest change has been the certificationprogram for barefoot doctors, which requires examinations. Newpolicies were put in place from 1979 to 1981. A two levelexamination was instituted - a Barefoot Doctor Basic Competencytest which led to the title Accredited Barefoot Doctor, and amore advanced examination conferring certification as a County orVillage Doctor. Those who failed the exam were given furthertraining and another chance to take it while still beingpermitted to carry out certain functions.Victor and Ruth Sidel gave statistics from several communeson the passing rate for barefoot doctors. In most of thecommunes eighty percent or more passed.(There were specialcategories of barefoot doctors who could become certified withouttaking the exams and were therefore \"grandfathered\" in.) As forcertification as a village or county doctor, the Ministry ofHealth reported that by September, 1981 one-third of the 1.5million barefoot doctors in the country had obtained village orcounty doctor certificates (Rosenthal 1987, 21). A smallpercentage of places in medical schools were to be reserved for i 71 100the most promising barefoot doctors.Other features of the new policy written from 1979 to 1981were that barefoot doctors were to become the equivalent ofthree-year medical school graduates (assistant doctors), serve asfull-time practitioners and receive salaries instead of work-points (Rosenthal 1987, 5). Finally, in 1985, the Ministry ofPublic Health decided to stop using the term barefoot doctor.From then on, those who passed the examinations for practitionersand a secondary medical school examination would be known asrural doctors. Those who failed such examinations would be calledmedical orderlies (Public Health in the Peoples Republic of China 1986, 206).Although it is too soon to assess its full impact, thisrecent requirement of more education and higher standards for thebarefoot doctor has already led to changes: a decrease in thenumber of barefoot doctors and an increase in theirprofessionalism. Both of these will be discussed in a latersection. In reporting the change of title from barefoot to ruraldoctor, the Los Angeles Times used the headline \"Idealism Yields to Certification Exams.\" Present Strengths and Problems of the Barefoot Doctor By whatever nam--: he or she is called, the barefoot doctor isthe bedrock of the Chinese rural health care system. Theirgreatest strength is that for millions of people they literally 101are the first tier of defense against health problems, the firstmedical authority whom a peasant or a poor city worker willconsult and be examined by. They are in the forefront ofdisease prevent5.on work in the provinces, supervising, educating,or workingalongside thepeasants in eliminating pests,improving sanitation and the environment.Since barefoot doctorsoften spend their entire lives in their own towns and districts,they are familiar with local conditions and local people. Theycan build a special level of confidence with the patients they treat.Finally, for some Chinese peasants, the job of a barefootdoctor offers a unique opportunity for advancement and reward.Especially in recent years, when brigades have been sending youngbarefoot doctors, male and female, for advanced training in largemedical centers, the peasant with talent and skill has a chance to develop his or her potential and attain a new status in thecommunity and the system :,..tself.Nevertheless, the institution of the barefoot doctor today faces formidable problems, principally relating to (1) theireconomic status and (2) their questionable education.Economic Status. While preventive care and public healthprograms in the People's Republic of Chira are almost totallyfunded by the government, other health care services cannot be called free.Patients pay for primary health care, including the costs of supplies and drugs.The barefoot doctor, as theprovider of primary care, is pad by patients, either directly or 102through some form of insurance which the patient pays for atleast partially. In urban areas the employer helps pay for this insurance.In rural areas the insurance comes from a cooperativemedical insurance system which is funded by each localcollective's welfare fund and the individual monthly premiumspaid by the peasants (Hsiau, 1984, 933).This system of payment has evolved over the years. In theoriginal barefpot doctor program in the mid-1960s, the intentionwas for the doctor to receive the same income as an agriculturalworker, despite spending considerable time in medical functions.A commune worker's income was determined by the commune's totalincome plus the doctor's \"medical work-points\" countedexactly the same as it he had been doing agricultural work during the same period.The salary paid an agricultural worker was approximatelyhalf as much as that of a fully trained doctor assigned to a commune.on a visit to China in 1971, Victor Sidel was told thatbeginning doctors earn 600 yuan ($240) per year as compared to300 yuan ($120) or less earned annually by peasants--includingbarefoot doctors (1972, 1295).Paul Picowicz reported similarsalaries for barefoot doctors in the Tungping Brigade ofChiagchen Commune, while in some brigades where production wasoff, the annual salary was only 200 yuan, or $80.) According to a surveymade by two Chinese authorities, Gong You-long and Chao Li-min, in 1980, the average income of female barefoot doctors 103was only seventy-five percent that of males (19821 60).It has already been noted that the barefoot doctor'smedical work-points counted exactly the same aE his agriculturalwork-points in determining his income.As a result, in manycases, the doctor found he could make more money working as afarmer than as a physician. The discrepancy increased whenpeasants were permitted to work their own plots privately inaddition to their work for the commune. Consequently, somebarefoot doctors gave up their medical chores completely to spendmore time in the fields.In 1980 the government instituted \"the productionresponsibility system\" to spur farm productivity and output.Considerable autonomy was given to communes to determine whatmethods and incentives would best increase productivity in their areas.Most permitted peasants to sell for their own profit alltheir produce over a certain quota. Thus the emphasis was onproducing the maximum possible crops (Chen 1983, 1411-1417).Although the system increased production dramatically, ithad an adverse effect on the economic status of barefoot doctors.Individual peasants, working their own plots/ began contributingless to the brigade welfare fund which helped support thecooperative medical insurance system. In some areas, insolvencyand even shutdowns of the insurance system occurred, so thatpayment to the barefoot doctors came late or not at all. Somedoctors set up fee-for-services practices rather than being paidout of the welfare fund, charging for consultations, 104prescriptions, drugs and vaccines (Young 1986, 109). Otherssimply resigned--in several instances en masse. The ranks of thebarefoot doctors were thinned from 1.76 million in 1977 to 1.67million in 1979 and 1.46 million in 1981 (Chen 1983, 1412).To deal with this fall-out, in 1981 the Ministry of Healthpersuaded the State Council to adopt a new economic policy forbarefoot doctors. There were three main provisions: (1) Thosewho passed the Barefoot Doctor Basic Competency examination wereto be full-time and paid the same amount as brigade schoolteachers. (2) In mountainous, remote and low-income areas thelocal government was to provide direct cash subsidies. (3) Thosebarefoot doctors who were still \"training up\"--i.e. had not yetreceived their certification--were to get their usual work-pointsplus a bonus, the latter given in answer to complaints that theirwork-points were not keeping pace with the rising income of theirfellow workers with private plots.Education.From the start there were serious problems withthe education of the barefoot doctor.Back in 1965/ it may beremembered, Mao Zedong himself had derided traditional medicaleducation, saying \"There's no read to read so many books\" andurging that countryside doctors \"study and raise their standardsmainly through practice\" rather than spending so much time inmedical school.One result of this kind of thinking was that many of theearly barefoot doctors went about their work with enthusiasm anddedication, but with very sketchy information and almost no 105experience.Three months training was simply not adequate formany of the health care problems they had to deal with.The most impartial and, seemingly, accurate appraisal of thebarefoot doctors' abilities was given by the Rural Health SystemsDelegation, a team of nine American physicians and scholars sentto China in June and July of 1978 under a grant by the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services as part of the U.S. ChinaScientific and Cultural Exchange Program.In the Delegation'sreport, Dr. Everett M. Rogers of Stanford University wrote: We concluded that China's barefoot doctorsare not theparamedical superhumans that someprevious accounts might lead one to expect.Barefoot doctors make mistakes in diagnosis,in referral decisions, and in treatment... Inmany of our briefings at commune and countyhospitals and in the Ministry of Health, wewere told that barefoot doctors were not theultimate solution to China's health caredelivery problems. We were told thatbarefoot doctors require upgrading intechnical knowledge and skills, and thateventually better trained barefoot doctorsand physicians will deliver some of theprimary health care barefoot doctors nowprovide(1980, 57). The report documented a number of serious errors due toeducational and experimental shortcomings.Among these werediagnosing lobar pneumonia as a common cold and mistakingtuberculosis of the bone for arthritis.One barefoot doctor wasunable to explain the use of chlorpromazine, one of fifteenmedicines she carried. Some of the barefoot doctors were found to be ignorant of the uses and toxicities of many of the drugs in113 106 their medical bags.Others had a \"penchant for experimentation\" with their own treatments.Sometimes these experiments produced unexpectedlypositive results, however. For example, in Wangzan Commune inShinshi in 1970, several barefoot doctors read about anagricultural chemical, identified as No. 920, that stimulatedplant growth.They thought it might work on human beings, too,and experimented upon themselves to make sure it was safe.Thenthey gave it to a woman who was losing her hair. Within fortydays, her hair grew back. The case was reported in People'sDaily as a model of how to combine the spirit of serving thepeople with practical skills and ingenuity.Inadequate training was also apparent in the work of theurban equivalent of the barefoot doctors, known as red workerdoctors or Red Guard doctors. Usually, \"red worker doctors\"refers to factory employees who get work-points for performingmedical services for their fellow employees, much as barefootdoctors do for the peasants. Red Guard doctors serve withintheir own residential neighborhoods, and usually are retirees orhousewives with very minimal training--sometimes only ten days. Red Guard is a term that seems to be dropping out of use, perhapsbecause of the connotations associated with it at the Jeak of theCultural Revolution, when extremist Red Guard students committed many depredations against their fellow citizens.(For a detailedaccount of the Red Guard doctors, see Sidel, V., New EnglandJournal of Medicine, June 15, 1972, pp. 1292-1298). 11.4 108doctors.Some doctors are criticized forneglecting service to the countryside...others apparently continue to resent the roleassigned to the lower-level medicalpersonnel... One doctor admitted thatalthough he did not believe secondary medicalpersonnel should be allowed to treat patientsbecause their training was not adequate, nowpractice has convinced him it is better tohave these personnel available since they \"doa very good job in taking care of the sick.\"(Leo Orleans, 1969, 34). Nowadays, the barefoot doctor-fully trained physicianrelationship seems to have evolved satisfactorily. The physiciantrains the barefoot doctor, imparting a good amount of practicalknowledge.The barefoot doctor performs his function in thecountryside, thus relieving many fully-trained physicians of theneed to relocate to rural areas. Both parties seem satisfiedwith this balance. And for those barefoot doctors who aredissatisfied, there remains the option of pursuing studies at anurban or county medical school where he, too, can pass into theranks of full professionalism. 115 109 The Barefoot Doctor Since 1980:Looking Toward The Future Once the goal of a society changes fromserving the people to getting rich what isgoing to happen to the barefoot doctor? (RuthSidel, personal communication, November 17,1988). The decade of the 1980s has brought substantial changes inthe status, function and operating methods of the barefootdoctor.The entire institution has moved in a new direction, andwhile it is too soon to discern what its ultimate destinationwill be, there is no doubt that the practice of rural medicinewill differ vastly from Mao Zedong's 1965 vision of direct ifrather rudimentary service to the people.Several major changes are already apparent.1. The number of barefoot doctors in practice is undergoinga decline.From 1977 to 1981 the total dropped from 1,760/000 to1,575,000, according to Marilyn M. Rosenthal (1987, 5). ChineseHealth Care, a volume published in association with the People'sMedical Publishing House in Beijing, gives an official figure of1,396,452 barefoot doctors in 1981 (115).The officialapproximation in 1986 was 1,290,000 (Public Health in thePeople's Republic of China, 53.) Dr. Ruth Sidel reports, in atypical example, that in the China-Romania People's Communeoutside Beijing the number of barefoot doctors went from 450 for 110a population of 46,000 in 1972 to 250 for a population of 48,000in 1980--a ratio drop from 1:102 to 1:192. Similar patternsobtain in Shunyi County (including Beijing) as a whole, where thepopulation increased from 450,000 to 467,000 in the decade of the1970s, but the number of barefoot doctors fell from 1,400 to 1,200.More recent figures than these are unavailable, but allsigns are that the downward trend continues for many reasons.Officials of the China-Romania People's Commune explain the dropin barefoot doctors in these terms: \"Some have become workers,some have gone into the army, some (usually women) have marriedand moved away, some were promoted to cadres and some went to theuniversity.\"Actually, as will be seen below, the reasons areeven more basic, reflecting the profound economic, social andpolitical changes that have taken place in China during the 1980s.2. Public receptivity of the barefoot doctors has changed.As Mao correctly observed, rural medical care had been indeplorable condition for generations, and the first barefootdoctors brought a welcome elevation of health care which wasdeeply appreciated by Chinese peasants. But as economicconditions improved, the expectations of rural farmers andworkers increased. With their income rising, they began todemand higher quality medical care and to demand access tobetter-trained personnel (Hsiao 1984, 935). Peasants now arewilling to pay for services at the commune health center or117 111county hospital and have bypassed barefoot doctors (Young 1986/ 109).Better economic conditions have not improved the lot ofthe barefoot doctors as such. Many of them have found they canmake more money farming, so they have abandoned practice.According to Ruth Sidel, very few have put up shingles and goneinto private medical practice. She feels, however, that the factthat this is happening at all is significant, because itdemonstrates that some barefoot doctors wish to move up throughthe medical ranks, and earn more money through medical practicerather than farming.3. Barefoot doctors are playing a lesser role as China'shealth care system becomes increasingly modernized, along withthe country's other social institutions and public services. Itshould be remembered that the original barefoot doctors were atleast in part a political phenomenon, reflecting the Socialistfervor unleashed by Mao Zedong to reshape China. Nowadays/enthusiasm is no longer enough; the people simply demand more and better services. Many rural areas are becoming modernized.FeiXiatong, China's best-known sociologist, said in 19850 \"It'sunbelievable to me how quickly the countryside is changing\" (LosAngeles Times, Feb. 1, 1985).It is also obvious that today's government in China is notexactly stressing grass-roots participation or individual freedomor responsibility. China is also not as anti-elitist anymore.\"From 1965-1976 the emphasis was very anti-elitist, that was thepoint of the Cultural Revolution.It was no accident thatlis 112community health workers, barefoot doctors and red medicalworkers were the ones who were favored and trained in greatnumbers.They even went too far in saying barefoot doctors coulddo anything doctors could do.\"4. China's health care needs are changing, along with thepolitical climate. In 1965 the country's major problem; includedpoor sanitation and hygiene as well as a lack of maternity care.As a result, prime causes of death included infectious diseases,tuberculosis, influenza and digestive diseases, as well aschildbirth problems (Public Health in the People's Republic ofChina 1986, 95-96). In addition the peasantry was uneducated.Conditions like these were ripe for the barefoot doctor.Better hygiene and sanitation helped reduce infectious diseasessharply, childbirth and maternity conditions were improved, thepeasantry received instruction in basic home health care. In thepolitical climate of the Cultural Revolution all joinedenthusiastically in the effort to upgrade the health of thecountryside.Today the leading causes of death are cancer, stroke andheart disease, none of which can be cured by such simple measuresas improvinghygiene or giving inoculations. Modernization inother technical areas also affects the barefoot doctor. Betterhighways have made traditional doctors more accessible. China is a very mountainous country, so part of the problem in bri-gingdoctors to the community was the difficulty of travel to rural communities.Some Chinese publications reported that barefoot119 113doctors had to cross mountain ridges on foot or walk for hours oreven an entire day in order to reach a patient or fetch aphysician (Hsu 1974, 126). Now it is far more expeditious fordoctors and patients to reach one another, or for a patient to bebrought to a rural medical center.5. The change in the status of barefoot doctors has evenbeen reflected, as previously noted, in the loss of their name.Writing to the editor of the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation on June 24, 1988, Dr. Tsung 0. Cheng, of GeorgeWashington University in Washington, D.C., points out that onJanuary 24, 1985, China's Ministry of Health officially abolishedthe term barefoot doctor, renaming them \"countryside doctors\" ifthey passed qualifying examinations or \"health aides\" if theyfailed them (3561).Perhaps the best summary of the change that has occurred isthat given by Marilyn M. Rosenthal: The barefoot doctor is now to beprofessionalized. To move the barefootdoctor toward increased professionalizationis perhaps just as daring as Mao's originalplan.It is part of the commitment tomodernization of the current leadership andan example of the professionalization processtaking place in other segments of the laborforce as well. It also reflects the generalreturn to power and dominance of theprofessionals and experts. There is someirony here as a political creation of thesixties brought to life outside the bounds ofprofessional medical models and control, nowmoves backprecisely toward that model andits influence. 121 114Although the increa3ed professionalism of the barefootdoctors will bring many health benefits, it also presents certainnegative features. The barefoot doctor established a uniqueintimacy with his patients; he treated them on a one-on-onebasis, he made them conscious of basic health needs andprocedures; he made house calls (Gong You-long and Chao Li-min,59).During the 1980s many Chinese peasants began going to localor county hospitals for basic treatment, much as today'sAmericans go to emergency rooms rather than to a private doctor'soffice.The peasant may get somewhat superior medical treatmentas a result, but it will be less personalized.The drop in the numbers of barefoot doctors is puttingadditional strain upon the local health stations.William Hsiaocontends that unless the salaries of barefoot doctors are raisedconsiderably, there will soon be a manpower shortage of healthworkers in the countryside, creating medical care problems (1984, 935).Finally, the decrease in numbers of barefoot doctors ishaving an adverse impact on disease prevention. Thanks to thebarefoot doctors, schistosomiasis, for example, has been almostcompletely wiped out, following elimination of the snails thatcarried the disease. Prevention programs are not as profitableas medical treatment and many barefoot doctors no longeremphasize such projects. Peasants do not want to spend money onvaccinations without seeing the results. In addition, the lowfees being charged do not compensate the barefoot doctor for the 12 I 115time and effort needed for vaccinations (Young 19860 109).Ruth Sidel points out that insufficient numbers of barefootdoctors are available to carry out public health measures likechecking water cleanliness. \"The barefoot doctor and the healthworkers who worked under them were in charge of health education,immunizations and old-fashioned public health measures likechecking for a clean water supply and collecting night soil(saving human feces in a vault until the bacteria die). If youuse night soil as a fertilizer you must do it right or you willhave epidemics. These issues may be neglected. With thepressure to make money, to grow food, to work in a factory, getrich, buy a TV, etc...unless they pay their barefoot doctors alot of money, which to my knowledge they are not doing, publichealth may suffer.\"Sidel also sees an adverse effect in family planning. Thebarefoot doctor often was involved on a close personal besis,even keeping track of contraceptives taken by individual membersof the brigade. The result was careful birth control.\"Asbarefoot doctors are trained and want to do more sophisticatedwork, who will carry out this important measure which is still soimportant in China?\" (Interview with Ruth Sidel, Fall 1988) 116 Is The Barefoot Doctor Finished As An EntityIn The Chinese Health Care System? The most direct answer to the question above is a simple\"No.\" However, it must be qualified somewhat, because while thebarefoot doctor is likely to remain as an integral cog in China'shealth care machinery, he or she will be performing a role quitedifferent from those \"90-day-wonder\" who mnswered the call ofMao Zedong to bring at least elementary health care to milllonsof Chinese peasants, farmers and villagers. Those primitivepractitioners with their few medicines, simple instruments andtimorous ministrations are gone, or at least are on their wayout, in most areas.However, they have grown into the Chinese medical system andleft their mark on it by transforming it into a universal servicein which virtually all the people, no matter how remote indistance or poor in belongings/ can expect at least a minimum of health care.Some have developed into full-fledged physicians,and most of the others have become competent mid-levelpractitioners, serving in health stations, assisting fulldoctors, handling basic health problems, and treatinguncomplicated diseases with a degree of expertise and confidencelacking in their predecessors of the 1960s and early 1970s.Theytruly are \"village\" or \"countryside\" doctors.Certainly their education, leading as it does to officialI\" 117certification, is superior to anything that their predecessorsexperienced.According to official Chinese figures, as of 1986there were in existence a total of 1,349 medical schoolsspecifically designed \"to train and retrain rural doctors who arevery popular among peasants for their competence in handlingcommon diseases and injuries\" (Public Health in the People'sRepublic of China, 53).In fact, the project of upgrading the qualifications andabilities of the barefoot doctors has attracted support fromoutside China. Project HOPE, the American philanthropicorganization, since 1983 has had an interest in promoting Chinesehealth care.In September 1989, it launched a program to educateChinese barefoot doctors in some modern facets of medical care.This is a co-operative undertaking of Xian Medical University inChina and the University of New Mexico in the United States. TheChinese are adapting a course initiated ten years ago at theUniversity of New Mexico to further the practice of ruralmedicine.\"We've done some case-writing and facultydevelopment,\" reports Dr. Arthur Kaufman of the University of NewMexico Medical School. \"We have visited their sites and theyhave sent their faculty to New Mexico.\"(Project HOPE Bulletin,Fall 1989).Project HOPE says the objective is \"to recreate thecorps of ruralphysicians (in China) that once provided primaryhealth care to many.\"All in all, then, the barefoot doctor of the future--whowill no longer be called by that name--will be relatively 124 118educated, sophisticated and expert in his tasks--a true mid-levelpractitioner.It also seemslikely that there will continue tobe a place for those barefoot doctors who do not move up theeducational scale and remain fairly close to the skills--aad thelimitations--of the barefoot doctors of the 1960s and 1970s.China, after all, is a vast country, with many regions that willremain remote and primitive for decades to come. In such areas,the traditional barefoot doctor may be expected to continue topractice pretty much as he has for the last 25 years. As WitoldRodzinski points out, the countryside always lags behind thecities in making improvements a:ld modernizing (Rodzinski, 91).Dr. Robert B. Taylor quotes Dr. Huang Chia-ssur president of theChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, as telling him: \"At thistime there are not enough fully trw.hed physicians. The emphasismust continue to be on providing health care services to thosethat need it most, and hence tlie systew will continue to rely onstreet, factory and barefoot doctcr:.\" (1981, 76).So for the immediate future, at leat. two levels ofbarefoot doctors seem likely to continue serving patients inrural China--the more sophisticated and advanced practitionersworking in those areas which have :elative prosperity andmodernjty, and their humb2er--but no less useful--brothers andsisters still working in the vast hinterland, attendingto basic health needs as they have for the last quarter century.Their numbers may be fewer but their tasks are no less important than in the past. 119China, as we know from the tragic events in TiananmenSquare, is still a country undergoing change; the age-old battlebetween democracy and authoritarianism is still unsettled. Wehave seen that the barefoot doctor, in his most primitive form,flourishes in time of unrest and turmoil, while in time oftranquility and prosperity he figuratively puts on shoes,improves his knowledge and skill, and moves up the ladder ofprofessionaliPx and prestige. The futuxe place and status of thebarefoot doctor depends upon what happens economically andpolitically in the China of tomorrow. But for the last quarterof a century he--and--she have served their country and humanitywell. 120 Chapter V The Physician Assistant Need for the Physician Assistant Although the physician assistants of the United States servemany of the same functions and needs as do the barefoot doctorsof China and the feldshers of the Soviet Union, they came intobeing under different circumstances.Unlike either China or Russia, the United States has longhad a highly trained, fully professional medical establishment.It has also had a stable political climate. Neverthelessconsiderable unrest began to develop within the medicalestablishment during the 1960s, bringing about substantialchanges in the American health system, some of which stillpersist. These changes may be summarized as follows; 1.In the mid-1960's there was a perceived shortage andmaldistribution of physicians. The actual number of medicalschool graduates had not risen significantly since 1900, when5/214 graduated from medical school to serve a population of about eighty million. In 1960 for a population of 180 million,there were only 7,081 graduates (Backup 1984, 203). On February19, 1973, U.S.News and World Report published a feature article 127 121with the title \"Not Enough Doctors, What's Being Done?\" TheCenter for Health Services Research and Development of theAmerican Medical Association reported that there were 334,028physicians in the U.S. U.S. News and World Reyort used thefigure of 323,000 physicians based on government studies for theyear 1970, and estimated that there would be 346,000 in 1973.This gave a physician-to-population ratio of one physician toevery 636 potential patients.\"There had been a sharp decline in the physician-to-population ratio between 1900 to 1930, in part due to the 1910publication of the Flexner Report which had caused manysubstandard medical schools to close (Kletke 1987, 5). Between1930 and 1960 the ratio had stabilized.The article in U.S. Newsand World Report reported that a desirable ratio would be onephysician to 500 patients, although Dr. James Warren, aparticipant at a symposium in 1968 in honor of Dr. Eugene Stead,the founder of the physician assistant (PA) concept, said thatthere was no way to determine the best ratio of physicians topopulation. Other factors such as health care requirements,ancillary medical resources, and demographic and socioeconomicfactors all play important roles in determining physician needs.No matter what the ratio was, most observers agreed thatthere was a maldistribution of physicians.Most of thephysicians in practice were concentrated in large cities and \"The physician to population ratio is defined as the numberofphysicians per 100,000 population and is the most widely usedmethod for analyzing the supply of physicians (Kletke 1987, 5). 122metropolitan areas, with fewer in rural or more reMote regions.Similarly within big cities, most doctors practiced in upper ormiddle class sections, while the inner cities were poorly served.In 1970, 86.6% of all non-federal physicians were located inmetropolitan areas. This situation has not improved since then.In 1986, 87.9 % of physicians lived in metropolitan areas(Physician Characteristics and Medical Licensure in the U.S.1987, 88).In many under served rural areas, the ratio of physiciansto population was greater than 1:5000. In 120 counties there wereno physicians at all (Lippard 1973, 26). In 1986 there were 126counties, thirty five percent of the U.S. land area, without apracticing physician in patient care.\" The situation was notmuch better within many cities. The 1973 article reported thatwhile some sections in New York City had one doctor for every 300people or about twice the national average, the Bronx had a ratioof less than 70100,000 people. To make matters worse, peoplewho live in the inner city often have more illnesses thanresidents of more prosperous neighborhoods. This is still 24A personal anecdote - A few years agoI spent two weeks atacamp in Dubois, Wyoming, a town with apopulation of 1,067(1980 Census).The nearest cities with physicians and hospitalswere located 75-90 miles away.There WAS more real to me.129 123true.\" In short, \"trained manpower was not to be found at theright place, at the right time in many parts of the nation\"(Lippard 1973, 5).Another criticism of the physician population was that alarge percentage were foreign medical graduates. The Departmentof Labor disclosed that in 1963 one out of nine doctors weretrained abroad whereas in 1970 the proportion was one in five.In an essay written during the period, two physician assistantspointed out that while some of the criticism of foreign medicalgraduates was openly racist, \"some was based on a desire to havecare delivered by someone of similar cultural and languagebackground\" (Backup 1984, 205). 2.The number of general practitioners or \"family doctors\"underwent a sharp decline in the 1960's with most doctorsentering specialties or going into research. In 1923, 89 percentof U.S. physicians were general practitioners; by the mid 1960sthe figure had fallen to 25 percent. \"The general practitionerwas a disappearing breed\" (Bottom 1987, 639). At an annualhealth conference at the New York Academy of Medicine on issuesin primary care, Dr. Milton Terris reported that \"the number ofGP's in office practice per 100,000 fell from 83 in 1940 to 24 in 14inadramaticreportintheNew England Journal ofMedicine, \"survival analysis showed that black men in Harlem werelesslikelytoreachtheageofsixty-fivethan meninBangladesh\"(McCord 1990, 173).Unfortunately, this problemcannotbe remediedsimply by having more health personnel inHarlem, since \"poverty, inadequate housing, psychological stress,substanceabuser malnutrition and inadequate access to medicalcare\" all are contributors.1 3 i ) 1241972. During that same period pediatricians and internists inoffice practice increased from 6 to 17 per 100,000 population,but the total number of primary care physicians fell from 89 to41 per 100,000, a decline of 54 percent\" (1977, 129).The use of physicians for activities such as routinephysical exams, diagnosing common illnesses, and conductingeducation or counseling in primary health care techniques was notregarded as cost effective. One author labelled this \"physicianmalutilization.\" In 1967 a survey of the American Academy ofPediatrics documented the fact that a high proportion ofpediatricians in office practice were performing tasks that didnot require a medical degree, such as weighing infants andchildren, vision screening and urinalysis.Surveys of internistsand family physicians yielded comparable results (Yankauer 1982, 252). 4.The advent of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 as well asthe growth in the number of people covered by private healthinsurance, was perhaps the most significant change for bothconsumers of health care and the practitioners. In 1940, lessthan 10% of the population had coverage for inpatient care. In1979/ four out of five Americans under the age of 65 had privatehealth insurance coverage for inpatient services provided by bothhospitals and physicians/ and 65% had some type of coverage forout of hospital physician visits.Medicare covered almost allAmerican citizens over age 65, and Medicaid, under whichbeneficiaries must show financial need, covered an estimated 131 125eleven percent of the population (Williams 1984, 355).Aperson's financial state now became less of a barrier inobtaining health care and demand for physician servicesconsequently increased.5.People came to regard adequate health care as a rightand not just a privilege reserved for the financially able. PaulStarr, a medical sociologist argues in favor of health care as aright and observes that it grew out of the broader\"generalization of rights\" that occurred in the United States asa whole following the momentum and inspiration of the CivilRights movement (1982, 388-389). In greater numbers than ever,people began to seek out medical and health care advice on alllevels from geriatrics to pediatrics. With physicians in shortsupply, a need grew for mid-level practitioners who could providebasic services.6.The Civil RiAihts movement may have played a strong partin the general feeling that there was an under-representation ofminorities in the health care field which could be redressedquickly only by training minority men and women in mid-levelwork.Statistics certainly bore this out. In the year 1970,only 697 first year medical students were black out of a total of 11,225.Minorities as a whole (Blacks, Hispanics, NativeAmericans and Chinese) made up only 8.9% of the first year class.Rocio Huet-Cox gave ever more dramatic statistics:In the year1968, Blacks, Native Americans and mainland Puerto Ricanstogether made up only 2.9% of the entering class in medical132 126schools (1984, 132).7. There was an increased demand for health services due tothe change in the U.S. population. In a widely publicized reportby the Surgeon General's Consultant Group on Medical Education in1959, it was predicted that there would be a rapid populationgrowth among the young and elderly, groups that have more illnessand disability (1959, 5).8. Concurrent with these changes in the demand for healthcare, there existed in the United States in the late sixties apool of trained personnel able to provide medical care. In thelast years of the decade, a large number of medical corpsmen whohad served with the U.S. forces in the Vietnam War began toreturn from active duty and to resume civilian life. About30,000 medics a year with $10 million worth of training werebeing discharged (New York Times Dec 13, 1970, 80). One third ofthese men found their way into civilian health employment, onethird chose to forget their training, while one third wanted jobsin the health area but couldn't find them.Many of these wereavailable for work as physician assistants.In conclusion, the need for health care in the U.S. in theearly 1960's met most of the conditions listed in the hypothesisof this paper, and gave rise to the new profession of physician assistants.There was a shortage as well as a maldistribution of physicians.Popular unrest was questioning the establishedtradition of health care, and the medical establishment itselfwas undergoingchange.Even though the government did not133 127establish a crash program to create mid-level healthprofessionals, the new profession of physician assistantnevertheless developed.To deal with the health-care shortages andmaldistribution arising from the factors listed above, the UnitedStates had two options: (1) to educate more fully-trainedphysicians or (2) to create a new class of mid-levelpractitioners. In the 1960's and 1970's, experiments were triedusing both approaches.To increase the number of fully trained physicians, medicalschools increased the size of their entering classes, new medicalschools were established and some schools tried decreasing thelength of medical education (Huet-Cox 1984, 140). As a result, the physician-to-population ratio per 1000000 did rise from 142in 1960 to 230 in 1986 (Physician Characteristics andDistribution in the U.S. 1987, 13).Although some observerspredicted a physician surplus by the mid 1980's, a recent article in JAMA argues that \"the rise in demand for physician serviceshas equalized or exceeded the rise in supply and gives noevidence of the physician surplus of 70,000 predicted for 1990 by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee andother analysts\" (January 26, 1990, 559). The problem ofdistribution does remain, with 85.7% of all doctors practicing inmetropolitan areas in 1970 and 87.9% in 1986 (PhysicianCharacteristics and Distribution in the U.S. 1987, 13). However the number ofphysicians in primary care specialties has 13.1 128increased from 137,975 in 1963 to 226,902 in 1986.1' The restof this chapter will be devoted to the second course of action,the creation of the mid-level health professional.The idea for intermediate health professionals in the UnitedStates was first proposed in 1961 by Dr. Charles Hudson,president of the National Board of Medical Examiners. Hesuggested the creation of \"one or two groups of assistants todoctors from non-medical, non-nursing personnel\" (839). Theseassistants would be trained to perform many routine patient carefunctions.However Hudson's ideas were not implemented until 1965/ inthree different programs. Although these programs had differentphilosophies behind them and included nurse practitioners as wellas physician assistants, they all shared one common goal:providing more accessible health care.Credit for the new profession of physician assistant alsobelongs to Dr. Eugene Stead, who set up the first actual programat Duke University in North Carolina in 1965.'6 Although notquite as radical as Mao Zedong about who should deliver healthcare, Dr Stead's beliefs differed from the conventional medicalviewpoint of the time in that he held that all medically trainedpersonnel had an important role to play in the care of the 'Primarycarespecialtiesareusually considered familypractice, general practice, internal medicine and pediatrics. \"In1970, Dr. Stead was awarded theAbraham Flexner AwardforDistinguishedService toMedicalEducation.He isstillwritingon a variety of topics, including the role of technologyand computers in medicine. 129patient.\" Dr. Stead believed that everyone who worked in thehealth care area had some contribution to make to the well beingof the patient. Each of us in the health field has oneprimary responsibility: to minister to theneeds of people in accordance with hisability.In the total care of the patientthere is no sharp dividing line between theactivities of the maid, the orderly, the aid,the practical nurse, the registered nurse,the dietician, the technicians of variouskinds, the professional nurse, the dentist,the doctor(1967, 949). Dr. Stead organized his program at Duke University afterthe National League of Nursing had turned down Duke's request foraccreditation of a Master's degree program intended to trainnurse practitioners (Yankauer 1982, 253). Nurses at that timewere seeking greater independence from physicians and did notwant to enter a program taught by doctors in which nurses wouldpractice only in a delegated role--i.e., limited to carrying outdoctors' orders under close supervision.The Duke program, two years in length, aimed to train a newhealth team member called a \"physician assistant.\" To enter, theonly education requirement was a high school degree. Initialrecruitment was aimed at military corpsmen. Although studentsfrom all backgrounds were accepted, the first class consisted of 17. It is interesting, althoughcoincidental, that the firstpthysician assistant program began in 1965, the same year that MaoZedong was proposing the need for barefoot doctors in China. 130four ex-corpsmen. Graduates received a certificate. They wereemployed individually by doctors, with their duties dependingupon their employer. The expressed philosophy behind the programwas that \"thephysician assistant can be taught to perform anyprocedure which requires skill and which is repeatedfrequently...He is trained to be an extension of the doctor'sarms and legs\" (Andreoli 1967, 1443).The second program aimed at creating a new mid-levelprovider, the nurse practitioners (NPs). Developed jointly by theSchool of Nursing and School of Medicine of the University ofColorado in 1965, the program prepared professional nurses togive comprehensive well-child care to children in an ambulatory setting.Nurses received initial training of four months, learningsuch skills as physical assessment and patient interviewing.Afterwards, the NPs practiced either in the offices ofpediatricians in private practice or in health stations and fieldoffices in low-income and rural areas.The nurses had thecapacity to \"furnish comprehensive well-child care to children ofall ages, identify and appraise chronic conditions and referpatients elsewhere, and to evaluate and temporarily manageemergency situations\" (Silver 1967, 443). There is a slightsimilarity here to the barefoot doctor in China, in that many ofthe duties were the same and in that both worked mainly in ruralareas, but animportant difference is that the nurse practitionerwas always under a physician's supervision. 3 131The third program, MEDEX, based at the University ofWashington in Seattle, was initiated in 1969. Unlike the twoprevious programs, it enrolled only returning military corpsmen.The program was described as \"a model of non-physicians extendingprimary medical care transferable to rural, suburban or urbansettings\" (Smith 1970, 1843-44). The students received threemonths of university training followed by twelve months ofpreceptorship with a practicing physician. Those who completedthe training received certificates and were employed asassistants by the physicians with whom they had served theirpreceptorship. They could also work for other doctorssubsequently.I will make no attempt to describe the further evolution andtraining of the physician assistant. Suffice it to say thatnumerous studies have shown that the quality of care deliveredboth by ptysician assistants and nurse practitioners has beenequal to that delivered by physicians and in some cases has beenrated superior (Yankauer 1982, 250). These new healthpractitioners have been well accepted by both physicians and the public.10Although there are important differences between theperceived roles of physician assistants and nurse practitioners(the medical profession views PAs as physician extenders while Ilk personalanecdote:When Iwas anurse's aidein thepediatrics clinic at Presbyterian Hospital in New York, I was abit surprised and impressed when a physician told the mother of anewbornbaby to go to a pediatric nurse practitioner rather thana physician since theformer was more skilled in providing carefor the infant and in patient teaching. :3 132nurses view NPs as RNs in extended roles), in actual practicetheir functions are usually similar.Most physician assistant programs today are two years inlength and combine theory with clinical practice.In 1988 therewere 49 programs accredited by the Committee on Allied HealthEducation and Accreditation (Allied Health Education Directory1989, 276). Applicants are less likely to have as extensive ahealth care background as they did in earlier years. However,their educational credentials are usually greater; in fact, mostnow have obtained college degrees before entering the programs.Most physician assistant programs offer a bachelors degree ratherthan a certificate. Although most early physician assistantswere male, today females make up about half of the usual PAclass.Currently there are 20,000 physician assistantspracticing in the United States (Telephone communication Jan.1990, National Commission on Certification of Physician'sAssistants).An important change has occurred in the practice environmentof the physician assistant. In the beginning, as noted, most PAsworked as assistants to doctors in private practice, almostalways in an office setting. Now more are working in hospitals,ambulatory emergency rooms, neighborhood clinics, large grouppractices or health maintenance organizations. They may alsoserve in areas where fully trained physicians would prefer not topractice, such as occupational health settings, prisons, long-term care institutions, rural areas and inner city ambulatory 139 133clinics. James Cawley, an authority on the physician assistant,says that they not only exhibit \"practice versatility\" (workingwhere needed) but that they have shown that they are costeffective.It costs less to educate physician assistants thanfull doctors and it costs less to employ them.An example known to me personally of a physician assistant!Ac:, is employed in an area where most doctors would prefer not toventure is Dawn Morton. She is a PA at the Bedford StuyvesantFamily Health Center in Brooklyn with the position of Coordinatorof the Brooklyn Team of Health Care for the Homeless.During a student internship in the spring of 1987, I had achance to see how she worked. She would travel with a socialworker and medical assistant to three different soup kitchens inimpoverished areas and make physical assessments, diagnoseillnesses, prescribe and dispense medications, provide basichealth education and counseling, and refer patients to physiciansas needed.In my judgment what she did was indistinguishablefrom what a physician might do in providing primary care. Shewas not just \"an extension of the arms of a physician,\" but anactual substitute for one.Although physicians were present at the Bedford-StuyvesantFamily Health Center, they did not go forth to the soup kitchens or other placeswhere the homeless people who needed careactually frequented.Ms. Morton told me that most classmates also went tomedically under-served areas when they graduated. However, most 134of these were in inner city areas such as New York.She knew ofonly one individual who had gone off to work in Appalachia, yetshe pointed out that it was not just therural areas in theUnited States that were in dire need of an increase in healthservices.\"The private doctor is not going to open a bigbeautiful office in Bedford Stuyvesant,\" Ms. Morton commented.Ms. Morton says she regrets what she regards as a growingtendency of PA graduates today to go into the field of hospitalsurgery since these positions usually pay better than inner cityjobs. In many cases a surgeon needs help while performingoperations, and a physician assistant can provide an extra set ofuseful hands. Furthermore it is less expensive for a hospital toemploy a physician assistant rather than an extra surgeon.'9Iasked Ms. Morton whether she believed she gave better care than aphysician.She replied that what she did (performing physicals,diagnosing and treating common problems and having the knowledgewhen to refer) she did well, but it could only be consideredbetter because she had more time to spend with an individualpatient.To round out the picture of physician assistants in theUnited States, I would like to comment on nurse practitioners whohave developed simultaneously with the physician assistant as \"A look atthe advertisements for physician assistants intheNew York Times on February 4/ 19901 confirmed Ms. Morton'sobservations.There were nine ads for physician assistants, ofwhich eight were from hospitals and one from a health maintenanceorganization.Most ofthe hospitalswanted physicians in thearea of surgery.1 4 135mid-level health workers.Nurse practitioner programs are either certificate programsthat last from eight to twelve months, or master degree programsrequiring one or two years of study. In 1990 there were 17,534certified nurse practitioners in primary care specialties. Theseinclude nurses certified by the American Nurses Association infive specialties; adult nurse practitioners, family nursepractitioners, pediatric nurse practitioners, school nursepractitioners and gerontological nurse practitioners as well asnurses certified by the National Association of Pediatric NurseAssociates and Practitioners (Pat Markway, Telephonecommunication, American Nurses Association, April 24, 1990). Inaddition there are several nurses association such as the NursesAssociation of the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists who certify nurses in specific specialties.Likephysician assistants, nurse practitioners work in a variety ofroles and settings. Ms. Morton reported that the head of theBronx team providing health care for the homeless is a nursepractitioner, and that the role of the nurse practitioner andphysician assistant is identical in that setting.I have little doubt that the physician assistant/nursepractitioner will continue to play a vital role in this country'shealth care system. As an institution that is less than twentyyears old, they are just coming into their own. Their roles,places of employment and working environment may change, but theywill continue to go where they are needed. 142 136 Chapter VI Conclusion China, the United States and the Soviet Union are three verydifferent countries in terms of government, politics, history,standard of living, cultural backgroumd and basic medical care system.Perhaps the only two things all three have in common aretheir large size and population.Yet all three rely on mid-levelhealth practitioners to provide basic health services torelatively large numbers of patients.In the Soviet Union and in China mid-level health practitioners provide care to millions of patients.The physician assistants in the United States totalabout 20,000 but they have become a new and significant part of modern health care. Although the roles, functions andeducational requirements of these mid-level health practitionerswill continue to evolve and change, it seems unlikely they will ever disappearfrom any of these countries for four reasons. 1.Educating fully trained physicians has becomeincreasingly costly both to the students and their training institutions.2.Even if a country does produce enough physicians, theproblem of maldistribution has always existed and will always ! 1 3 137 remain.In addition to the obvious attraction of city life, mostmedical school graduates prefer to have access to hospitals withsophisticated technology. 3.It is not always necessary to have fully trained doctorstreat many illnesses or provide primary medical care. 4.Being seen by a mid-level health practitioner may haveadded value for a patient because the mid-level practitioneroften is closer to the patient's own background.This point willbe discussed in more detail later on.The hypotheses generated prior to the study and statedearlier describes several conditions under which mid-level healthpractitioners flourish. The results of this thesis support theexistence of such conditions.The first two conditions were that mid-level healthpractitioners are of particular value 1) in countries with aremote or scattered population and 2) when there is a shortage offully trained physicians. The Soviet Union and China do havescattered populations with a large percentage of people in hard- to-reach areas. The United States also has a medicalmaldistribution problem which, though less acute than Russia's orChina's, nevertheless requires some alleviation by mid-levelpractitioners. The third condition states that mid-levelpractitioners increase in number and importance when popularunrest or upheaval challenge established systems or traditions ofhealth care. The activities of feldshers in Russia increasedduring the upheaval of the early Bolshevik days following the ! I 4 138 Revolution.The birth of the barefoot doctor in China wasdirectly linked to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.Although the sixties in the United States were not comparable tothe 1917 Revolution in Russia or the Cultural Revolution inChina, they were a period of relative unrest with many peoplequestioning government policy in many areas from the Vietnam Warand civil rights to the established system of health care.The fourth condition, that centralized governments caninitiate a crash program to create mid-level health practitionersto help upgrade the public health system, became operative inChina with the Cultural Revolution and to a lesser extent, in theUnited States with the advent of Medicaid and Medicare. A Comparison of the Three Systems Similarities and differences exist between the mid-levelpractitioners in the three countries. Some of the similarities are: 1.All three diagnose and treat common illnesses,prescribe some kinds of medication, and make decisions about when to refer.Patient counseling and education are always consideredimportant aspects of their jobs. 2.All three serve areas where physicians are not available.In China and the Soviet Union this is in the ruralcommunities, while in the United States this includes inner city areas as well as the rural communities.115 139 3.In all three countries their educational requirementsare changing.In the beginning, barefoot doctors only needed sixyears of primary school; now they must be middle schoolgraduates.Originally, applicants to physician assistantprograms needed only a high school degree; now some college isusually required. Although I could find no information on thechanging educational requirements of feldshers, in 1987 theamoLnt of education required for a physician was increased fromsix to seven years. It is likely that the Soviet Union willalso raise the educational requirements for a feldsher. 4.In all three countries, the mid-level healthpractitioners are closer to the people they serve than are fully trained physicians. They generally talk in a non-technicallanguage and have a better understanding of the patient'sculture.As already indicated, this is most true in China, butin the Soviet Union feldshers are most likely to be from ruralareas and in the United States the proportion of physicianassistants from minority groups is higher than that of MD's. 5.All three countries provide opportunities in health carefor men and women who would not have been able to become fullytrained doctors for financial, educational, social, academic orother personal reasons.Some of the differences among the three systems are: 1.In China, the barefoot doctor evolved from the people themselves.Although Mao made the statement, \"In health care putthe stress on the countryside\", neither he nor anyone else 1 .1 f; 140created a class of workers called barefoot doctors.Even thename \"barefoot doctor\" came from the peasants themselves. Untilrecently the government never regulated what these practitionerscould or could not do. This is in stark contrast to the SovietUnion and the United States. The feldsher was introduced byPeter the Great, the head of state, into the Russian military.What these providers can and cannot do is spelled out in greatdetail in the document \"Regulations Concerning the Rights andDuties of the Feldsher\" issued by the Ministry of Health on June61 1946.Unlike the barefoot doctor, who originally worked parttime in agriculture, the feldsher was always a medical worker.In the United States, the role and education of physicianassistants and nurse practitioners was crqated and defined bydoctors and nurses already in practice and in power. Today eachstate regulates and sets legal limits on the role of nursepractitioners and physician assistants. In training theseproviders, the United States, like the Soviets and unlike theChinese, offers formal instruction in schools.The Soviet Union is the only one of the three countrieswhose official policy is that its mid-level health practitioner,the feldsher, is a provider only until sufficient physicians areavailable to serve the whole country. However, this \"temporary\"condition has existed for decades and shows every sign ofcontinuing.It should be added that several Soviet republicshave recently noted the value of the feldsher (see page 61).Mikhail Gorbachev's regime has acknowledged that problems exist .17 141within the Soviet health care system, but has given no indicationof an intention to diminish the role of the feldsher.Ruth Sidel points out that the Chinese, in contrast to theRussians, have never adopted the attitude that barefoot doctorswere a \"stopgap\" measure. Instead, the Chinese understand thatmid-level providers fill a special function.3. Another difference is that in the United States anevaluation was built into physician assistant and nursepractitioner programs. Definitive studies have been carried outto measure the quality of the health care the programs provide,as well as their cost-effectiveness. Because China is so largeand poor, it would be difficult 4-o do such research.However,China is just starting to puLlish evaluations of the barefootdoctor. I could not find any indication that the Soviet Unionevaluates the feldsher on a large scale, although there have beenstudies of the health care they provide by independentresearchers. 4.China is the only country in which the education of themid-level health practitioner is tailored to an area's specificneeds.This may be because barefoot doctors were actuallyeducated on the commune where they would end up practicing.Inthe Soviet Union and the United States, students usually travelto a particular school for their education. In the UnitedStates, a physician assistant who treats the homeless at a soupkitchen in Brooklyn has basically the same education as one whotreats migrant workers in New Mexico, even though the health14s 142needs of the two populations might be very different. 5.In the Soviet Union and China, the feldsher and barefootdoctor are essential to the functioning of the country's healthcare system.In the United States, at this time, the physicianassistant's function is highly desirable but less essential. Thenumbers of these personnel show this is true.Estimates of thenumber of feldshers range from one half to one million and thereare at least one million barefoot doctors in China. In theUnited States in 1989 there were only 20,000 physicianassistants.They were never part of a mass movement like thebarefoot doctor was in China. Because the United States has goodtransportation, even people in remote areas can usually get tomedical care or the care can be brought to them. Areas for Further Study I would like to conclude by raising a question which Ibelieve is worthy of further study: Is the barefoot doctor orfeldsher concept, which has proven so useful in China and Russiarespectively, suitable for export either to third world countriesor even to inner-city and ghetto areas of advanced countries?1. Third World Countries - In 1979 Robert Blendon, of theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, published an article titled \"CanChina's Health Care be Transplanted Without China's EconomicPolicies?\"His auewer was no. \"China's health care system is areflection of the way China has chosen to organize its national 143life,\" he said. \"It is not...a separable phenomenon...somethingthat could be transported across international borders as couldbe done with a new vaccine or surgical procedure\" (1453).However, in an article published in World Health Forum in 1981,nine health officials found that health auxiliary mid-levelpractitioners, had made important contributions in LatinAmerican, Asian and African countries. These authoritiesconcluded that \"village health workers\", indigenous practitionerssomewhat analogous to the barefoot doctor, performed significantservices in education, prevention and elementary medical care inrural areas (Werner 1981, 46-68). They could become a vitalelement in a country's medical services. Some places where thesevillage health workers practice include Mexico? Columbia,Guatemala, Peru, Mozambique and Tanzania (Werr:r 1981, 46-68).Although none is identical either to the Chinese or Sovietmodel, they meet a serious medical need in their country's poorerareas.In many cases their work is affected by politicalramifications, since they may be used \"as vehicles of a nation'soverall political strategy\" (Stark 1985, 269).Furtherinvestigation and research is necessary to determine the ultimateeffectiveness of mid-level workers in these settings.2.Inner city and ghetto areas - Several authors haveexpressed doubts about the value of the barefoot doctor andfeldsher model for advanced countries like the United States. In the article previously cited, Blendon points out that of thephysician assistants and nurse practitioners in the United 15'1 144States, less than forty percent have chosen to locate in ruralcommunities. Unlike China, he notes that U.S. medical personnelare under no compulsion as to where to serve. Another critic,Dr. Allan Lurie, wrote that the United States needed \"fullytrained qualified general practitioners, not half trained quasi-physicians\" (1968, 1296). In 1977, Milton Terris, chairman ofthe Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at New YorkMedical College, deplored \"feldhsherism\", sayi;Ag that thetraining of physician assistants and nurse practitioners in thiscountry would lead to two separate classes of medical care and be\"the epitome of class discrimination\" (134). Dr. Terris cited theexample of the industrialized countries of Eastern Europe, whichhave tried to increase the number of physicians rather thantraining mid-level health workers. Cuba went a similar route.lost forty percent of its 6,000 physicians in the early 1960's,but by 1976 had increased their number to 9,000.However, as a result of my research and interviews, I havecome to theconclusion that it is entirely conceivable that underthe right circumstances and in the right localities there maywell be a place for an American equivalent of the barefootdoctor.Dr. Blendon's contention that too many mid-levelpractitiomIrs prefer to work in urban settings loses some of itsvalidity when one realizes that there is a great need for suchproviders in inner-city areas. As Dawn Morton, the physicianassistant who works with the homeless in soup kitchens pointed 145out in an interview, \"no doctor is going to set up a bigbeautiful office in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and not all the poorpeople who need help are in Appalachia.\"Dr. Terris's argument that countries like those in EasternEurope prefer to train full physicians rather than mid-levelproviders also seems irrelevant. There is no indication that thecreation of the physician assistant is leading to a two classmedical care system in the United States. Inner city patientsget good basic care from the physician assistant, perhaps on alevel with the care given by many full physicians in EasternEurope or the Soviet Union where the process of becoming aphysician is not as long and medical technology is not as welldeveloped.The nearest this country has ever come to using the Chinesemodel barefoot doctor was in the neighborhood health centermovement of the late 1960's and early 1970's. At that time,people from the actual community were given basic training inhealth care and social services, and performed simple tasks liketaking blood pressure and providing health education. However,most of these programs have disappeared because of decreasedgovernment funding. Reviving at least that aspect of the programwhich trained paraprofessionals from the community would be astep toward implementing the barefoot doctor concept in the U.S.and improving local health care.While I was interviewing Dr. Ruth Sidel, we somehow gotoff the topic of feldshers and barefoot doctors and started 5 2 146talking about teenage pregnancy. I had asked Dr. Sidel whethershe thought barefoot doctors could work in this country wherepeople were used to seeing not only fully trained M.D.s butsuperspecialists. She had no doubt that the concept could workin some form.She described a session she had attended atPlanned Parenthood run by a Hispanic woman who had a littletraining from Planned Parenthood for ten teenagers from theneighborhood.\"She was wonderful. No physician, even asympathetic physician from the same cultural background as theclients could do as good a job as she did.By the time you gothrough medical school, internship and a residency program youhave it rubbed out of you...How abouttraining some women fromthe South Bronx and East Harlem who speak Spanish and are .:romthe neighborhood, and training them to go door to door and talkabout alternatives in contraception, condoms and AIDS...Thiswould also provide jobs. We should use the talents and skillsthey have of talking to each other in their own language and Idon't mean just Spanish.\"I believe further research into the potential use of abarefoot-doctor equivalent in the urban setting of the UnitedStates would be a worthwhile project.As a result of my studiesof the activities and achievement of mid-level practitioners inthree very different societies, I have come to the conclusionthat no one country has yet achieved the perfect health caremodel and that as we enter a new and changing era there is muchthat we can learn from one another.153 147Works ConsultedAckerknecht, E.H.\"From Barber Surgeon to Modern Doctor.\"Bulletin of the History of Medicine 58 (1984): 545-553.\"Advance Along the Widening Road Pointed Out by Chairman Mao.\"Chinese Medical Journal 1 (1975): 159-166.Allied HealthEducation Directory.
