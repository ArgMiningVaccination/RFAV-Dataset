While these are great ways to detox, there's a lesser known way which can benefit you greatly during detoxification: chiropractic care. This way of cleansing the body has started to become more popular in recent years because of how effective it is. It helps get rid of toxins in the joints and muscles that other types of detoxification processes have less of an effect on. How it works Chiropractic adjustments help align the spine and joints which become misaligned over time or become suddenly misaligned due to sports, accidents or everyday wear and tear. This can get rid of many chronic aches and pains. But that's not the only benefit of chiropractic care. Adjustments also cause your joints to release any built-up toxins so that your body can get rid of them. This is essential for full-body detoxification. With your spine being the connection between your brain and the rest of your body, it's vital that it is not overloaded with toxins. Why detox is beneficial The average person comes in contact with about 500 chemicals each and every day. Many of these chemicals are toxic to our bodies. This includes herbicides like glyphosate, pesticides found in food, BPA found in plastics, and heavy metals. Even with a healthy diet and exercise, there may still be many toxins in your body due to poor air quality. Your spine and joints build up these toxic substances over time. If not dealt with, they can cause health problems that range from minor to severe. A mild amount of toxins in the body can often cause fatigue, sleepiness, a lack of concentration, and an overall unhealthy body. But there are deeper health concerns as well. Toxins have been found to cause cancer, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases. It could get worse before it gets better Following a chiropractic adjustment, the positive effects of detoxifying won't be immediately evident. In fact, you may feel like you've come down with a cold. This is because after the toxins have been released from your spine and joints, your body has to work extra hard at expelling the toxicities. You may experience headaches, tight muscles, night sweats, and diarrhea. Not to worry, the symptoms should pass quickly. After your body has cleansed itself, then you should begin to feel more energetic, healthy, happy, and focused than you were before. The more often you detoxify, the fewer symptoms you are likely to experience because of lower concentrations of toxins in the body. It's helpful to drink lots of water after a chiropractic adjustment to clear out the toxins as quickly as possible. How to support natural detoxification While chiropractic care can't fully detoxify your body on its own, it is an incredibly important part of the natural detoxification process. As you detoxify, it's essential to consider nutrition, exercise, and chemicals you may come into contact with regularly. Optimal detoxification requires both avoiding toxins and promoting the release of already built-up toxins. Eat fresh and organic foods that contain no herbicides or pesticides, so you don't add more toxins to your body. Avoid foods like red meat and refined oils which often contain high amounts of toxins. Consider adding a cleansing supplement to your diet. Ingredients like black walnut and fenugreek will help support your body's natural detoxification process. Check labels to ensure you purchase plastic products that are BPA-free. Try natural cleaning products since most cleaning supplies contain harmful chemicals which can stay in your body after inhaling. Stretching and exercising is also important in getting rid of harmful substances in your muscles. It's good to sweat out any toxins daily during your workout\u2014just drink plenty of fresh water. "}
