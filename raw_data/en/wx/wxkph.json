Here are some of the beneficial properties and contents of raw food:](https://hayhouseoz.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/picture-52.png) \u2014 Enzymes. Uncooked foods contain enzymes, which are proteins that are catalysts for digestion, immune-system functioning, energy production, and brain activity. Since heat destroys one of the most vital types and changes all enzymes' structure, cooking diminishes the vital nutrients in your meals! Cooked food is therefore difficult to digest, puts undue stress on your pancreas, and sits in your body longer. Raw food digests in one-half to one-third the time of its cooked counterpart. \u2014 Protein. Cooking destroys at least one-half of food's available protein\u2014the building block of muscular growth and regeneration! Vegetables, fruits, nuts, and legumes contain more than sufficient protein to fuel healthy bodies. In addition, since raw living food is vegan, you avoid animal-based proteins, which studies have linked to cancer, osteoporosis, and other health concerns. \u2014 pH balance. Raw living foods also help you maintain a homeostatic balance of alkaline and acid, which increasing numbers of studies link to health, youthfulness, and longevity. The standard western diet creates an extremely acidic environment for the body, making it more susceptible to disease and degeneration. In contrast, most raw and unprocessed fruits and vegetables have a healthful alkaline effect on the body. \u2014 Vitamins and minerals. Cooking destroys 50 to 80 percent of vitamins and minerals in foods and half of the antioxidants and carotenoids, thereby reducing the nutritional value of your meals. For example, it destroys 50 to 96 percent of B vitamins\u2014including 97 percent of folic acid and 72 percent of biotin\u2014and up to 80 per cent of vitamin C. A 2006 Louisiana State University study examined the diets of more than 10,000 men and women. Researchers found that those who consumed the most raw vegetables and salads had significantly higher blood-serum levels of vitamins C and E, folic acid, and carotenoids. The study concluded that these nutrients were well absorbed from a diet of salad and raw vegetables. Another study conducted in Finland in 1995 found that raw living food-ists had significantly higher blood levels of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, even when they weren't consuming nutritional supplements. \u2014 Water. Since our bodies are 60 to 70 percent water, we need to hydrate throughout the day. Cooking effectively dehydrates food. \u2014 Oils. The natural oils in food are denatured through the cooking process, rendering it more difficult to digest and utilize. This happens as the molecular structure of the oil is changed during exposure to high heat, making it literally a poison in the body. When you incorporate more raw living foods into your daily diet, you'll soon discover that it's a lifestyle and not just an eating plan. That's why some raw food-ists become a little fanatical\u2014they're models for the many emotional and spiritual benefits of eating uncooked foods. These benefits include the following: \u2014 Optimal daily health. A feeling of peace, tranquility, and harmony accompanies our bodies when they're in a balanced state of optimal nutrition. It's easier to get going in the morning, with more energy throughout the day and mental clarity for better performance at home and at work. A 1985 study reported in Southern Medical Journal found that a raw-food diet significantly reduced blood pressure, resulted in weight loss, and led 80 percent of participants to abstain from alcohol and cigarette consumption. Other studies show beneficial health effects for those who have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. And because raw vegan food is completely cholesterol free, it's a heart-healthy diet. Raw-food eating brings benefits rapidly as well! A 1992 Finish study discovered statistically significant health improvement among chronically ill people when they switched to an all-raw-vegetable diet for just one week! An infamous experiment called the China Study found that tumors grew in rats fed a high-animal-fat diet, yet researchers discovered that the tumors reversed when the animal fat was removed or replaced with plant fats (such as vegetable oils, avocados, or nuts). They also linked breast cancer and diabetes to the consumption of animal-based protein. In addition, a 1990 German study found that a raw vegan diet significantly boosted the immune system. \u2014 Ecological friendliness and freedom from cruelty. Any form of vegetarianism reduces the pollution and cruelty connected to animals raised for meat, fur, or leather. Compared to meat, dairy, eggs, and other animal products, a diet of vegetables and fruit (especially organic and locally grown varieties) means less water consumption, carbon footprints, air pollution, and toxic chemical runoff into waterways. \u2014 Weight loss. When you stop eating high-fat animal products, you automatically lose weight. A 1999 German study found that women shed an average of 26 pounds and men an average of 22 pounds after going on a raw-food diet. A similar study conducted in Finland in 1993 found that raw-food participants lost an average of 9 percent of their body weight. \u2014 Long-term health. Eating a raw-living-food diet is preventive medicine at its best. A healthy, balanced living-foods diet can stave off disease in the body, ultimately reducing risks of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, poor vision, and arthritis. \u2014 Beauty. Healthy hair, skin, and fingernails; optimal weight management; and sound immune function lead to all aspects of beauty, inside and out. The density of vitamins and nutrients available in raw fruits and vegetables supports a beautiful body and mind. \u2014 Emotional Healing. A raw diet cleanses your system of any toxic chemicals that formerly played a part in controlling and dulling your emotions. Many people report that eating a diet that's free of toxins makes them sensitive to the emotions and personalities of those around them. The reality is that since your body no longer has to remove food toxins, you're more open to experiencing other parts of life. For some, this can open the door to in-depth emotional healing. You'll also find you're likely to attract healthy new friends and enjoy an increase in accurate intuition.
