Not all weirdos are wrong. We had a pretty young lab chemist with a bubbly personality. Marketing snapped her up, and soon she was outearning all of us. Of course that was complete coincidence.I would have assumed this was a joke -- but I witnessed a crew of GSK sales reps descend upon my usual Starbucks once... so I know that it's absolutely true. It shouldnt be possible to get a doctorate if you are in the bottom 15%.Our society has always overemphasized inteligence as though it's a wholly-encompassing trait. The technical criteria for being a genius are that you have an IQ in the top 15%, which means that about 1 in 7 people are geniuses. I can assure you that not a single genius who's ever lived has been right about everything they ever thought or said, from da Vinci to Einstein. Every one of them has blindspots. Even if we ignore the obviousness that being super smart doesn't make you immune from being super wrong, and we grant that it's reasonable to suppose that many doctors do have top 15% IQs, it's highly unlikely that everyone who can legally call themselves a doctor is within that genius category. More likely a 'negative ion'Please, please, tell me that she wears a magnetic bracelet \"for its health benefits\"! The overwhelming majority of them ... just sliding through their internships and residencies as quickly and painlessly as possible (which is next to impossible), while jonesing for a specialty. You have a dim view of US medical education, training and professional regulation, which is your right. But you also generalize based on worst case examples, and spew outright falsehoods.It's easier to pass ONE board/certification body than it is TWO (one for the medical license, the other for a specialty). And a lot of \"medical schools\" don't really provide the necessary training, since many aren't actually accredited (it depends on state and such, with some being less tolerant of these kinds of institutions than others). Since medical licenses aren't a government title or award and are awarded by the state boards, only the state medical boards - not the criminal justice system - can take them away. And most are VERY loathe to do that. It usually takes them defying a medical board to lose their license, but it really does depend on the state board's rules. Because Scotland, Wales and England are separate (sort of), constituent countries of the United Kingdom.Why does Scotland and Wales have different rules on some fronts compared to England? Especially not 2 YEARS after complaints began. I understand due process, but after she didn't respond for a 3 months - 90 days is plenty of time to respond if you need more time, are trying to cooperate, etc., but suspension should have been immediate after 90 days pending either cooperation or full investigation. Most states have rules (and in my profession) that allow for professional licenses to be suspended if you fail to cooperate or respond at all in a short but reasonable amount of time.Good, but it's a bit concerning that it took the board this long to suspend her after that many complaints. Medical boards exist, in part, to protect public safety and to safeguard patients. If a doctor is subject to 350 complaints, he or she should probably be immediately suspended pending the outcome of an investigation, not suspended following investigation. No I have not seen that. I have seen comments that DOs embrace other methods, but I have not seen specific commentary that they have abandoned the osteopathic methods they are taught in osteopathic schools.And you have other commenters (and [your own linked source]) pointing out that DOs now generally do not practice OMT when seeing patients. The name of a qualification does not necessarily correspond to the present-day reality; I know plenty of PhDs who are not actually learned experts in philosophy (not even in \"natural philosophy\", unless electrical engineering and computer science somehow made the cut). That was the original organizing principle of the United States, too. It has taken too long to gradually shake it off.Because Scotland, Wales and England are separate (sort of), constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Even assuming vaccines made you magnetic (a big ask, I know), did Sherri Tenpenny explain why that might be bad? I mean, sure, if I really turned magnetic it would probably be because I had an unusually - and probably unsafe - amount of iron in my body which would interfere with various chemical interactions. But I doubt that sort of thing would be Tenpenny's concern. So what - according to Ms. Tenpenny - is the problem with being magnetic? Does it interfere with woo-woo energy fields that homeopaths think exist in the body? Does God not like magnetic people? Why should I - were I to subscribe to Tenpenny's beliefs - be worried about being magnetic? Where's the downside of it, according to her? Or did she just throw out 'magnetic' because magnets are apparently some sort of black magic that nobody understands (she thinks) and therefore must be bad? Give me the science, Tenpenny! Because, honestly, I could see being magnetic as having a number of advantages. Just think; I'd never again lose a tiny screw when taking apart a computer! Although it's further complicated by the fact that Wales is technically a conquered nation, while Scotland isn't.Because Scotland, Wales and England are separate (sort of), constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Jokes aside I cannot decide whether she's a moron, evil or both but that doesn't matter as any of these options IMO disqualify anyone for the medical profession. It does bother me A LOT that there's a possibility that she'l regain her license. That should not be possible. Oh I don't know - I feel quite repelled by her.She doesn't exactly have a magnetic personality. Stroke, drug abuse or alcoholism, traumatic head injury, dementia or other mental illness that developed later in life, etc. Why are DOs and MDs separate qualifications ?And you have other commenters (and [your own linked source]) pointing out that DOs now generally do not practice OMT when seeing patients. The name of a qualification does not necessarily correspond to the present-day reality; I know plenty of PhDs who are not actually learned experts in philosophy (not even in \"natural philosophy\", unless electrical engineering and computer science somehow made the cut). She had the upgraded model. It's magnetic and homeopathic!The one time my mum tried to convince me to wear one of those, tapped it against the various magnets on our fridge. As far as I could tell it wasn't even magnetic. Internal magnetism isn't inherently unhealthy. The problem comes from its interaction with the radiation from 5G cell towers...So what - according to Ms. Tenpenny - is the problem with being magnetic? Not to mention how many unvaccinated people have perished after falling into tall, conductive pipes.Because, honestly, I could see being magnetic as having a number of advantages. Just think; I'd never again lose a tiny screw when taking apart a computer! Ever since getting my vaccine, doctors have warned me against spinning really fast while standing on a copper plate.Not to mention how many unvaccinated people have perished after falling into tall, conductive pipes. This is fair, I suppose but it's like complaining that you call the slowest Olympic sprinter \"a sprinter\". Yes they're the slowest of the bunch but it's a pretty fast bunch and you (usually) have to beat out a lot of good people to get there.What do you call the person who graduated at the bottom of their medical school class? Doctor. Indeed.I still cannot fathom how someone who thinks a vaccine can make your entire body magnetic can ever have been a doctor in the first place. It started June 16, 2015, when a 'magnetic' entity (patient zero) rode down a gold plated escalator. The virus he shed spread through the Internet, infecting and devouring brains, until reaching IQ 45, after which the patient simply babbbles or repeats nonsensical talking points. She likely contracted the infection from a public toilet seat, due to the proximity of those entities' brains. Definitive diagnoses useful in managing public mental health pandemics can also be made if the patient appears on television with mascara dripping from the temples, mentions Israeli space lasers, posthumous voting machine tampering, Chinese bamboo ballot content, state or federal Constitutional-overriding superusers, possessors of alternative facts, slavery-based trade skills, or that the word militia means an individual when referring to possessing automatic weapons - in that case indicating an infection cluster, or at least a cluster foxtrot uniform charlie kilo...I still cannot fathom how someone who thinks a vaccine can make your entire body magnetic can ever have been a doctor in the first place. Exactly. I was also dissapointed that my arm did not get magnetic. There really is a market for that.Wait I didn't get magnetism with my dose, I want a refund. You want to get marketized?Exactly. I was also dissapointed that my arm did not get magnetic. There really is a market for that. I'd argue that I've fixed that for you, she's welcome to show her face and argue otherwise.It also verifies that she continues to believe in and push her bullshit. This person should never be allowed to practice medicine again. Yes it truly boggles the mind. Either she's a dogmatic-religio moron who believes anything she reads online, or someone in the GOP is paying her behind the scenes to suit their anti-science narrative.I still cannot fathom how someone who thinks a vaccine can make your entire body magnetic can ever have been a doctor in the first place. The etc. would probably include kickbacks from the anti-science GOP.You may as well ask how a person who only thinks of money can become a doctor. One need not believe in the discipline in order to practice the discipline. Besides, it seems as if she makes most of her money selling anti-vaccine products and services, like shirts, books, seminars, etc... I would add kickbacks from the GOP to that list.Stroke, drug abuse or alcoholism, traumatic head injury, dementia or other mental illness that developed later in life, etc. That would mean that doctorates couldn't be issued anymore, because no matter how many people you purge from the graduation rolls, there's always a new bottom 15%.It shouldnt be possible to get a doctorate if you are in the bottom 15%. Tell it to the managers who are always watching the metrics and trying to force out the \"bottom\" scoring employees so they only have a team of \"rockstar supertechs.\"That would mean that doctorates couldn't be issued anymore, because no matter how many people you purge from the graduation rolls, there's always a new bottom 15%. Good, can't wait.Oh great, now I suppose these \"medical boards\" are going to go after physicians who prescribed ivermectin for covid treatment. Where will it end? FTFY ;-)Tell it to the managers who are always watching the metrics and trying to force out the \"bottom\" scoring employees so they only have a team of \"rockstar supertechs.\"can get their golden parachute as the company folds and they move on to a new Csuite job elsewhere Giving you the benefit of the doubt, you must have missed the context of the post I was replying to (even though it was right there in my post). It was about the range of iq's in the general population, not who was top or bottom of their class.That would mean that doctorates couldn't be issued anymore, because no matter how many people you purge from the graduation rolls, there's always a new bottom 15%. And how, exactly, are you going to determine that? IQ tests are notoriously racist and unreliable.Giving you the benefit of the doubt, you must have missed the context of the post I was replying to. It was about the range of iq's in the general population, not who was top or bottom of their class. Doctors shouldnt be the stupidest of the general population, no matter what family they came from.
