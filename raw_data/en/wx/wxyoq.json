During this time numerous studies have been performed documenting side effects, some of which appear over time, some within weeks or month s, but all can have a serious impact on health. An effort was made to perform a series of comprehensive literature surveys to better understand immediate and long -term side effects of these agents . The results of this literature review have led to several recommendations. These recommendations are listed below with the documentation of the research noted on the following pages. Action Requested Drugs which should be removed from the market: Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) o Recommendation to remove from the market the injectable contraceptive Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA ; Depo Provera ) based on conclusive evidence that it facilitates the transmission of HIV from men to women. Nume rous alternatives are available. Black box warnings that should be added to prescribing information Breast Cancer o Combined estrogen- progestogen contraceptives (COCs, including oral, intravaginal and transdermal formulations) are acknowledged by IARC as Group I carcinogens. Substantial data supports an increased risk of breast cancer with the use of COCs . A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that they have been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. o Progestogen -only contraceptives (POCs) have not been extensively studied, but one large registry study did show a sign ificantly increased risk of breast cancer with use of POCs. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, a similar warning should be added to all POCs. Patient - related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Cervical Cancer o COCs have been linked to a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer. Similar data have been shown for POCs. A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs and POCs that they have been shown to increase the risk of cervical cancer. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Inflammatory Bowel Disease o Significantly higher risk for the development of inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease, but also ulcerative colitis, has been s hown for COCs . A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use is linked to a significantly increased risk for the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) o Significantly higher risk for the development of SLE has been shown for COCs in several studies, especially the best -designed, largest cohort studies. A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use is linked to a significant ly increased risk of the development of SLE. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Depression and S uicide 5 o Substantive evidence indicates there is a 25% risk of depression for women under 25 years of age especially within 6 mont hs of starting COCs. A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use is linked to a significantly increased risk of the development of depression. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. o The relativ e risk for suicide attempts ranges from 1.91 for COC's, to 2.29 for oral progestins, 2.58 for vaginal ring and 3.28 for patch among adolescents and young wome n - mean age 21 years - peaking within two months of onset of medication. A black box warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use is linked to a significantly increased risk of suicide. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Close monitoring is essential especially in the first year of use. Venous Thro mbosis and Cardiovascular Events o The current black box warning regarding thrombotic events on some formulations , notes \"WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS.\" This is misleading and has shown to be misinterpreted by many women who i nfer that the increased risk only occurs with cigarette smoking and/or with being over 35 years of age . The warning s should be amended to state, \"WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS INCLUDING BLOOD CLOTS.\" o This warning should be requi red for hormonal birth control products including oral, intravaginal and transdermal formulations. The patient -related materials should clearly explain the genetic risk factors, other risk factors, and the signs and symptoms. This warning should be included in ALL direct -to-consumer advertising (television, print, radio, etc.) . Additional safety information which should be added Multiple Sclerosis (MS) o Significantly higher risk for the development of MS has been shown for COCs in several studies, especially the best -designed, largest case -control studies. A warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use appears to be linked to a significantly increased risk of the development of MS. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Bone Fractures o Use of POCs is clearly associated with a higher risk of bone fractures. A warning should be added to the labeling of all POCs that their use is linked to a significantly increased risk of the development of bone fractures. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. o Protracted use of COCs has been associated with an increased risk of bone fracture s. A warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their prolonged use may be linked to a significantly increased risk of the development of bone fracture s. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. Body Mass Effects o For ANY progestin -releasing IUD: Add to professional label in side effects/precautions: Progestin -releasing IU Ds (IUCs) have demonstrated in clinical trials to significantly increase % fat body mass with a corresponding decrease in % lean body mass over 1 year of use. Add to patient -related materials : Use of (Brand name) may increase the percent of fat in your body while decreasing the percent of lean body mass ; this change in body composition is 6 known to increase risk of other serious conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular prob lems. o This warning should be included in all direct -to-consumer advertising (television, print, radio, etc.) as it demonstrates use of IUCs may contribute to other serious chronic health conditions. o Similar labeling should be considered for p rogestin -only contraceptives . Although the current evidence is less , it tends in the same direction. Urogenit al Problems o Interstitial Cystitis: Significantly higher risk for the development of interstitial cystitis has been shown for COCs in two studies. A warning should be added to the labeling of all COCs that their use appears to be linked to a significantly increased risk of the development of interstitial cystitis. Patient -related materials should also adequately convey this risk. o COCs have also been li nked to an increased risk of bacteriuria, urinary tract infection s, bladder trabeculation, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal dryness, vulvar vestibulitis, (FSD) caused by OC -induced dyspareunia and reduced sexual desire and li bido. These risks should be adequately conveyed in the prescribing information, especially FSD where there is substantial literature evidence . List of Agents A list of the agents discussed is shown below. Other than Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA ; Depo Provera) we refer in general to COCs (which refers to all combined estrogen -progestogen contraceptive formulations) and POCs (which refers to all progestin -only contraceptive formulations) regardless of the route of administration (e.g. oral, intrav aginal, transdermal, implants, IUS/IUD, NORTREL generic therapeutic equivalents FE 7 and generic therapeutic equivalents NORINYL 1+35 24 FE TAYTULLA MIBELAS 24 FE MICROGESTIN 1/20 MICROGESTIN FE 1/20 JUNEL 1/20 GILDESS 1/20 and GILDESS FE 1/20 LARIN 1/20 and LARIN FE 1/20 BLISOVI 1/20 and BLISOVI FE 1/20 AUROVELA 1/20 and AUROVELA 1/20 FE HAILEY 1/20 and HAILEY FE 1/20 and generic therapeutic equivalents generic therapeutic equivalents ZOVIA 1/35E and generic -LINYAH TRI-SPRINTEC TRIPREVIFEM -28 TRI-LINYAH TRI-ESTARYLLA LO TRI-PREVIFEM TRI LO SPRINTEC LO-ZUMANDIMINE and generic therapeutic therapeutic equivalents YASMIN 28 SYEDA YAELA ZUMANDIMINE and generic therapeutic equivalents SAFYRAL NATAZIA Combined EE -P Contraceptive Patch ORTHO EVRA XULANE Combined EE -P Contraceptive Ring NUVARING 11 KYLEENA IUD 12 Statement of Grounds Risk of HIV Transmission One of the most common forms of steroidal contraception is the injectable contraceptive: Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). DMPA is highly effective and requires only quarterly injections, as opposed to daily oral ingestion. As a long -acting type of effective contraceptive, it is not unique, as there are other injectable or implantable contraceptives in wide use, e.g., norethisterone enanthate (NET), as well as other delivery systems such as vaginal rings and patches. However, evidence began emerging in the 1990s, which has become compelling in recent years, that DMPA is unique among contraceptives in its property of facilitating the transmission of HIV. This dangerous characteristic has been abundantly and unequivocally documented through several lines of evidence which are summarized below: Epidemiological Evidence A. Four meta -analyses (3 reports) were published in 2015. Each used different inclusion criteria and compiled the data on different numbers of studies, yet all 4 came up with essentially the same result of significantly increased risk of male -to-female HIV tra nsmission in women using DMPA (Table 1).

Ten primary studies (all longitudinal, published between 2003 and 2014, listed in Table 2 below) were methodologically robust enough to meet the inclusion criteria of all 3 published reviews. 13 Table 2 - Individual Studies of the Effects of DMPA HIV Transmission Study Yr.(s) of study Pop. size Nation and locale Subject source Months of follow -up Follow -up interval (months) Type of data shown HR or IRR (95% CI) Weight (%) Crook 2014 2005-2009 8,663 S Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia Microbicide trial sero 12 1 South Africa, Zimbabwe Diaphragm/gel HIV prev. trial 24 3 MV HR 1.22 (0.85-1.76) 13.20 Morrison 2012 2004-2007 5,567 South Africa General population 9-24 3 MSM HR 1.27 (0.93-1.73) 15.32 Wand 2012 Not reported 2,236 Durban, S.

Mechanistic Evidence A. In vivo evidence of increased HIV transmission: Heffron et al. (2012) reported the increased presence of HIV -1 RNA in genital fluids of women using DMPA. B. In vitro evidence of increased HIV replication at the cellular level: Maritz et al. (2018) reported experimental evidence of increased replication of HIV in human blood monocytes with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) . C. Experimental evidence o f agonistic binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as the mechanism for DMPA's immunosuppression: over the last 15 years, abundant experimental evidence of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive action of DMPA via its agonistic binding to the GR of human leukocytes has been reported (Schindler 2003; Hapgood and Tomasicchio 2010, Hapgood 2014.) Thus, Huijbregts et al. (2014) reported experimental evidence of immunosuppression of human T cells in vitro by MPA. Tomasicchio et al. (2013) reported experimental evi dence of increased human T -cell destruction in vitro via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with MPA. Hapgood et al. (2014) reported : \"that MPA, unlike NET and progesterone, represses inflammatory genes in human PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in a dose -dependent manner, via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), at concentrations within the physiologically relevant range. These and published results collectively suggest that the differential GR activity of MPA versus NET may be a mechanism whereby MPA , unlike NET or progesterone, differentially modulates HIV -1 acquisition and pathogenesis in target cells where the GR is the predominant steroid receptor expressed.\" D. Evidence of mechanism of MPA action at the gene expression level: e xperimental evidence o f MPA -mediated suppression of inflammatory genes via GR in cultured human cells (Govender 2014) demonstrated the suppression of inflammatory genes in cultured human endocervical cells. Summary and Conclusions: DMPA, in contrast to all other steroidal con traceptives, has now conclusively been demonstrated to significantly increase the risk of HIV transmission from infected men to women. The robust epidemiological association has been supported by in vivo evidence of increased HIV RNA in the female genital tracts of women using DMPA. Moreover, abundant experimental evidence has shown that MPA, due to its agonistic binding of the GR, specifically represses the innate immune responses of both circulating hum an leukocytes and endocervical cells and allows for increasing HIV replication. The demonstration in the literature of the chain of causation is therefore compelling. In the United States, where the availability of a wide range of contraceptive drugs and devices is virtually universal, and where, among these contraceptive choices, one and only one particular method\u2014 DMPA \u2014is now known to increase the transmission of an often- fatal viral infection (HIV/AIDS), there can be no justification for such a drug's c ontinued availability in the marketplace. It should be removed from the marketplace by the FDA without further delay. 15 Risk of HIV Transmission References Baeten JM, Benki S, Chohan V, -Achola JO, Jaoko and Overbaugh J .

Each paper was rated based on the parameters noted in the STROBE statement (von Elm et al . 2007). Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (excluding non -melanoma skin cancers) in women in developed nations, including the U.S., with 1.7 million cases diagnosed worldwide annually. It accounts for 20% of all cancers in women.1 According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) statistics2, it is estimated that there are about 3,418,000 women with inva sive breast cancer in the USA as well as over 60,000 cases of in situ cancers . There will be about 266,000 new cases of breast cancer in 2018, accounting for 15.3% of all new cancer cases, with about 41,000 deaths, accounting for 6.7% of all cancer deaths. Nulliparity or late childbearing and high body mass index are risk factors for breast cancer as is exposure to COCs and HRT. Any risk factors that are controllable should be minimized. The data for breast cancer is shown split into cohort studies ( Table 3), case control studies ( Table 4) and meta- analyses (Table 5). The carcinogenicity of combined estrogen -progestogen contraceptives was evaluated by IARC working groups initially in 1998 (monograph published in 1999) and again in 2005 (monograph published in 2007). This was most recently updated with studies published through May 2008 (IARC 2012). Since that time, several important studies have been published, most of which are supportive of the IARC classifi cation of C OCs as Group I carcinogens and in agreement with the IARC evaluation of specific cancer types. In addition, several important studies have been published evaluating C OCs and their cancer risk. In 2002 the National Toxicology Program added steroidal estrogen as a known human carcinogen (Report on Carcinogens, Fourteenth Edition available at https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/pubhealth/roc/index -1.html ). In agreement with IARC the recent data confirms an increased risk of breast cancer with use of C OCs (Table 2). After 2005, there continue to be studies demonstrating the significant risk of breast cancer with hormonal contraception. In January 2006, the Ne w England Journal of Medicine published a review article which found estrogen -progestin drugs increased breast cancer risk (Yager 2006) . In October 2006 the Mayo Clinic Proceedings published a meta -analysis confirming estrogen -progestin drugs increase prem enopausal breast cancer (Kahlenborn 2006) . The studies that looked at recent use (within 1 -5 years) or current use of C OCs in premenopausal women showed the most dramatic increased risk for breast cancer. In a case control study, women ages 20 -49 years with use of C OCs within a year had an increased risk of breast cancer (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3 -1.9) (Beaber 2014). The same study showed an increase in risk depending on the formulation with triphasic C OCs carrying a markedly increased risk (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1. 4-4.7). In another large case control study of women ages 20- 45 years, use of C OCs for a year or more resulted in a 2.5 -fold increased risk of triple -negative breast cancer (95% CI 1.4 -4.3) but not for the receptor -positive breast cancers. In the same study, women 40 years or younger with a year or more use of C OCs had a higher relative risk of triple -negative breast cancer (RR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9- 9.3) (Dolle 2009). A cohort study of over 35,000 postmenopausal women found a significantly increased risk of bre ast cancer in women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if they had used C OCs in the past (RR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.92- 3.12) as compared with never users (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32- 2.12) (Lund 2007). There also appears to be an increased risk for African American women on COCs within the past five years for ER+ cancers (OR, 1.46, 95% CI, 1.18- 1.81), for ER - cancers (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22- 1.43) and 95% CI, 1.25- 2.53) with the risk of ER+ cancers continuing for 15 -19 years after stopping the COCs (Bethea 2015). In a French study (DeLort 2007) of 934 women who developed breast cancer, the use of C OCs increased the risk of early development of breast cancer (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38 -2.44). However, initiating C OCs afte r age 23 reduced the risk (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34- 0.79). Use of the levonorgestrel -releasing IUD, commonly used to treat abnormal bleeding in the perimenopause, increased the risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women (OR, 1.48, 95% CI, 1.10- 1.99) (Heikkinen 2016). The risk varies with the formulation as current use of a triphasic pill containing levonorgestrel carries an excess risk of causing breast cancer (RR, 3.05; 95% CI, 2.00- 4.66) (Hunter 2010). In a large prospective cohort study of 1. 8 million Danish women ages 15 to 49, enrolled and followed from 1995 to 2012 through various national registries, the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users increased depending on length of use from RR, 1.09 with less than one year of use (95% CI, 0.96 -1.23) to an RR, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.26- 1.51) for more than 10 years of use (M\u00f8rch 2017). They found the increased risk persisted after discontinuing use if C OCs were used for 5 years or more. These investigators also found an increased risk in curre nt or recent use of the progestogen -only intrauterine device (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11- 1.33). In most Western countries, 5% to 10% of all breast cancer cases are due to a main genetic cause : mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes constitute 90% of hereditary breast cancer cases (Mehrgou 2016) . These women are often begun on C OCs at an early age to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer. However, in a case control study of 2 ,492 matched pairs of women with the BRCA1 gene, COC use was associated with an increased risk of early onset breast cancer if begun under the age of 20 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 -1.75) (Kotsopoulos 2014) and the risk increased by 11% for each additional year of use. More recent publications include data from some very recent, large cohort studies (M\u00f8rch 2017, Heikkinen 2016, Poosari 2014) with RRs ranging from 1.2 to 1.37. Since breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women, affecting 1 in 8 women at some time during their lives, this translates into a substantial number of additional cancer cases. In addition, a large registry study of POCs (Soini 2014) also showed an increased RR for breast cancer of 1.19. Increased duration of use also increases the risk of breast cancer for C OCs as does use early in life (M\u00f8rch 2017). 19 Table 3 - Breast Cancer (Cohort Studies) Study Study Design OR1 Ever Use RR2 Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score M\u00f8rch et al. 2017 Cohort 1.23 (1.14-1.26) 1,797,932 *4 100% Heikkinen et al. 2016 Cohort 1.37 (1.12-1.68) 7,000 20,000 100% Lund et al. 2007 Cohort 1.33 (1.11-1.59) 11,777 23,676 et al. 2014 Cohort 1.32 (1.02-1.70) 654 16,928 et al. 2017 Cohort 1.808 (1.29 -2.55) 4816 83% Rosenberg Cohort 1.65 (1.19-2.30) 115,264 73% 1.4210 (1.05-1.94) odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) . 2 RR = relative risk (95 % confidence interval) . 3 Initiation before age 20, greater than 10 years of use and evaluation within 5 yrs . of stopping further increased the risk . 4 Entire population of Denmark was the cohort. 5 Concurrent randomized clinical trials and an observational study . 6 Hazard ratio shown.

Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care 2012; 17:402- 414. 30 Cervical Cancer According to the SEER statistics1, it is estimated that there are 257,52 4 women in the US with cervical cancer. There will be about 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer in 2018, with about 4,000 deaths. The five -year survival for cervical cancer is 66%. The IARC evaluation of an increased risk of cervical cancer with COCs is also supported especially by a large, high -quality cohort study (Roura 2016, Table 6). The data for cervical cancer presented in Table 4 shows in particu lar a higher risk for invasive cervical cancer, and a higher risk with current use. All studies appear to agree that there is an increased risk of cervical cancer in users of COCs (OR apparently about 1.05 per year of use ), and this risk increases with dur ation of use. Current use appears to confer a higher risk than past use, and the risk for invasive cancer shows the highest increase in risk (Roura 2016). A meta- analysis of case -control studies that focused on patients positive for human papilloma virus DNA (Moreno 2002) also showed an increase d risk, especially with protracted (5+ years) of use of COCs. One case -control study (McFarlane -Anderson 2008) and one meta -analysis (International Collaboration 2007) also showed an increased risk with progestogen- only contraceptives. Thus, there does appear to be an increased risk of cervical cancer in users of COCs or POCs, and the risk appears to increase with duration of use. 1 https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html 31 Table 6 - Cervical Cancer Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Roura et al. 2016 Cohort Study et al. 2014 Case Control Study 1.353 (0.99 -1.85) 219 2,300 87% McFarlane -Anderson et al. 240 102 83% 2.485 (1.30 -4.74) al. 2008 Case Control Study 1.49 (0.79 -2.64) 60 180 76% Wilson et al. 2013 Case Control Study 1.22 (0.96 -1.56) 724 3,479 76% Matos et al. 2005 Case Control Study 1.3 (0.8-3.1) 140 157 47% International Collaboration of use 5-9 years of use 1.2 (0.05)5 10+ years of use 1.56 (0.08)5 <5 years of use 1.07 (0.08) 9 7,227 255 ICC 5+ years of use 4.01 (2.01 -8.02) 1 Includes Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 3, carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer. 2 Analysis limited to invasive cervical cancer. 3 Study limited to HIV+ women. 4 Combined hormonal contraceptives. 5 Progesterone only contraceptives. 6 Meta-analysis of 24 studies (15 cohort and 9 case -control studies). 7 Relative risk per year of use for current users of combined hormonal contraceptives. 8 Floating standard error shown for users of combined hormonal contraceptives. 9 Progestin only contraceptives.

Each paper was rated based on the parameters noted in the STROBE statement (von Elm 2007). Overall, 17 primary studies and two meta -analyses were identified which evaluated the effect of COCs on the later development of Crohn's disease ( Table 7). Of the 17 primary studies, 4 showed a significantly increased risk for either ever use (Ng 2012, Sicilia 2001, Katschinski 1993) or current use (Katschinski 1993, Khalili 2013) or past use (Khalili 2013). None of the primary studies showed a significantly decreased risk. One meta - analysis (Godet 1995) gave a significantly increased RR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.12- 1.86) for ever use of COCs. A meta- analysis published in 2008 showed a significantly incre ased risk for current use (RR of 1.46 [1.26- 1.70]) compared with 1.04 (0.816- 1.340) for past use. Recent studies have produced similar findings as older studies, with the highest OR published in 2012 (9.04 [1.11 -73.6]). Overall these studies indicate that use of COCs conveys an increased risk of Crohn's disease, especially current use. 35 Table 7 - Individual Studies of the Effects of COCs on the Development of Crohn's Disease Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Khalili et al. 20131 Cohort (0.50 -2.17) 171 10,000 88% Logan Kay 1989 Cohort 1.7 (0.88-3.2) 42 45,958 1.8 (0.61-5.29) 51 19856 Case -control 1.7 (1.0-3.2) 57 2189 83% Sandler et al. 1992 Case -control 1.49 (0.99-2.26) 184 217 81% Persson et al. 1993 Case -control 1.7 (0.9-3.2) 152 305 81% Halfvarson et al. 20067 Case -control 1.5 (0.4-5.3) 102 102 75% Lowe 4 (1.1-14.2) 125 125 74% 1 Hazard ratios (RR adjusted for time). 2 OR increased with duration of use. 3 Authors ' calculation adjusted for smoking. 4 Adjusted RR for 1 -3 years prior to disease onset. 5 Adjusted RR for >3 years prior to disease onset. 6 RR is from multiple logistic regression analysis. 7 Monozygotic and dizygotic twins. 8 Adjusted incidence rate ratio. 9 Twins study. 36 Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Ng et al. 201210 Case -control 9.04 (1.11 2.8 (1.01-7.77) 103 103 71% Corrao et al. 1998 Case -control ever use 3.4 1.8 (0.4-7.3) 225 225 199311 Case -control 4.3 (1.3-14.4) Calkins -control 1.6 (0.59-4.37) 66 42% Vcev et al. 2015 Case -control 0.28 (0.03-2.46) 11 42 31% Cornish et 10 Multivariate analysis. 11 RR for use > 3 years. 12 Hospital controls. 13 Neighborhood controls. 14 High quality studies. 15 Adjusted for smoking. 37 Crohn's Disease References Boyko EJ, Theis MK, Vaughan TL, and Nicol- Blades B.

Each paper was rated based on the parameters noted in the STROBE statement (von Elm 2007). Overall 14 primary studies and one meta -analysis were identified which evaluated the effect of COCs on the later development of ulcerative colitis ( Table 8). None of the primary studies has shown a statistically significant decrease in risk, while two showed a significant increase in risk for the development of ulcerative colitis with ever use of COCs (Boyko 1994, Parrello 1997). One meta -analysis examined ever use and failed to show a significant difference (Godet et al . 1995), while another meta -analysis examined current use and found a significantly increased relative risk of 1.28 (1.06 -1.54). Overall these studies suggest that use of COCs conveys an increased risk o f ulcerative colitis, especially current use. 40 Table 8 - Individual Studies of the Effects of COCs on the Development of Ulcerative Colitis Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Khalili et al . 20131 Cohort 0.67 (0.32 -1.39) 222 10,000 88% Logan 1989 Cohort 1.3 (0.82-2.0) 78 45,922 54% Vessey Case 1.1 (0.65-1.85) 217 Case 0.57 (0.11-2.88) 35 38 42% 1 Hazard ratios (RR adjusted for time). 2 Authors ' calculation, adjusted for smoking. 3 Interaction with smoking notes, higher RR in smokers (2.49). 4 Monozygotic and dizygotic twins. 5 Twins studies. 6 Unclear how the calculation was done. 7 Hospital controls. 8 Neighborhood controls. 41 Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Vcev et al . 2015 Case -control 0.75 (0.30-1.88) 62 31% 82% 9 High quality studies. 10 Adjusted smoking. 42 Ulcerative Colitis References Boyko EJ, Theis MK, Vaughan TL, and Nicol- Blades B.

Each paper was rated based on the parameters noted in the STROBE statement (von Elm 2007). There have been seven studies published evaluating the effect of hormonal contraceptives on susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus ( Table 9). A significantly increase d risk for development of systemic lupus erythematosus with use of COCs was shown for ever use in two studies (Costenbader 2007, Sanchez -Guerrero 1997), for current use in one study (Bernier 2009) and for past use in one study (Costenbader 2007). None of the studies showed a decreased risk. Whil e no meta -analyses of these studies have been performed, the uniformity of the results implicate COCs as an important risk factor for the subsequent development of systemic lupus erythematosus. 45 Table 9 - Individual Studies of the Effects of COCs on the Development of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Costenbader et al. 20071 Cohort 1.5 (1.1-2.1) 1.7 (1.2-2.3) 96% Bernier al. 96% Sanchez 99 121,546 88% Sanchez -Guerrero et al. 19976 Cohort 1.9 (1.1-3.3) 58 121,587 88% Cooper et al. 2002 Case -control 1.5 (0.8-2.7) 1.3 (0.8-2.0) 240 321 92% Strom et al. 1994 Case -control 0.8 (0.5-1.4) 195 143 73% Zonana -Nacach et Case -control 2.1 (1.18 -3.6) 130 130 61% Grimes et al. 1985 Case -control 0.5 (0.11 -2.3) 109 109 58% 1 Pooled RR from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHS II. 2 RR from the NHS (data collection through 1976). 3 RR from NHS II (data collection through 1989). 4 RR for short term use (starting COCs within 3 months). 5 RR for long term use (starting COCs ov er 3 months previously with current use ongoing). 6 Using most stringent definition of systemic lupus erythematosus. 7 Paper written in Spanish.

The largest study of incident depression and use of anti -depressant medication (Skovlund 2016) indicates significantly increased risks for both COCs and POCs for both outcomes. The same group studied for suicide attempts and suicides (Skovlund 2018). Elevated risks were seen, and this was the case for both COCs and POCs. The recent NCHA study (Gregory 2018) showed a similar trend. One study (Keyes 2013) showed a lower risk of depression, but was not measuring clinically diagnosed depression, but rather the presence of depressive symptoms within 7 days prior to the survey. They also found a lower rate of suicide attempts among COC users. Similar findings were seen in 2 studies that also used a questionnaire looking at current COC or POC use (Toffol 2011, Toffol 2012). An analysis of the development of mood disorders found a higher incidenc e with POCs but a lower incidence with COCs (Svendal 2012). A study of post - partum depression as a reported adverse drug reaction showed higher rates for levonogestrel, etonogestrel and sertraline & drospirenone (Horibe 2018). A study of post -partum DMPA v ersus copper IUD use showed significant increases in depression scores and major depressive episodes with DMPA (Singata -Madliki, 2016). A retrospective cohort study showed increased risk for antidepressant use in patients who used ethinyl estradiol/etonoge strel (ring), and decreased risk of depression diagnosis with norethindrone -only pills or the levonorgestrel intrauterine system. A small retrospective chart review of the effect of immediate post -partum DMPA did not show significant effects on po st-partum depression (Tsai 2009). All the papers, which have broken out the age groups of users, show maximum increased risk for depression, suicide risk , and suicide within 3 months of beginning to use the drugs and tapering off after 6 months, partly due to atten uation of symptoms, partly due to discontinuation due to adverse effects. These risks need to be adequately conveyed in prescribing information and patient -related materials. However , little attention has been paid to the effects of blocking the important actions of estradiol and progesterone with progestins during the time of active brain remodeling. Estradiol and progesterone in normal sequence are essential for brain remodeling from ages 15 -19 years particularly for myelination, dendritic pruning and establishment of new synaptic connections (Del Rio 2018). Suppressing these with synthetic progestins can have far -reaching , untoward effects.

Each paper was rated based on the parameters no ted in the STROBE statement (von Elm 2007). A total of 6 studies (3 cohort studies and 3 case -control studies) were identified which evaluated the impact of COCs on the subsequent development of multiple sclerosis ( Table 11). Two studies showed a significantly increased risk for the development of multiple sclerosis with ever use of COCs (Hellwig 2016, Kotzamani 2012) with a similarly increase d risk noted in o ne study for current use or past use (Hellwig 2016). Overall these studies suggest that use of COCs may convey an increased risk for the subsequent development of multiple sclerosis. 53 Table 11 - Individual Studies of the Effects of COCs on the Development of Multiple Sclerosis Study Study Design OR Ever Use RR Ever Use OR Current Use RR Current Use OR Past Use RR Past Use Cases Controls Quality Score Hern\u00e1n et al. 2000124 Cohort 1.1 (0.9-1.5) 1 75% et Case 81% Alonso et 0.6 (0.4-1.0) 106 1001 77% 124 NHS I and II cohorts. 125 Funded by drug companies that make HCs. 126 OC use over the 3 years prior to the index date.

Another case -control study showed that use of COCs markedly increased the risk of the disease whether past (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.74- 12.1) or current use (OR 6.9, 95% CI 2.1- 22.1). Interstitial cystitis was associated with vulvodynia and sexual dysfunction in a high number of cases (Gardella 2011). Another study showed that use of COCs in patients with interstitial cystitis was associated with a decrease in quality of life (El Khoudary 2009). One meta -analysis (Champaneria 2015) showed that ever use of COCs significantly increased the risk of interstitial cystitis (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.03 -5.16). Overall, use of COCs appears to be associated with an increased risk for the developm ent of interstitial cystitis. Interstitial Cystitis PM.

However, the more relevant outcome is fracture risk. Therefore, articles were sought that looked at the effect of COCs and POCs on fracture risk. Data were initially derived from a systematic review of the evidence from observational studies of hormonal co ntraceptive use for contraception and the risk of fracture in women by Lopez (Lopez 2015). They noted that in 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) labeling about the potential loss of BMD (FD A 2004), which might limit long -term use. A systematic review of progestin -only methods found an association between DMPA use and loss of bone mineral density (Curtis 2006). Lopez identified 559 records, 524 of which did not meet their inclusion criteria. Thirty -five full- text reports remained , 11 of which were excluded. Of the remaining 24, 10 were secondary articles. That left 14 articles: the 14 studies examined oral contraceptives (N = 12), DMPA (N = 4) and the hormonal IUD (N = 1). Similar search terms to Lopez were used for papers published since 2015 and 2 additional papers were retrieved. The resulting studies are shown in Table 12. COCs: Three early stud ies (Cooper 1993 , Tuppurainen 1993, Vessey 1998) showed an increase risk of fracture with use of COCs. These studies predominately evaluated pre -menopausal fracture risk. Others that evaluated wrist fracture linked to falling had few cases but showed a trend to decreased risk (O'Neill 1996). One study that evaluated post -menopausal fracture risk based on prior oral contraceptive use (Barad 2005) also found an increased fracture risk. Another study looking at hip fracture risk in elderly women (Micha\u00eblsson 1999) showed a decreased risk but is compromised in that \"The exposure time for oral contraceptives may thus maximally have spanned 5 years...\" T wo studies by Vestergaard (Vestergaard 2006 and Vestergaard 2008) looked at any fracture with OC use and did not show a significant effect when multivariate analyses were performed. However, t hese studies only looked at use within the past 5 years and did not take into account remote use or cumulative lifetime use. A small cross -sectional study in southern Tasmania (Wei 2011) was stratified by duration of use and showed a reduction in vertebral deformities for 5 -10 years of use, but no effect for shorter or longer duration of use and no effect on number of vertebral deformities. A large case - control study which evaluated incident fracture risk with varying numbers of COC prescriptions showed an increased risk for 10+ prescriptions with current use (Meier 2010). A similar study failed to confirm this for most prescription numbers (Kyvernitakis 2016) but t his study had fewer subjects reducing its power. A case - control study (Memon 2011) nested in a n earlier cohort study (Cooper 1993) failed to show an effect. Overall the weight of evidence for use of COCs suggests an increased risk of bone fracture with protracted use. The study by Barad (2005) appears to have the largest number of subjects, was a cohort study, and was the only study that evaluated post -menopausal fracture risk with prior use of COCs . In contrast, virtually all the studies evaluating POCs show an elevated risk (Lanza 2013, Vestergaard 2008b, Meier 2010, Kyvernitakis 2016). This risk appears to increase with duration of use . 57 Table 12 - Individual Studies of the Effects of Contraceptives on the Development of Osteoporotic Fractures Study Study Design Intervention OR RR Cases Controls or Cohort Size Outcome Cooper 1993127 Cohort COCs 1.20 (1.08 -1.34) 4,674 80,947 2005137 80,947 First 1.41 (1.35 -1.47) 11,822 312,395 Incident fractures 127 From the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Oral Contraception St udy. 128 OC use > 97 months vs no use.

Progestin- only contraceptives are m ost commonly associated with weight gain complaints and discontinuation. A recent Cochrane review (Gallo et al. 2014) examined the effect of combined oral contraceptives on weight gain and concluded existing data does not support a causal relationship. A second review of p rogestin -only contraceptives on weight gain (Lopez et al. 2016) found most studies of low to m oderate quality but did conclude weight gain of up to 2kg (4.4 lbs) within the first year of use with continued increases thereafter. The authors advised appropriate counselling on expected weight changes to minimize discontinuation due to perceived weight gain. The attached table ( Table 13) summarizes studies of 1 year or longer that examined weight and body mass changes in contraceptive users in comparison to non -hormonal contraceptives or no method. Several additional studies compare various contraceptives for their effect on weight or body composition, but these do not directly address our focus. The strongest data appear to be the deleterious effects of l evonor gestrel -releasing IUD s on percent lean and fat body mass. Total body weight change does not appear different between groups and several large studies have shown no significant differences. However , a significant increase in % fat mass with a correspo nding decrease in % lean body mass was observed in both studies where these were measured. A similar effect was seen from oral desogestrel in a single study. Thus, while limited to date, data suggest that use of progestin -only contraceptives may have dele terious effects on % fat and % lean body mass with no significant overall effect on total body weight . A review of current Mirena labeling makes no mention of changes in lean or fat body mass composition. Retrospective, but not more recent , prospective stu dies also show DMPA use is associated with significant gains in weight. The data appear too mixed to draw firm conclusions. 64 Table 13 - Effect of Chemical Contraceptives on Weight Gain Study Design Comparison N Time Weight change (Kg) Fat mass change Lean mass change Comments Pantoja 2010 Retrospec.

The trials included 85 weight change comparisons for 52 distinct contrac eptive pairs (or placebos). The four trials with a placebo or no intervention group did not find ev idence supporting a causal association between combination oral contraceptives or a combination skin patch and weight change. Most comparisons of different combination contraceptives showed no substantial difference in weight. In addition, discontinuation of combination contraceptives because of weight change did not differ between groups where this was studied.

These include bacteriuria ( Zahran 1976; 3.49; also noted in Lee 2017 ), and Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) related desire and libido (Lee 2017) . This risk is increased if COCs are used in adolescents and the duration of OC use is at least 2 years (Lee 2017), although some newer COCs containing drospirenone 3 mg plus EE 30 mg and gestodene 75 mg plus EE 20 mg appear to have a reduction in these risks (Lee 2017). These urogenital risks, especially FSD where there is su bstantial literature, should be referenced in prescribing information and patient pamphlets.

It says: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. A study (Gomer 2009) conducted among 300 women concluded \"that most of them believe that certain risks are only associated with being over 35 years of age and/or smoking .\" Instead, the label should clearly state that anyone taking the medications without good knowledge of the risk factors could experience a potential ly life -threatening cardiovascular event and should discuss the risks with a medical provider. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for healthy women can significantly increase with the use of hormonal contraceptives, even women under 35 and not -smoking. In a 2012 article about birth control side effect s, Dr. Rebecca Peck (Peck R 2012) reports that \"Oral contraceptives are associated with a three to five times higher risk of VTE (Van Hylckama VA 2009) .\" Third and fourth generation combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) have been found to put women at an even much higher risk, leading to major lawsuits against some manufacturers and changes in regulations in several countries. In his opinion published in Drug Safety, Dr. L idegaard, the author of several studies on the subject, states: \"Of 14 studies specifically assessing the risk in users of CHC with desogestrel or gestodene, 13 found a higher risk with use of these products when compared to the use of CHC with levonorgest rel\" (Lidegaard 2014) . Drospirenone, the progestin contained in Yaz and Jasmine, also increases the risk of VTE over levonorgestrel by a factor of 1.5 to 2.8. \"The relative risk [of Drospirenone was 6.3 as compared with nonusers in both the large Dutch (Van Hylckama 2009 ) and Danish (Lidegaard 2011 ) study .\" The author comments that \"the studies demonstrating risk differences between CHC with different progestins are generally methodologically more transparent and more robust than those demonstrating no difference, especially concerning exclusion of women with predispositions for VTE.\" Another large study published in 2015 (Vinogradova 2015 ) reviewed 10,552 cases of VTE reported between 2001 and 2013 in the UK and found similar elevated risks of VTE with thes e CHC: \"Corresponding risks associated with current exposure to desogestrel 5.01), and cyproterone (4.27, 3.57 to 5.11) were significantly higher than those for second genera tion contraceptives levonorgestrel (2.38, 2.18 to 2.59).\" Note that the odd s ratios were \"adjusted for smoking status, alcohol consumption, ethnic group, body mass index, comorbidities, and other contraceptive drugs.\" Most importantly, the risk levels are multiplied if women have other risk factors. For instance, women who have the genetic blood condition known as Factor V Leiden could have a risk as high a s 18 per 10,000 woman - year s. If these women stay on the product for 10 years, their risks could be 250 per 10,000 woman -years, or 2.5% as risks increase with aging (Lidegaard 2014) . Dr. Lidegaard concludes: \"Therefore, women with known risk factors of VTE are advised to be reluctant to use CHC. The relative risk of VTE with different dispositions is as follows: previous thrombosis: > 50 (Le Moigne2013) , genetic abnormalities such as factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygous): 6, deficiency of protein C: 10, of protein S: 10, of antithrombin: 25, and of prothrombin 20210A: 3 (Phillippe 2014) . Pregnancy with delivery on average: 8, adiposity: 2 -3 and immobilization 2 -5 depending on how long time you are immobilized. Family disposition (first -degree relatives with VTE before their 50th year) doubles the risk of VTE. Women with such dispositions are generally recommended to use progestin- only contraception, which does not increase the risk of VTE except perhaps for medroxyprogesterone depots. A genetic screening should until further also be restricted to women with a family disposition\" (Lidegaard 2014). In a 2018 systematic review (Keenan 2018) of the most evidenced -based articles from the 1960s to 2018 comparing user s of COCs to nonusers, with a confirmed diagnosis of VTE, and including more than 17 million 69 woman -years of observation, women on HC increase their risk by 3 - to 9-fold. However, the first year of use has the highest risk for clot formation, and if a woman is younger than 30, her risk is increased 13-fold in the first year. Obesity can increase the risk of being on hormonal contraception, about doubling the risk compared to a woman of normal weight on the pill. It is not considered cost -effective to check f or thrombophilia, a genetic disposition to form blood clots, but for those with thrombophilia, the risk can be as high as 62-fold in the first year. This systematic review of the literature concludes that 136 -260 women die from VTE a year in the United States from hormonal contraception. Combined with the added risk of stroke and heart attack from the COCs, 300- 400 women die each year in the United States simply due to their choice of using HC for family planning (Keenan 2018) . To give some perspective, meningitis killed 45 people (of all ages) in 2017: most US States mandate meningitis vaccination for college and university students.

They found that combination oral contraceptives (COC) caused \"greater cell proliferation and incorporation...in both human ar terial smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts.\" Smooth muscle cell proliferation is an integral feature of all atherosclerotic lesions (Bagdade 1982). In 2007, a presentation at the American Heart Association meeting described a study of 1,301 Belgian women, which showed that women had a 20 to 30 percent increase of plaque for every decade on COCs (Zoler 2007) . They noted that active OC users had elevated C -reactive protein levels, three times higher than non -users. C - reactive protein is a biomarker for many inflammation -related arterial (and autoimmune) diseases , which was recently the subject of another presentation (Rietzschel 2018). They evaluated the carotid and femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and found the average PWV among non- users was 6.6 m/sec, while the average among current OC users was 6.75 m/sec. The blood pressure of current OC users was also significantly higher (4.3/2.3 mm Hg higher than non- users) ( Zoler 2007). Lead investigator Dr. Ernst Rietzschel said this study \"changes our thinking about oral contraceptives just causing an increased thrombotic risk. Instead, it appears as though OC use may also cause long -term structural damage to the vasculature.\" These findings were supported by an evaluation of large artery stiffness in the ENIGMA study (Hickson 2011) although other smaller studies have shown conflicting data (Yu 2014, Priest 2018). A study of homocysteine and nitric oxide lev els compared 50 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles as a control group and 50 healthy women receiving oral contraceptive pill s for at least three menstrual cycles (Fallah 2012). They noted that a fter 3 months of treatment, homocysteine levels were s ignificantly increased (P = 0.027), and there was a significant and considerable decrease (P = 0.048) in NO concentration of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) consumers. Another study evaluated the effect of COCs on homocysteine and C - reactive protein levels in women (Norouzi 2011). This observational cross -sectional analysis included 90 healthy, non -obese women (mean age 25 years). Forty -five healthy women on OCP and 45 healthy controls were studied. COC users had a minimum of 3 cycles on COCs. The res ults showed that the (5863.0\u00b11349.5 vs. levels were significantly higher in women receiving OCP in comparison with the control group (p=0.027 and p<0.001, respectively). Simila rly, a cross -sectional study, in 2011 -2012, evaluated 60 healthy premenopausal women (30 cases of COC consumers and 30 controls as nonconsumers), aged between 25 and 45 years who were current users for at least a 3 -year period. They evaluated brachial arte ry endothelial function (using flow common carotid artery intima -media thickness (Heidarzadeh 2014). They noted that there was a significant FMD% difference between 2 groups of cases and controls: 11 \u00b1 3.53 versus 15.80 \u00b1 9.22 (P = 0.01). In addition, a significant mean CCA -IMT thickness difference was detected: 0 .53 \u00b1 0.07 versus 0.44 \u00b1 0.08 (P = 0 .00). Although these results were not significant after multiple regression analysis, the authors noted that their results were in favor of early atherosclerotic changes in prolonged users of COCs. The Danish Heart Association released the results of a 15 -year historic cohort study looking at thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction, which observed over 1.6 million women. The resu lts demonstrated that women taking COCs with ethinyl estradiol at a dose of 20 \u00b5g had a risk of arterial thrombosis that was 0.9 to 1.7 times higher than non-users, while those taking a dose of 30 to 40 \u00b5g had a 1.3 to 2.3 higher risk (Lidegaard 2012). The risk of thrombotic stroke appeared to be independent of duration of use, while the risk for myocardial infarction increased with duration of use ( Table 15). 75 Together, these studies suggest that protracted use of COCs can induce atherosclerotic changes independent of any pro -thrombotic effect. These changes may contribute to the increase in thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction seen in COC users.

Internal Medicine News October 15, 2007; 32. 77 Conclusion Hormonal agents have a variety of effects on various organs and organ systems which may result in a deleterious impact on women's health. The data reviewed above reflect a vast body of information which has come to light since the introduction of these age nts as contraceptives over 50 years ago. While the information for patients and prescribers currently reflects many of the known side effects, others have come to light which are not adequately represented in the current prescribing information. These shou ld be added and made obvious to patients. In one instance, that of venous thromboembolism, while the warning information is present, it is phrased in a misleading manner which misleads the patients into drawing the incorrect conclusion regarding the risks. In addition, one agent (DMPA) appears to convey a specific risk for HIV transmission which is not shared by other agents . DMPA should be considered for revoking of marketing authorization and removed from the market. The risks of depression, mood disorders , and suicide have not been adequately emphasized. We further encourage the Agency to require the manufacturers of these agents to widely publicize these additional risks. Many millions of women are currently receiving COCs and POCs. Many millions more ha ve been exposed to these agents at some point in their lives. They should receive updated information regarding risks which have not been conveyed, or not adequately conveyed, in the past. All women who have been exposed to COCs or POCs should be informed so that they can take this information into account as they may encounter some of these adverse effects in some cases ma ny years after cessation of use. Environmental Impact Based on data from the Guttmacher Institute, a conservative estimate of 11 million women aged 15 -44 in the US take some form of hormonal contraceptive each day155. A 2015 study reports that about 21 percent of women of reproductive years are using some form of hormonal contraceptive , which equates to about 13 million women (Daniels 2015). This has resulted in a significant increase in the release of synthetic progestagens (such as levonorgestrel) and synthetic estrogens (such as ethinylestradiol [EE2]) into the aquatic environment via wastewater treatment plant discharges ( Besse 2009 , King 2016). EE2 is metabolized in the liver undergoing first pass metabolism, but ~6% of the administered dose appears as untransformed EE2 in the urine and ~ 9% in the feces (Stanczyk 2013). As noted by King (King 2016), e ven at low concentrations, thes e compounds can act as potent endocrine disruptors, affecting the growth, development, and reproduction of exposed aquatic organisms (Tyler 1998, Larsson 1999). EE2 is one of the most studied synthetic hormones in aquatic environments, for which assessment s of environmental concentrations and the quantification of endocrine - related effects have been documented in a range of aquatic species (Purdom 1994, Jobling 1998, Kirby 2004, Jobling 2006) . In fact, the numerous studies on the effects of EE2 on aquatic organisms have led to the derivation of a reliable predicted no -effect concentration of 0.1 ng/L for EE2 (Caldwell 2012) . In 1993, the first publication appeared which brought attention to th e issue of synthetic chemicals mimicking natural estrogen in the environment (Sharpe 1993). The study pointed to environmental pollutants, which were having a deleterious effect on male fetuses in utero - endocrine disruptors like polychlorinated biphenyls , detergents, dioxins, and hormonal contraceptives. In 1995 , another paper (Sumpter 1995) noted that male fish in 28 rivers across Britain were being \" feminized \" by pollutants. In 2002, a paper was published that focused specifically on the effects of endo crine -disrupting chemicals in the environment (Jobling 2002) . They demonstrated reduced fertility in fish populations in areas downstream of effluent from sewage plants 155 https://www.guttmacher.org/fact- sheet/contraceptive -use-united -states . 78 located along tributaries of the Thames River. In 2007, the results of a seven -year Canadian lake study were published which examine d the effects of EE2 (Kidd 2007) . The researchers releas ed a quantity of EE2 equivalent to what would come into the waterways via sewage from a city of 200,000 people. They witnessed an immediate feminization and transgendering of male fish, which resulted in the \"near extinction\" of the fathead minnow populati on (Kidd 2007). Although the minnow populations neared extinction, they rebounded as soon as the researchers stopped adding EE2 to the lake. A 2006 study from the United States Geological Survey on smallmouth bass in the Shenandoah and Monocacy Rivers found that more than 80 - percent of all the male bass living in these waterways were growing eggs in their testes156. A study was carried out of fish populations relative to the sewage treatment plants of three major Colorado cities: Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs (Woodling 2006) . At each municipality, they set up a location just upstream from where the effluent was released, and another just downstream. The fish in the upstream locations enjoyed a balanced 1:1 female -to-male sex ratio. Downstream t here were five female fish for every one male, and twenty percent of the reduced male population demonstrated intersex characteristics, such as eggs in their testes and the presence of vitellogenin, an egg yolk protein normally found only in fertile female s. The consequences also appeared to ascend up the food chain in a measurable way, specifically with the feminization of trout, mink frogs and green frogs (Parke 2009). Both the predicted and the measured concentrations of EE2 in the US, including effluent of waste water treatment plants, surface water, or ground water, exceeds the predicted no -effect concentrations on fish populations (Kostich 2013). Environmental factors have been implicated in declining fertility rates (Skakkebaek 2016). A 2017 study ou t of Hebrew University and Mount Sinai M edical School found that sperm counts in human men have dropped by more than 50 percent since 1973 (Levine 2017). While it has been noted that environmental exposure to individual steroidal estrogens, as well as their mixtures, are unlikely to dramatically affect endocrine signaling in humans, it is not clear whether more subtle effects are possible (Kostich 2013). More recently, environmental effects of levonorgestrel have been postulated (King 2016) but there is les s hard data. There is a clear effect of environmental EE2 on fish populations as well as species higher in the food chain such as frogs. An effect on humans is also possible.

Economic Impact For the diseases noted below, in some cases we have calculated the estimated economic impact taking into account those who are currently using COCs and those who have ever used COCs. According to the CDC157 15.9% of women aged 15- 44 in the US use \"the pill .\" There are 61 million US wome n of reproductive age (15 - 44)158. This yields 9,699,000 women in the USA currently on COCs. Note that this is a low estimate as it does not include women using intravaginal and transdermal formulations and is lower than the estimate by Daniels (Daniels 2015) . According to the National Survey of Family Growth159, 79.3% of women surveyed from 2011- 2015 have ever used \" the pill.\" This is down from 81.9% in the 2006- 2010 survey and 82.3% in the 2002 survey. The lower number for \" ever use\" of 79.3% is used in subsequent calculations. According to the 2010 census (Howden 2011), there were 156,964,212 women in the US , of whom 24% were under 18 years of age. Thus, there were 119,292,801 women 18 years of age or older. This implies that 119,292,801 x 0.793 = 94,599,191 women in the USA have ever used the pill. As noted above, this does not include women using intravaginal and transdermal formulations. The numbers 9,699,000 for current use and 94,599,191 for ever use of COCs were used in some of these calculations. In other cases, the census data for specific age groups was used if they were the groups most likely to be impacted by current or recent use of COCs. For progesterone -only contraceptives (POCs), the National Survey of Family Growth160, notes that 25.4% of women aged 15- 44 in 2011- 2015 have ever used \"3 -month injectable (Depo -Provera) .\" This is up from 23.2% in 2006- 2010 and 16.8% in 2002. For a conservative estimate, we will use the lowest of these numbers (16.8% or 20,041,191 women) who have ever used POCs. This would not include POCs administered by other routes and is thus a conservative estimate . HIV Costs According to the CDC161, an estimated 255,900 women were living with HIV at the end of 2014. Of these it is estimated 87% were via sexual contact (this proportion was relatively stable from 2011 -2016; CDC HIV Surveillance Table 1a). Annual medical cost estimates for HIV -infected persons, adjus ted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and transmission risk group, were from the HIV Research Network (range $1,854 - $4,545/month) and for HIV- uninfected persons were from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (range $73 - $628/month) (Schackman 2015). Using this information along with the prevalence of DMPA use of 16.8%, this suggests an annual cost of treatment for HIV infection due to DMPA use of ~$157 -573 million ( https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/women/index.html . 81 Table 16 - Estimated Economic Impact of DMPA due to Increased Prevalence of HIV Infection Women with HIV 255,900 Sexual transmission 87% Cases due to sexual transmission 222,633 Ever use of DMPA 16.80% Women with HIV with DMPA use 37,402 RR of HIV with DMPA use 1.4 Adjusted estimate 26,716 Excess cases 10,686 Highest estimated individual annual costs $53,664 Lowest estimated individual annual costs $14,712 Highest estimated total annual costs $573,474,111 Lowest estimated total annual costs $157,218,081 Breast Cancer A recent study in the US (Blumen 2016) notes , \"The average costs per patient allowed by the insurance company in the year after diagnosis were $60,637, $82,121, $129,387, and $134,682 for disease stage 0, I/II, III, and IV, respectively. The average costs allowed per patient in the 24 months after the index diagnosis were $71,909, $97,066, $159,442, and $182,655 for disease stage 0, I/II, III, and IV, respectively.\" For all patients, they note that the average cost for the first 12 months following diagnosis is $85,772, and for the second 12 months is $22,127 with a total of $103,735 for the 24 months following diagnosis. For these calculations we will use the first -year costs to estimate costs for incident cases among current users of COCs and will use the second -year cost to approximate the average annual cost of care for a patient diagnosed with breast cancer. According to the NIH SEER statistics162, the incidence of breast cancer is 126.0 per 100,000 person -years. Approximately 12.4 percent of women will be diagnosed with female breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. According to the best epidemiology studies noted in Table 3 (M\u00f8rch 2017; Heikkinen 2016, Lund 2007 ), and the best meta -analysis in Table 5 (Kahlenborn 2006) the relative risk of ever use of COCs for the development of breast cancer is 1.19 -1.37. Based on this information, the estimated increase in cost from use of COCs due to incident cases of breast cancer is between $ 199 million and $387 million ( Table 17).

According to the SEER statistics, there are currently 3,418,124 prevalent cases of breast cancer in the USA. The estimated increase in cost from treatment of the excess c ases of breast cancer is estimated to be ~$ 9.6 billion annually ( Table 18). Table 18 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Breast Cancer Prevalent cases of breast cancer Ever use of COCs Breast cancer ever users 3,418,124 79.3% 2,710,572 Adjusted estimate of cases if no use of COCs 2,277,792 1.19 RR Excess cases 432,780 Annual cost per patient of breast cancer $22,127 Estimated total costs $9,576,133,158 Cervical Cancer A recent study in Canada (Pendrith 2016) on the costs of invasive cervical cancer treatment noted : \"The mean overall medical care cost was $39,187 [standard error (se): $1,327] in the 1st year after diagnosis. ... At 5 years after diagnosis, the mean overall unadjusted cost was $63,131 (se: $3,131), and the cost adjusted for censoring was $68,745 (se: $2 ,963) .\" For these calculations we will assume a cost of $39,187 annually for incident cases and $13,749 (=$68,745/5) annually for prevalent cases of invasive cervical cancer. According to the NIH SEER statistics163, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer is 7.4 per 100,000 person -years. According to the American Cancer Society164, it is estimated that 13,170 women will be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer in the USA in 2019. In 2015, there were an estimated 257,524 women living with invasive cervical cancer in the United States. According to the best epidemiology studies noted in Table 6 (Roura 2016) the relative risk of ever use of COCs for the development of invasive cervical cancer is 1.6 and the RR for current use is 2.2. Based on this information, the estimated increase in cost from use of COCs due to incident cases of cervical cancer is ~ $33 million ( Table 19). Table 19 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Incidence of Cervical Cancer Women of reproductive age Number on the pill Incidence 61,000,000 9,699,000 0.000074 Estimated women on the pill at risk 718 Adjusted estimate of cases 1,579 2.2 RR Excess cases 861 Annual cost per patient of cervical cancer $39,187 Estimated annual costs $33,750,635 To evaluate the impact of \"ever use\" of COCs on prevalent cervical cancer, we noted that the best study (Roura 2016) showed a 1.6 relative risk of cervical cancer with COCs. According to the SEER statistics, there are currently 257,524 prevalent cases of c ervical cancer in the USA. The estimated increase in cost from treatment of the excess cases of cervical cancer is estimated to be ~$ 1 billion annually ( Table 20). 163 https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html . 164 https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervical -cancer/about/key -statistics.html . 83 Table 20 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Cervical Cancer Prevalent cases of breast cancer Ever use of COCs Cervical cancer ever users 3,418,124 79.3% 257,524 Adjusted estimate of cases if no use of COCs 204,217 1.6 RR Excess cases 76,581 Annual cost per patient of cervical cancer $13,749 Estimated total costs $1,052,914,912 Crohn's Disease A recent study in the US (Rao 2018) estimated the 5 -year cost of the treatment of Crohn's disease as $116,838 per patient (interquartile range of $45,643 -$240,398; annual cost $23,368). This was higher with worsening disease activity. According to the Cent ers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of Crohn's disease is 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 person -years165. According to the best epidemiology studies noted in Table 7 (Khalili 2013; Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez 2005), and the best meta -analysis (Cornish 2008) , the relative risk of current COC use is 1.46- 2.82 for the development of Crohn's disease. Based on this informat ion, the estimated increase in cost just from treatment of the excess cases of Crohn's disease, only looking at current use and not past use of COCs , is between $3 million and $60 million annually ( Table 21). Table 21 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Incidence of Crohn's Disease Women of reproductive age Number on the pill Low incidence High incidence 61,000,000 9,699,000 0.000031 0.000146 Estimated women on the pill at risk 301 1,416 Adjusted estimate 439 2,067 1.46 Low RR Adjusted estimate 848 3,993 2.82 High RR Excess cases 138 651 Low RR Excess cases 547 2,577 High RR Annual cost per patient of Crohn's disease $23,368 Estimated annual costs $3,231,920 $15,221,300 Low RR Estimated annual costs $12,787,162 $60,223,406 High RR To evaluate the impact of \"ever use\" of COCs, we noted that the best cohort study (Khalili 2013) and meta - analys is (Cornish 2008) showed a 1.43 and 1.44 relative risk of Crohn's disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the prevalence of Crohn's disease in adults is 201 cases per 100,000 person -year s166. Taking the lower number of 1.43, the estimated increase in cost from treatment of the excess cases of Crohn's disease due to COC use is approximately $1.9 billion annually ( Table 22). Table 22 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Crohn's Disease Women 18 in 2010 Census Ever use of COCs Prevalence 165 https://www.cdc.gov/ibd/IBD Estimated women on the pill at risk 190,144 Adjusted estimate 271,906 1.44 RR Excess cases 81,762 1.44 RR Annual cost per patient of Crohn's disease $23,368 Estimated total costs $1,910,583,605 1.44 RR Ulcerative Colitis A recent study in the US (Cohen 2015) noted that compared with controls, patients with UC had higher adjusted total direct ($15,548 vs $4812) and indirect costs ($4125 vs $1961) annually. This implies a total annual increase in cost of ~$12,900 for UC. This was hig her with worsening disease activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of UC is 2.2 to 14.3 cases per 100,000 person -years167. According to the best epidemiology studies noted in Table 8 (Khalili 2013; Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez 2005), and the best meta -analysis (Cornish 2008) the relative risk of current COC use 1.22 -1.58 for the development of UC. Based on this information, the estimated increase in cost just from treatment of the excess cases of UC, only looking at current use and not past use of COCs is between $605 ,000 and $10 million per year ( Table 23).

The estimated increase in cost of the excess cases of UC due to use of COCs is approximately $522 million annually ( Table 24).

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of SLE is 6.5 -10.6 cases per 100,000 women -years168. In terms o f prevalence, \"A conservative estimate suggests a prevalence of 161,000 with definite SLE and 322,000 with definite or probable SLE.\" According to the best epidemiology studies noted in Table 9 that evaluated current use of COCs (Be rnier 2009), the relative risk of current COC use is 1.45 - 2.52 for the development of SLE. Based on this information, the estimated increase in cost just from treatment of the excess cases of SLE, only looking at current use and not past use of COCs , is $6.1 million to $ 33.6 million annually ( Table 25).

The estimated increase in cost of the excess cases of SLE due to use of COCs is approximately $ 439 million -$1.55 billion annually ( Table 26). Table 26 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Women 18 in 2010 Census Ever use of COCs Prevalence 119,292,801 94,599,191 161,000 Estimated women on the pill at risk 127,673 Adjusted estimate 107,288 1.19 Low RR Adjusted estimate 55,510 2.3 High RR Excess cases 20,385 1.19 Low RR Excess cases 72,163 2.3 High RR Annual cost per patient of SLE $21,535 Estimated total costs $438,985,908 1.19 Low RR Estimated total costs $1,554,030,205 2.3 High RR Depression The most reliable study (Skovlund 2016) indicated a 1.1 RR for depression with COCs and a 1.2 RR with POCs. This study evaluated women aged 15 -34 and then followed them for a mean of 5 years. According to the information from Brody (Brody 2018) , the prevalence of depression in wo men aged 20 -39 is 10.1%. An analysis 168 https://www.cdc.gov/lupus/facts/detailed.html . 86 of medical claims conducted by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield (Blue Cross Blue Shield 2018) found that \"in 2016, Blue Cross plans spent $10,673 on those diagnosed with 'major depression' compared to $4,283 on those with out a depression diagnosis.\" With this information, and noting from the census data (Howden 2011) that there are ~52 million women aged 15 -39, we calculate that the excess annual cost of depression attributable to COCs is ~$2.4 billion ( Table 27) and from POCs is ~$937 million ( Table 28). Table 27 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Depression Table 28 - Estimated Economic Impact of POCs due to Increased Prevalence of Depression Multiple Sclerosis As the most rigorous cohort studies did not show an increase in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis a rigorous cost analysis was not performed. However, using the information from the best case -control study (Hellwig 2016), an increased odds ratio of 1.51 was noted. If this is assumed to be accurate, this can be used along with a study of total MS costs from 1997 -2013 (Chen 2017). They noted that, \"The total charges on managing MS range from $161 million in 1997 to $755 million in 2013. \" Conservatively assuming steady costs since 2013, we can calculate that 79.3% of those costs were incurred by women who were \"ever users\" of Women aged 15 -39 51,877,977 Percent with depression 10.1% Women aged 15 -39 5,239,675.68 Ever use COCs 79.30% 15-39 y.o.

This yields $598,715,000. If these women had not used COCs there would have been a proportionate reduction in costs of $202,215,000 ($598,715,000 -($598,715,000/1.51) ). Interstitial Cystitis According to (Tung 2017) on average, having interstitial cystitis was associated with $7,223 higher total health care costs annually than not having IC. The prevalence of interstitial cystitis has been estimated at 2.7% using a high specificity definition (McLennan 2014) while another study in a managed care population (Clemens 2005) indicated (depending on the definition) a prevalence between 45 and 197 per 100,000 women. Using the most conservative estimate (Champ aneria 2015) \"ever use\" of COCs is associated with an OR of 2.31 for interstitial cystitis . Assuming 61 million women of reproductive age, with a 79.3% of exposure to COCs, this suggests ~11,500 excess cases (using a prevalence of interstitial cystitis of 45/100,000) to ~50,500 (using a prevalence of interstitial cystitis of 197/100,000). This yields an annual cost of $83 -$365 million (Table 29) . Table 29 - Estimated Annual Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Prevalence of Interstitial Cystitis Low prevalence interstitial cystitis 0.00045 High cystitis 0.00197 Women of reproductive age 61,000,000 Number with ever use of the pill 48,373,000 # of Women with interstitial cystitis low prevalence 21,768 # of Women with interstitial cystitis high prevalence 95,295 OR 2.13 Excess cases of cystitis low prevalence 11,548 Excess cases of interstitial cystitis high prevalence 50,555 Annual cost $7,223 Annual cost of interstitial cystitis low prevalence $83,412,664 Annual cost of interstitial cystitis high prevalence $365,162,106 Osteoporotic Bone Fracture Risk According to a recent review (Ballane 2017), in North America the incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is 837 to 1 ,083 cases per 100,000 women per year (mean of 960 per 100,000 per year) as standardized to 2015. The annual excess cost of care for women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures was estimated to be $11,655 per year (Kilgore 2009). Using the most relevant relative risk of 1.07 (Barad 2005), this implies an annual cost of ~$308 million dollars in the US from COC use (Table 30). Table 30 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Annual Incidence of Vertebral Fractures Women 50 in 2010 Census Ever use of COCs Incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures 53,151,456 42,149,105 0.0096 Estimated women on the pill with Fx 404,631 Adjusted estimate 378,160 1.07 RR Excess cases 26,471 Annual cost per patient of osteoporotic vertebral fractures $11,655 88 Estimated total annual costs $308,521,992 The best cohort study on fracture risk with progesterone -only contraceptives (POCs) showed a RR of 1.51 for ever use of DMPA (Lanza 2013), the most widely used POC. Assuming 16.8% of women have used POCs this yields an annual cost of ~$290 million dollars in the US from POC use (Table 31). Table 31 - Estimated Economic Impact of POCs due to Increased Annual Incidence of Vertebral Fractures Women 50 in 2010 Census Ever use of POCs Incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures 53,151,456 8,929,445 0.0096 Estimated women on the pill with Fx 85,723 Adjusted estimate 60,796 1.41 RR Excess cases 24,926 Annual cost per patient of osteoporotic vertebral fractures $11,655 Estimated total annual costs $290,517,770 Body Mass The costs of the effects on body mass were not calculated, but these effects are contributory to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, which are discussed below. Urogenital Effects The medical and societal costs of the urogenital effects of hormonal contraceptives wer e not calculated as, although there are measurable costs, they are not felt to be significant. Venous Thromboembolism, Atherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Disease About 1 in every 4 female deaths is due to heart disease ; it is the leading cause of death for women in the U.S.169 A review of recent population studies revealed that the overall prevalence of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) for women is 15.6% (compared to 13.4% for men).170 In 2008, coronary heart disease was prevalent in 7.5 million women.171 The total mean direct medical costs for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is $18,953 annually (Nichols 2010) . Using the median relative risk of the most popular birth control brands, the RR is 1.8 (Table 32). 169 https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_women_heart.htm Table 32 - Estimated Economic Impact of COCs due to Increased Incidence of Cardiovascular Disease Coronary heart disease Ever use of COCs CHD in ever users 7,500,000 79.3% 5,947,500 Adjusted estimate of cases if no use of COCs 3,304,167 1.8 RR Excess cases 2,643,333 Annual cost per patient for CVD $18,953 Estimated total costs $50,099,090,349 A more conservative estimate would assume that the increased risk for cardiovascular disease is limited to women aged 15- 49 years, which was the group studied by Lidegaard (Lidegaard 2012). According to the US Census in 2010 , population is broken down by age group (Howden 2011). The rate of cardiovascular events is similarly broken down by Lidegaard (Lidegaard 2012). Thus, the number of cases by age group is shown in Table 33. Table 33 - Cardiovascular Events in Women by A ge Group Census data Events per 100,000 person -years (Lidegaard 2012 ) Events per year Age group Number of women Myocardial infarction Stroke Myocardial infarction # Stroke # 15 to 19 years 10,736,677 0.4 3.4 43 365 20 to 24 years 10,571,823 0.7 5.6 74 592 25 to 29 years 10,466,258 2.2 10.5 230 1,099 30 to 34 years 9,965,599 5 15.4 498 1,535 35 to 39 years 10,137,620 12.2 23.3 1,237 2,362 40 to 44 years 10,496,987 25.4 39.2 2,666 45 to 49 years 11,499,506 38.2 64.4 Total number of events per year 9,141 17,473 Using these estimates, with the annual cost of care for cardiovascular disease and the relative risk noted above, this calculates to ~$61 million in excess costs for myocardial infarctions and ~$117 million in excess costs for strokes (Table 34).
