Diagnostic tests might include the following: - Blood test; to look for elevated numbers of white blood cells that indicate that an infection is present [Chest x-ray](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/chest-x-ray); to reveal changes in the lungs when asthma is severe - Allergy test; a skin or blood test to indicate that your child is allergic to a specific allergen You should take your child to the doctor if they display symptoms like those mentioned above; constant coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, tightness in the chest and repeated episodes of chest infections.

How is asthma in children treated? There is no cure for childhood asthma and symptoms may continue into adulthood. However, with treatment, symptoms can be kept under control, preventing further damage to the lungs. Some children may only require short term treatment with short-acting bronchodilators for immediate relief of symptoms if their asthma is mild and intermittent. However long term medication will be needed for children with recurring bouts of asthma. Long term medication to control the asthma is administered in the form of [corticosteroid inhalers](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/steroid-inhalers/). The dosage may change over time, depending on the severity of your child's symptoms. Sometimes other treatments might accompany inhalers if they initially prove ineffective on the own, such as: - Leukotriene modifiers; taken in chewable form or as a powder - Long-acting beta agonists, which can be inhaled with the corticosteroid inhaler - Cromolyn; a drug that can be inhaled along with the corticosteroids to reduce inflammation - Oral corticosteroids; only taken when other medications have proved unsuccessful Monitoring and recording your child's asthma and symptoms and controlling asthma triggers, keeping the house dust free and clean and teaching your child what to do if they have an asthma attack are all very important to keeping asthma under control.27-10-2017 27-10-2017 Asthma in children [ Dr [ Paediatrics ](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/paediatrics/) Created on: 27-10-2017 What is asthma in children?
