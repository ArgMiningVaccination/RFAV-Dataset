Table of Contents Antimony \u2014 a Toxic Heavy Metal in PET Plastics That's Wise to Avoid According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry under the Center for Disease Control (CDC), [antimony is used in textiles and plastics](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=58) to prevent them from catching fire during processing and is problematic to health. It's also used in paints, ceramics, fireworks, enamels, lead storage batteries, solder, sheet & pipe metal, bearings, castings, and pewter. This silvery-white metal is found in the earth's crust and are mined with other metals to form antimony alloys or combined with oxygen to form antimony oxide. Lots of antimony is used in the manufacturing of plastic and polyester used for clothing, especially the most common type of plastic-polyethylene terephthalate (PET). More than 83 million metric tons of PET were produced in 2019, accounting for 19% of all plastics production worldwide. Toxic antimony isn't the only problematic chemical used in the processing of PET plastics, there are others: - Compounds of antimony and cobalt, which are known to cause cancer and organ toxicity, are also used as processing aids or additives in PET and often escape exposing humans when consuming beverages in plastic bottles. - When manufactured, toxic ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane are routinely emitted into the air and discharged as waste impacting local communities. - Ethylene glycol, a reproductive toxicant that can harm the intrauterine development of a baby, is also used in the production of PET. California considers antimony [a toxic substance](https://oehha.ca.gov/chemicals/antimony) and restricts it's levels in drinking water to between 1-6 parts per billion (ppb), whereas 1ppb is the health goal. So what about the health effects? Sometimes antimony is used as a medicine to treat people with [leishmaniasis](https://www.medicinenet.com/leishmaniasis/article.htm) (kala-azar), an infection caused by a protozoan parasite. When this happens, the side effects are stomach pain and ulcers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Ingesting large doses of antimony can also cause vomiting. Antimony is also known to trigger lichen planus \u2014 a recurring itchy inflammatory rash on the skin or in the mouth from contact with the heavy metal. Consumer Study Found Toxic Antimony in Beverages in PET Plastic Bottles Non-profit Defend Our Health was given a generous donation from Bloomberg Philanthropies to look into petrochemical plastics and their impact on public health. With that donation, they [commissioned a consumer study](https://defendourhealth.org/news/plastic-bottles-threaten-childrens-health-not-just-a-waste-problem/) to look at levels of antimony inside PET plastic beverage bottles sold to the public to showcase that plastic pollution is not just a waste problem, but also a public health problem. Beverages inside PET bottles were purchased and sent to an EPA-certified laboratory to test for antimony in both the plastic itself and the beverage. The investigation and report made the following claims: - In nearly half of the PET plastic-bottled beverages were tested (40%), the concentration of antimony in the drink itself exceeded 1 part per billion (ppb), the California Public Health Goal for drinking water. - Daily exposure to the amount of antimony found in 40% of the plastic bottles can cause liver damage. Excess exposure can increase risk of cancers, heart disease, and other organic toxicity. - 90% of the beverages tested exceed 0.25ppb, a more protective health limit recommended by Defend Our health. This level takes into account other areas where routine exposure happens on a daily basis. - PET releases more antimony when exposed to heat, light, soda, juice or extended storage time. - According to the lab, ranges of antimony found inside beverages were from 0.17 to 3.45 parts per billion (ppb), whereas levels of antimony inside plastic PET beverage bottles were from 216 - 321 parts per million (ppm). In other words, depending on how long those bottles were sitting on the shelves, levels of antimony exposure may vary based on migration points: heat, light, type of beverage, & storage time. - Safer alternatives to antimony are widely available, but evidently, are not being used by the most popular beverage companies. Exposure to Antimony Exceeds Safety Limits for Children In terms of children, antimony exposure may exceed what adults are exposed to based on their behaviors of putting their toys, clothing, and hands in their mouths. This means it's even more important to restrict the amount of antimony children are exposed to in everyday products. Where are children exposed to antimony? - Ingestion: PET plastic bottles, drinking water, food, polyester cuddly toys, & house dust - Dermal: Polyester fabrics (clothing), upholstered furniture, & crib mattresses - Inhalation: House dust, outdoor air According to California EPA, the safe exposure level for children needs to not exceed 140 ng/kg/day, which is the acceptable daily dose (ADD) of antimony for its Public Health Goal for antimony in drinking water. (The United States EPA has a reference dose of 430 ng/kg/day.) However, according to this study from Defend Our Health, antimony can exceed 140 ppm for children every day based on other exposures, which puts them at risk for health issues tied to overexposure. Mamavation Covers Raw Data From PET Plastic Beverage Study Mamavation has pulled the raw data from the consumer study from Defend Our Health to warn our audience about the dangers of drinking beverages in PET bottles. These products represent the following companies: The Coca-Cola Company, Pepsico, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Nestle, Ocean Spray, and Campbell Soup Company. Not all beverages available in the United States were tested in an EPA-certified lab, however, it's clear from what was tested that the most popular beverages inside PET plastic bottles may pose a risk to public health. Soda in Plastic PET Bottles - Coca Cola (in plastic bottle) \u2014 2.2 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) - Diet Coke (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.22 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) - Mountain Dew (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.38 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) - Diet Pepsi (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.1 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) - Pepsi (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.98 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Dr. Pepper (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.79 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Diet Dr. Pepper (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.79 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - 7up (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.82 parts per billion (ppb) antimony Tea in Plastic PET Bottles - Honest Tea with Lemon (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.07 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) - Snapple Peach Tea (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) antimony Juice in Plastic PET Bottles - Simply Lemonade (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.96 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Tropicana Orange (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.56 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Motts Apple Juice (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.98 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Ocean's Spray 100% Juice (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.46 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - V8 (in plastic bottle) \u2014 3.45 parts per billion (ppb) antimony Energy Drinks in Plastic PET Bottles - Powerade Fruit Punch (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.88 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Gatorade Blue Rasberry (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.78 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) Water in Plastic PET Bottles - Dasani (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.17 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Aquafina (in plastic bottle) \u2014 0.19 parts per billion (ppb) antimony - Perrier (in plastic bottle) \u2014 1.58 parts per billion (ppb) antimony* (above California's public health goal for water) What Does Mamavation Recommend? Mamavation recommends buying less beverages in plastic PET bottles to lessen your exposure to antimony. Here are some additional recommendations. - Make your own soda. Purchase one of the last remaining Soda Streams in glass, but I think it's been discontinued but is still available with additional sellers on Amazon: [Soda Stream Aqua Fizz Sparkling Water Machine with Glass Carafes](https://amzn.to/3zbXdM1) - Purchase more mineral water in glass instead of soda or water in plastic bottles. Recommended: [San Pelligrino mineral water in glass bottles](https://amzn.to/3Px3V4v)(this brand also has non-detectable PFAS according to other studies.) - Add fruit to your water to give it more flavor. Add strawberries, watermelon, cucumbers, lemon, or lime. - Purchase a good reusable water bottle certified by Made Safe: [Pura Insulated Stainless Steel 22 oz Reusable Water Bottle](https://amzn.to/3IGIjAF) - Why not try a beverage in a glass bottle instead.
