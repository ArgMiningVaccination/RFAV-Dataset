Prompt initiation of chest compressions and early defibrillation (when indicated) are the keys to success. Speed, efficiency, and proper application of CPR with the fewest possible interruptions determine successful outcome; the rare exception is profound hypothermia caused by cold water immersion, when successful resuscitation may be accomplished even after prolonged arrest (up to 60 minutes). Overview of CPR (See also the American Heart Association [AHA] [2020 guidelines](https://cpr.heart.org/en/resuscitation-science/cpr-and-ecc-guidelines) for CPR and emergency cardiovascular care and [2022 AHA Interim Guidance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35072519/) to Health Care Providers for Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support in Adults, Children, and Neonates With Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19.) Guidelines for health care professionals from the AHA are followed (see figure ). If a person has collapsed with possible cardiac arrest, a rescuer first establishes unresponsiveness and confirms absence of breathing or the presence of only gasping respirations. Then, the rescuer calls for help. Anyone answering is directed to activate the emergency response system (or appropriate in-hospital resuscitation personnel) and, if possible, obtain a defibrillator. Basic life support should be started immediately. If no one responds to the call for help, the rescuer first activates the emergency response system and then begins basic life support by giving 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120/minute and a depth of 5 to 6 cm, allowing the chest wall to return to full height between compressions, and then opening the airway (lifting the chin and tilting back the forehead) and giving 2 rescue breaths. The cycle of compressions and breaths is continued (see table ) without interruption; preferably each rescuer is relieved every 2 minutes. It is crucial that even untrained bystanders begin and maintain continuous chest compressions until skilled help arrives. Therefore, many emergency response providers now give pre-arrival instructions to callers, including phone instruction in compressions-only CPR. When a defibrillator (manual or automated) becomes available, a person in [ventricular fibrillation](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/specific-cardiac-arrhythmias/ventricular-fibrillation-vf) [ Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions.

If the cardiac arrest is witnessed and a defibrillator is on the scene, a person in VF or VT should be immediately defibrillated, with compressions immediately resumed after shock is delivered; early defibrillation may promptly convert VF or pulseless VT to a perfusing rhythm. If the initial rhythm is pulseless electrical activity or asystole, an initial dose of epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO (intravenous/intraosseous) should be administered as soon as possible after recognition of cardiac arrest. Adult comprehensive emergency cardiac care | | * If an adequate number of trained personnel are available, patient assessment, CPR, and activation of the emergency response system should occur simultaneously. Based on the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The techniques used in basic 1- and 2-rescuer CPR are listed in Table Airway and Breathing Opening the airway is the second priority (see [Clearing and Opening the Upper Airway](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-establishment-and-control#v927609) [ Clearing and Opening the Upper Airway Airway management consists of Clearing the upper airway Maintaining an open air passage with a mechanical device Sometimes assisting respirations (See also Overview of Respiratory Arrest.) read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-establishment-and-control#v927609) ) after beginning chest compressions. For witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, it is acceptable to provide passive oxygenation for the first 6 minutes, as part of an emergency medical services bundle of care aimed at minimizing pauses in the initial provision of CPR and defibrillation. For mechanical measures regarding resuscitation in children, see table . When health care professionals provide CPR, [bag-valve-mask ventilation](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-and-respiratory-devices#v28604882) [ Bag-Valve-Mask Devices If no spontaneous respiration occurs after airway opening and no respiratory devices are available, rescue breathing (mouth-to-mask or mouth-to-barrier device) is started; mouth-to-mouth ventilation... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-and-respiratory-devices#v28604882) should be started as early as possible, but bag-valve-mask ventilation should not delay initiation of compressions or defibrillation. Lay rescuers may provide compressions-only CPR or, if trained to do so, may give rescue breaths delivered mouth-to-mouth (for adults, adolescents, and children) or combined mouth-to-mouth-and-nose (for infants). If available, an [oropharyngeal airway](/professional/critical-care-medicine/how-to-do-basic-airway-procedures/how-to-insert-an-oropharyngeal-airway) [ How To Insert an Oropharyngeal Airway Oropharyngeal airways are rigid intraoral devices that conform to the tongue and displace it away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, thereby restoring pharyngeal airway patency. (See also Airway... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/how-to-do-basic-airway-procedures/how-to-insert-an-oropharyngeal-airway) may be inserted to maintain airway patency during bag-mask ventilation. Cricoid pressure is not recommended. If abdominal distention develops, the airway is rechecked for patency, and the amount of air delivered during rescue breathing is reduced. Nasogastric intubation to relieve gastric distention is delayed until suction equipment is available because regurgitation with aspiration of gastric contents may occur during insertion. If marked gastric distention interferes with ventilation prior to availability of suction and cannot be corrected by the above methods, patients are positioned on their side, the epigastrium is compressed, and the airway is cleared. When qualified rescuers are present, an advanced airway (endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway) is placed without interruption of chest compressions after initial CPR and defibrillation attempts, as described under [Airway Establishment and Control](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-establishment-and-control) [ Airway Establishment and Control Airway management consists of Clearing the upper airway Maintaining an open air passage with a mechanical device Sometimes assisting respirations (See also Overview of Respiratory Arrest.) read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-establishment-and-control) . A breath is given every 6 seconds (10 breaths/minute) without interrupting chest compression in adults; infants and children are given breaths every 2 to 3 seconds (20 to 30 breaths/minute). However, chest compression and defibrillation take precedence over endotracheal intubation. Unless highly experienced rescuers are available, endotracheal intubation may be delayed in favor of ventilation with a [bag-valve-mask](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-and-respiratory-devices#v28604882) [ Bag-Valve-Mask Devices If no spontaneous respiration occurs after airway opening and no respiratory devices are available, rescue breathing (mouth-to-mask or mouth-to-barrier device) is started; mouth-to-mouth , [laryngeal mask airway](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-and-respiratory-devices#v28604914) [ Laryngeal Mask Airways (LMA) If no spontaneous respiration occurs after airway opening and no respiratory devices are available, rescue breathing (mouth-to-mask or mouth-to-barrier device) is started; mouth-to-mouth ventilation... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/airway-and-respiratory-devices#v28604914) , or similar device.

Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes 14(7):e007666, 2021. doi:10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.007666 Circulation Chest compressions Chest compression should be started immediately on recognition of cardiac arrest and done with minimal interruption until defibrillation is available. In an unresponsive patient whose collapse was unwitnessed, the trained rescuer should immediately begin external (closed chest) cardiac compressions, followed by rescue breathing. Chest compressions must not be interrupted for > 10 seconds at any time (eg, for intubation, defibrillation, rhythm analysis, central IV catheter placement, or transport). A compression cycle should consist of 50% compression and 50% release; during the release phase, it is important to allow the chest to recoil fully. Rhythm interpretation and defibrillation (if appropriate) are done as soon as a defibrillator is available. The recommended chest compression depth for adults is about 5 to 6 cm. Ideally, external cardiac compression produces a palpable pulse with each compression, although cardiac output is only 20 to 30% of normal. However, palpation of pulses during chest compression is difficult, even for experienced clinicians and is often unreliable. Quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring may provide a better estimate of cardiac output during chest compressions; patients with inadequate perfusion have little venous return to the lungs and hence a low end-tidal carbon dioxide level (as do those with hyperventilation). While there is limited evidence supporting specific numbers in physiologic monitoring, it is generally accepted that an end-tidal carbon dioxide level of 10 to 20 mm Hg is associated with adequate CPR. A sudden significant rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide level, usually to a value > 30 mm Hg or a palpable pulse during pause in compressions, indicates restoration of spontaneous circulation. Mechanical chest compression devices are available; these devices are as effective as properly executed manual compressions and can minimize effects of performance error and fatigue. They may be particularly helpful in some circumstances, such as during patient transport or in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. These devices have also been recommended for use in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 ( [1](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851922) [ Circulation reference Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851922) ).

Serious myocardial injury caused by compression is highly unlikely, with the possible exception of injury to a preexisting ventricular aneurysm. Concern for these injuries should not deter the rescuer from doing CPR. Laceration of the liver is a rare but potentially serious (sometimes fatal) complication and is usually caused by compressing the abdomen below the sternum. Rupture of the stomach (particularly if the stomach is distended with air) is also a rare complication. Delayed rupture of the spleen is very rare. Circulation reference 1.

Prompt defibrillation is the only intervention for cardiac arrest, other than high-quality CPR, that has been shown to improve survival; however, the success of defibrillation is time dependent, with about a 10% decline in success after each minute of VF (or pulseless VT). Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) allow minimally trained rescuers to treat VT or VF. Their use by first responders (police and fire services) and their prominent availability in public locations have increased the likelihood of resuscitation. Defibrillating paddles or pads are placed with one on the anterior right chest wall below the clavicle at the mid-clavicular line and the other over the left 5th or 6th intercostal space at the apex of the heart in the anterior-axillary line. Alternatively, the 2 pads may be placed with one pad over the anterior left hemithorax and the other pad on the posterior left hemithorax. Conventional defibrillator paddles are rarely present on modern defibrillators. When present, paddles are used with conducting paste; pads have conductive gel incorporated into them. One initial shock is advised as soon as a shockable rhythm is detected, after which chest compressions are immediately resumed. Energy level for biphasic defibrillators is between 150 and 200 joules (2 joules/kg in children) for the initial shock; monophasic defibrillators are set at 360 joules for the initial shock. Postshock rhythm is not checked until after 2 minutes of chest compressions. Subsequent shocks are delivered at the same or higher energy level (maximum 360 joules in adults, or 10 joules/kg in children). Patients remaining in VF or VT receive additional shocks every 2 minutes, along with continued chest compression and ventilation and optional [drug therapy](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v925884) [ Drugs for ACLS Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v925884) . Monitor and IV Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is established to identify the underlying cardiac rhythm. An IV line may be started; 2 lines minimize the risk of losing IV access during CPR. Large-bore peripheral lines in the antecubital veins are preferred. In adults and children, if a peripheral line cannot be established quickly, a subclavian or femoral central line (see [Procedure](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925092) [ Central Venous Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.

If blind percutaneous placement... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925092) ) can be placed provided it can be done without stopping chest compression (often difficult). Intraosseous lines (see [Intraosseous Infusion](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925226) [ Intraosseous Infusion A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.

If blind percutaneous placement... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925226) ) are alternatives, especially in children, as they can be placed quickly to avoid delay in administration of the first dose of epinephrine. Femoral vein catheters (see [Procedure](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925092) [ Central Venous Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.

If blind percutaneous placement... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/approach-to-the-critically-ill-patient/vascular-access#v925092) ) are an option because CPR does not need to be stopped and they have less potential for lethal complications; however, they may have a lower rate of successful placement because no discrete femoral arterial pulsations are available to guide insertion. The type and volume of fluids or drugs given depend on the clinical circumstances. Usually, IV 0.9% saline is given slowly (sufficient only to keep an IV line open); vigorous volume replacement (crystalloid and colloid solutions, blood) is required only when arrest results from hypovolemia (see [Intravenous Fluid Resuscitation](/professional/critical-care-medicine/shock-and-fluid-resuscitation/intravenous-fluid-resuscitation) [ Intravenous Fluid Resuscitation Almost all circulatory shock states require large-volume IV fluid replacement, as does severe intravascular volume depletion (eg, due to diarrhea or heatstroke).

Special Circumstances In accidental [electrical shock](/professional/injuries-poisoning/electrical-and-lightning-injuries/electrical-injuries) [ Electrical Injuries Electrical injury is damage caused by generated electrical current passing through the body.

In [drowning](/professional/injuries-poisoning/drowning/drowning) [ Drowning Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal.

If cardiac arrest follows traumatic injury, airway-opening maneuvers and a brief period of external ventilation after clearing the airway have the highest priority because airway obstruction is the most likely treatable cause of arrest. If cervical spine injury is suspected, jaw thrust, but not head tilt and chin lift, is advised. Other survivable causes of traumatic cardiac arrest include [cardiac tamponade](/professional/injuries-poisoning/thoracic-trauma/cardiac-tamponade) [ Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling.

However, most patients with traumatic cardiac arrest have severe hypovolemia due to blood loss (for which chest compression may be ineffective) or nonsurvivable brain injuries. Drugs for ACLS Despite widespread and long-standing use, no drug or drug combination has been definitively shown to increase neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge in patients with cardiac arrest. Some drugs do seem to improve the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and thus may reasonably be given (for dosing, including pediatric, see table [Drugs for Resuscitation](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v55247709) [ Drugs for Resuscitation* ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v55247709) ). Drug therapy for shock and cardiac arrest continues to be researched. In a patient with a peripheral IV line, drug administration is followed by a fluid bolus (\"wide open\" IV in adults; 3 to 5 mL in young children) to flush the drug into the central circulation. In a patient without IV or intraosseous (IO) access, naloxone, atropine, and epinephrine, when indicated, may be given via the endotracheal tube at 2 to 2.5 times the IV dose. During administration of a drug via endotracheal tube, compression should be briefly stopped. First-line drugs The main first-line drug used in cardiac arrest is Epinephrine Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO should be given as soon as possible to patients with a nonshockable initial rhythm and may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. It should be given early in nonshockable rhythms, because recent evidence suggests survival is increased when it is given in the first 5 minutes of resuscitation, or for [ventricular tachycardia](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/specific-cardiac-arrhythmias/ventricular-tachycardia-vt) [ Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia is 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate 120 beats/minute.

It has combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic effects. The alpha-adrenergic effects may augment coronary diastolic pressure, thereby increasing subendocardial perfusion during chest compressions. Epinephrine also increases the likelihood of successful defibrillation. However, beta-adrenergic effects may be detrimental because they increase oxygen requirements (especially of the heart) and cause vasodilation. Intracardiac injection of epinephrine is not recommended because, in addition to interrupting precordial compression, pneumothorax, coronary artery laceration, and cardiac tamponade may occur. Amiodarone 300 mg can be given once if a third attempt at defibrillation is unsuccessful after epinephrine, followed by 1 dose of 150 mg. It is also of potential value if VT or VF recurs after successful defibrillation; a lower dose is given over 10 minutes followed by a continuous infusion. There is no persuasive proof that it increases survival to hospital discharge. Lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic to amiodarone, with an initial dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg, followed by a second dose of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg. Vasopressin is no more effective than epinephrine and is therefore no longer recommended as a first-line drug in the American Heart Association's guidelines ( [1](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851930) [ Drugs for ACLS references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851930) ). However, in the unlikely case of a lack of epinephrine during CPR, vasopressin may be substituted. Other drugs A range of additional drugs may be useful in specific settings. Atropine sulfate is a vagolytic drug that increases heart rate and conduction through the atrioventricular node. It is given for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias and high-degree atrioventricular nodal block. It is no longer recommended for asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Calcium chloride is recommended for patients with [hyperkalemia](/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hyperkalemia) [ Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L (> 5.5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells.

In other patients, because intracellular calcium is already higher than normal, additional calcium is likely to be detrimental. Because cardiac arrest in patients on renal dialysis is often a result of or accompanied by hyperkalemia, these patients may benefit from a trial of calcium if bedside potassium determination is unavailable. Caution is necessary because calcium exacerbates digitalis toxicity and can cause cardiac arrest. Lidocaine is recommended as an alternative to amiodarone for VF or VT that is unresponsive to defibrillation and initial vasopressor therapy with epinephrine. It may also be considered after return of spontaneous circulation after arrest due to VF or VT (in adults) to prevent recurrent VF or VT. Magnesium sulfate has not been shown to improve outcome in randomized clinical studies. However, it may be helpful in patients with [torsades de pointes](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/specific-cardiac-arrhythmias/torsades-de-pointes-ventricular-tachycardia) [ Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia is a specific form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with a long QT interval. It is characterized by rapid, irregular QRS complexes... read more ](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/specific-cardiac-arrhythmias/torsades-de-pointes-ventricular-tachycardia) or known or suspected magnesium deficiency (ie, patients with alcohol use disorder or protracted diarrhea). Procainamide is a second-line drug for treatment of refractory VF or VT. However, procainamide is not recommended for pulseless arrest in children and is no longer recommended by American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of post-arrest ventricular arrhythmias. However, the European Resuscitation Council includes it as an option to treat hemodynamically stable patients with wide complex QRS tachycardia per the 2021 guidelines, as some studies have shown an association with fewer major adverse events as compared with amiodarone ( [2](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851930) [ Drugs for ACLS references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851930) ). Phenytoin may rarely be used to treat VT, but only when VT is due to digitalis toxicity and is refractory to other drugs. A dose of 50 to 100 mg/minute every 5 minutes is given until rhythm improves or the total dose reaches 20 mg/kg. Sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended unless cardiac arrest is caused by hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered when cardiac arrest is prolonged (> 10 minutes); it is given only if there is good ventilation. When sodium bicarbonate is used, serum bicarbonate concentration or base deficit should be monitored before infusion and after each 50-mEq dose (1 to 2 mEq/kg in children).

Despite some laboratory evidence to the contrary, it is not recommended to delay defibrillation to administer a period of chest compressions. Chest compression should be interrupted as little as possible and for no more than 10 seconds at a time for defibrillation. Recommended energy levels for defibrillation vary: 120 to for biphasic defibrillators 360 joules for monophasic defibrillators If this treatment is unsuccessful after 2 attempts, epinephrine 1 mg IV is administered and repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Defibrillation at the same energy level or higher is attempted 1 to 2 minutes after each drug administration. If VF persists, amiodarone 300 mg IV is given. Then, if VF/VT recurs, 150 mg is given followed by infusion of 1 mg/minute for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/minute. Current versions of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) provide a pediatric cable that effectively reduces the energy delivered to children. (For pediatric energy levels, see [Defibrillation](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-infants-and-children#v8346789) [ Defibrillation Despite the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are about 90% for infants and children.

Asystole can be mimicked by a loose or disconnected monitor lead; thus, monitor connections should be checked and the rhythm viewed in an alternative lead. If asystole is confirmed, the patient is given epinephrine 1 mg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Defibrillation of apparent asystole (because it \"might be fine VF\") is discouraged because electrical shocks may injure the nonperfused heart. Pulseless electrical activity is circulatory collapse that occurs despite satisfactory electrical complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients with pulseless electrical activity receive epinephrine 1.0 mg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes, followed by 500- to 1000-mL (20 mL/kg for children) infusion of 0.9% saline if hypovolemia is suspected. Cardiac tamponade can cause pulseless electrical activity, but this disorder usually occurs in patients after thoracotomy and in patients with known pericardial effusion or major chest trauma. In such settings, immediate pericardiocentesis or thoracotomy is done (see figure [Pericardiocentesis](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/myocarditis-and-pericarditis/pericarditis#v939971) [ Treatment Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial space. Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders (eg, infection, myocardial infarction, trauma... read more ](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/myocarditis-and-pericarditis/pericarditis#v939971) ). Tamponade is rarely an occult cause of cardiac arrest but, if suspected, can be confirmed by ultrasonography or, if ultrasonography is unavailable, pericardiocentesis. Termination of Resuscitation CPR should be continued until the cardiopulmonary system is stabilized, the patient is pronounced dead, or a lone rescuer is physically unable to continue. If cardiac arrest is thought to be due to hypothermia, CPR should be continued until the body is rewarmed to 34\u00b0 C. The decision to terminate resuscitation is a clinical one, and clinicians take into account duration of arrest, age of the patient, and prognosis of underlying medical conditions. The decision is typically made when spontaneous circulation has not been established after CPR and advanced cardiovascular life support measures have been done. In intubated patients, an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level of < 10 mm Hg after 20 minutes of CPR is a poor prognostic sign. Studies of outcomes from cardiac arrest have found that neurologically favorable survival is < 1% in patients > 81 years old (possibly 73 years old\u2014 [1](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851951) [ Termination of resuscitation references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851951) , [2](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851951) [ Termination of resuscitation references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v79851951) ) with unwitnessed cardiac arrest and initial non-shockable rhythm.

The ultimate goal is survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function, which is achieved by only a minority of patients with ROSC. To maximize the likelihood of a good outcome, clinicians must provide good supportive care (eg, manage blood pressure, temperature, and cardiac rhythm) and treat underlying conditions, particularly [acute coronary syndromes](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/coronary-artery-disease/overview-of-acute-coronary-syndromes-acs) [ Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. Consequences depend on degree and location of obstruction and range from unstable angina to non-ST-segment elevation... read more ](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/coronary-artery-disease/overview-of-acute-coronary-syndromes-acs) . Postresuscitative care includes mitigation of reperfusion injury occurring after the period of ischemia. Postresuscitative care should begin immediately after spontaneous circulation is determined. Oxygen administration should be titrated down to an SpO2 of 94% to minimize hyperoxic damage to lungs. Ventilation rate and volume should be titrated to an end-tidal carbon dioxide reading of 35 to 40 mm Hg. A fluid bolus should be administered if tolerated, as well as vasopressor infusion. Postresuscitation laboratory studies include arterial blood gases (ABG), complete blood count (CBC), and blood chemistries, including electrolytes, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, and cardiac markers. (Creatine kinase is usually elevated because of skeletal muscle damage caused by CPR; troponins, which are unlikely to be affected by CPR or defibrillation, are preferred.) Arterial PaO2 should be kept near normal values (80 to 100 mm Hg). Hematocrit should be maintained at 30% (if cardiac etiology is suspected), and glucose at 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.7 to 9.9 mmol/L); electrolytes, especially potassium, should be within the normal range. Coronary angiography The decision to do [cardiac catheterization](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/cardiovascular-tests-and-procedures/cardiac-catheterization) [ Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins. Cardiac catheterization... read more ](/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/cardiovascular-tests-and-procedures/cardiac-catheterization) after resuscitation from cardiac arrest should be individualized based on the electrocardiogram (ECG), the interventional cardiologist's clinical impression, and the patient's prognosis. Current guidelines suggest doing emergency angiography (within 2 to 6 hours) for adult patients in whom a cardiac cause is suspected and who have ST-segment elevation (STEMI) on ECG. It is unclear whether emergency (within 2 hours) or more delayed (median about 120 hours after arrest) cardiac catheterization in patients without STEMI on ECG results in any clinical benefit ( [1](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) [ Postresuscitative care references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) ). Some researchers advocate liberal use of cardiac catheterization after ROSC, doing the procedure on most patients unless the etiology is clearly unlikely to be cardiac (eg, drowning) or there are contraindications (eg, intracranial bleeding). Neurologic support Only about 10% of all cardiac arrest survivors have good central nervous system function (cerebral performance category [CPC] score 1 or 2\u2014see table ) at hospital discharge. A CPC score of 1 is indicative of good cerebral performance (patient is conscious, alert, able to work but may have mild neurologic or psychologic deficit). A CPC score of 2 is indicative of moderate cerebral performance (patient is conscious, able to do activities of daily living [ADLs] and work in a simple environment). Hypoxic brain injury is a result of ischemic damage and cerebral edema (see [pathophysiology of cardiac arrest](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiac-arrest#v925644) [ Pathophysiology Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow. Cardiac arrest stops blood from flowing to vital organs, depriving them of... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiac-arrest#v925644) ). Both damage and recovery may evolve over 48 to 72 hours after resuscitation. Maintenance of oxygenation and cerebral perfusion pressure (avoiding hyperventilation, hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypotension) may reduce cerebral complications. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may damage the post-ischemic brain and should be treated. In adults, targeted temperature management is recommended for patients who remain unresponsive after spontaneous circulation has returned ( [2, 3](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) [ Postresuscitative care references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) ). Current recommendations are to target normothermia (< 37.5\u00ba C), although many researchers and clinicians continue to advocate for hypothermia (body temperature of 32 to 36\u00b0 C). Regardless of the chosen target temperature, active temperature management is begun as soon as spontaneous circulation has returned. Techniques to induce and maintain hypothermia can be either external or invasive. External cooling methods are easy to apply and range from the use of external ice packs to several commercially available external cooling devices that circulate high volumes of chilled water over the skin. For internal cooling, chilled IV fluids (4\u00b0 C) can be rapidly infused to lower body temperature, but this method may be problematic in patients who cannot tolerate much additional fluid volume. Also available are external heat-exchange devices that circulate chilled saline to an indwelling IV heat-exchange catheter using a closed-loop design in which chilled saline circulates through the catheter and back to the device, rather than into the patient. Another invasive method for cooling uses an extracorporeal device that circulates and cools blood externally then returns it to the central circulation. Regardless of the method chosen, the goal is to cool the patient rapidly and to maintain the core temperature at target (< 37.5\u00ba C for normothermia or between 32\u00b0 C and 36\u00b0 C for hypothermia) for 24 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation. Currently, there is no evidence that any specific temperature within this range is superior, but it is imperative to avoid hyperthermia ( [4, 5](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) [ Postresuscitative care references Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v45391656) ). Numerous pharmacologic treatments, including free radical scavengers, antioxidants, glutamate inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, are of theoretic benefit. Many have been successful in animal models, but none have proved effective in human trials. Blood pressure support Current recommendations are to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 65 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg. In patients known to be hypertensive, a reasonable target is systolic blood pressure 30 mm Hg below prearrest level. MAP is best measured with an intra-arterial catheter. Use of a flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter for hemodynamic monitoring has been largely discarded. Blood pressure support includes IV crystalloid infusion (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) Inotropic or vasopressor drugs with a goal of maintaining systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg and MAP of at least 65 mm Hg Rarely intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation Patients with low MAP and low central venous pressure should have IV fluid challenge with 0.9% saline infused in 250-mL increments. Although use of inotropic and vasopressor drugs has not proved to enhance long-term survival, older adults with moderately low MAP (70 to 80 mm Hg) and normal or high central venous pressure or widened IVC as assessed by bedside ultrasonography may receive an infusion of an inotrope (eg, dobutamine started at 2 to 5 mcg/kg/minute). Amrinone or milrinone are alternatives that are rarely used (see table ). If this therapy is ineffective, the inotrope and vasoconstrictor dopamine may be considered. Alternatives are epinephrine and the peripheral vasoconstrictors norepinephrine and phenylephrine (see table ). However, vasoactive drugs should be used at the minimal dose necessary to achieve low-normal MAP because they may increase vascular resistance and decrease organ perfusion, especially in the mesenteric bed. They also increase the workload of the heart at a time when its capability is decreased because of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. If MAP remains < 70 mm Hg in patients who may have sustained a myocardial infarction (MI), intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered. Patients with normal MAP and high central venous pressure or widened IVC may improve with either inotropic therapy or afterload reduction with nitroprusside or nitroglycerin. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation can assist low-output circulatory states due to left ventricular pump failure that is refractory to drugs. A balloon catheter is introduced via the femoral artery, percutaneously or by arteriotomy, retrograde into the thoracic aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. The balloon inflates during each diastole, augmenting coronary artery perfusion, and deflates during systole, decreasing afterload. Its primary value is as a temporizing measure when the cause of shock is potentially correctable by surgery or percutaneous intervention (eg, acute MI with major coronary obstruction, acute mitral insufficiency, ventricular septal defect).

However, patients manifesting such rhythms may be treated with procainamide, lidocaine (see [Other drugs](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v926159) [ Other drugs Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v926159) ), or resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including Recognition of absent breathing and circulation Basic life support with chest compressions... read more ](/professional/critical-care-medicine/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr-in-adults#v926141) ). Postresuscitation rapid supraventricular tachycardias occur frequently because of high levels of beta-adrenergic catecholamines (both endogenous and exogenous) during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. These rhythms should be treated if extreme, prolonged, or associated with hypotension or signs of coronary ischemia. An esmolol IV infusion is given, beginning at 50 mcg/kg/min.
