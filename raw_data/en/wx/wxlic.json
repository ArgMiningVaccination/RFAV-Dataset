From a series of lectures and conversations held at Koberwitz, Germany (now in Poland) in June 1924, there emerged the fundamental principles of biodynamic farming and gardening, a unified approach to agriculture that relates the ecology of the farm-organism to that of the entire cosmos. This approach has been under development in many parts of the world ever since. Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, who worked with Dr. Steiner during the formative period, brought biodynamic concepts to the United States in the 1930s. It was during this period that the Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association was founded in 1938. While studying at Sunbridge College in Chestnut Ridge, New York, Crystal took extra classes in Biodynamic Gardening with Gunther Haulk. He has been an educator, biodynamic gardener/farmer and beekeeper for nearly four decades. Crystal had previously owned an organic landscaping company, Mother Earth Organic Gardening and found Biodynamic Gardening more complete since it includes the spiritual forces. _\"More than we can imagine depends on our ability to turn the crisis into an opportunity for change.\" - Gunther Hauk - _ Nurturing the biodynamic movement in North America through education, research, and development The Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association (BDA) is an association of individuals and organizations in North America who are committed to the transformation of the whole food system, from farm to table, and who draw inspiration from the spiritual-scientific insights of Rudolf Steiner. Biodynamics is a worldwide movement for the renewal of agriculture based on an understanding of the spiritual forces at work in nature and in human social life. From this understanding, a particular form of organic farming has been developed that continues to grow and evolve around the world. "}
