Available from the Hy-Vee Floral Department, this versatile symbol of the season can ll a starring role on a front door or in the center a lovely table setting. When displaying your wreath on larger surfaces such as a front door or gate, wire a few stems of curly willow to the base to add depth to the wreath, above. Or, let the evergreen beauty earn its keep indoors as a clever table centerpiece, below. Place it on a runner and insert a clear glass cylinder vase lled with Granny Smith apples. 1 2 3 4 5 6 4seasons / HOLIDAY 2007 1.

By combining your family's cherished seasonal d\u00e9cor with the creative touch of an experienced florist, you'll discover new ways to outt your home with holiday cheer. The Hy-Vee florists do more than just custom-design floral pieces. They're also available to brainstorm decorating ideas for an entire home or business seasonal display or a holiday event, yuletide party, or family gathering. Count on the Floral Department as your source of unusual or hard-to-nd decorating items, such as large sugar pine- cones, a wide selection of containers and vases, or oversize baskets. Many items are available for purchase, and some can be rented for special events or the entire season. OPPOSITE: Fresh hydrangea blooms and evergreen boughs complement the wood surfaces in the family room. Simple arrangements of different heights bring drama and visual interest to the mantel. A loose spray of curly willow in a tall cylinder vase connects floral creations on the mantel and hearth. Votive candles, clustered in groups of two or three on the mantel and shelves, warm the setting. BELOW: The granite hearth is softened with the homeowner's moss balls in a Hy-Vee basket overflowing with elements that hint at nature's bounty: sugar pinecones, pine boughs, twine 7seasons / With the candle carver tool, below right, creating handcrafted candle holders is a snap. The tool carves a plug from fruits and vegetables, the perfect size for tealights in metal cups. Try the tool on apples, pears, gourds, or pumpkins for festive holiday tables and buffets. Use oranges, lemons, and limes for fragrant candle holders. Fruits or vegetables with uneven bottoms work, too. Slice off the bottom rst to make a flat base then use the candle carver; place the fruit or veggie votive on a candle coaster, plate or platter, or bed of evergreens to the protect table surface. (Warning: Never leave burning candles alone with children or unattended.) Candle Carver $7.99 White Tealight Candles 50 pc. $3.99RIGHT: Creating floral design to suit the scale of the space and furniture can be difcult especially for new homeowners with few Christmas ornaments or large homes. Hy-Vee florists created a grand and bountiful display on a large vintage cupboard using an old window and a few of the homeowner's favorite pottery bowls. OPPOSITE: Dining room tables are pretty throughout the season with long- lasting elements such as pinecones, evergreen, and willow. For special occasions, add fresh blooms and apples lled with tealights. Purchase cube- shape, clear glass containers in the Hy-Vee Floral Department along with floral foam. For Thanksgiving, Rita suggests lling a square vase with orange floral foam, bringing a ribbon up either side of the vase, and sticking a few flowers or pumpkins on top, anchoring them in the foam. BELOW: Granny Smith apples light up the table when lled with votive candles. Consider using fruit and vegetable votives in other ways, too. For example, float several candle-lled apples in a water-lled vase or punch bowl or create a platter of fruit or veggie votives for an entry, coffee, or selected varieties 2 roll $3.68 2.

But you don't need to bake a batch of sugar cookies every time you want your home to be infused with the scents of the season. Here are some other ways to ensure your home is lled with an inviting holiday aroma every time someone steps through the front door: Simmer a blend of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and vanilla beans in water on the stovetop. Stuff Christmas tins with spruce and pine boughs to set around the house. Cut a piece of holiday-themed fabric into squares and toss broken cinnamon sticks, vanilla beans, and whole cloves into each square. Gather the ends of the fabric together and tie each bundle with gold ribbon. Hang them around door handles so the fragrance is released whenever someone exits or enters. Buy Christmas candles with scents such as pine, vanilla, and other spices. Choose an assortment of candles in varied heights, diameters, and colors to put on a decorative serving tray. Use all one fragrance or carefully mix a few to create your own unique fragrance. Set out a reed diffuser to release favorite winter fl avors like bayberry, peppermint, and balsam. Throw a handful of spices into the replace. Take your favorite potholder and cut a small hole in one side. Drop a teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger inside the hole and sew it up so the heat from pots and pans will release the hidden spices during holiday meals. Brew coffee fl avors such as vanilla hazelnut or a unique holiday spice blend in place of your regular ground each morning. Make a Christmas wreath out of fresh pine. Dust some pinecones with cinnamon and place them inside the wreath. Tie several small bundles of cinnamon sticks together with red or green ribbon and hang them on the Christmas tree. Fill a glass bowl full of vanilla beans, cinnamon sticks, and strips of orange peel to create a delicious centerpiece. Plug in room fresheners in bedrooms and bathrooms in fl avors like gingerbread and hollyberry. 1 2 3 11seasons / hy-vee.com/G.swash2/a.begin1/t_her /T.swash1oge/t_h.alt2e/r.end6 WRITTEN BY KATHY EASTMAN PHOTOGRAPHED BY TOBIN BENNETTTibsjoh!hppe!ujnft!xjui!gbnjmz!boe!gsjfoet!jt!uif!cftu!qbsu!pg!! ipmjebz!hbuifsjoht/!Uijt!zfbs-!kpjo!jo!uif!gvo!boe!cf!b!hvftu!bu!zpvs!pxo!! hfu.uphfuifst!xjui!b!mjuumf!ifmq!gspn!zpvs!gsjfoet!bu!Iz.Wff/! 12seasons / HOLIDAY 2007Easy entertaining that's big on style: Make table decorations in less than 20 minutes using your own contain- ers.

Call the Hy-Vee Catering, Bakery, and Floral Departments to check on any special-order items you want. Note: You can place most \"normal\" orders up to a day or two in advance of the occasion. However, because the holidays are busy and because some items may need to be ordered in by the store, be sure to call your Hy-Vee early. Determine if you need to rent or borrow tables, chairs, or any other items. Again, because the holidays are busy, place your order as soon as possible. Purchase a cha ng dish or two, kitchen gear, holiday dinnerware, baking and cooking staples for the pantry, cleaning supplies, holiday decorating items, gifts and gift wrap from Hy-Vee. If needed, pick up a Rug Doctor to freshen the carpets and have your tablecloths, napkins and holiday clothing laundered and pressed or dry cleaned at Hy-Vee, too. 2 WEEKS BEFORE Select your favorite recipes and create a menu. Make a grocery list and lists of any miscellaneous items needed. Make a list of the beverages to serve, such as wine, beer, sodas, and cider. Using the lists, pick up beverages and nonperishables as you have time. 1 WEEK BEFORE Clean out refrigerator and freezer. Start on cleaning tasks, such as polishing the silver and dusting furniture. Make the foods that can be frozen or stored safely until the meal. 4-5 DAYS BEFORE If you purchased a frozen turkey, begin thawing it in the refrigerator so it is ready to roast. Make a list of the times foods need to go into the oven, onto the stove top, and into the microwave, so everything gets done at the right time. 2-3 DAYS BEFORE Shop for the perishable items on your lists. Begin prep work on foods that can be made ahead, such as sweet potato casserole or soups. Continue cleaning chores, such as fl oors and bathrooms. Clear the coat closet for guests. 1 DAY BEFORE Purchase refrigerator items, including fl owers. Don't forget ice for drinks and coolers, if needed. Pick up tables, chairs, and any other rental items. Set up the tables, iron linens, and set chairs around the tables. Get out necessary serving platters, bowls, and utensils. Set the table. Arrange fresh fl owers from Hy-Vee yourself or set out arrangements the Floral Department has designed for you. PARTY DAY Pick up last-minute Hy-Vee items. Prep foods according to your schedule; keep everything cold (or hot) until serving time. Set out beverages, ice bucket, and glasses so guests can help themselves as they arrive. Offer snacks or nibbles\u2014relish trays, pretzels, or nuts\u2014to keep hunger at bay while you work on last-minute dinner preparations. Enlist guests to help, as needed. Let them ll water glasses, mash potatoes, or re ll platters at the buffet table. Enjoy your party! 1. Dutch Yellow or Ruby Gold Potatoes 24 oz. $3.48 2.

Hy-Vee baking soda 1 tsp. few minutes and inexpensive supplies from Hy-Vee, you can create unusual gift packages. English Toffee, opposite , looks smart in a wine bag. By cutting 6 inches off the top of the bag, you end up with the perfect size to hold two servings of toffee. We punched new holes in the bag top and reused the bag's cording, adding fun dangling tags. A sleeve of crimped freezer paper and scrapbooking paper keeps the toffee's chocolate layer from rubbing onto the gift bag. Small treats such as Chocolate-Peanut Butter Bites, page 28 , and White Chocolate Raspberry Fudge, page 33 , are best packaged in shallow containers. For the Bites, we opted for a shiny metal craft tin, and wrapped the lid with a slender ribbon. A cushioning layer of tissue or crinkled paper keeps the goodies in place. For fudge, use a candy box, and give it a holiday upgrade with scrapbooking paper layered inside the lid and a thick ribbon wrapped around the outside. A single clear button glued on the gift tag adds a simple, homey touch. Brittle is fragile, so avoid giving this treat in a soft package, such as a gift bag. Instead, use a clear canister like the one on page 29 , which holds more than enough Spiced Pecan Brittle, also page 29 , to satisfy a sweet tooth. To complete the look, add a tag strung on cording around the top and wrap a band of paper around the middle. Use a patterned scrapbooking paper, or gussy up solid-color paper with snowfl ake cutouts as we did. Finally, head to the tableware aisle at Hy-Vee for sturdy white soup mugs to package Brown Sugar Shortbread, page 32 . After the cookies cool, pop each one into a treat bag, tie with a bit of embroidery thread, and place in the mug. A belt of ribbon once again completes the package. 3 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 1.

If you're looking for an especially ne line of cheeses to use at your next dinner party, look no further than Beemster premium gourmet Dutch cheeses. Farmers in northern Holland long ago discovered that cows grazing in Beemster pastures gave better quality milk than other cows. Due to a combination of soil and climate, the milk contained a softer, sweeter milk fat that produced an incredible cheese texture and flavor. The Beemster secret recipe, developed in 1901, remains a closely guarded formula to this day. Beemster only employs master craftspeople, many from generations of skilled cheesemakers with a passion for their trade. Each one must undergo extensive training to understand the Beemster cheesemaking process. In the all-natural process, the cows are never injected with growth hormone, and they graze freely in pastures without pesticides. The end result is a top-quality product with unmatched taste. In 2001, Beemster became a selected supplier to the Royal Court of the Netherlands, sealing the company's reputation for excellence in cheesemaking. 54seasons / HOLIDAY 2007Beemster Imported from Holland: Classic or Vlaskaas $10.99 Swiss Switzerland $6.99 lb.
