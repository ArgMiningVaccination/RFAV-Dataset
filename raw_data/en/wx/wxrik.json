The homesteading community who live off-grid and are self-sufficient generally only uses products that are organic and cause no harm to the food they grow to eat. There are many ways to paint and seal the planter boxes you use to grow your own fresh, healthy produce to eat. While some products are safe and do not contain harmful toxins, others are not. Food safe and plant safe containers should always be used for growing fresh produce for your family. Planter boxes are a great way to grow all sorts of fresh produce, from herbs to vegetables and fruit trees to [nutrient-enriched succulents](https://farmhouseguide.com/flowering-succulents/). Knowing how to grow and care for these plants could take some research, but the information is available. We will discuss the best way to paint or seal a planter box for producing chemical-free, fresh homegrown produce. Table of Contents What Is The Difference Between Food Safe And Plant Safe? Before we start, we should address this critical question as we need to know that the planter box that our food is growing in will produce food safe enough for us to eat and be chemical-free. Most people would like to know where their food is coming from and what chemicals are going into them. With the trend of growing food at home becoming ever more popular, we see this question arise more frequently. Some people don't have the space to grow vegetables in the garden, or they don't even have a garden at all. Planter boxes are an option for growing food in areas with limited space, but this is an option even for people with room for a garden. Fresh produce can be grown in your own backyard in the ground or simple planter boxes on your patio or balcony, but these boxes need to be safe for the food and plants we grow in them. What Is Food Safe? All containers used to store or grow any food item consumed by humans have to be food-safe or food-grade safe. This means that the container cannot contain any dyes, recycled plastics, treated raw materials, or toxic chemicals of any kind that could be harmful to humans. If you are going to purchase food planters from stores or garden centers, check the labels first, as many of them come with a warning stating that they shouldn't be used for food plants. The best wooden food planter boxes should be made with redwood, teak, heartwood, or cypress. There are many other materials used for planting boxes. These include ceramics, stone, brick, cement, and even steel and wrought-iron. You can make or buy almost any type of planter box to suit your own unique needs and requirements. What Is Plant Safe? A strong chemical could be used to paint or seal the planter box. The harmful toxins could leach into the ground and be absorbed by the plant, damaging or killing the plant. Paint or seal your plant container with a food-safe and plant-safe product, ensuring no toxin or chemical transfer of any kind to yourself and your family or to the plant you are growing to produce the food you are going to eat. Be sure to check that the materials you will use are food safe and plant safe before using them to plant and grow your food. Safe Paint And Sealers For Planter Boxes It is not ideal to use left-over paint that you have lying around from a previous DIY job to paint your planter box. Read the paint tin's directions first to see which chemicals it contains and if it is food and plant safe. If it does not mention that the paint is food and plant safe, don't use it! You could go ahead and try using any old paint or sealer that you have lying around your shed or garage, but with all the information available on how to get the job done correctly and which products are safe to use, why would you take the chance? The risk of contaminating the food that you and your family are going to eat is too great. Research the job and buy the suitable materials before you start and enjoy toxin-free, fresh, healthy produce. When growing food plants in planter boxes, avoid using copper and zinc sealants and pressure-treated wood. Planter boxes made from cement or concrete do not need sealing. All planters with a porous surface need sealer treatments before you plant any food plants. There are many non-toxic paints and sealers available that are safe to use on your planter boxes: 1.
