Osteopathic physicians utilize palpation (clinically appropriate touchi ng) as part of the os teopathic approa ch to treatment. As p art of the educat ional process, CUSOM MSBS students must be a ble to tolerate being touched, examined and receive osteopathic manipulation by memb ers of both genders, and to touch, examine and provide osteopa thic manipulation to others (of both genders) in order to acquire the ski lls necessa ry for palpation and examination. This palpation is performed a pro fessional and appropr iate manner. Acquiri ng the skills to palpate and examine patients requires a student to examine partially disrobe d patients of both genders and is mand atory for successful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. S tudents are required to pa rticipate fully as both the e xaminer and examinee in various clinical laboratory experiences. In Clinical Skills and Osteop athic Manipulative M edicine laboratory experiences, as well as othe r clinical laboratories wh ere ski lls are acquir ed, students are required to participate in the examination of fellow students of both gende rs who may be partially disrobe d. In order to be able to gain appropri ate clinical exposure to the regions being examined and osteopa thic manipulative techniques to be provide d, students need to wear attire such as shorts and are expected to partially disro be for certain laboratory experiences. Please refer to t he Dress Code Policy for additional info rmation. Addit ionally, CUSOM utilizes cadavers in the gross anatomy laboratory. As such, CUSOM MSBS students must be able to tolerate working wit h, and touching , cadavers. Any de vice capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, includi ng cell phones, are not permitt ed in any laboratory (anatomy , clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to OSCE, standardized patients, Early Clinical Experience, clinical rotations, and the student health clinic. CUSOM MSBS students also participate in ultrasound labs and, as such, will be required to pe rform ultrasound examination of fellow student s of both genders who may be partially disrobe d. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural or religious beliefs, in order for the student to acquire the skills necessa ry to practice osteo pathic medicine. 19 Students who have any concern regarding these requirements should discuss them with the Director of Admissions prior to applying. CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations as required by law for students whose disabili ties will not prevent them from successful ly compl eting the entire CUSOM c urriculum and gr aduating as an ost eopathic physician. Students, how ever, are required to fun ction with indepe ndence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds a s mand atory for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. Appl icants who do not meet the Technical Standards should not apply to CUSOM. Students / Applicants must possess the abilities and skills in the following five areas: 1. Observat ion The student must be able to visual ly obs erve laboratory demonst rations, microscopic t issue with the aid of the m icroscope, and electronic i mages used in classroom presentations and labora tory demonstr ations. The student must be able to visually and accurately obs erve p hysical signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and clinical man agement. The use of a trained intermedi ary in such cases would compromise performance, as it would be medi ated by another individual 's power of selection, observation, and experience. O bservation requires the fu nctional use of vis ion and somatic sensations a nd, is oft en enhanced b y the sense of smell. 2. Communica tion The student must be able to communi cate effectively in English, as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered exclusively in English.

In addition, osteopa thic manipulation the use of extremities in palpation, posit ioning , and carrying out maneuvers of manipulation. These actions r equire fine and gross motor control, as well as the sense of touch and adequate vision for insp ection. Stude nts must be a ble to generate suf ficient force, and be able to r eceive these same forces, to successful ly learn and provide effective osteo pathic manipulative treatments for all techniques which include, but are not limited to, muscle energy, counte rstrain, Still technique, and high- velocity, low amplitude ( HVLA) taught in the curriculum. 4. Intellectual The student must have the ability to reason, calcul ate, analyze, measure, and synthesi ze information delivered in a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, electroni c/digital sources, EKGs, medi cal images and similar modalit ies.

In addition, students must be able to pe rform pattern recognition, recall information, identify and disc riminate important information, probl em solve, calcul ate and make decisions in timed situations and in the p resence of noise and dis tractions. The above intellectual abilities are essential, as students and graduates are expected and required to perform pattern recognition, immedi ate recall of learned mate rial, discrimination to elicit important information, probl em solvi ng, and decision- making in the emergent diagnosis and treatment of patients. S tudents must be able to recall and apply important information to generate a differential diagnosis and to de velop a the rapeutic management for emergent conditions. This type of demonstr ated intellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time-efficient mann er in order to provide appropriate care to patients with emergent conditions. 21 It is common for emergent situations to occur in the presence of visual ly distracting and noisy environme nts. Such emergent situations include , but are toxic exposures, shoc k, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must possess the emotional health neede d for full use of his/her intelle ctual capabilities at all times. The emotional health required for effective communication and for pro fessional, matu re, sensitive, and compa ssionate patient/physician or patient/student r elationships m ust be pre sent. Students must be able to function effectively unde r stress and with physically taxing wo rkloads, such as during lectures, labs, written and practical examinations, and clinical rotations.

As such , a controll ed substance screening test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription me dications without a valid pr escription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a, is required before mat riculation into CUSOM MSBS. 40 The Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a psychiatric evaluation on any student whe n there is an incident of erratic or unusual behavior, or there is a reasona ble concern due to a stude nt's behavior, appearance or performance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and including , dis missal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and controlled substances (defined as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controll ed Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and including , dismissal. Please note this also include s substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a, but which may be legal in other states. For example, although the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the U.S. Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Un iversity policy. Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utiliz ation of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient , and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of medical educatio n. While many capable and compassionate health care providers are present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life -threatening emergency, they should not be consulted to make treatment or disposition recommendations in non- emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which is activated by dialing 9 -1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a medical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and will also be responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security w ill complete, and maintain, an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance, even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment and/or transport. 41 Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an inj ury during a CUSOM activity while on campus, the student must compl ete an incid ent report, a nd call/go to the Campbell Univ ersity's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from Campbell Univ ersity's Health Center (910) 893- 1560. Campbell Student Health Services PO Box: 565 129 T.T.

A medi cal, psycholog ical or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabilit y if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. Section II: Ho w to Obtain Services General Procedur e for Receiving Acco mmodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Director of Student A ffairs to request services as soon as poss ible. The Univ ersity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabilit ies and is not required to provide s ervices unless prope r procedures have been follow ed in m aking a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Director of Student A ffairs, who consul ts with the Dire ctor of S tudent Success/ ADA/504 Com pliance Officer to provide document ation of the dis ability and to com plete the appropriate paperwork. 48 Step 3: The Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting doc ument ation, if neede d. The process of review depends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accommodations are made on a case-by- case basis. T here is no stand ard accom modation for any particular disabilit y. CUSOM will make r easonable modifi cations to its policies, practices and pro cedures, unless doing so would fundament ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fin ancial burden.

Additional Information Regarding Accommodations Do cumentation For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provid es accom modations or modi fications to policies and practices in order to ensure t hat all students have equal access to all CUSOM MSBS programs, services, and activities. The p urpose of accom modations is not to ensure success, but rather to provide access and equal educat ional opportuni ty. Accom modations are not provide d retroactively. Any student approved for accom modations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date that approva l is given. E ven if the stude nt can establis h that he or she h ad a disabilit y at the time of the course in question, CUSOM MSBS will not expung e or re-examine coursework completed b efore the stud ent was reviewed and approved for accommodation. No student is required to disclose his or her disabilit y to the Unive rsity. However, as discuss ed above, any student who discloses and receives approve d accom modations after he or she has begun study at CUSOM MSBS will not receive any retroactive accom modations on work compl eted before the approval for accom modations w as made. 49 Document ation of a student's disabilit y is only shared with relevant CUSOM MSBS faculty, staff or administration on a need-to-know b asis with a release of info rmation s igned by the studen t.

P roviding comfo rt or suppor t does not qualify an animal as a service animal. If the re are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Dir ector of Student S uccess/ADA/504 Compl iance Officer. In compl iance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all bu ildings on campus and m ay attend any class, meeting, or oth er event. Service animals are expected to e xhibit reasona ble b ehavior while on campus. The owners of disrupt ive and aggressive service animals may be asked to remove t hem from unive rsity facilities. If the imprope r behavior ha ppens repeatedly, the ow ner may be told not t o bring the service animal into a ny facility until they take si gnificant s teps to m itigate the behavior. Emot ional support animals are animals that provide comfo rt and relieve symptoms of ment al health disorde rs. Emotional support animals are not allowed in other campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasona ble accommodation and will be inclu ded in the stude nt's Letter of Accom modation (LOA) from CU SOM. The CUS OM Director of Student Affairs can p rovide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service animal on campus is mandatory. Conside ration of othe rs must be tak en into account when provi ding mainten ance and hygiene of a nimals. The own er is expected to clean and dispose of all animal waste.

Section III: S tudent Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accom modations. CUSOM MSBS students with disabilit ies or for contacting such students to begin the accom modation request process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student 's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to pa y any costs thereof. CUSOM r eserves the r ight not to provide services or a ccommodations until all of the documentation sp ecified in the g uidelines is provided. 3. Any student approved for accommodations is respons ible for retrieving his or he r Letter of A ccom modation (LOA) and Release of Information Form fr om the Director of Student Affairs or available at: https://cuweb.wuf oo.com/forms/cusom -release-of-information/ 51 Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommod ations Testing accom modations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs. It is very important that testing information be shared in a tim ely mann er. At the beginning of the semest er, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs all approve d testin g accommodations. This discussion should address the que stions of how, when and where the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs will provide the testing accom modations. The student shoul d make sure to have a calen dar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs of t heir need for accom modations at least one w eek prior to each t est/exam. If at any time you feel that the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs is not adequately meeting your accom modations, discuss this with the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs and the Dire ctor of Student A ffairs immedi ately. Rememb er, the Office of Postbaccalaure ate is only required to provide accom modations spe cifically listed in the Letter of Accom modation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on camp us must maintain state- issued handicap parking permits. The student is also required to purchase an appropri ate parking sticker from the Campbell University D epartment of Campus Safety. If a student has consistent probl ems finding necessa ry handicapped parking n ear his/her class buildings, notify the Director of Student Affairs and the Campbell University D epartment of Campus Safety immedia tely. Section IV: Doc umenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure that reasonable and appropri ate services and accom modations are pro vided to students with disabilit ies, students requesting such accom modations and services must provide current document ation of their disabilit y. Such documentation g enerally must include the f ollowin g: 52 A clear diagnosti c statement of the disability prepared by a licensed prof essional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activit y and the s everity of the limitation It is the respons ibility of the student requesting the accom modations and services to document the disabilit y. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursua nt to these guidel ines is to be borne by the student. I f there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modi fications to previously approve d accommodations. The student will have to provide current suppor ting doc ument ation for review at that time. An Indivi dualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to suppl ement documentation, but are generally insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, a nd be comprised o f the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified profe ssional who conduc ted the a ssess ment should be gin the report. Please note that memb ers of the student's family are not c onside red appropri ate evaluato rs. Recen t Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or compl ete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administe red, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individuali zed Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan may help to suppl ement a more compr ehensive insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The sum mary should integrate the elements of the battery with back ground infor mation, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's current academic situation. This summary should present evid ence of a substantial 53 limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakne ss are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disabilit y diagnosis. It should also demons trate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning probl em. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discuss ed. This summary may include recommended accom modations, but these are in no way bindi ng to the Univ ersity. CUS OM reserves the right to evaluate all document ation and de termine appropriate accommodations in each ca se. Section V: Grievanc e Proced ure All requests for accom modations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs. P roblems with approve d accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Dire ctor of Student A ffairs, the student and the CUSOM Director of S tudent A ffairs should forward the compl aint to the Director of Student Success/ ADA/504 Compliance Officer for an informal resolut ion. The Direc tor of Student Success/ ADA/504 Compliance Officer will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs with in ten ( 10) business d ays of receiving the c ompl aint. In the event that the stude nt is dissatisfied with the informal resolut ion, he/she may file a compl aint with the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Vi ce President for Student Life and Dean of Students will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compl iance Officer within ten ( 10) business d ays of receiving the compl aint. In the event that the stude nt is dissatisfied with the informal resolut ion, he/she may file a compl aint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the is sue invol ves denial of an acad emic accommodation. Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of compl aint through the D epartment of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if neede d. 54 5. ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES 5.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counseling should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre -matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSO M's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, long-term, consistent mentorship from academic advisors, board and residency preparation support, the training and allocation of peer -tutors, learnin g enrichment programs, and targeted individual and group workshops through its Academic Center of Excellence ( CUSOM ACE). Organizational Structure of the ACE CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans of Academic Success and the support of an Executive Assistant, is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM MSBS students. CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to: peer-tutor program, study skill development workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on-line student forum. CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning and Board preparation resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its computers or mini library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community and Facebook group pages provide additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. Academic Transition Activities CUSOM ACE is responsible for designing and leading a ctivities and programs designed to assist matriculating students develop study skills and techniques, which will assist them in achieving academic success Long- term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship i s one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even t each. The CUSOM MSBS advising process ensures biomedical science faculty are involved in student at advising and establishing relationships that create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor/Advisee relationship will ensure consisten t feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an 55 important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and Assistant Academic Officer of the MSBS Program assign academi c advisors to each incoming CUSOM MSBS student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors duri ng years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Semes ter 1 of Year s 1 and 2, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually, and thereafter, as requested by the student advisee. The purpose of these meetings is to provide academic support to the students as they adjust to graduate school and prepare for professional programs . During the remaining academic semesters in the first and second years, students will meet with their advisors as requested by the student . During each semester of Years 1 and 2, students will also have a Personali zed Evaluation of Professional Programs Candidacy (PEPPC) meeting with the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Assistant Academic Officer of the MSBS Program and Faculty Advisor to provide additional support and c ounsel on applications to professional programs and assessment of candidate competitiveness and readiness for professional programs. In lieu of a PEPPC meeting, a Pre -Professional Committee Interview may be scheduled pending approval from the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs . In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to stude nts for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By mat riculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate advising effectiveness. 56 Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Deans for Academic Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test- taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one -on-one meetings. Individual meet ings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact thei r academic advisor or CUSOM ACE for an individual meeting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic performance, student requests, and/or recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additional meetings with their academic advisor or the Academic Center for Excellence at any time regardless of their academic performance. These meetings can be one -time only, weekly, or bi -weekly, whiche ver the students and CUSOM ACE directors deem appropriate. Recommendation to seek additional support from Behavioral Health when necessary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisors, CUSOM ACE als o organizes and/or participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring students. 5.2 CUSOM Peer- Tutor Program CUSOM ACE also develops and manages additional academic support se rvices through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor program and faculty development programs designed to enhance faculty advising skills. The CUSOM Peer -Tutor p rogram is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to become more proficient in subject -specific materials and more efficient and effective independent learners across a broad range of courses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace, lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course - specific tutors. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (rankin g the top 25% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS BS students who wish to receive peer-tutoring support place their request s by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and complete a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer -tutors who will then 57 contact the tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidentiality, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on the ACE Blackboard Community page. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the two years of the MSBS program , and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 5.3 Attendance Attendance Policy Attendance of all students is expected at all lectures, and re quired at all lab s and other scheduled curricular activitie s. Attendance will be mo nitored by the Office of Postbacca laureate Programs using the lecture hall came ras, and electronic attendance records are maintained. Absences for emergencies are conside red on a case-by-case basis through the Office of Postbaccalaureate Progr ams. Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action thr ough the Acad emic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Violations of the attendance requirement policy may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, remova l from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in student's file . In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. It is recog nized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; how ever, a student who m isses a lecture, laboratory or worksho p is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that p articular period. The student may be required to make-up the missed educational session( s) during off-hours. Makeup lab oratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Cour se Directo r in consultation with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs when necessa ry. 58 The total number of absences mu st not e xceed 20% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 20% threshold has not been reached. Once a student ha s met or exceeded the 20% mark, the student may be eligible to request an excused absence through the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For medical condition/illness, the student must provide the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs with a note from the examining physician (who is NOT a family member) indic ating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time-off, and the student's r eturn-to-class date. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitte d at least seven (7) d ays prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or othe r similar activities or events. Examples include: o Death in imme diate family stepparent , grandparen t, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the a nticipated absence. For attending CUSOM-related activitie s or national meetin gs of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be subm itted, in writing, to the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumul ative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good acade mic standing. Students are allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absences per semester for voluntary attendance at conferences if all ot her excused absence criteria have been met . No tr avel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs . CUSOM accepts no responsibilit y or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancel led or delayed travel plans. Approved absences for stude nts required to attend national conferences will not be subject the 20% rule; however, formal requests must be submitted for approval. Students may request an excused absence for religious holid ays not included in the list of recog nized University holidays. Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitte d for approval to the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs . 59 In the event of any absence from an examination, quiz or other scheduled curricular activity , approval must be obtained from the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs to arrange a make-up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above) . It is essential each stude nt make every effort not to miss any examination, quiz or other scheduled curricular ac tivity requiring student participation. Requests for make-up examinations, quizzes or other scheduled curricular activit ies must be made in a timely manner with the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs in consultation with the Course Director(s) . An unexcused absence from an examination or q uiz may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment . For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \" Excused Absence Request Form\" online. The Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the stude nt will be notified of the d ecision in a timely mann er. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on A cademic Probation, they may not be approv ed for an excused absence unless for an extenuating situation determined o n a case-by-case basis. The Vi ce Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an atte ndance decision. Once an absence request is approve d, it is the stude nt's respons ibility to contact the Course Dir ectors and the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs to arrange a makeup for m issed labora tories, scheduled curricular activities, and an examination /quiz where applicable . It is important to note that, a lthoug h the Course Dir ectors will do their best to accom modate the mak eup requests, some missed experiences may not be replicable, and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' disc retion. In the case in which a missed experience is not replicable, and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade. Official Ho lidays CUSOM o bserves the f ollowing Univ ersity holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King , Jr Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) Holid ays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monda y after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell Univ ersity. 60 Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM MSBS student is called to s erve on a jury, or if a CUSOM MSBS student is ordered to appea r in court as a witness, he or she should submit the appropriate lecture and/or lab excused absence request as outlined above , and advise the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs as soon as possible. As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence request and suppor ting docu mentation must be submitted to the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs at least seven (7) days prior to the a nticipated absence. Cons equences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) C ommittee may consider non-compliance with the Attendan ce Policy by MSBS students as a viol ation of CUSOM policy which may result in disciplinary action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any stu dent club, organization, or student govern ment office; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in the student's file . In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. Severe Weather P olicy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules or dining option changes, a mess age will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through our incl ement w eather l ine: On cam pus: dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: di al 910-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 5.4 Dress C ode Policy Students must maintain a profe ssional appearan ce and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell Univ ersity and on all clinical and service e xperiences. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, and workshops and scheduled m eetings with faculty and staff . Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length (no higher than 2\" above the knee when sitting ) or slacks with appropriate blous es. Cha nging areas and lockers are provi ded for students to change 61 into appropri ate dress for labs. Students may wear appropriate casual attire while not in class., Monday throug h Friday, or on weekends, except when notified by the school administra tion. A clean and well-cared-for appear ance shoul d be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the Univer sity. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well groom ed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to facult y, staff, or students. Hairstyles should be c lean and neat, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unaccept able. Beards and must aches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body pie rcings are not accept able. Shorts, jeans, sweatpants, and T -shirts are not permitted . Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie , or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. CUSOM encourages all students to cover their tattoos while on- campus, a nd during clinical and service experiences. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus and not return until appropriately attired. Any class or lab, missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs , whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academic Performa nce, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. Additional Dres s Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. Anatomy Laboratory Dress C ode Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM p rovides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. T he lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close -toed shoes and long pants are required. Flip- flops, open -toed shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. 62 Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy lab . Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where stu dents may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the 4th floor lobby outs ide the l aboratory. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (stud ents provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the c hemicals u sed in t he laboratory). 5.5 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM MSBS curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administe red to assess student know ledge and performance. The E xecutive Director of Ass essment, Accr editation and Medical Education, the Director of Postbaccalaureate Prog rams , the Registrar , as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Acad emic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committe e (APPS) Committee to d etermine each individual student's eligibility for prom otion or graduation, consider the results of the s tudent assessments and reports concern ing attendance, and monitor conduc t and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory acade mic progress are addressed through the processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, stude nts may be brought be fore the Acad emic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committe e (APPS) Committee for disciplina ry action or academic review, with recomm endations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 5.6 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The O ffice of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. Co rresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculu m, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Ost eopathic a subcommi ttee of the CUSOM Curriculum C ommittee), the CU SOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell Univ ersity Cur riculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM MSBS curriculum as part of the i nstitutiona l accreditation process. Campbell Unive rsity is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call 404 -679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell Univ ersity was awarded Level VI accr editation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, a t which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The S ACSCOC approva l reads: \"The Boar d of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es revie wed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Med icine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to appr ove the program and include it in the s cope of the curren t accreditation and to advance the institution to L evel VI.\" Campbell Univ ersity is one of only four private unive rsities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accred itation status by SACSCOC . CUSOM MSBS 's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to prepare students for the rigor and pace of a wide range of health professions programs . CUSOM MSBS C redit Cal culation The CUSOM MSBS curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Semester of study with a designated number of weeks per Semester . CUSOM MSBS assigns grades to all credit-bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A m inimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next low er credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 15 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours are assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour ca lculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. 64 Credit Re view Pr ocess CUSOM MSBS assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in thi s process conform to commonly accep ted pr actices of higher education. CUS OM MSBS awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, ut ilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid re gulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Com mittee, as well as the Cur riculum Counc il (UCC), appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM MSBS reviews credi t assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The proc ess includes, bu t is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, pr ecedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistenc y with t he CUSOM M ission. The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review a re maintain ed in the O ffice of Academic Affairs. All pro posed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are broug ht to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the CUSOM Curriculum Commit tee, and also the full MSBS Curriculum Committee for review, consideration and approval. M inor changes include such matters as the additio n/elimination of a course, modifications to an ex isting course, or minor changes to existing prog ram requirements. Substantive changes are those that invol ve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the U niversity. For propo sed non-substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Course Directors, in consultation with the Associate D ean for Biomedical Affairs, Assistant Academic Officer of the MSBS Program or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, a nd finally by the MSBS Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the propos ed changes are then presented to the Dean for re view and final approval. The Southe rn Asso ciation of Co lleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SAC SCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree-granting higher educat ion institutions in the Southe rn states. As such, any propos ed CUSOM MSBS substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a t imely manner. 65 Grading CUSOM MSBS has developed and publicized a grading system, in k eeping with the CUSOM Mission, to assess the progress of each student toward acquir ing the competencies essential to effective performance. Students must complete all required coursework with passing grades as publish ed in the Acad emic Bulletin. S tudents who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review. CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades: Grading Scale Year -1 and Year -2 Courses QualityPoints Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 C*b 70 2.0 F <70 0.0 P 70 4.0 P*b 70 2.0 a The maximum percentage cannot exceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, therefore 82.50- 82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful remediation of an initial failin g grade . Remediation Students must compl ete all required coursework with passing grades as published in this A cademic Bulletin. S tudents who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review and poss ible disciplina ry action. The APPS Committee may offer s tudents who fail any part of the curriculum an opportunity for remediatio n. 66 A student in the first (MSBS-1) or second (MSBS-2) year of studi es, who fails any course, will appear before the AP PS Com mittee. If the Com mittee gr ants the student the oppor tunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incompl ete (IC) until remedi ation is compl ete. The student will receive a grade of C* for a graded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remedi ation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remedi ation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remedi ation or if the student fails the r emedi ation. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUN ITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECI SION MADE BY THE APPS COMMI TTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASI S. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BE G RANTED REMEDIATION. Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points and Class R ank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by div iding the total number of qua lity point s earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purp oses of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not include d in \" graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the g rade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721 . In both years of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum , most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. No course grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that r emedi ation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for conside ration of a grade change only after the APPS Com mittee has convened and rendered their recommendation. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remedi ate the course w ill have the grade reported as Incompl ete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remedi ation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The R egistrar will report current IC grades to the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs at the time the IC is assigned. On ce an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. S tudents who fail to successful ly remedi ate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The hi ghest grade that can be earned for a remedi ated course is 70%. T he new grade, if remedi ated successful ly, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The gr ade of C* represents a remedi ated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pas s-Fail course. 67 Quality Points Quality point s are point s assigned to grades in an acade mic \"banking\" system. CUSOM MSBS is on a four-point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) point s per hour, a \" P\" is wo rth four (4.0) point s per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) point s per hour, a \"C\" is wo rth two (2.0) point s per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) point s per hour, and zer o (0) points a warded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three-hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hou rs = 12 total quali ty point s. Incomplete (IC), and Withdraw (W) grades do not carry any quality points. Class Rank Students will be provid ed their class rank at the end of the first and secon d academic year. Class ranks are calculated after all final grades have been submitted at the end of each acade mic Semester , in Years One and Two. Class ranks are provide d for informational purpos es only, and are only released to the student. Students who do not wish to receive information regarding their class rank may opt out of this notification by contacting the Registrar. The class rank ha s no di rect correlation to the stud ent's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all cou rses are calculated into t he cumulative GPA throu ghout the program . Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across all four semesters . For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achiev ed higher nume rical grades in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in An atomy while S tudent 6 e arned a grade of 93% in An atomy). Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapp ed to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that a ll CUSOM MSBS graduates achieve the in tended learning out comes. Assessment of knowl edge is conducted by multiple-choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled and random intervals, assignments and pres entations. 68 Grading for Years One and Two Eval uation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUS OM recognizes five categories of evaluation m odalities, including , but not limited to: 1. Integrated written e xaminations 2. Quizzes 3. Assignments 4. Presentations 5. Other (e.g., Projects, In-class activities, Independent work ) Each category is represented within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combi nation of the components listed above as determin ed by the Course Director and approved by the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs. Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the five categories identifie d previous ly, yet also provi de consistenc y across courses, CUSOM MSBS recognizes the followi ng approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams typically occur three to four t imes in each Semester in Years 1 & 2. Quizze s are typically administered each Monday of the MS BS curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lectures given in the preceding week . Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are ty pically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points possible. Grades are defined by the course- grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi. As such, bonus points are not permitted . In rare instances, there may be exceptions to the established Grading Policy, which require justification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive their course grades. 69 5.7 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standi ng is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic semester of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum . A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses and has met other specified degree requirements a t any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approve d activities, such as confer ences, student organizations, etc... Students wishing to s erve as officers in c lubs/organizations or pa rticipate in e vents, travel to meetings or ot her related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 s cale to be considered. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all semesters , successful ly compl eting all curricular and degree requirements in the semesters , and meeting the requirements as set forth by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for students, including those in a Modifi ed Course of Study. Students must also demonstr ate adequate developm ent in profe ssionalism as d etermined by the faculty and administration. Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to compl y with the plan as determined by the APPS Com mittee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modifi ed Course of Stu dy, they will remain in ful l-time status. Students who do not follow the Modifi ed Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modifi ed Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Com mittee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dis missal from the program . 5.8 Modified Courses of Study A Modified Cour se of Study (MCOS) is a credit-beari ng, individuali zed study plan for students who require an alternative educat ional pathway for r easons such as required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withd rawals. The Modifi ed Course of Study will be individual ly designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and approved by the APPS Com mittee. Students in a Modifi ed Course of Study must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the Modifi ed Course of Study. Students not follo wing the MCOS may be pla ced on Suspension (ineligible for fin ancial aid and not conside red an active studen t) at an y time. 5.9 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, moni tors the academic progress achi eved by all hout the entire CU SOM MSBS academic prog ram. 70 The APPS Com mittee meets at the end of each s emester to review students who ha ve achie ved a failing course grade, failed to suc cessfully remedi ate a failed course, failed to meet other program requirements, w hen a delay in a student 's academic progress is identified, or when deemed n ecessa ry. The Chair of the APPS Committee or the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs may also call a meeting of the APPS Com mittee in cases where the acad emic progress of a student is a ffected by a leave of absence or other factors. Addit ionally, the APPS Com mittee is respons ible for the review of situations where students are invol ved in academic misconduc t (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), violations of the H onor Code or Code of Mis conduc t, or unpro fessional conduc t. Additional information regarding these violations is found in Section 10 of the Academic Bulletin - \"Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, and Grievance Procedures\". The APPS Com mittee is appointed by the Dean, a nd memb ership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar, Director of Student Affairs , and Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs participate as non- voting ex officio memb ers. A quorum is defined as a simple majo rity of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, m ay inv ite non-voting members to attend. As APPS Committee meetings are consider ed academic proceedings and not legal hearings a ttorneys or other representatives a re not a llowed. Procedur es for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting APPS Committee mee tings are held at the end of each semester , after the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs has determined all grades, or as need ed. Reasons for an APPS Com mittee hearing include, but a re not limited to, if a student ha s: Failed a course Failed to complete a program or degree requiremen t Attempted and failed to remediate a course Failed to pa ss any course while on Acad emic Probation Violated the CUSOM MSBS Honor Code Violate d any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure Failed to make acade mic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan, or any Modified Course of Study Failed a c ontrolled substance screening test Received adve rse findings on a c riminal backg round check Failed to adhere to set timelines/due dates Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of comm unication from CUSOM. 71 APPS Committee Proced ures for Academic Performance Matters The Vi ce Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the AP PS Com mittee. Members of the APPS Com mittee ha ve the f ollowing roles: The appropr iate Asso ciate Dean for the academic year involved reports on the acad emic progress of stude nt(s), as necessa ry. The Asso ciate Dean may submit a written or oral report documenti ng assistance that the student has received or been offered, including but not limited to tu toring or advising. The Course Director, Department Chair, or the student's Faculty Advisor may be invited to an APPS Com mittee meeting to comment on stude nt performance and related topi cs, as necessary. The Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs may report as ex officio on document ation that the Office of Student Affairs has which may be relevant to the student 's academic prog ress. The R egistrar will be available a s ex officio to discuss the acade mic record if needed. The APPS Com mittee Chair shall identify a record ing secretary for minutes and to ensur e all communications oc cur in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Com mittee is provided the oppo rtuni ty to make a maximum of a ten-minute presentation (no PowerP oints or handouts) relevant to any issues or conside rations that they wish to make known to the APPS Com mittee. Members of the APPS Com mittee m ay then di rectly question the stude nt. This is the on ly portion of the meeting at which the stude nt may be physically present. In lieu of an in-person presentation, the student may be allowed to phone in to the APPS Committee meeting, and ha s the option to submit a written document, no more than two pa ges, single-spaced. These options are only available upon approval by the Chair of the APP S committee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in person. All aspects of the APPS Committe e functions remain confidential in perpetuity. For students failing to make a cademic progress includi ng, but not limited to, multiple grades of IC in one semester or across more than one semester , failure of a course, or failure to successful ly complete any curricular or degree requirements, the APPS Committee may impose a sanction including, but not limited to, any combi nation of the f ollowin g: Award a satisfactory grade (C*, P*, or PC*) and promotio n to the next Semester following satisfactory remed iation Require remediation, further coursework, repeat of courses, or write a topic -specific paper Require to repeat multi ple courses in whi ch the stude nt initially earned a failing grade 72 Specify a timeline or manner in which a ny remedi ation must occur Place a student on a defined term of Aca demic Probation Extend a student's term of Acad emic Probation Remove a student from clubs/organizations or leadership roles Require more f requent meetin gs with CUSOM's Academic Center for Excellence or fac ulty advisors Request further assessment to verify the st udent has the ability to make satisfactory progress including but not limite d to, psychological evaluations, controlled substance or alcohol screening/testing, or other evaluations. S uch testing will be at the stude nt's expense. Require the student to r epeat multi ple courses in whi ch the stude nt initially earned a failing grade Assign a Modi fied Course of Study which may delay promot ion and graduation until satisfactory progress through a directed remediation program has occur red In addition to imposing the above sanctions for failure to make academic progress, the Committee may review student progres s in order to remove students from Academic Probation or Suspension. The APPS Committee may also recommend to the Dean Suspension or Dismissal of a student from the program wh en the student de monstr ates that he/she is unable to make acade mic progress due to, but not limited to , any combi nation of the followin g: Failure of two or more courses in any one Semester in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failure of three or more total courses in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failure of any course while on a Modified Course of Study Failure of any course while on A cademic Probation Any other issues deemed relevant. The APPS Com mittee Chair will notify the stude nt in writing of the outcome of the AP PS Committee meeting and any applicable sanctions as soo n as practical . Upon receipt of not ification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decis ion, or signing the Notice of Decision to appeal the decision, within the timeframe defined in the Notice of Decision . An appeal of the APPS Committee decision by the student must be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the AP PS Com mittee at the time of the hearing. The Dean will reply within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the written appeal. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification, the APPS Com mittee d ecision is final. 73 An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern on the seventh (7th) day after receipt of not ification will not be conside red, and the decision of the APPS Com mittee will be considered f inal. The Dean doe s not meet wi th the stude nt prior to receiving the required written appeal mate rial, and the student must make no attempt to meet with the Dean immediately prior to the APPS Committee meeting or between the date of the APPS Committee meeting and the date of any potential appeal hearing. The Dean's decision is f inal. Procedur es for N on-Academic Matters Alleg ations of misconduc t may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty member, a djunct faculty member, staff member or supervisor of clinical - or service- related experiences . For issu es arising from H onor Code, Code of Misconduc t, or professionalism viola tions, person(s) identi fying the issue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs or the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs within seven (7 ) calendar days of the incident. The Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs or Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will collect document ation which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty or staff invol ved with the incid ent(s). In the case where students are reporti ng the suspe cted violation, unless required at a hearing, confide ntiality of the reporting student is maintain ed, and the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs or Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will present the reporting student's testim ony. Dated notes a re taken to des cribe the discussion. The Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs or Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs notifies the Asso ciate for Cl misconduc t or viol ation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Asso ciate D ean for Cl inical Integration then, (i) consti tutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspe cted misconduc t, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for A cademic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Com mittee. 74 Ad hoc Comm ittee Proced ures If referred to an ad hoc Committee, the Ch air of the ad hoc Commi ttee will schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee and n otify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") at least three (3) days prior to the hearing . This hearing typically is held as soon a s practical following the referral of the case to the ad hoc Commi ttee. The R espondent(s) shall me et with the ad hoc Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. A lthough the hearing's purpose is fact-finding, the Respondent(s) sh all have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his/her position. All s essions of the ad hoc Commi ttee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concern ed in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. The testimony of each witness is conduct ed in private w hile the other witnesses in the c ase are out of the room. After the ad hoc committee concludes its investig ation, they shall provide a written report to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs in a timely manner, that shall include a recommended finding of facts, and if the finding of facts is that a violation occur red, a recom mended sanction. If the recom mend ations a re that: 1. No violation oc curred, the V ice Dean f or Acad emic Affairs m ay accept the finding, and so not ify the Responde nts(s); 2a. No violation occu rred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees, he /she sh all decide upon an appropr iate sanction as set forth below and so not ify the Responde nts(s); 2b. No violation occu rred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees, he /she shall d ecide to forward the matter to the APPS Committee for further c onside ration; 3. A violation occur red, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs agrees with the finding and the sanction proposed by the ad hoc committee, and so notify the R espon dents(s); 4a. A violation occur red, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disag rees with the s anction proposed by the ad hoc committee, he/she shall decide upon an appropr iate s anction as set forth below, and so notify the Responde nts(s) ; 4b A violation occur red, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disag rees with the s anction, he/she shall decide to forward the matter to the AP PS Committee for fu rther conside ration on the s anction onl y. 75 The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs notifies the student in writing of his/her decis ion and: 1. If the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is No. 2a, 3, or 4a above and the R esponde nts(s) accepts the decis ion, the decis ion of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs shall be fin al; or 2. If the decis ion of Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is No. 2a, 3, or 4a above , and Responde nt(s) do not accept the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, the R esponde nt(s) has (have) the r ight to appeal the decis ion to t he APPS Committee. 3. If the decis ion of Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is No. 2b, or 4b above , the matter will be forwarded to the APPS Committee for further consideration. An appeal of the Vice Dean's decision to the APPS Committee by the student must be made in writing to the Vice Dean within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the Vice Dean at the time of the hearing. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification, the Vice Dean's decision is final. APPS Committee Procedures The recommendations of the ad hoc committee or the decis ion of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs are presented to the APPS Com mittee at the hearing. The Responde nt(s) shall meet with the APPS Com mittee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an oppor tunity to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. All sessions of the Committee are closed to all individuals except those immedi ately concerned in the cas e. No l egal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding.

All APPS Com mittee meeting m inutes and evidence are maintain ed in the Office of the Dean. 76 The decis ion of the APPS Committee shall be sent to the R esponde nt(s) in writing within seven (7) calen dar days of the AP PS decision. Upon receipt of not ification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decis ion, or signing the Notice of D ecision to appeal the decision. An appeal to the Dean must be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the ad hoc Com mittee, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or the AP PS Committee at the time of the hearing and be made in writing to the Dean with in seven (7) calend ar days of receipt of not ification. The Dean will reply within fourteen (14) calendar d ays of receiv ing the written appeal. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern on the seventh (7th) day after receipt of not ification will not be conside red, and the decision rendered by the AP PS Committee is fina l. The Dean doe s not meet wi th the stude nt prior to receiving the required written appeal mate rial, and the student must make no attempt to meet with the Dean from the date of the written appeal and the date of any potential appeal hearing. The Dean's decision is f inal. Rights of the R esponde nt With respect to a hearing regarding academic misconduct, an alleg ed viol ation of the student Honor Code, or the Code of Misconduct, and/or professionalism standards , the Student/ Responde nt(s) is g uarantee d the right to: a timely h earing, if requested receive notice of the allegation(s) at least three (3) days prior to the hearing a presumption of innocence un til proven guilty solicit advice expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential man ner appeal the decision to the Dean Deliberation of the ad hoc Com mittee or the APPS Committee shall take plac e in private and remain confidential, and the standard for a decis ion sh all be based on a preponde rance of the evidence (whether a violation is more likely than not to have occurred). If, based upon a preponde rance of the e videnc e, the ad hoc Com mittee recommends, or the AP PS Com mittee determines, the student was in violation of the Honor Code, the C ode of Misconduct, a CUSOM policy, or the professional standards of CUSOM, the ad hoc Committee may recom mend or the APPS Com mittee m ay render an appropriate s anction including, but not limited to: 77 Admonition: Student will receive a written warning. An Admoni tion will not become a part of the student 's longitudinal record. An Admoni tion may not be a ppealed b y the student . Academic Probation: Students may be placed on Academic Probation for a sp ecified time period, until the deficiency is rectified, or otherwise designated by the Dean. The record of each stude nt on A cademic Probation is reviewed at the end of the specified time period, to e valuate the studen t's academic progress and the APPS Committee makes any recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Probation. A cademic Probation will appear on the student's official tr anscript, along with the date the Academic Probation was rectified. Conduct Probation: Conduct Probation is levied for a specified time period, determin ed by the circumstances of the case. It carries with it a warning that any further violations of CUSOM r egulations will result in more serious disciplin ary act ion up to and including dismissal. Suspension: Suspension may be imposed for continued or flagrant violation of terms of a Dis ciplinary Probation, or it may be imposed directly in first- offense cases that w arrant such action. I n the case of Suspension, the student will be ineligible for financial aid and is barred from all c ampus and non - campus a ctivities. Suspension will appear on the student's transcript. o Any student may be pla ced on S uspension pe nding an investig ation into conduc IX violation s. Dismissal: Dismis sal from CUSOM MSBS is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Com mittee, with fin al app roval for dismissal by the Dean. Revocation of a Degree : T he revocation of the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree following graduation m ay occur for discovered misconduc t of the student(s) during his/her enrollment that would be grounds for dismissal at the time of the misconduct. In the event of the discovery of such misconduct, the former student will be given notice of a hearing before the APPS Committee in accordan ce with the procedures set forth herein for a violation of the Code of Misconduct, provided that the former student may be entitled to legal representation at the hearing or any appeal. Additional academic and professional sanctions may include, but are n ot limited to : Writing a paper; Receiving a gr ade reduction for an examination, assignment, or course; Repeating a course(s); Repeating an examination, coursework or even an entire academic semest er or year; Ineligibility for election to or removal from student office or organizational office for specified period of t ime; Withholdi ng of if dismis sed; 78 Prohibiting a student from enrolling for a specified period of time; or Restitution, whether monetary or by specific duties, or reimbursement for d amages to or misapp ropriation of CUSOM, s tudent, staff or faculty property. Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be a dministered regardless of wh ether the actions of the student are also civil or crimin al violations. Whenever disciplina ry actions lead to the student leaving CUSOM MSBS , grades are assigned in a ccordance with the CUS OM MSBS grading policy. In addition to the sanctions described above , the following actions may also be taken by the Dean in an appeal: Withdrawal: Withdrawal is the administra tive removal of a stude nt from a class or from C USOM MSBS and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial oblig ations to CUSOM MSBS . The withdrawn stude nt may also be barred from re-enrollment until specific conditions have been met. Dismissal from the program without the option to return. Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Com mittee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approve d extended leave or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional act ion or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. 5.10 Separation from CU SOM MSBS There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM MSBS : Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM MSBS . All current or former students returni ng an approved period away from CUSOM MSBS , suc h as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by the Office of Postbaccalaureat e Programs but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. 79 A subs et of the MSBS Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Assistant Academic Officer of the MSBS Program , and Director of Postbacca laureate Programs will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the stude nt must provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resum e the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curricul um is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled wit h a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum . Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A le ave of absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM MSBS which m ay not last longer than 180 calen dar days. Reasons f or a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds beyond 180 calen dar days, it will become a Withdr awal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs , who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Leave of Absence request. A Leave of Absence request requires compl etion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM MSBS issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of A bsence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the L eave of Absence request. 80 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean and m ay not last longer than 180 calen dar days. A Personal Leave of Absence is available to address situations such as a death of a spouse, child, or such other severe circumstance that would interrupt a student 's education. In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the stude nt must provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum. Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. Med ical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good acade mic standin g, who provide acceptable supporti ng document ation indicating a valid medi cal reason requiri ng a leave of less than 180 calendar days. Decisions regarding the granting of a medi cal leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calen dar days, if it extends beyond 180 calendar days it will become a Medi cal Withdr awal. In order to return from an approved medi cal leave, the stude nt must provide the Dean with doc umen tation from a physician approvi ng/releasing the student to return as a full time student in the c urriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to d etermine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum. 81 Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. Med ical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standi ng and who have an approved medi cal reason for a medi cal leave of absence that exceeds 180 calen dar days. A st udent returni ng from an approved Medical Withdrawal minimally must submit a Background Check and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs but no later than sixty (60) days prior t o the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deem ed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medi cal Withdrawal, the stude nt must also provide the Dean with doc umen tation from a physician approvi ng/releasing the student to return as a full time student in the c urriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of a student who ha s taken an approve d medical leave to determine wh ere the stude nt will resume the curriculum and to de termine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum. Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. Student Maternity Leave of Absence CUSOM adheres to, and follows, federal guidelines for granting leave for students who give birth while enrolled in the curriculum. A Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good acade mic standin g, who provide acceptable supporti ng document ation indicating the date of birth, a clearance from her treating physician and an expected date of return to CUSOM MSBS on a full - time, unrestricted basis. Decisions regarding the granting of a mater nity leave are determined by the Dean. 82 A Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calend ar days will require the student to file for a Medical Withdrawal. The student will meet with the Associ ate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated maternity leave. The student will provide the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs a proposed timeline of requested leave. Once the student delivers, the student will provide a medical note from her medical provider with an anticipated return- to-school date. This date should be the date when the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating physician places an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Based on the date or return to full -time status, the Associa te Dean for Biomedical Affairs will work with the Course Directors, Medical Education, Registrar, and Student Affairs to develop the Modified Schedule for the student . The student will meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and the Director of Postbaccalaureate Pr ograms to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will sign the Attestation section after any additional changes are made and agreed upon by all parties. The student will provide medical documentation to the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs from their medical provider documenting full medical clearance for return, including a definitive date of return. Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM MSBS is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM MSBS which m ay last longer than 180 calen dar days or permanent separation from CUSOM MSBS . Reasons for a withdrawal include, but are not limited to, persona l and medical. A Withdr awal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs , who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. The student must compl ete a Withdrawal Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM MSBS issued items to the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs before the stu dent wi ll be c onside red Withdrawn in Good S tanding. The date for a Withdr awal is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the withdrawal request. 83 The Dean makes the f inal decision regar ding Withdrawals. S tudents who disconti nue th eir education at CUSOM MSBS , for any reason , are requ ired to complete a With drawal Form. Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM MSBS issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing f rom CUSOM MSBS and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for re admission or issuance of a n official transcript if requested. Students on Suspension may not withdraw. Withdrawal must be completed prior to the beginning of the final course assessment. Failure to withdraw b y this date may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Semester , which will be recorded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. A student may not withdraw if a grade has been a ssigned or if a final examination or assessment event has been st arted. Withdrawal from a course or after an examination has been administered will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal from CUSOM MSBS , minimally must submit a Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by the Office of Postbaccalaureate Programs , but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deem ed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the t erms of the approved Withdrawal. A subs et of the MSBS Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Assistant Academic Officer of the MSBS Program and Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs , will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Once approved for return, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of the student in the c urriculum and to de termine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the c urriculum. 84 Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to volunt arily leave CUSOM MSBS for personal reasons.

As discussed in Section 5.8 of the Academic Bulletin, a Modified Cour se of Study (MCOS) is a credit-beari ng, individuali zed study plan for students who require an alternative educat ional pathway for reasons such as required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The institution of a MCOS will result in a delay in the student's graduation date. 87 Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student 's financial aid status or qua lification for education-based financial aid. Specific couns eling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of A cademic Affairs and the Univ ersity's Office of F inancial Aid for these or other ind icated situ ations. 5.13 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedur es Many students choos e to engage in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the fo rmal CUSOM MSBS curriculum such as during Semester breaks, summer break or weekends. S hadowing experiences can be extremely valuable and students may choos e to include these e xperiences in their Curriculum Vitae or personal statement. Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM -appoint ed clinical faculty memb ers or ph ysicians not affiliate d with C USOM . Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience ackno wledge they will do so while a dhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands-on activity occurs with patients, this should be limite d to patient examination onl y, approved by the patient and supe rvising physician, and MUST be r epeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to pe rform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to sutur ing, endotr acheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or centr al lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, r ectal and genitourinary system s. Students should not pe rform any ost eopathic manipulation while on sha dowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll University, Incorpora ted while engaged in physician sha dowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM-appointed faculty memb er. Students are required to let non- CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provide d by Campbell University, Incorporated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambul atory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or health care system poli cies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and comply with a ny applicable pol icies. 4. Indivi dual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is the refore the student's e thical and pr ofessional duty to ful ly explain their lev el of tr aining. 88 Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical F aculty M embers 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM clinical faculty must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form, (available from the Office of Clinical Affairs) c ompleted in its entirety, to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 3. Students m ust sign the f orm a nd initial all required attestations. 4. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing e xperience. Shad owing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the c linician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and background checks, i mmuniz ation records, acade mic performance info rmation or letters of recommendation. c. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University, Incorporated . d. Students acknowledge that Campbell University, Incorporated will not be liable for any medical care or expenses if they are to be injured or become ill during the clinical sha dowing experience. They also release Campbell University, Incorporated from any liability from any injury or illness that occurs during the shadowing experience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this doc ument. Violation of any conditions of this Shad owing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. 89 5.15 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are e ntitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic dut ies; but research for pecunia ry return must be based upon an unde rstanding with the authorities of the institution in adva nce of the accept ance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduc e into his teaching controve rsial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in w riting at the time of the appointment. The University faculty is a citizen, a memb er of a learned profession, and an officer of an educat ional institution. His/h er prim ary loyalty is to his/her institution, his /her profession, and his/her growth and d evelopm ent as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. S/he possesse s the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her posit ion as an employee of the Univ ersity; to be accurate, to exercise prope r restraint, to show respect for the opini ons of others, and to make every effort to indi cate that in his/her role as a citizen s/he is not an institutional spoke sman. Mor eover, s/he should allow for the fact that many me mbers of the general public will find it dif ficult to disasso ciate his /her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identificat ion. S/he should not use official university station ery, logos, watermarks or his /her inst itutional t itle in issuing public statements whi ch s/he makes purely in his/her role as a citizen. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronicall y (including use of Campbell University and/or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 90 6. MSBS CURRICULUM Academic Calendar Academic calen dars are made available to all students.

RESEARCH and SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY 9.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capacity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier fa culty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research and scholarly activity at CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 9.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive phi losophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically addresses student research and scholarly activities. CUSOM MSBS does require students to complete independent research project s and other scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation and part of the MSBS curriculum . Additionally , CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing extracurricular research and scholarly opportunitie s. Whereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in engaging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent. As such, student - researchers are provided with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty mentor. 9.3 Education in Research P rinciples Principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented in the Research Topics I and II courses during Years One and Two. Topics include general principles of research ethics, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSO M students in basic science and clinical research. Additional education opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities may be presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As active members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of complet ion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the research project will be provided by the research mentors. 114 9.4 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to present the results of their research through public ation and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publica tion of any research project conducted while a CUSOM MSBS student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and the Associate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must r eview and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any meeting. For manuscript submissions (case report, original research, or any other publication), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associ ate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journals for consideration of publication. The final poster, presentation or manuscript must be reviewed and approved by the faculty mentor and all listed co -authors. The author(s) and mentor should be up to date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these requirements will be considered professional misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS committee as described elsewhere in thi s publication. 9.5 Research Opportunities CUSOM MSBS students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to provide guidance for student s cholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity, and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that a faculty member appro ve all scholarly activity undertaken by students; however, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student - initiated project, the student must have a faculty sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance within University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 9.6 Research Symposi um Campbell University and CUSOM has a tradition of highlighting and showcasi ng student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to students, residents and faculty. The IPE research symposium is 115 an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well as projects from other healthcare fields. Every spring semester, second year MSBS students present posters of their independent research projects completed as part of the Capstone Project I -II courses at the MSBS Research Symposium. CUSOM MSBS students may also present posters and oral presentations at other local, regional and national events. 116 10. HONOR CO DE, CODE OF MIS CONDUCT, AND G RIEVANCE PROCEDURES 10.1 Honor Code The Campbell Univ ersity Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduc t (CUSOM Honor Code ) embodi es a spirit of mu tual trust, intellectual hone sty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell Univ ersity communities.

In such cases, the Director of Postbaccalaureate Programs , notifies the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs of the suspected violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affair s, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. A complete description of the process may be found in section 5.10 of the Academic Bulletin. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include , but is not limited to, the f ollowin g: a. Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without a ppropri ate authori zation or during inappropri ate times. b. Knowingly and purpos ely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student func tions of the CUSOM community. c.

Controll ed substance screening results are viewed in l ight of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, althoug h the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug En forcement Ag ency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University pol icy. Anothe r example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentr ation sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence charge.

Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. P lease note this includ es substances which are illegal in t he state of North Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states. Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of re spect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M.
