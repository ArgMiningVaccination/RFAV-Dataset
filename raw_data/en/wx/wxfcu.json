Chicago In her inaugural address, American Medical Association President Ardis Dee Hoven, MD, recalled how she was the only infectious diseases specialist in private practice in her community when AIDS was just appearing on the medical landscape. Over time, treating people with AIDS in Lexington, Ky., made a lasting impression on her. \"My AIDS patients and their family members taught me about strength, about courage and about never, ever passing judgment about something you do not understand,\" said Dr. Hoven, who also practices internal medicine. In the June 18 speech, she urged physicians to work together on issues such as medical liability reform, innovations in medical education and health care technology improvements. Among her other goals as the AMA's 168th president: Eliminate the sustainable growth rate doctor payment formula in Medicare, and focus on the Association's strategic plan. \"By standing together, unified in vision and commitment, physicians can shape the health care system this country needs,\" she said.

Strategic plan's progress At the meeting's opening session, AMA Executive Vice President and CEO James L. Madara, MD, gave delegates an update on the AMA's three-part strategic plan, which focuses on improving health outcomes, enhancing physician satisfaction and practice sustainability, and accelerating changes in medical education. The AMA is working to identify and support models of care delivery and payment that promote doctor satisfaction and practice sustainability. The Association is teaming up with RAND Health to conduct research on 30 practices in six states, with the goal of creating resources and tools that doctors can use to improve satisfaction and sustainability, Dr. Madara said. On June 14, the AMA unveiled the 11 medical schools that will receive funding over five years as part of the accelerating change in medical education initiative. The $11 million will go toward educational innovations such as increased use of health IT and models for competency-based student progression.
