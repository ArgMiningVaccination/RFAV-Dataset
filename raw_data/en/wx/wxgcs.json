Originally, Dr. Tom Cowan and I planned to talk about his lovely and nourishing vegetable powders, but this podcast took an entirely different turn towards the topic of whether viruses really exist, and I think you'll be quite surprised at the answer! Dr. Cowan has given countless lectures and workshops throughout the U.S. on a variety of subjects in health and medicine and is the author of six best-selling books, including [The Contagion Myth/The Truth About Contagion](https://amzn.to/3JpqTr9) co-authored by Sally Fallon Morell; [Cancer and the of Water;](https://amzn.to/3Lw5hLL) [Human Heart, Cosmic Heart;](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/human-heart) [Vaccines, Autoimmunity and the Changing Nature of Childhood Illness;](https://amzn.to/3uNqLhl) [The Nourishing Traditions Book of Baby and Child Care](https://amzn.to/3sCSeQ7) co-authored by Sally Fallon Morell; and [The Fourfold Path to Healing](https://amzn.to/3uMPiTr) (with Sally Fallon and Jaimen McMillan). From 1985 until 2019, Dr. Tom Cowan had a general-medical practice, first in upstate New York, then for 17 years in Peterborough, N.H., and for 17 years in San Francisco, until his recent retirement from active practice. He was a founding board member of the [Weston A. Price Foundation](http://www.westonaprice.org/) and continues to serve as its vice president. In the past five years, he launched two businesses along with his wife and two sons. The first, [Dr. Cowan's Garden](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/cowan), offers high-quality vegetable powders and kitchen staples; the second, [Dr. Tom Cowan, LLC](https://drtomcowan.com/) distributes information, hosts his popular webinar series, and offers many of the products he has used personally and in his practice. Dr. Tom Cowan attended Duke University, graduating in 1977 Summa Cum Laude with a degree in biology. He then served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Swaziland, Africa, from 1977 to 1980, teaching gardening in a secondary school. It was in Swaziland where he encountered the work of [Weston A. Price](http://www.westonaprice.org/) and [Rudolf Steiner](https://www.rudolfsteiner.org/), two of the greatest influences on his career. After the Peace Corps, he attended medical school in his home state of Michigan at the Michigan State College of Human Medicine, graduating in 1984. Dr. Cowan now lives with his wife, Lynda, on rural farmland in Upstate New York. He has three children, one stepson, and six thriving grandchildren. He is an avid gardener and recently added several sheep and barn kittens to his growing farmstead. In addition to this most recent conversation, Dr. Cowan has also joined me in the past for multiple podcast episodes, including: [Should You Or Your Kids Get Vaccinated?
