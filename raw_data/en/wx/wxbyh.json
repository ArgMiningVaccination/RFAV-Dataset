It classically presents with fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and multi-organ system failure. We describe a case of a 70-year-old male with this condition who had an atypical presentation of left chest wall pain and left shoulder pain after two mechanical falls along with hemodynamic stability. The patient rapidly deteriorated on his second hospital floor day, resulting in a higher complexity of care and management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite a number of resuscitative measures, therapies, and multidisciplinary care, the patient unfortunately passed away within 24 hours of his ICU care.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
