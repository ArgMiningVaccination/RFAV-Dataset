The new protocol introduces targeted TCM treatments for severe cases, and puts forward relatively complete therapeutic TCM solutions for children, said Jia Zhongwu from the national TCM administration at a Monday press conference. It clarifies the COVID-19 symptoms of child patients at different stages of infection, and gives corresponding TCM prescriptions and medicine instructions, Jia said. The 10th edition of the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 was issued on Friday, and it now treats COVID-19 as a conventional Class-B infectious disease.
