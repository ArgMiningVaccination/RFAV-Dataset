They're delicious and super good for you! Types of Foods to Support Immune System Fruits and vegetables: These are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which can help support the immune system. Some particularly good options include citrus fruits (such as oranges and grapefruits), berries (such as blueberries and raspberries), and leafy greens (such as spinach and kale). Whole grains: Whole grains, such as oats and quinoa, are rich in antioxidants and other nutrients that can help support the immune system. Protein-rich foods: Foods high in protein, such as chicken, fish, and eggs, are important for the growth and repair of cells in the body, including the cells of the immune system. Probiotics and prebiotics: Foods that contain probiotics, such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut, can help support the immune system by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Prebiotics, which are types of dietary fibers that promote the growth of good gut bacteria, can also be found in foods like garlic, onions, leek, asparagus and artichokes. Spices: Some spices have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and could be good for your immune system. For example turmeric, ginger, garlic, and cumin. Smoothies and Juices To Boost Immunity Smoothies and juices are always a great way to get good-for-you ingredients in your body. Try these and let me know what you think! Pin Immunity Boosting Shots These shots are made with oranges for a vitamin C boost plus fresh ginger and turmeric which have anti-inflammatory properties.

They don't call it the most important meal of the day for nothing. Berries high in vitamin C and dark berries like blackberries, strawberries and blueberries not only taste insanely great, but they are also a great source antioxidants.
