What Spikevax is and what it is used for Spikevax is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 disease caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to individuals aged 6 months and older. The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the SARS - CoV -2 Spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM -102 lipid nanoparticles. As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID -19. How the vaccine works Spikevax stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID -19. Spikevax uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given Spikevax The vaccine must not be given if - you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax if: - you have previously had a severe, life -threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Spikevax in the past. - you have any allergies - you have a very weak or compromised immune system 2 - you have ever fainted following any needle injection. - you have a bleeding disorder - you have a fever - you are pregnant or plan to be pregnant - you are breastfeeding - you have any serious illness - you have received another COVID -19 vaccine - if you have anxiety related to injections There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccin ation with Spikevax (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males . The chance of having this occur is very low. You should avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks after vaccination. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving Spikevax: Chest pain Shortness of breath Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax. As with any vaccine, the primary 2 -dose vaccination course of Spikevax may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected . Children Spikevax is not recommended for children aged under 6 months old. Other medicines and Spikevax Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. Spikevax may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Spikevax works. Immunocompromised individuals If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax. The efficacy of Spikevax even after a third dose may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close cont acts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Driving and using machines Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines. Spikevax contains sodium Spikevax contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and, that is to say, essentially 'sodium - free'. 3 3. How you will be given Spikevax Vaccination 0.10 mg/mL concentration Primary series It is recommended to get the second dose of the same vaccine 28 days after the first dose to complete the vaccination course. Children 6 months through 5 years of age two 0.25 mL injections Booster dose Individuals 18 years of age and older 0.5 mL If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax. If you miss an appointment for your primary 2nd dose of Spikevax - If you miss an appointment, arrange another visit as soon as possible with you doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. - If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID -19. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your upper arm. During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 30 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
