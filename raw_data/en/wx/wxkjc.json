President 's Scholarship Program is Georgia Tech 's premier merit-based scholarship. Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective, the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in academic and leadership per - formance and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers four levels of awards. For the students who entered Georgia Tech as freshmen in fall of 2006, the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: $60,000 and $30,000. To apply for the President 's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by October 31 of their senior year. The most qualified applicants in terms of high school grades, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is sent a supplemental application in December and interviewed by a Regional Committee in January. Approximately 100 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President 's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.Table 4.8 President's Univ. 294 2. Univ. of Florida* 257 3. Univ. of Texas at Austin* 250 4. Washington Univ. in St. Louis 241 5.

This unit offers the traditional Cooperative Plan of education as well as Undergraduate Professional Internships, Graduate Co-op Program, and the Work Abroad Program. The Co-op option has been offered to undergraduates since 1912, and is the fourth oldest program of its kind in the world. It is a five-year, totally optional plan for undergraduates who wish to combine career-related experience with classroom studies. Students who enroll in this program alternate between industrial assignments and classroom studies on a semester basis, taking the same course work on the campus that is completed by regular students. Graduates of the program are awarded a degree in their field with the designation \"Co- operative Plan.\" The Co-op Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education, and for five consecutive years has been listed as one of the top 10 \"Programs that Work\" by U.S. News & World Report . Students who participate in Co-op have the opportunity to develop career interests, become more confident in their career choices, and develop human relation skills through their work experiences. Since all Co-op positions are paid, students are able to save a portion of their salaries to apply toward educational expenses. Approximately 600 employers participate throughout the U.S. and internationally. With average starting salaries over $13 per hour for students, the aggregate amount earned last year by all co-ops was about $18 million. The Undergraduate Professional Internship (UPI) program had its first students participating in the Spring Semester 2003. This program is geared toward those students who, for some reason could not or did not participate in Co-op, but desire some career-related experience before graduation. Aimed mainly at rising juniors and seniors, hundreds of students have been able to take advantage of the UPI program since its inception. UPI students may work any semester of the year and maintain full-time student status. As part of the International Plan which began at Georgia Tech in 2005, the Work Abroad Program was established to provide students op- portunities to practice their respective professions outside the United States, and be immersed into a different culture. Being able to gain relevant work experience in a totally different environment is extremely rewarding, and can be very challenging. Over three dozen students have taken advantage of this program in the last year, working at approximately 30 different employers. Countries of employment include: Germany, Japan, China, Spain, Singapore, France, and several others. A full-time coordinator and administrative staff are in place to assist students both on the undergraduate and graduate level who are interested in obtaining this type of experience.

Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. Dan Radakovich, a veteran of two decades of athletic administration, was named Georgia Tech 's seventh Director of Athletics last Febru - ary. The list of his predecessors includes four of the most honored men in collegiate athletics history: John Heisman, for who football's Heisman Trophy was named, William Alexander, Bobby Dodd and Dr. Homer Rice. Radakovich succeeded Dave Braine who retired after nine years at the Institute. Radakovich oversees 17 intercollegiate sports and administrative departments including the Total Person Program, compliance, business, development, finance, ticketing, marketing, sports information, sports medicine and strength and condi- tioning. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletic program at Tech. The GT Athletic Association is overseen by its Board of Trustees, chaired by the president of the Institute, Dr. G. Wayne Clough, and composed of eight faculty members, three alumni members, and four student members. Since 1904, Tech has had only 11 head football coaches: John Heisman, Bill Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodgers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O 'Leary, and the present coach, Chan Gailey. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990, and the Yellow Jackets have the nation 's second-best record in bowl games at 22-12. Other major athletic highlights include NCAA Final Four appearances by the Tech men's basketball team in 2004 and 1990, a NWIT women 's basketball title in 1992, three College World Series berths in baseball and 12 top 10 national finishes by the Tech golf program. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history are Grand Slam winner Bobby Jones, Masters champion Larry Mize, British Open champion David Duval as well as Stewart Cink, Matt Kuchar and Bryce Molder Morris, Randy Rhino, Maxie Baughan, Marco Coleman, Shawn Jones and 1999 Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton in football. Georgia Tech's track and field Olympians include: Derrick Adkins, Antonio McKay, Derek Mills, Angelo Taylor and Chaunte Howard. Several current Major League Baseball stars with Tech ties are: Nomar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek, Mark Teixeira and Yunkus, Mark Price, John Salley, Stephon Marbury, Matt Harpring and Chris Bosh. Tech 's facilities rank among the finest in college athletics. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, one of America 's oldest and most recognized football venues, has undergone an expansion and renovation project that raised its capacity to 55,000. Tech boasts the new Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium, site of NCAA Regional and Super Regional play in 2006 and previous years. Alexander Memorial Coliseum, also known as The Thrillerdome, is home to the men 's and women 's basketball teams. The 2006 NCAA Men 's Swimming and Diving Championships were held in the Aquatic Center, which was also home to Olympic swimming and diving events during the 1996 Olympic Games. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Athletic Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, sports medicine facilities, and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. The Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance is the home of the Total Person program, the best of its kind in the United States. The Center is comprised of seven sports performance and wellness clinics. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, regarded as one of the finest collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a good citizen.

Source: Office of Sponsored Programs\u00183\u00182006 Georgia Tech Fact Book RESEARCH Source: Office of Sponsored ProgramsSPONSORED PROGRAMS The Vice Provost for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has the responsibility for all research programs conducted by the Geor - gia Institute of Technology and works with the deans, chairs, directors, and other department heads in establishing research policies and procedures. In partnership with the Office of the President, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) and its subsidiary, Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTARC), the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) provides program development as- sistance as well as overall contract management for the sponsored research program at Georgia Tech. Organizationally, OSP reports to the Associate Vice Provost for Research who also serves as the General Manager for GTRC and GTARC. The Associate Vice Provost for Research is responsible, in cooperation with Grants and Contracts Accounting, for negotiating facilities and administrative (indi - rect) cost rates. Also, the Office of the Associate Vice Provost is responsible for the design and maintenance of an interactive automat- ed database which integrates all contract administration functions and is used for management control and reporting. The database is used to produce a variety of periodic management reports including: a) a monthly report of all sponsored activity, b) a monthly report of cost-sharing commitments, c) listings of all upcoming deliverables, and d) an overdue deliverables report. In addition, specialized (ad hoc) reports are prepared on request. Prior to funding, OSP provides assistance that leads to the submission of formal proposals. OSP is responsible for submitting all proposal and grant applications for sponsored research and instruction from GTRC, GTARC and the Georgia Institute of Technol - ogy. Contracting officers review proposals and cost estimates for compliance with sponsor requirements and Institute policies, and prepare the business portion of proposals. Contracting officers serve as the sponsor's point of contact for business matters during the evaluation process, negotiate the final terms of the contract or grant, and sign, in conjunction with an officer of GTRC or GTARC, the resulting agreement. After sponsored research projects are funded, OSP has the responsibility for monitoring active grants and contracts. Upon receipt of a signed agreement, an initial in-depth review of the award documents takes place and relevant initiation forms are prepared and distributed. Complete project files are established and maintained for the duration of the program. All post-award project modifications to existing programs are processed by OSP. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and monitoring of subcontracts and consulting agreements issued by Georgia Tech under sponsored programs. Liaison with project sponsors is maintained by OSP Contracting Of - ficers through responses to contractual situations or requests on day-to-day administrative matters. Responsibilities include monitoring programs to see that potential problems in meeting contractual obligations (i.e., assurance of satisfactory performance, submission of all deliverables, etc.) are called to the attention of Georgia Tech management in a timely manner. OSP is responsible for all contractual closeout actions, i.e., submission of final billing and research property and patent reports, accounting for the disposition of classified documents, and verification that deliverable requirements have been satisfied. OSP distributes all proposals, tracks project deliver- ables and serves as the filing center for deliverable reports, pending receipt of final reports and subsequent submission to the Archives section of the Georgia Tech Library. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and administration of Small Business Administration (SBA) subcontracting plans. Research Administration, Communications, Training, and Technologies (ReACTT) within OSP furnishes specialized educational, in - formational, and technological support to research administrators and faculty. ReACTT hosts an annual New Faculty Orientation, dur - ing which numerous resources are identified for new faculty. An NSF CAREER panel is offered yearly for young faculty. Specialized conferences and other educational opportunities, such as webcast and video conferences, NCURA's SPA I and SPA II, Export Control Summit, and presentations by the National Institutes of Health and the National Academies of Science, are managed by ReACTT. The Research Administration Buzz (RAB) is supported by ReACTT and provides professional development and networking opportunities to departmental research administrators. RAB contributes to the development of policies and practices that fairly reflect the mutual interests and separate obligations of both departmental and central research administration. ReACTT also sponsors Departmental Certification in Sponsored Programs, which is targeted to academic department administrators who perform pre- and post-award functions. Candidates for certification must successfully complete a series of workshops and pass a written examination. Coursework is coordinated and/or presented by ReACTT. A newsletter, Research News, is published monthly and is also posted to the internet. ReACTT maintains several web sites, including the Office of Sponsored Programs, the Office of Research Compliance, the Office of Technology Licensing, and www.export.gatech.edu. As gatekeeper for the COS database, ReACTT provides faculty with assistance in maintaining their COS profiles and in using the COS funding opportunity database. As the focal point for electronic research admin- istration for sponsored projects, ReACTT maintains Georgia Tech's access to Grants. gov, NSF FastLane, NIH Commons, and other federal electronic proposal submission systems. ReACTT also develops innovative resources to assist faculty, such as the Grants.gov proposal upload site and the budget wizard template. \u00183\u00182006 Georgia Tech Fact Book RESEARCH Support Amount Table 8.6 GTRC Sponsored Research Contracting Operations, Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006Revenue 2005 2006 Source: GTRC Associate Vice Provost and General ManagerFounded in 1937, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) is a state chartered not-for-profit corporation serving Georgia Tech as a University System of Georgia approved cooperative organization.
