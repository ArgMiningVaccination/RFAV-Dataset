Such sweet, therapeutic scents. It's likely you've seen these oils advertised on Instagram or sitting in a neat row on the shelf of a local store. They've grown more popular over the years for their aromatic strengths. But the influence of essential oils goes beyond the casing of a diffuser. They are largely beneficial for not only the mind, but the body and the soul. Essential oils are extracted from different plants and seeds. They have deep historic roots and a spiritual significance in many cultures and religions. When used right, essential oils can be powerful tools for elevation, amplification, and relaxation. Mixing essential oils with chiropractic care can boost the release of physical and mental tensions. Here are four essential oils guaranteed to enhance your chiropractic treatment. Lavender Lavender has been used for centuries. It's thought to originate in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and India, however its influence is known across the globe. Lavender's beautiful, floral smell has been culturally tagged the scent of love. But in recent years, it has made headlines as nature's golden tool for relaxation. Lavender's calming effect makes it a perfect ingredient for soothing any anxiety prior to a chiropractic treatment. It can also strengthen relief after a session, easing the mind to be one with itself and in the present moment. Marjoram Ah, sweet, sweet marjoram! This lovely oil, like lavender, is originally grown in the Mediterranean. Known as a spiritual ingredient for protection and peace, marjoram is an oil that can release the body of physical pain, such as aches and tensions. Easing muscle spasms and joint relief are additional effects. Eucalyptus Native to Australia and the islands surrounding it, eucalyptus is another popular oil used today. Like lavender, it's known for the soothing effect it has on the mind and body. Those with anxiety often use it as a chest rub or sprinkle a few drops on their pillows. But eucalyptus also has a cooling effect on the muscles. The oil is known to reduce inflammation and pains. Ginger A personal favorite, ginger is a darling oil from southern China and grows throughout the majority of Asia. Ginger is known for its healing properties, often used for sickness. Boiling ginger water, for example, has often been a family antidote for remedying a queasy tummy and sore throat. Opposite of eucalyptus, ginger tends to warm aching muscles. It's an oil specially used for pain relief. But Before You Try, Respect the Culture It's important to note that before trying any essential oil, pay respects to its higher significance. Many oils, such as ginger and eucalyptus, have a sacred cultural importance that should be understood and respected. Aside from doing some homework on its origins, uses, etc., make sure it comes from an authentic source. Things like supporting fair trade ensures these powerful oils are used responsibly and not being exploited. Chiropractic care is a treatment seeking to relieve the body of pain and align it with the mind. Essential oils have the power to unify both the mind and body, but also the soul. Mixing chiropractic care and essential oils is an all-purpose amplifier, a method of healing everyone must try!
