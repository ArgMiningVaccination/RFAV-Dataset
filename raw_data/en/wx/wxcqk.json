Especially when it comes to your mental health and sense of well-being, doctors are still limited in their approach. Instead of relying on prescriptions, you should give crystal healing a try. Crystals contain healing and purifying energies which can cleanse your body and environment. Even if the negative energy and thoughts are coming from your own mind and soul, there are crystals that can help you expunge those crippling afflictions. Here's a guide on how to use crystals most effectively, as well as our top 10 list of the crystals for positive energy and overall happiness. Crystal Maintenance: Cleansing, Charging, and Wearing When you first get a crystal, whether it is from the store or a friend, it's always a good idea to cleanse it before use. Crystals are great at collecting energy, which is the property used to protect you from negative influences. They can get full, though, and when that happens, they must be cleansed in order to work at their maximum potential again. To cleanse your crystal, leave it overnight buried in sea salt, on a clear and empty tabletop. The salt will absorb the impurities locked within the crystal, leaving it fresh and ready to protect you from negative energy. Alternatively, you can pass crystals through sage or [smudge stick](https://exemplore.com/misc/How-To-Use-A-Smudge-Stick) smoke to release pent-up vibrations. To recharge your crystal you also have a few options. One is to leave the crystal in direct sun or moonlight, or to bury it in the ground to let it reclaim the healing powers of the earth. It should only take a day or two to recharge crystals this way. You may also meditate with your crystal, directing your thoughts, needs, and desires into it with deep, forceful breaths. Wear your crystal as a piece of jewelry or keep it in your pocket. Know, however, that direct contact with the skin allows crystals to work the strongest. Placing crystals over your [major chakra points](http://www.artofliving.org/seven-centers-energy-chakras) during meditation is another favored method of crystal healing. The Best Crystals for Happiness and Positive Energy 1. Turquoise Whenever someone is complaining of general malaise, turquoise is the first stone I recommend. Turquoise has long been prized for its inspirational influence, [bringing feelings of peace, ease, and satisfaction to the wearer](http://fengshui.about.com/od/Crystals/qt/Turquoise-in-Feng-Shui-and-Jewelry.htm). Turquoise tends to have an emboldening effect in social situations, making you feel more extroverted. This stone is so powerful it often influences others around you, too. 2. Rose Quartz So often our happiness is shattered by problems in love. Rose quartz promotes healthy romantic relationships, allows you clarity of judgment when viewing other people, and can even make you love yourself. For self-loathing, and especially for ill moods due to poor romantic outlook, use rose quartz to start healing. 3. Quartz Quartz is a panacea among crystals, used for its powerful purifying effects. The purity of this crystal destroys all negative energy around it and stores positive intentions, thoughts, and other important vibrations. It helps clear your mind, and allows you to focus with renewed inspiration on the most positive aspects of your life. 4. Onyx Onyx works similarly to quartz, but instead of dispelling negative energy, it absorbs it. Onyx has the incredibly power to change this negative energy into lucky, fruitful energy that can turn bad situations into blessings. Use onyx to eliminate lingering ailments or negative thoughts and to make the most out of unhealthy situations. 5. Amethyst If things beyond your control bring you anxiety or sadness, amethyst is often used to regain balance. Coming to terms with your abilities and overcoming grief are never easy, but amethysts emit a calming aura which centers us. By allowing us to [regain clarity, self-confidence and peace](http://www.gemstonebuzz.com/meaning/amethyst), you can trust amethyst to brighten even your darkest times. 6. Fluorite Are you struggling to find purpose in your life? Are you unable to focus on what's really important? Fluorite helps bring us back to reality with newfound clarity and vision after a long time of searching. Fluorite can help artists and other introspective types from bouts of doubt and lack of inspiration. 7. Jade Jade is as beautiful as it is a powerful healing tool. Wearing jade will contribute to your mental clarity, emotional calm, and physical well-being. Wearers will find themselves more patient, more open to new ideas and feeling as though their bodies had been detoxified. 8. Citrine It is a yellow stone that reflects & refracts bright lights [bringing abundant happiness to the wearer](http://www.energymuse.com/blog/crystals-for-happiness-positivity/). If you've ever been envious of children with their carefree attitudes and lust for life, citrine can help you relive those days again. This motivational crystal empowers you both mentally and physically, giving you that \"I can take over the world!\" feeling all over again. Lack of energy will never be a problem with citrine. 9. Lapis Lazuli Lapis lazuli is a stone fit for a king, which makes sense because it can give you a kingly sense of wisdom and grace. If you suffer from social anxiety, lapis lazuli will help you find clarity, gain confidence and find the proper way to approach every tricky situation. 10. Tiger Eye Similar to lapis lazuli, tiger eye gives you an inner strength and confidence that radiates outward, altering your perspective. Specifically, you're better equipped to deal with confrontation and unexpected negative energy and will find yourself shrugging off instances which in the past would have ruined your whole day. Now that you have a better understanding of the best crystals for positive energy and happiness, feel free to mix and match them as you please, or choose just one that best suits your needs. When choosing crystals at the store, always go with your intuition and remember to cleanse them once you get home. Featured photo "}
