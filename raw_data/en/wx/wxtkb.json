Today 30% of respondents who suffered from an ailment within the past year claim to have used a homeopathic or herbal remedy to treat it. And there is more good news for the homeopathic and herbal remedies sector, as Mintel forecasted sales to increase to $7.5 billion by 2017 as more Americans become proactive about their health. Further growth is fueled by availability of these products in mass retailers. \"Recalls of traditional OTC (over-the-counter) remedies, a holistic approach to health and more availability in traditional retailers all helped to fuel growth in this market,\" said Emily Krol, health and wellness analyst at Mintel. \"The sector is primed for continued success as U.S. consumers increasingly seek products that are natural and organic, particularly as it relates to healthcare. This is especially true for families with small children as many OTC medications are unsafe for children under the age of two. \"Those who trust homeopathic medications are more likely to eat a healthier diet,\" she continued. \"Additionally, they are more likely to eat natural and organic foods and are willing to invest in these products. Those who trust homeopathic medicines are also more likely to be preventative about their healthcare. They visit the doctor regularly and take vitamins to prevent illness.\" However, less than 25% of OTC users agree that they trust homeopathic and herbal remedies to relieve their symptoms, suggesting that many people do not use these products because they do not believe they will be effective. Among users of homeopathic and herbal remedies though, this increases to about half (48%). \"The fact that so many users of homeopathic remedies are confident about them relieving their symptoms suggests that once people have used these products and experienced the effectiveness, they may be more inclined to use them in the future. Therefore, a key marketing message to convince non-users to try these products, such as including users talking about their positive experiences with the products, could prove effective,\" Ms. Krol said.
