PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS We, St. Peter's Health Partners and CHE Trinity Health, serve together in the spirit of the gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities. Founded in community -based legacies of compassionate healing, we provide the highest quality comprehensive continuum of integrated health care, supportive housing and community services, especially for the needy and vulnerable. THE COLLEGE OF NURSING The mission of St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing is to prepare students for entry into the profession of nursing as competent, caring practitioners. HISTORY Albany St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing has been educating and preparing students for fulfilling careers in nursing for more than a century. Initially known as the Training School of the Homeopathic Hospital of Albany, it was the first in record to be registered with the New York State Board of Regents, graduating the first class in 1906. The names of the hospital and school were ch anged in 1923 establishing the Memorial Hospital School of Nursing. In 2015 the name was changed to Memorial College of Nursing. In 2019, the name was changed to St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. The St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department. The curriculum adheres to the National League for Nursing's Educational Outcomes of Associate Degree Nursing Programs. St. Peter's Hospital is certified by the New York State Department of Health. PHILOSOPHY WE BELIEVE The practice of nursing is... An art and science Dedicated to promoting, maintaining, restoring and supporting health and well -being of individuals living and dying Holistic Caring Accountable: legally, ethically and morally The application of theoretical knowledge, reasoning, and technical competence Accepting and respecting individuals regardless of religion, race, creed, color, age, gender, culture, ability, mental status, or socioeconomic status, or political affiliation Partnership with: Individuals and significant others with actual or potential health needs and Health care team members 6 Education... Is a partnership involving shared accountability between faculty and students. Requires open, honest and timely communication by faculty and students. Recognizes students' unique abilities, life experiences, and learning preferences. Is committed to providing a variety of resources and active learning experiences to support individual learning preferences and rates. Builds from simple to complex. A minimum level of competency is critical before progressing in a sequential curriculum. Given additional time and resources, students establish a stronger foundation from which to build. In consultation with faculty, students identify corrective measures necessary to move to a higher level of competence and negotiate the time needed. Flourishes in an environment in which there is freedom of expression, creativity, and innovation. Is a lifelong endeavor. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The nursing community of St. Peter's Health Partners has adopted Jean Watson's theory of Human Caring/Caring Science as their theoretical framework for Nursing practice. As a member of this community, the College subscribes to this theory. Watson's Refined Carative Processes 1 include: Practice of loving- kindness/compassion and equanimity with self/other Being authentically present; enabling belief system and subjective world of self/other Cultivating own spiritual practices; beyond ego- self to authentic transpersonal presence Sustaining a loving, trusting, and caring relationship Allowing for the expression of feelings' authentically listening and \"holding another person's story for them\" Creative solution seeking through caring processes, full use of self; all ways of knowing/doing/being; engage in artistry of human caring- healing practices and modalities Authe ntic teaching- learning within context of caring relationship; stay within other's frame of reference; shift toward health- healing -wellness coaching model. Creating healing environment at all levels; physical/nonphysical, subtle environment of energy, consc iousness, wholeness, beauty, dignity, and peace are potentiated Reverentially and respectfully assisting with basic needs, holding an intentional, caring consciousness of touching the embodied spirit of another as sacred practice, working with life force/life energy/life mystery of another Opening and attending to spiritual, mysterious, unknown, and existential dimensions of all the vicissitudes of life, death, suffering, pain, joy, transitions life change; \"allowing for a miracle\" All of this is presuppos ed by a knowledge base and clinical competence Furthermore, the theoretical framework is informed by our understanding of the work of Patricia Benner. Benner theorized that nurses must have a strong foundation of knowledge and develop expertise through r epeated practice and breadth of experience. It is our intent 7 that students attain a sound theoretical basis and have ample opportunity to develop competence in nursing practice sufficient to prepare them for entry into practice. Finally, all faculty mem bers are encouraged to reflect on the work of many nursing theorists and are supported in their incorporation of relevant components of these theories. 8 OVERVIEW CURRICULUM GOALS The curriculum is prepared by the faculty with the following goals in mind: Graduate a caring, accountable nurse, adaptable to a variety of settings and changing environments.

If the repeating student is unsuccessful in a second attempt, the student will be academically dismissed. If the repeating student is successful he/she will be listed in good academic standing. Failure of a subsequent nursing course or semester will result in academic dismissal. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student may only attempt any given course twice. After two unsuccessful attempts at the same course, t he student will be dismissed. A grade of less than B is considered to be failure of a nursing course. A grade of less than C is considered to be failure of a non- nursing course. A student who is not approved to repeat a failed nursing course is academically dismissed. Failure of a second course in any nursing, science or non- science support course category will result in academic dismissal . See examples below: 1. If a student fails A&P I and subsequently fails Micro, then he/she will be dismissed. 2. If a student fails PSY 100 and then fails the English elective, he or she will be dismissed. 3. If a student fails NSG 1 and subsequently fails NSG V, then he/she will be dismissed. 23 Dismissal will result for those students who have failed a nursing course at any other school of nursing, including our sister school, if they fail ONE nursing course at this school. Dismissed students are not eligible for readmission. ACADE MIC DISMISSAL WAIVER An academic dismissal waiver will be considered if personal circumstances, unexpected crisis or hardship is encountered by the student leading to the failure. A faculty member, advisor or student services representative MUST have been informed of these circumstances prior to the end of the course. WITHDRAWAL (see below for Nursing or HVCC course withdrawal) Withdrawal is designed for students who are unable to continue with a course(s) in any given semester. Students may withdraw from one course or course category only once without academic penalty. A subsequent withdrawal will at least result in Academic Probation and may result in dismissal. A third withdrawal from a course will result in dismissal. Each semester , a last date to withdrawal without penalty is published. The nursing course withdrawal deadline will be different from the HVCC withdrawal deadline . If a stu dent withdraws on or before the date published as the \"last day to withdraw\" the student will receive a W. Withd rawals will not be allowed after the published withdrawal date. Any withdrawal after the refund period has ended does not qualify for a refund. See page 75 for the Refund schedule. Please refer to Refund Schedule for the financial consequences of withdrawing from a course. A withdrawal prior to 60% completion of the semester may result in repayment of financial aid taken for the semester. Please speak with the Financial Aid Director before finalizing your withdrawal form. WITHDRAWAL FROM NURSING COURSES Students who wish to withdraw from a nursing course must meet with the Dean of Student Services, the Bursar, and the Financial Aid Director to complete a nursing course withdrawal form . It is also recommended that the student discuss withdrawal with his/her academic advisor and course chair. Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the beginning of the semester, must withdraw from the nursing course and may withdraw from the co- requisite course(s). Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses a the end of the semester, may be permitted to continue in the nursing course and with draw from the co- requisite course(s). In this instance, the decision is made by the Dean on a case- by-case basis. The effective date of the withdrawal will be the date the form is submitted to Student Services with all required signatures. A student on academic probati on cannot repeat a course that he/she withdrew from without the approval of the Admissions and P rogression Committee. To repeat, the student must submit a \" Nursing Course Repeat Request\" form. 24 WITHDRAWAL FROM HUDSON VALLEY COURSES Withdrawal policies of Hudson Valley Community College are applied to courses taken at that school. Please review the Hudson Valley Community College Catalog regarding their Grading Policy and other implications of withdrawing from a course. Students must refer to the Hudson Valley Community College catalogue and calendar each semester for specific information regarding policies on registration, registration changes, tuition and grading. Students must complete an HVCC withdrawal form available from Student Services . The form must be completed and signed by Student Services and the student must take the form directly to the Registrar's Office at HVCC for the change to go into effect. PLEASE NOTE: All withdrawals from HVCC courses MUST be approved by the Student Services Office at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. INCOMPLETE GRADE At the completion of a nursing course, a student may be granted an \"incomplete\" letter grade when course requirements have not been met and a learning plan has been established and agreed upon wi th course faculty. The incomplete letter grade must be redeemed within TWO WEEKS following the end of the semester or the grade converts to \"F\". In exceptional circumstances, the student may apply for an extension through the Dean. Incomplete grades in support courses are subject to the policy of Hudson Valley Community College or the institution at which the support course is taken. LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA): The LOA policy allows students to interrupt continuous enrollment for one semester with out having to re -apply for enrollment and without changing conditions of their academic program. The Leave of A bsence policy covers interruptions in studies for personal, financial, medical, or military reasons and is meant to ensure program completion within a 3 -year time period . Exceptions to the time limit may be granted by the Dean of the CON or Dean of Student Services under extenuating circumstances. Students who wish to obtain a LOA must complete an application for a Leave of Absence form with Student Services. Student Services notifies the B ursar and the F inancial Aid Coordinator. Students will be contacted to register by Student Services during the advisement period of t he semester prior to their re- enrollment. REPEATING A NURSING COURSE AT OUR SISTER SCHOOL The student who repeats a nursing course at Samaritan Hospital will continue to be a student at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. Failure of a subsequent nursing course will result in academic dismissal, whether the repeated course is taken at Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing or at St. Peter's Hospital Colle ge of Nursing. The student's transcript will show the course taken at the host school, with the actual grade rec orded and computed into the student's GPA. ACADEMIC RECORD Students receive a grade report at the end of each semester. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by adding the quality points achieved by the student in each course and dividing the sum by t he total number of credit hours for those courses. 25 If a failed course is repeated, the original grade will always appear on the transcript. The new grade will be used to calculate the GPA, and will be shown as repeated. Any non- nursing grades below a C - are not accepted for transfer credit and do not earn whatever quality points are awarded by Hudson Valley Community College. Transferred courses are not assigned quality points and are not calculated in cumulative averages. MASTERY LEARNING This is a process designed to assist students in attaining the highest level of competency by recognizing learning style preferences and variations in time to acquire a deeper understanding. The curriculum builds from simple to complex. To support a stronger foundation, all students are required to attain a minimum of 80% or better in all nursing courses. If a student does not meet the minimum standard on a nursing exam, he/she must complete corrective measures, as discussed with that student's faculty. 26 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ATTENDANCE Scheduled learning experiences are designed to enhance each student's success and support deeper understanding. Attendance at classroom/lecture, all clinical, lab and observational learning experiences is required. Students are responsible for reporting late arrival or any planned or unplanned absence. Students are required to notify the clinical site and the clinical instructor when they will be late or absent. Additional information about notification of absences will be provided in each individual course orientation by the course chair. (See Attendance Policy) When a student is absent for three or more days as a result of an extended illness or has undergone childbirth or surgery of any kind, a written release from the student's health care provider must be provided to indicate the student's readiness to return to scheduled classroom and/or clinical experiences. Excessive absences, multiple failures to report absences, or lateness may result in course failure and/or termination from the program (see Dismissal Policy). Students at risk will be advised accordingly and informed in writing of actions that may be taken . CLINICAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIEN CES In addition to course work at the College of Nursing, students will be assigned to clinical learning experiences at other health care agencies in the Capital District. These agencies may include, but are not limited to the following: St. Peter's Hospi tal, S amaritan Hospital, St. Margaret's, The Eddy Cohoes Rehabilitation Center, Heritage House or other agencies. These assignments will be scheduled during day and/or evening hours on weekdays and/or weekends. PREPAREDNESS FOR CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERI ENCES Students are responsible for coming to clinical learning experiences prepared to participate in those experiences. Inadequate preparation may result in a faculty member denying an unprepared student the opportunity to participate in the learning experience (dismissed from the clinical setting for that day). Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. 27 EVALUATION OF CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Data or information used to formulate the student's clinical evaluation may include, and may not be limited to, the following sources: direct observations by the student's clinical faculty, patient statements, the student's written care plans and assignments, the student's demonstration/performance of psychomotor skills, the student's ability to discuss human illness or conditions, the student's ability to plan and provide organized, safe, efficient nursing care for same, the student's ability to provide patient teaching, the student's participation in clinical conferences, review of the student's documentation in the medical record, the student's professional behavior and appearance, and statements from other members of the health care team and preceptors' (if any) evaluations College of Nursing administration and faculty and/or members of the heath care team. CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE MAKE -UP Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. Make- ups will be scheduled at the convenience of the faculty, but are not guaranteed. Students who miss more than one clinical experience will be required to make up the clinical experience at the end of the semester after the final exam. In that case, s tudents will be assessed additional fees to augment expenses related to make up experiences beyond routine scheduling or semester calendars. The fees will be billed by the Bursar and payment must be m ade within 10 business days. Due to the uniqueness of some learning experiences, certain clinical make -ups may not be possible. After an absence, arrangements for make- ups of any type of missed experiences should be done in a timely manner with the faculty . Excessive absence or lateness may result in an administrative termination from the program and/or may be reason for course failure. Some clinical experiences begin at 7 a.m. or during evening hours or on weekends. If a clinical learning experience is cancelled, it may be rescheduled at a later date. 28 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR MEETING OUTCOMES IN THE CLINICAL PORTION OF A NURSING COURSE A student who successfully meets outcomes...

We strive to provide students with the knowledge, skills, judgment, and wisdom they need to function in societ y as educated adults. By accepting admission into the College of Nursing, the student affirms the commitment to uphold the values of the School's Honor Code and the standards of the nursing profession. Academic integrity at the St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing, Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing, a nd St Peter's Health Partners is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every faculty member and s tudent belongs to a community of professionals where academic integrity is a fundamental commitment. DEFINITIONS Academic Integrity is defined in terms of a commitment to five fundamental values and to the principles that flow from those values. At the College of Nursing, five values are fundamental to the academic process: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integrity is the commitment to stand up for these five values, even in the face of adversity. Academic Dishonesty is defined as any action or practice that provides the potential for an unfair advantage to one individual or one group. Academic dishonesty includes misrepresenting facts, fabricating or doctoring data or results, representing another's work o r knowledge as one's own, disrupting or destroying the work of others, or abetting anyone who engages in such practices. Academic dishonesty is not absolute because the expectations for collaboration vary. In some courses, for example, students are ass igned to work on team projects. In others, students are given permission to collaborate on homework projects or to have written materials present during an examination. Unless otherwise specified, however, the College of Nursing requires all work to be t he result of individual effort, performed without the help of other individuals or outside sources. If a question arises about the use of external materials that may be used or the amount of collaboration that is permitted for a given task, each individua l involved is responsible for verifying the rules with the appropriate faculty before engaging in collaborative activities, using external materials or accepting help from others. 32 Actions constituting violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: Plagiarism : the use of another's work, ideas, data, or product without appropriate acknowledgment, such as copying another's work, presenting someone else's opinions and theories as one's own, or working jointly on a project and then submitting it as one's own. Cheating: the use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, or study aids; or an act of deceit by which a student attempts to misrepresent academic skills or knowledge; unauthorized copying or collaboration. Fabrication: intentional misrepresentation or invention of any information, such as falsifying research, inventing or exaggerating data, or listing incorrect or fictitious references. Collusion: assisting another to commit an act of academ ic dishonesty, such as paying or bribing someone to acquire a test or assignment, taking a test or doing an assignment for someone else, or allowing someone to do these things for one's own benefit. Academic Misconduct : the intentional violation of school policies, such as tampering with grades, misrepresenting one's identity, or taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test or any information about the test. SANCTIONS All proven cases of academic dishonesty will be penalized as appropriate under the circumstances. Sanctions other than a reduced or failing grade may be imposed by the chair of the course. The imposition of any sanction other than a private reprimand will include a statement of reasons supporting its severity. A student may appeal any finding or sanction. Sanctions may include but are not limited to: Reduced or failing grade on an assignment, test, or course. A letter of reprimand A defined period of probation, with or without the attachment of conditions Withdr awal of College of Nursing funding A defined period of suspension, with or without the attachment of conditions Expulsion (or dismissal) from the College of Nursing Notation on the official record Revocation of an awarded degree Any combination of the sanc tions above The administrators of the College of Nursing will be responsible for tracking any occurrences of academic dishonesty and meeting with any student who fails to follow the honor code. 33 PROGRAM DISMISSAL/TERMINATION A stu dent may be dismissed from the college when there is sufficient evidence to show: violations of The College of Nursing code of honor (see Academic Integrity policy) academic failure (see Academic Progress and Grading policy) unsafe clinical practice a failure to comply with College /Hospital/Agency policies and procedures excessive absences with failure to initiate a plan for make- up experiences, or absences beyond the school's ability to accommodate the make- up experiences behavior which is unprofessional/inappropriate conduct that jeopardizes the safety of self, students, patients or others failure to meet financial obligations or health requirements violation of the drug/alcohol policy behavior that violates one or more policies, such as Conduct on Campus or Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault policies abuse of social networking If a student is unsuccessful in a nursing course due to mental or physical illness, a plan of treatment and written proof of completion, by an appropriate authority, must be submitted before the student will be considered for readmission. Faculty, staff or students who recklessly or intentionally endanger the mental or physical health of others at the college will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination or dismissal. Any communication (statement or photo) which may cause actual or potential harm or injury to another or to the college may be grounds for termination or dismissal. 34 APPEALS STUDENT APPEAL PROCESS The Student Appeal Process is designed to facilitate conflict resolution. Students have a right to appeal decisions that impact their educational experiences or create conflict with their program objectives. Remedy is sought through the following steps: Solve the problem at the source. Meet with the individual or persons involved in the conflict to attempt to resolve issue(s). Take the problem to next level. When a conflict remains unresolved, seek assistance through an advisor, or curriculum team member. When all avenues have been exhausted, a written statement of appeal may be submitted to the Admission and Academic Progress Committee within eight (8) working days of the issue being disputed. A student who is appealing a clinical failure which is determined prior to the end of the semester may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. A student who is appealing a dismissal may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. To appeal, a student will submit a written request to the Dean of Student Services . An ad-hoc subcommittee of the Admission and Academic Progress Committe e will be convened, comprised of the Dean of Student Services or designee, two faculty representatives, and two students. Every attempt will be made to review the written appeal within five working days from the time the written appeal is received. The s tudent will be invited to appear before the appeals committee to state his/her case. The faculty member of the course the student was unsuccessful in will also be invited to present information i n support of the grade issued. The committee will vote to ei ther uphold the grade or dismissal or reverse it. The appeals process does not guarantee that a decision will be reversed. It does ensure that issues brought before the committee are mediated and that all considerations on behalf of the student are gi ven. The purpose of the appeals committee is to formulate resolutions and make recommendations to the Dean. The Dean may uphold the decision or override it. The decision of the Dean is final. If the Dean is the subject of the appeal, the final decision rests with the Admissions and Progression Committee. Please refer to Policy #203. No action will be taken against any student who chooses to file an appeal. Any student who appeals a decision will be provided with written assurance that no action will be taken against the student for filing the complai nt. Section 494(C)j of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, provides that a student, faculty member, or any other person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution of high er education has the right to file a written complaint. 35 In New York State, a complaint may be filed by any person with reason to believe that an institution has acted contrary to its published standards or that conditions at the institution appear to jeopardize the quality of the institution's instructional programs or the general welfare of its students. Any person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by an institution on or after May 4, 1994, may file a written complaint within three years of the alleged incident. Information regarding this complaint process can be obtained from the Dean's Office . Additionally, the person can contact opprogs@nysed.gov and request a complaint form. The s tudent must be the co mplainant. Additional information may be obtained at the following link: http://www.highered.nysed.gov/ocue/spr/COMPLAINTFORMINFO.html 36 CAMPUS SAFETY/SECURITY PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the policy of the College of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment that is safe and free of threat or harm. In addition, the policies and procedures of the college provide protection of the rights and dignity of each student and employee. A safe and healthy work environment will assure that the student has the best possible opportunity for success in their studies. Safety and security is the responsibility of every student and employee. It is expected that each member of the college community work to make our campus a safe and productive learning environment. PREVENTION Prevention is the best strategy for providin g a safe environment. To that end, the College of Nursing has policies and procedures regarding safety and security issues and practices. These policies are covered in student orientations. Personal safety and violence prevention education is also provided to students annually. Published materials regarding personal safety and security and treatment options are available from the Student Services office. The college is in compliance with all government regulations and recommendations. Annual fire and safety inspections of the facility are conducted. In the event of an imminent threat against the safety of the community, it is the policy of the college to take reasonable steps to provide students with warning of potential threats to security. COMPLAINT PROCEDURE The College of Nursing believes that the reporting of crime is an effective measure in preventing future crimes. Issues of safety or security should be brought to the attention of Maria College Campus Security and the Dean. Students, faculty, staff, and guests are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the appropriate authorities in a timely manner. Crimes committed on campus should be reported to security as well as the local police department. The complaint should include details of the incident(s), names of individuals involved, and the names of witnesses. Should an accident or incident involving yourself or another occur, please contact the Dean or a faculty or staff member for an incident report form, instructions for completing and filing the report, and possible referral for treatment. Sexual assault is a crime and victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the emergency department for medical and forensic evaluation. Depending on the location of the sexual assault inc ident, a report should be made t o the Dean , St. Peter's Hospital Security or Maria College campus security. Reports of sexual harassment or assault are confid ential and should be reported, even if legal action is not being pursued. In addition to the College's internal complaint procedure, students have the right to pursue investigation and prosecution of sexual harassment by filing complaints with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR). Students must file complaints within 365 days of the last incident. Whatever action is taken against the harasser will be communicated to the NYSDHR complainant. 37 CAMPUS SAFETY/SECURITY SPECIFIC POLICIES Bias Related Crime Prevention It is the policy of the College of Nursing to take reasonable steps to provide a learning environment free from bias. The learning environment should be one that is fair and that allows students to progress solely on the basis of ability and academic performance. Bias adversely affects the learning environment and the student's ability to learn. Bias perpetrated by the student faculty, or staff will not be tolerated. Allegations will be investigated promptly and with as much confidentiality as the situation permits. It is also the polic y of the College of Nursing to provide information about bias related crime to the incoming student during the mandatory orientation program.

The law is designated to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system by standardizing electronic transmission of certain healthcare transactions. The goal of HIPAA is to protect the privacy and security of all health care information, including transmitted infor mation. Protected health information may be used or disclosed only to the individual or personal representative; for treatment, payment or health care operations; for special purposes set forth in HIPAA regulations; for any other purpose, with the individ ual's authorization. MEDITECH COMPUTER SYSTEM AND CONFIDENTIALITY The Meditech and/ or Sorian Computer System is a confidential, order entry (to maintain hospital/department business) and clinical access (to enhance patient care) information system. It is the poli cy of this institution and the college that ALL patient information is confidential and that access to that information is a privilege which carries with it ethical and legal responsibilities and sanctions. Student Access Students are eligible to access the Meditech and/or Sorian system on a \"need- to-know\" basis. The purpose of this access is to obtain patients' information directly related to clinical objectives in nursing courses, as well as to utilize the word processing and internal email capabilities of the system. This is a privilege which facilitates clinical learning. Student Employees Some of the students of the college are also employees of the hospital. If you hold this dual status, as an employee, while working in your employed status, you are eligible to use the computer system in whatever capacity your employer deems appropriate for your position. You will have separate passwords for your work and student access. You must not access the system outside of your work time with y our work password. Printed Material Students may NOT remove any printed information with patient identification on it from the building - this is removing a chart. Patient lab reports and medication lists may be taken out of the hospital only if all pat ient identifiers have first been removed from these documents. Students may not photocopy any part of a patient's chart. 58 REGULATORY Passwords No one is to allow anyone else access to the Meditech and/or Sorian system on her/his password. If the person asking for use of the system is an eligible user, they can access the system through their own password. Do not \"buddy up\" while using the computer. Those who share their password may be dismissed from the college. Do not allow anyone who does no t have a password into the system to \"show them what it can do\". This is not a reference library system - it is confidential information. Sanctions Please be mindful of the sanctions that apply to breach of confidentiality. These are listed in the Perso nnel Policies of the hospital. The final sanction for any behavior which violates these rules is termination of employment/dismissal from the school. In addition, violation of HIPAA regulations is a felony and may prohibit applicants from licensure as a nurse, or loss of license for those who already hold a license. FAMILY RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An eligible student under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution. In addition, parents are afforded the same rights as students, as long as the student is claimed as a dependent on either of their parent's Federal Income Tax Return, and there is proper presentation of the dependency condition. These rights include: 1 . The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing ( SPHCON ) receive s a request for access. A student should submit to the Dean or other appropriate official, a writte n request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccu rate, misleading. A student who wishes to ask SPHCON to amend a record should write the college official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If SPHCON decides not to amend the record as requested, SPHCON will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing re garding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before SPHCON discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 59 SPHCON discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by SPHCON in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com mittee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of SPHCON who performs an institutional service or function for which SPHCON would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of SPHCON with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educa - tion record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for SPHCON . Upon request, SPHCON may also disclose education records without consent to offi cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. SPHCON has designated the following information as \"directory information\": student's name, address, telephone listing, participation in officially recognized activities, major, dates of attendance, date of birth , enrollment status, and degrees and awards received, and digitized image/photograph/video. The school may disclose any of this information without prior consent, unless notified in writing to the contrary within 30 days of the beginning of the term. 4.

Enrollment on at least a half -time basis (6 credits per semester) for loans with matriculated status Working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program. Please note: Federal and NY State financial aid regulations require that the courses must and can only be a part of the College of Nursing's required curriculum which includes the Nursing courses, the co -requisite courses and the directed elective courses.

The student's financial resources are cal culated by considering the family circumstances, including the size of the family, the number of family members, the number of family members attending post -secondary institutions, and the family income. The difference between these figures is the student 's demonstration of \"need. \" Cost of Attendance : The table below illustrates the estimated expenses for a first year, full time RN student of different status: All numbers are U. S. Dollars. COMMUTER OUT OF STATE Tuitio n and Fees $9,641 $11,440 Living Expenses $80 VERIFICATION PROCESS The Department of Education uses a system of edits to select student financial aid applications for verification. This process involves the collection of additional supporting documentation to compare and correct inaccurate information that may have been supplied on the financial aid application. Students' whose applications are selected for verification will be notified by the Financial Aid Office and informed of any additional documentation/forms that must be completed. Once the verification process is completed, any necessary changes will be made and the student's expected contribution will be recalculated. The Financial Aid Office will make necessary adjustment, if warranted, and send notification to the student. In addition to the verification process, all student financial aid applications are compared with other databases to ensure accurate information and to flag potential problems. The matches include the Selective Service Agency files, Immigration and Naturalization files, Social Security Administration files and the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS). Errors or problems are indicated on the student's Student Aid Report OR ISI R and must be resolved prior to the disbursement of any federal funds. The Financial Aid Office will notify students of any database match problems and the process to resolve the issues. 68 DEPENDENCY OVERRIDE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID This is for students classified as \"dependent\" by the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a dependent student. The college recognizes that the awarding of federal student aid is based on the assumption that the primary responsibility of meeting college expenses rests with the student and the student's parents. Using a nationwide need analysis formula, the federal government requires both student and parent income and resources information in determining aid eligibility. The family's ability to pay for college is based on the information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Occasionally, due to \"unusual circumstances\", students should not be considered dependent. The federal government has given financial aid professionals authority to use their \"professional judgment' in determining if a dependency override is warranted in unusual circumstances. The dependent student can request a waiver of federal regulations requiring parental information if he/she can document why they should be considered independent. The student shoul d contact the Financial Aid Coordinator for what required documentation will be requested for a Dependency Override as well as the policy and procedures guidelines.

In addition, make sure you are familiar with the School's Academic Progress and Grading policy which is defined in the College of Nursing catalog and is different than the Financial Aid SAP policy. In order to remain a student in good academic standing and be eligible for most types of financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting Title IV federal financial aid must : Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. GPA's are reviewed at the end of each semester. Students who fail to maintain the minimum GPA will be given ONE semester of \"Aid Probation\" in which they must achieve a 2.0 cumulative GPA. Make progress toward their degree as follows: o Full Time: 24 credits per academic year o \u00be Time: 18 credits per academic year o \u00bd Time: 12 credits per academic year Fewer than 6 credits: complete all attempted credits within two semesters. Repeated classes are not eligible to be counted as credits earned toward academic progress, since each class can only be counted once. Students requesting/receiving financial aid are expected to complete their academic program within a reasonable time frame as follows: o Full Time : 3 academic years o Part Time : 4 academic years Students dismissed from the school and later readmitted, are academically eligible for Title IV funds immediately 71 150% Direct Subsidized Loan Limit ***NOTE: If you are a first time borrower or have paid off your prior loans and are now borrowing again after July 1, 2013, this Federal regulation applies to you.*** You will no longer be eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans once you have received Direct Subsidized Loans for the period of 150% of the published length of the borrower's current educational program. For the RN program, 150% is 3 years. If you lose eligibility of subsidized loans, you will also lose interest subsidy on subsid ized loans received on or after July 1 st, 2013 during all periods if you do not complete the program and continues enrollment in the same program OR enrolls in another program of the same or shorter length. The only exception is if you complete the progra m and then go on to another one, you would not lose the subsidy. Loss of interest subsidy cannot be regained. The calculation of determining when 150% limit met is: Maximum eligibility period less total of subsidized usage periods equals remaining eligibility period. The amount of subsidized is not based on the dollar amounts , it is based on the amount of time you receive it. If your enrollment status is less than full -time, the calculated subsidized usage period is prorated for less than full -time enroll ment. If you leave our program and go to another institution, the subsidized limit does not start over at 0% borrowed. If you do not borrow the full amount of subsidized offered to you, you will not be eligible for any unsubsidized loans. There will be a m essage on the FAFSA when you complete it to notify you and the school of any issues in regards to the 150% limit regulation. 72 APPEALS OF SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STANDARDS : Students have the right to appeal Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.

The earned percentage is applied to the total amount of the Title IV gra nt and loan assistance that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) to the student Unearned Percentage : Any amount in excess of the allowed percentage must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program by the school, the student or both. The school must return the lesser of the unearned Title IV assistance or an amount equal to the total liability incurred by the student multiplied by the unearned percentage. Tuition Liabilit y: If a student officially or unofficially withdraws after the end of t he school's refund period, the student is liable for al l his or her tuition and fees, even if the student's financial aid is decreased. If the student's financial aid previously covered his or her bill, but no longer covers it after the Return of Title IV Aid calculation, the student will be expected to pay for his or her outstanding tuition and fees. In addition, if the student receives a disbursement of financial aid, and the Return of Title IV Aid calculation shows that the student was not entitled to t he funds, the student will be billed for the funds, and the overpayment information will be forwarded to the U. S. Department of Education. It will be the student's responsibility to repay the funds before he or she is eligible to receive any further feder al student aid, even if the student attends another college. This overpayment will appear on the Student Aid Report until the overpayment is repaid. Definitions for Title IV Program: The following is an explanation of the difference between a refund and a repayment: Refund: The difference between moneys originally paid for institutional charges by financial aid and or cash payments and the amount retained by the institution after withdrawal. If a student received federal financial aid, a portion of the refund must be returned to those programs. Repayment: The amount that a student must pay back to the school if federal financial funds were received, in excess of institutional charges. The school will return the Student Financial Aid (SFA) program portion of the refund/repayment to the source of funding in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Federal Plus Loan Federal Pell Grant 77 Federal Academic Competitiveness Grant Other sources Student The refund/repayment disbursal will be 100% to the SFA programs in order of the priority listed until the funds are exhausted. Determination of Date of Withdrawal Official Withdrawal: The date the student began the withdrawal process or the date the student officially notifies the School in writing that he/she is withdrawing from the program. The per centage of eligibility will be directly related to the percentage of the semester completed. For example: if a student completes 10% of the semester, he/she will be eligible for 10% of his/her financial aid. If he/she completes 30% of the semester, he/she will receive 30% of his/her financial aid etc. Unofficial Withdrawal: If the student leaves school without giving notice, the student's last recorded day of attendance as documented by the school will be used. In the absence of attendance records, the midpoint of the semester will be used. Process for Determining Refunds/Repayments Student's date of withdrawal will be calculated using the federal withdrawal record. For both Federal Financial Aid Recipients and Non- Federal Financial Aid Recipients the Refund policy of the school will be applied for tuition, fees and other charges. Repayment/refunds will be determined by using the federal softw are provided by the U. S. Department of Education governing the money involved. Allocation of a refund/repayment to the SFA program sources will be within 45 days of the withdrawal date to the federal programs, within 60 days to the lender and within 30 days to the student. If a repayment is required by the student, he/she will be not ified of the need to repay the FFELP programs. Verification of Process When a student withdraws from t he school, the calculation work sheet will be completed and filed in the student's Financial aid folder/billing records as a record of this policy's applicat ion and the record of returned refund/repayment as required. All students will have the following documentation attached to their final bill: Withdrawal Record - with copy of change of status/written note or attendance sheet. Refund calculation sheet If nece ssary - refund/repayment/prorated sheets per federal policy A sample of all forms are available upon request. Once a refund/repayment is determined, the Bursar will attach all paper work to the bill, and process through accounti ng so that distribution is made within 30 days of the refund/repayment calculation date. 78 CERTIFICATION/REGISTRATION St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department, approved by the Board of Regents.
