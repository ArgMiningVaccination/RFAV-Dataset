After completing an undergraduate degree in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia (1996), Amita pursued intense studies in Ayurveda and Yoga. She traveled to south India in 1998, where she was divinely led to [SVYASA Yoga Research Institute](http://svyasa.edu.in/) (Vivekananda Kendra) in Bangalore, India where she trained under the guidance of world-renowned yoga guru Dr. H.R. Nagendra (GuruJi) and Dr. Nagarathna and earned her Hatha Yoga Teacher certification. After completing yoga training, Amita went on to study Ayurveda and Ayurvedic healing therapies (panchakarma) at International Academy of Ayurveda earning certification in Ayurvedic health consulting in 1999. Following her studies in natural healing, she worked in the IT industry at companies such as Ernst & Young, Deloitte, and Intelsat in Washington DC and Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley in NYC. Alongside her full-time IT work, Amita taught traditional Hatha Yoga and consulted in Ayurvedic healing on a volunteer basis in several places including 10 years in the DC metro area for public and private institutions, 4 years teaching and consulting in New York City, 3 years working with patients at National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, teaching and presenting at over a dozen conferences, and several years of private therapy-based education for people healing from chronic illness. In 2006, along with husband, she operated Classic Homes of Maryland as co-owner and Vice President. Alongside being a business owner, Amita achieved certification as Ayurvedic Practitioner and continued to consult people who were suffering from chronic illness on how to regain health naturally with Ayurvedic medicine. In 2017, after she aided in the total healing of someone who was told by western doctors that there was no chance of recovery, Amita heard a Divine message to leave her job and dedicate the rest of her life to helping people recover with natural medicine. She decided to devote herself full-time to this cause, on a voluntary basis, and opened Vedic Health Inc as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. She was awarded the degree of Doctor of Ayurveda from Sai Ayurvedic College of Miami after completing 3.5 years of studies including clinical training in Ayurvedic panchakarma at Swasthyam Ayurvedic Hospital in Kannur, Kerala. She studied under leaders of Ayurvedic medicine including Dr. Waldo Castro, Vaidya Atreya Smith, Vaidya William Courson and Dr Jyothi Samith, all of whom continue to guide her today. After observing that costs to see naturopaths were out of range for many, Amita opened this nonprofit to make holistic health care affordable and accessible for anyone seeking an alternative solution to healing. In her clinic she has seen hundreds of people heal in amazing ways, and word of mouth keeps her and her small staff busy on a daily basis. The goal of her clinic is not to grow in volume, but to grow in number of success cases. For this reason, the focus is on the complete healing of every single person, divinely sent here for help, and to limit our client volume to achieve this purpose. Amita sees all kinds of cases, primarily complicated and/or chronic cases, such as long-term digestive complications, auto-immune disorders, severe skin problems, pain affliction, etc. and psychosomatic illness such as depression, anxiety, addiction, ADHD, and more where drugs are not desirable. She also teaches at Sai Ayurvedic College as adjunct professor and is the personal health advisor to several CEOs, physicians, community leaders, as well as the uninsured, impoverished and underserved.
