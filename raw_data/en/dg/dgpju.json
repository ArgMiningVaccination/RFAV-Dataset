Itchy eyes. Runny nose. Sneezing. Skin rash. More serious reactions can include constricted air passageways, vomiting and even death. All this from a handful of peanuts, an encounter with a cat or microscopic grains of pollen in the air! If everyone reacted to these common substances, we could fix the blame squarely on the nut, dander, shellfish or pollen. But not everyone reacts. What is it? Your nervous system is the master system that orchestrates your immune system, glandular system, respiratory system and every other system that reacts inappropriately to an allergen. Normally, these systems help you respond and adapt to the world around you. But suffering from uncontrollable sneezing around a house cat is probably an inappropriate reaction. If your nervous system isn't working right, you don't work right. So, rather than direct our attention to the countless potential allergens, we locate and reduce the disturbances we find to your nervous system. Each of us was born with the capacity to withstand or adapt to stress. If we're unable to deal with things we eat, breathe or come into contact with it may be because our margin to adapt is used up. Pretend that this bucket represents your capacity to adapt to the physical, emotional and chemical stresses of life. Every stressful encounter your body faces, fills up your bucket. If your bucket is already full and you encounter pollen, foods or other chemicals, your bucket overflows. When that happens, people say they're having an allergic reaction. But what they're really saying is, \"I've lost my ability to adapt. My margin is used up.\" So, we don't treat allergies. We look for ways to restore your ability to adapt to allergens by locating and reducing disturbances to your nervous system. Simple, really. We'd love to discuss your specific allergy issue and how chiropractic may help. Request your appointment with Dr. John today [BY CLICKING HERE](http://bit.ly/2uDXZ3X) or calling us at 518-383-5595. Chiropractic is not a treatment for asthma. However, many who suffer from asthma report improvement by receiving chiropractic care. There is research that suggests a link between the spinal column, the nervous system and the respiratory system. This may be why many have mentioned improved breathing by consulting our practice. Asthma cases seem to be rising at an alarming rate. Some think it's due to a combination of factors, especially the increase of chemicals in our environment. These days, airtight, super-insulated homes can trap chemicals, molds, formaldehyde and other irritants. Even the increasing use of cesarean births, antibiotics and our fascination with germ killing have been cited. If these factors were the only issue, why wouldn't all children living in the same house and breathing the same air, suffer equally? Your diaphragm is the primary muscle used for breathing. Nerves that control each breath leave your brain and exit the spinal cord in the mid-neck (C3, C4 and C5) area. Spinal problems in this area can have a profound affect on the nerve supply to the diaphragm. Reducing vertebral subluxations in the spine may help restore proper nervous system control of the lungs and improved function can begin. In fact, research published in the [Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research](http://www.chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/An_Impairment_Rating_Analysis.shtml) =documented the results experienced by 81 children with asthma who received chiropractic care. The two-month study revealed that those under care saw a 45% decrease in the number of \"attacks\" and that 31% of the subjects voluntarily chose to decrease their medication. All this from improved nervous system control of the lungs! Chiropractic care may help reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. Naturally, we can't make any promises, however, if your son or daughter has subluxations, and they are the cause of their symptoms, many have found relief with conservative chiropractic care.
