TIMEFRAMES FOR POST SCT COMPLICATIONS Delayed complications may be lethal! Justification METHODS Observational studies, registry limitations, latency measurable in decades, minimal cross -disciplinary involvement INCENTIVES LACKING FACT, SCTOD, reimbursement, framework OVERLAP Chronic GVHD, pediatric initiatives, other oncology survivorship WIDE SPECTRUM - disorders, latency, lethality, disciplines - patient -centric Vs. pathobiology UNKNOWNS - pathobiology poorly understood - effectiveness of preventive guidelines - ultra-late effects and aging The NIH Late Effects Initiative OBJECTIVES to define the critical issues and barriers in the field to set research priorities create a successful organizational framework for studying late- effects PROGRESS TIMELINE Guidance for Working Committees Focus : Survival > 1 year, not covered by chronic GVHD initiative, unique to BMT. Only the most critical challenges that will improve health, advance the science OR change guidelines/clinical care/standard approach. Multidisciplinary: International, adults/ peds , subject matter experts, Governmental, advocacy groups, transplant societies. Cross fertilization: Pediatric oncology & HIV. U nique problems in this field may lead to generalizable solutions . G oals: identify knowledge gaps, give evidence-based recommendations and set research agenda to improve BMT survivor monitoring and management. Program Highlights Participation Research Roadmaps - CV, ID, SN, QOL Methodology HCD- Improve follow up! Patient perspective panel Funding discussion Workshop- \"Starting a Late Effects Program\" Consensus publications BBMT Research Methodology Establish new cohorts or expand existing cohorts to study late effects using comprehensive and complete capture of pre- , peri- and post -HCT exposures and follow -up of HCT recipients and include detailed information on extent and severity of chronic GVHD, socio -demographic data, patient reported outcomes and healthcare costs High priority areas for data collection are late effects that have high incidence of morbidity, impairment, disability and/or premature mortality, have excess risk compared to general population and have potentially modifiable risk factors Develop or supplement existing repositories of biospecimens before and after HCT to facilitate investigations of biomarkers, risk factors and pathogenesis of late effects; high priority specimen collection areas include germline DNA, total leukocyte of cell - specific RNA, plasma serum, and fresh frozen tissue of subsequent neoplasms Health Care Delivery Healthcare delivery models Identification, development, implementation and efficacy of patient -centered care delivery models, including novel models that integrate information technology in healthcare delivery and evaluate care coordination and role of non- physician providers Evaluate patient self -management and information technology tools for enhancing patient participation in survivorship care Evaluate healthcare disparities in HCT survivorship care and issues in special populations including caregivers Assess models for implementation and utilization of treatment summary and survivorship care plans Evaluate development and implementation of evidence- based late effects screening and prevention guidelines Evaluate role of supportive therapies in survivorship care Coverage and value Establish infrastructure and databases to conduct studies on costs and value of HCT, including linkage of existing databases and electronic health record platforms Identify patient- centered coverage models for preventive care and late complications Investigate resource utilization, costs and cost -effectiveness of healthcare delivery models including innovative models for coverage through the care continuum and coverage of other services required to provide survivorship care Assess impact of health policy (e.g., Affordable Care Act, Medicare payment reform) on HCT survivorship care Evaluate prevalence, risk factors and interventions for short -term and long- term financial toxicity of HCT to patients and caregivers Evaluate patient reported outcomes to inform value and coverage models Subsequent Neoplasms Establish multicenter mechanisms to conduct prospective large-scale long-term studies of HCT survivors that capture detailed data on pre-, peri- and post -transplant exposures Define magnitude of risks for specific subsequent neoplasms Evaluate interaction between traditional risk factors (e.g. smoking) with transplant related risk factors Bank cryopreserved donor and recipient blood and marrow cells and subsequent neoplasm tissues for laboratory investigations of susceptibility and pathogenesis Assess genetic risk factors Investigate validity, cost -effectiveness, magnitude of risk -reduction, and optimal techniques and timing of screening for specific subsequent neoplasms and its impact on HCT outcomes Validate cancer prevention interventions (e.g., HPV vaccination) in HCT survivors Immune Dysregulation Late infections Conduct long-term multicenter prospective studies of late infectious events in HCT survivors to identify serious infections, types of pathogens, and risk factors Evaluate immunologic correlates for late infections using banked samples Evaluate association of early and late microbiota changes after HCT with late infections and immune reconstitution Understand effectiveness of consensus infection control guidelines by creating registry of vaccine-preventable and other rare infectious diseases Immune reconstitution Identify the molecular mechanisms of late dysfunctional adaptive immunity Investigate adaptive immune system neogenesis , maturation and exhaustion and the influence of persistent alloreactivity, inflammation and viral infections Asses late functional pathogen-specific T - and B -cell responses to pathogens Prevention Correlate immune reconstitution markers with vaccine responses to standardize thresholds for initiating vaccination Conduct vaccination specific prospective multicenter trials Assess role of other therapies such as IVIG Cardiac, Vascular and Metabolic Arterial Disease Describe incidence, risk factors (including allo-effect) and at risk populations Establish HCT -specific risk prediction models Clarify pathobiology and evaluate novel imaging and blood biomarkers for screening Test interventions on risk reduction in HCT survivors Cardiac Dysfunction Describe contribution of pre- HCT exposures and comorbidities Examine mechanisms of enhanced cardiotoxicity in patients with cardiovascular risk factors Describe asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction Novel imaging and blood biomarkers for asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction and for screening Test preventive interventions in high risk populations Cardiovascular Risk Factors Hypertension: Evaluate optimal timing of interventions based on markers of vascular and endothelial dysfunction; assess magnitude of under -treatment and barriers to treatment Hyperglycemia: Assess effects of pre -HCT metabolic status and exposures; evaluate optimal timing and methods screening; investigate pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic interventions in prediabetic states Dyslipidemia : Define high- risk populations; evaluate association of dyslipidemia with inflammation after HCT and immunomodulatory aspects of statins; assess effect of lifestyle and lipid- lowering therapy on risk reduction Sarcopenic obesity : Evaluate longitudinal changes in body composition in HCT survivors and association with outcomes, Assess risk factors and exposures and effect of exercise or dietary modification on fat/muscle mass QOL & Psychosocial Establish registry for prospective collection of patient reported outcomes that includes underrepresented groups Design and test risk -targeted interventions that address resource utilization and costs, process measures including feasibility and treatment fidelity, sustainability and dissemination potential; priority domains include sexual dysfunction, fatigue/sleep disruption, non-adherence, health behaviors such as physical inactivity, and psychological dysfunction Convene stakeholders to design a consensus -based methodological framework for outcomes evaluation including standardized time points and longitudinal prospective designs Evaluate and compare existing practices for integrating patient - centered outcome screening across HCT survivorship programs to identify best practices and barriers; address opportunities to incorporate patient centered outcome data into electronic medical records Future plans: 1.Dissemination of results White papers in BBMT Educational session at ASBMT, ? EBMT Patient outreach 2.Stimulate discussion, ideas, research projects 3.Stimulate awareness in BMT societies - ASBMT SIG 4.Coordinate and align recommendations with existing BMT initiatives, such as CTN 5.Stimulate funding discussion at federal level -IAA "}
