Herbal medicine is a form of functional medicine that makes use of plants to treat the symptoms of illness and disease. Herbal medication makes use of all parts of the plant, including its leaves, flowers, seeds, and roots, as each of them provides particular benefits to help you achieve wellness. Use of herbal medicine to alleviate disease has been used for thousands of years across the world.

An imbalance or stagnation of energy in your body can result in stress, migraines, digestive issues, and chronic pain. Herbal medicine is considered a form of dietary supplements and is available as pills, capsules, powders, extracts, and tinctures. Common herbal medicines include chamomile, rosemary, and lavender, as well as garlic, ginger, and milk thistle. What Are the Benefits of Herbal Medicine?

Recent studies have shown that regular use of herbal medicines can: - Improve immune function - Reduce chronic pain - Improve blood circulation and heart health - Alleviate the symptoms of anxiety and depression - Promote restful sleep - Decrease digestive issues, including constipation and nausea, reduce inflammation What to Expect During Your Herbal Medicine Appointment If you've never taken herbal medicines before, it's best to consult with a trained herbalist or certified naturopathic doctor at Panhandle Counseling and Health Center before you begin. Some botanical dietary supplements can be toxic in high doses or negative interactions with your medications, so working with a trained professional is highly recommended. A certified herbalist or naturopath will begin your first appointment by asking you a comprehensive series of questions regarding your current health and whether you're experiencing any symptoms of pain or illness. These sessions typically last an hour and consider any current medications you may be taking, your diet, and overall physical and mental health. Your practitioner will then formulate an individual plan of treatment that includes herbal supplements, complementary therapies, and any dietary changes. You will typically be recommended to follow this plan for one to three months, and a follow-up consultation helps assess your progress along the way.
