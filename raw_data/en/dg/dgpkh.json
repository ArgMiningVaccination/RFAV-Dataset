The purpose of NNSA oversight is for assessing the Contractor's performance in meeting its obligations under this Contract, in addition to measuring progress toward NNSA missions. The Contractor's accountability described in this clause is not reduced by the fact that NNSA conducts oversight activities. H-13 NNSA OVERSIGHT At all times during the term of this contract, NNSA will continue, preserve and maintain its right to determine the level of NNSA oversight of all Contractor activities under this Contract. In addition to the rights and remedies provided to the Government under provisions of this Contract, the Contractor shall fully cooperate with NNSA oversight personnel, NNSA subject matter experts in the performance of their assigned oversight functions and shall provide complete access to facilities, information, and Contractor personnel.

(i) Level 1 performance failure: not less than 26% nor greater than 100%; (ii) Level 2 performance failure: not less than 11% nor greater than 25%; and (iii) Level 3 performance failure: not greater than 10%. (d) Mitigating Factors. (1) In determining the amount of the reduction and the applicability of mitigating factors, the contracting officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&H or security requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site- specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition, guidance for the amount of reduction, or guidance for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range. (2) The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident. (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to ant icipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance. Section I , Page 38 (iii) Contractor self -identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.

(vi) Event caused by \"Good Samaritan\" act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response). (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision -making (e.g., policy, ES&H programs). (viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&H by use of lessons -learned and best practices inter- and intra -DOE sites. (e) Effect of Reduction. (1) The Government will effect Earned Fee reductions as soon as practical. If the effective date of the reduction falls after the completion of the fee determination for the evaluation period during which the performance failure occurred, the Government will effect the reduction during a subsequent evaluation period, by issuing a demand for payment or by reducing any Earned Fee, at the contracting officer's sole discretion. If the performance failure occurs during the last evaluation period before termination or completion of the contra ct, reduction will be effected as soon as practical during contract close - out. (2) The amount of reduction under this clause, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract, shall not exceed the amount of Earned Fee. (f) Environme nt, Safety and Health (ES&H). Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&H requirements, standards, terms or conditions (including the DOE/NNSA approved Contractor SMS). The levels of performance failure under which reductions of earned fee are: Section I , Page 39 (1) Level 1: Performance failures that are most adverse to ES&H. Examples of Level 1 performance failures include, but are not limited to: (i) Failure to develop and maintain required DOE/NNSA approval of an SMS; (ii) Any action/event that is considered an \"Accident\" for which an Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is appointed pursuant to DOE Order 225.1B, Accident Investigations, or its successor.

(2) Patent Counsel Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Pate nt Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 60 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold D OE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor. If Patent Counsel grants permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in computer software, the permis sion automatically extends to subsequent minor versions (e.g., minor revisions, patches and bug fixes) having the same funding source, same name and substantially same functionality as the original computer software, and may be extended to subsequent major versions representing significant modifications of the program with the approval of Patent Counsel. (3) Permission for contractor to assert copyright. (i) For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish, or make available to the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in accordance with OSTI guidelines at the time permission to assert copyright is given under Section I , Page 50 paragraph (e)(2) of this clause \u2014 (A) Announcement information/metadata contained in the Software Announcement Notice 241.4; (B) The source code and/or executable file for each software program; and (C) Documentation, if any, which may consist of a user manual, sample test cases, or similar information, needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software (whether included on the software media itself or provided in a separate file or in paper format).

When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities, the Contractor will provide to OSTI the latest version of the copyrighted data (for example, source code, object code, minimal support documentation, drawings or updated manuals.) In addition, the Contractor will provide annually to Patent Counsel, if requested, a list of all copyrighted data that the Contractor has abandoned commercial licensing activity during that year. (vii) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this parag raph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office, or when submitted for publication. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall substantially similar to the following: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. with the Department of Energy. During the period of commercialization or such other time period specified by the Department of Energy, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Subsequent to that period the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to the Contractor or DOE. NEITHER THE UNITED STATES NOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, NOR ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES, MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ASSUMES ANY LEGAL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY DATA, APPARATUS, PRODUCT, OR PROCESS DISCLOSED, OR REPRESENTS THAT ITS USE WOULD NOT INFRINGE PRIVATELY OWNED RIGHTS. Section I , Page 52 (End of notice) (viii) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the period that Contractor is commercializing the data as provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license it self, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in subparagraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause. Before licensing under thi s subparagraph, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65\u2014 \"Appeals\". (ix) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs. (4) The following notice may be included in computer software prior to any publication or release and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the c omputer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Notice: This computer software was prepared by [insert the Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the Depart ment of Energy (DOE). All rights in the computer software are reserved by DOE on behalf of the United States Government and the Contractor as provided in the Contract. You are authorized to use this computer software for Governmental purposes but it is not to be released or distributed to the public. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE CONTRACTOR MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ASSUMES ANY LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. This notice including this sentence must appear on any copies of this com puter software. (End of notice) (5) A similar notice can be used for data, other than computer software, prior to Section I , Page 53 any publication or release and prior to Contractor's obtaining permission of DOE Patent Counsel to assert copyright. (f) Open software source. The Contractor may release computer software first produced by the Contractor in the performance of this contract under an open source software license. Such software shall hereinafter be referred to as open source software or OSS, subject to the following: (1) DOE Program notice for copyright assertion for OSS. (i) The Contractor shall provide written notice (including relevant data such as, for example, the software disclosure form) to each DOE Program or Programs that have provided a substantial portion of the funding (funding source(s)) to develop the software that the Contractor intends to release as OSS unless the funding Program(s) has previously provided blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that Program or a specific DOE project stipu lates the software to be released as OSS. If Program has neither consented nor objected to the assertion of copyright within two weeks of such written notification, the Contractor may assert copyright in the software. If notification of a funding DOE Progr am(s) is not practicable or DOE Program(s) has objected, the Contractor shall consult with Patent Counsel, which may provide approval. For software developed under a technology transfer agreement (e.g., CRADA, SPP, or User Facility Agreement), authorizatio n from the partner of the such agreement shall be additionally obtained for OSS release unless such agreement has a provision providing for such copyright assertion. (ii) If the software is developed with funding from a federal government agency or agencies (f unding source(s)) other than DOE, then authorization from all the funding agency(ies) shall be obtained for OSS release, if practicable. Such federal government agency(ies) may provide blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that agency(ies). However, OSS release of any one of such software shall be subject to approval by all other funding sources for the software, if any. If approval from such federal government agency(ies) is not practicable, the Patent Counsel may provide approval i nstead. (2) Assert copyright in the OSS. Once the Contractor has met the program approval requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, copyright in the software to be distributed as OSS may be asserted by the Contractor, or, for OSS developed under a CRADA, User Facility Agreement, or SPP Agreement, either by the Contractor, CRADA Participant, User Facility User, or SPP Sponsor, as applicable, which precludes marking such OSS as protectable from public distribution. (3) Submit Software Announcement Notice 241.4 to OSTI. The Contractor must submit Software Announcement Notice (AN) 241.4 (or the current notice as may Section I , Page 54 be required by DOE) to OSTI. In the AN 241.4, the Contractor shall provide the unique URL (i.e. a persistent identifier) from which the s oftware can be obtained so that OSTI can announce the availability of the OSS and the public has access via the URL. (4) Maintain OSS record. The Contractor must maintain a record of all software distributed as OSS. Upon request of the Patent Counsel, the Contractor shall provide the necessary information regarding any or all OSS. (5) Provide public access to the OSS. The Contractor shall ensure that the OSS is publicly accessible as open source via the Contractor's website, Open Source Bulletin Boards operate d by third parties, DOE, or other standard industry methods. (6) Select an OSS license. Each OSS will be distributed pursuant to an OSS license. The Contractor may choose among industry standard OSS licenses or create its own set of Contractor standard licens es.

NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (NNSA) MISSION NNSA is responsible for the management and security of the nation's nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactor programs. It also responds to nuclear and radiological emergencies in the United States and abroad. Additionally, NNSA federal agents provide safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons and components and special nuclear materials along with other missions su pporting national security. NNSA was established by Congress per the NNSA Act (Title XXXII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, Public Law 106-65) as a semiautonomous element within the Department of Energy (DOE). 2.0 M ANAGEMENT & O PERATIONS The NNSA's nuclear security enterprise spans eight sites, including three national laboratories, four plants, and the NNSS. Each site's technical expertise enables NNSA to accomplish its work across NNSA's four mission areas. NNSA relies on Management and Operating (M&O) Contractors to manage day- to-day site operations of its laboratories, production plants, and other facilities in the National Security Enterprise (NSE) in compliance with legal requirements and DOE/NNSA policies. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) (herein referred to as \"SNL\", \"the Laboratory\" or \"the Laboratories\") is operated under an M&O contract, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 17.6. SNL is also a multi- program DOE/NNSA Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), as defined in FAR 35.017, whose primary mission is to function as a nuclear weapons research, development and engineering laboratory. NNSA establishes the work to be accomplished by the Contractor and will provide program and performance direction regarding what NNSA wants in each of its programs. The Contractor is accountable for assuring safe, secure, effective, and efficient operations, and providing directed deliverables in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract. NNSA's M&O Contractors implement NNSA's all -encompassing Stockpile Stewardship Program managed by Defense Programs that includes operations associated with research, development, qualification, and certification efforts as well as surveillance, assessment, maintenance, refurbishment, manufacture and dismantlement of the nuclear weapons stockpile. In addition, there is work managed by the Laboratories that is performed for other sponsors within the DOE, NNSA, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security, and other government agencies, and private industry. 3.0 REQUIREMENTS (MODIFIED 0026) The Contractor shall, with the highest degree of vision, quality, integrity, efficiency, and technical excellence, maintain a strong, multi-disciplinary scientific and engineering capability and technical depth that is responsive to scientific issues of national importance in addition to national security responsibilities, including broadly based programs in such areas as the environment, national infrastructure, health, energy, economic and industrial competitiveness, and science education to achieve the mission. Section J, Appendix A, Page 2 Assigned missions and requirements are dynamic; therefore, this SOW is not intended to be all - inclusive or restrictive, but is intended to provide a broad framework and general scope of the work to be performed at the Laboratories. This SOW does not represent a commitment to, or imply funding for, specific projects or programs. NNSA projects and programs, or other work sponsors, will be authorized individually by NNSA in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract.

For changes to existing benefit plans or establishment of new plans that will not raise costs or long -term liability, 60 day advance notification to the CO is required. 6.1.3 Cost reimbursement for retirement and other bene fit programs sponsored by the Contractor for non- bargaining and bargaining unit employees will be based on conformance with the \"Employee Benefits Value Study\" and \"Employee Benefits Cost Survey Comparison\" requirements as described in 6.1.6.1 and 6.1.6.2 below. 6.1.4 If the Contractor seeks to terminate any non- retirement benefit plan during the term of the Contract, the Contractor must obtain Contracting Officer approval at least 60 days prior to the scheduled date of plan termination. The Contracting Officer will provide approval or disapproval of the proposal no later than 30 days before the scheduled termination, unless the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that additional review time is necessary. 6.1.5 Service Credit for cost reimbursement for employee benefits to include PRB eligibility will be determined in accordance with NNSA Supplemental Directive NA SD O 350.1, M&O Contractor Service Credit Recognition. 6.1.6 Unless otherwise stated, or as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall participate in and/or submit the studies required in paragraphs 6.1.6.1 through 6.1.6.3 below. The studies Section J, Appendix A, Page 35 shall be used by the Contractor in calculating the cost of t he benefits under existing benefit plans. In addition, the Contractor shall submit updated values to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to the adoption of any change that will increase costs to a retirement or other benefit plan. 6.1.6.1 The Consolidated Employee Benefits Value Study for non-bargaining unit employees, shall be completed every two years and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than July 31 of the applicable year. An Employee Benefits Value Study (Ben Val) is an actuarial st udy of the relative value (RV) of the benefits programs offered by the Contractor to employees measured against the RV of benefit programs offered by comparator companies. The Contractor shall use the comparator companies previously used in the last Consol idated Benefit Value Study. If any of the comparator companies no longer participate, the Contractor shall recommend replacement companies for approval by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall include major non -statutory benefit plans offered by the Contractor, including qualified defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) retirement plans; capital accumulation plans; and death, disability, health, and paid time off welfare benefit programs in the Value Study. Any M&O Contractor defined bene fit pension plans and post -retirement benefit plans, closed to new entrants, do not have to be included in the Ben Val measurement. To the extent that the value studies do not address postretirement benefits other than pensions, the Contractor shall provid e a separate cost and plan design data comparison for the postretirement benefits other than pensions using external benchmarks derived from nationally recognized and Contracting Officer approved survey sources. A Ben Val for bargaining unit employees shall be completed six months prior to the end of the collective bargaining agreement. The Ben Val for bargaining unit employees must include at least 15 comparator companies approved by the Contracting Officer. The Ben Val must include major non- statutory benefit plans offered by the Contractor, including qualified DB plans and DC retirement plans; capital accumulation plans; and death, disability, health, and paid time off welfare benefit programs. Any M&O Contractor DB plans, closed to new entrants, do not have to be included in the Ben Val measurement. To the extent that the Ben Val does not address post-retirement benefits other than DB plans, the Contractor shall provide a separate cost and plan design data comparison for the post- retirement benefits ot her than DB plans using external benchmarks derived from nationally recognized and Contracting Officer approved survey sources. 6.1.6.2 When the average net benefit value for non- bargaining employees (including different tiers of benefits or groups of employees) exceeds the comparator group average by more than five percent, Section J, Appendix A, Page 36 the Contractor may be required to provide, for Contracting Officer approval, a Corrective Action Plan describing the specific actions they plan to take to get to 105% within a specified period of time. 6.1.6.3 An Employee Benefits Cost Study Comparison (Cost Study) for non-bargaining and bargaining unit employees shall be completed annually and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than July 31. The Cost Study must use a professionally recognized measure approved by the Contracting Officer that analyzes the Contractor's employee benefits cost for employees on a percent of payroll and compares it with appropriate comparator data. Any M&O Contractor defined benefit pension plans and post- retirement benefit plans, closed to new entrants, do not have to be included in the Benefit Cost study measurement. 6.1.6.4 When the average of the Contractor's Cost Study total benefit costs as a percent of payroll for the non-bargaining employees exceeds the comparator group's total benefit cost by more than five percent the Contractor may be required to provide a Corrective Action Plan describing the specific actions they plan to take to get to 105% within a specified period of time. 6.2 Reports and Information: Benefits 6.2.1 The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer: (i) All data requested to be entered into DOE's iBenefits management system (or any successor database) including but not limited to the Compensation and Benefits Report. 6.3 Workers' Compensation 6.3.1 The Contractor, unless workers' compensation coverage is provided through a state funded arrangement or a corporate benefits program, shall submit to the Contracting Officer for approval all new workers' compensation policies and all initial proposals for self -insurance (Contractors shall provide copies to the Contracting Officer of all renewal policies for workers compensation). 6.3.2 Workers' compensation loss income benefit payments when supplemented by othe r programs (such as salary continuation, short term disability) are to be administered so that the total benefit payments from all sources shall not exceed 100% of employee's net pay. 6.4 Retirement Plans (MODIFIED 0018, REPLACED 0116) ) The Contractor shall carry over the length of service credit and leave balances for Incumbent Employees accrued as of the Base Term in the existing retirement plans. Section J, Appendix A, Page 37 For cost allocability and reimbursement purposes, any DB or DC plans established by the Contractor and any DB or DC plans for which the Contractor assumes sponsorship upon the start of the Base Term, shall be maintained consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA) and any other applicable laws. 6.4.1 Any DB plan maintained by the Contractor, for which NNSA reimburses costs, shall be maintained as a separate DB plan distinct from any other plan that provides credit for service not performed under this Contract. Eac h Contactor D B plan shall be subjected to an ERISA Section 102(a)(3)(c) audit annually, except that every third year the Contractor shall conduct a full- scope audit satisfying ERISA section 103. Alternately, the Contractor may conduct a full- scope audit satisfying ERISA section 103 annually. In years in which a limited-scope audit is conducted, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with a copy of the qualified Trustee or custodian's certification regarding the investment information that provides the basis for the plan sponsor to satisfy reporting requirements under ERISA section 104 along with the copy of the audit results to which they apply. In all cases, the Contractor shall submit the audit results to the Contracting Officer within ten months of the la st day of the pension plan year to which it applies. (REPLACED 0 103) 6.4.2 The Contractor will be reimbursed for DB plan contributions in the amounts necessary to ensure that the plans are funded to meet the annual minimum required contribution under ERISA, as amended. If an additional DB plan contribution over and above the minimum required contribution would have the effect of avoiding benefit restrictions to DB plan participants, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer at least 60 days prior to th e date the payment would be due. Reimbursement above the annual ERISA required minimum contribution will require prior approval of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will take into consideration all pre-funding balances and funding standard c arryover balances when evaluating whether to approve reimbursement above the minimum required contribution. The timing and amount of contributions to the plan will be made to satisfy the Section 430 of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 302 of ERISA and avoiding any penalties associated with contributions made after a required installment date. 6.4.3 The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's advance written approval for any proposed changes to DB and/or DC plans that are not required by law and that may increase costs and/or liabilities. The Contractor shall submit the proposal at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of the change(s).

The analysis should also describe the potential impact on the plan's qualified status at present and the potential impact of the special programs on the qualified status through the duration of the Contract. 6.4.3.1 For proposed changes to DB and DC plans that are not mandated by law and which increase plan costs and/or liabilities, the Contractor shall provide the following to the Contracting Officer: (i) A clean copy of the current plan document (as conformed to show all prior plan amendm ents), with the proposed changes identified using redlines/strikeouts; (ii) An analysis of the impact of any proposed changes on actuarial accrued liabilities and an analysis of relative benefit value and a cost study index; (iii) Except in circumstances where the Contracting Officer indicates that it is unnecessary, a legal explanation of the proposed changes from the Contractor's legal counsel for purposes of compliance with all legal requirements applicable to private sector DB/DC plans; (iv) The Summary Plan Description; and (v) Any such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer. 6.4.3.2 When changes to DB and/or DC plans are required by law, or the changes do not increase costs or liabilities under the plan(s), the Contractor must provide a copy of the current plan document (as conformed to show all prior plan amendments), with the proposed new amendment indicated in redline/strikeout no later than 60 days before the new amendment is proposed to take effect. 6.4.4 When operations at a designated NNSA facility are terminated and no further work is to occur under the Contract, the following apply: 6.4.4.1 No further benefits for service shall accrue; 6.4.4.2 The Contractor shall provide a determination statement in Section J, Appendix A, Page 39 its settlement proposal, defining and identifying all liabilities and assets attributable to the NNSA Contract; 6.4.4.3 The Contractor shall base its DB plan liabilities attributable to NNSA Contract work on the market value of annuities or dispose of such lia bilities through a competitive purchase of annuities. The Contractor, as DB plan sponsor, must adhere to Department of Labor guidance set forth at 29 CFR 2509.95-1 regarding selection of an annuity provider for the purpose of benefit distributions from a D B plan; 6.4.4.4 Assets shall be determined using the \"accrual -basis market value\" on the date of termination of operations. 6.4.4.5 The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall establish an effective date for spinoff or retirement plan termination. On the same day a s the Contractor notifies the IRS of the spinoff or termination of a DB plan, all NNSA assets assigned to a spun - off or terminating DB plan shall be placed in a low- risk liability matching portfolio until the successor trustee, or an insurance company, is able to assume stewardship of those assets. The portfolio shall be rated no lower than Standard & Poor's \"AA.\" (REPLACED 0018) 6.4.5 Terminating Plans 6.4.5.1 If the Contractor seeks to terminate any retirement plan during the term of the Contract, the Contractor must obtain Contracting Officer approval no later than 120 days prior to the scheduled date of plan termination. The Contracting Officer will provide approval or disapproval of the proposal no later than 90 days before the scheduled date of plan termination, unless the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that additional review time is necessary. 6.4.5.2 To the extent possible, the Contractor shall satisfy DB plan liabilities to plan participants by the purchase of annuities through competitive bidding on the open annuity market or through lump sum payouts. The Contractor, as DB plan sponsor, must adhere to Department of Labor guidance set forth at 29 CFR 2509.95-1 regarding selection of an annuity provider for the purpose of benefit distributions from a DB plan. With respect to standard plan terminations, the Contractor must adhere to all Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation regulations regarding the termination of a DB plan. Section J, Appendix A, Page 40 6.4.5.3 Funds to be paid or transferred to any party as a result of settlements relating to DB plan termination or reassignment shall accrue interest from the effective date of termination or reassignment until the date of payment or transfer. 6.4.5.4 If ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code prevents a full transfer of excess NNSA reimbursed assets from the terminated DB plan, the Contractor shall pay any deficiency directly to NNSA according to a schedule of payments to be negotiated by the Parties. 6.4.5.5 On the same day as the Contractor notifies the IRS of the DB plan termination, all NNSA plan assets will be placed in a low -risk liability matching portfolio until full disposition of the terminating DB plan's liabilities. The portfolio shall be rated no lower than Standard & Po or's \"AA.\" 6.4.5.6 NNSA liability to a commingled DB plan shall not exceed that portion which corresponds to participants' service accrued for their work under an NNSA Contract. The NNSA shall have no other liability to the plan, to the plan sponsor, or to the DB plan participants. 6.4.5.7 After all liabilities of the DB plan are satisfied, the Contractor shall return to NNSA an amount equaling the asset reversion from the DB plan termination and any earnings that accrue on that amount because of a delay in the payment to NNSA. Such amount and such earnings shall be subject to NNSA audit. To affect the purposes of this paragraph, NNSA and the Contractor may stipulate to a schedule of payments. 6.4.6 Post Contract Responsibilities for Retirement and Other Benefit Plans 6.4.6.1 If this Contract expires or terminates and NNSA has awarded a Contract under which the new Contractor becomes a sponsor and assumes responsibility for management and administration of the retirement or other benefit plans covering active or retired Contr actor employees with respect to service, the Contractor shall cooperate and transfer to the new Contractor its responsibility for sponsorship, management, and administration of the plans consistent with direction from the Contracting Officer.

(ii) Bargain in good faith with NNSA or the successor Contractor to determine the assumptions and methods for establishing the liabilities involved in a spinoff. NNSA and the Contractor(s) shall establish an effective date of spinoff. On the same day as the Contractor notifies the IRS of the DB plan spinoff, all NNSA plan assets assigned to a spun-off plan shall be placed in a low -risk liability matching portfolio until the successor trustee is able to assume stewardship of those assets. The portfolio shall be rated no lower than Standard & Poor's \"AA.\" (REPLACED 0018) 6.4.6.2 If this Contract expires or terminates and NNSA has not awarded a contract to a new Contractor under which the new Contractor becomes a sponsor and assumes responsibility for management and administration of the retirement or benefit plans, or if the Contracting Officer determines that the scope of work under the Contract has been completed (any one such event may be deemed by the Contracting Officer to be \"Contract completion\" for purposes of this paragraph), whichever is earlier, and notwithstanding any other obligations and requirements concerning expiration or termination elsewhere in this Contract, the following actions shall occur regarding the Contractor's obligations regarding the plans at the time of Contract completion: (i) Subject to paragraph 6.4.6.2 (ii) below, and notwithstanding any legal obligations independent of the Contract that the Contractor may have regarding responsibilities for sponsorship, management, and administration of the plans, the Contractor shall remain the sponsor of the plans, in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (ii) The parties shall exercise their best efforts to reach agreement on the Contractor's responsibilities for sponsorship, management and administration of the plans prior to or at the time of Contract completion. However, if the parties Section J, Appendix A, Page 42 have not reached agreement on the Contractor's responsibilities for sponsorship, management and administration of the plans prior to or at the time of Contract completion, unless and until such agreement is reached, the Contractor shall comply with written direction from the Contracting Officer regarding the Contractor's responsibilities for continued provision of retirement and welfare benefits under the plans, including but not limited to continued sponsorship of the plans, in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Contract No. DE -NA0003525 Modification 166 Attachment 2 Page 5 of 19 SUBCONTRACTING PLAN OVERVIEW The National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC (NTESS) Small Business (SB) Subcontracting Plan communicates the goals and methods supporting flow-down requirements in accordance FAR 52.219-9 entitled \"Small Business Subcontracting Plan.\" Focus is placed on NTESS, a single purpose operating affiliate of Honeywell, which has established goals and will manage achievement of those goals through monitoring, measuring, and feedback analysis of administrative responsibilities, performance results, and small business outreach. The goals and results reported in this SB Subcontracting Plan are based on subcontracting activities associated with the Management and Operating (M&O) contract at Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia). The integration of SB is not something NTESS does simply to meet National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) expectations; it is an important part of Honeywell's and its teaming subcontractors' culture and values. NTESS is solely owned by Honeywell. Teaming subcontractors are also represented by Universities Research Association, In c., Peraton, Inc., Sandia Technical Partners LLC, and Longenecker and Associates Inc. The Small Business Program Manager and Supplier Diversity team help procurement personnel to identify potential opportunities for small business placement and provides a ssistance with tools, processes, systems, and training so that we are connected with the SB supply base and encourage engagement of SBs across the full contract scope. NTESS seeks capable small, small disadvantaged (SDB), women -owned (WOSB), HUBZone, veteran -owned (VOSB), and service- disabled veteran -owned (SDVOB) businesses to successfully support our mission at Sandia. SB subcontracting results are achieved through procurement strategy and business outreach. We incorporate outreach as a strategy to be involved in the business community and identify new supplier sources. NTESS will be actively engaged with affiliate organizations that help us accomplish outreach objectives throughout the year. Our objective is for NTESS's engagement with SB development to be incorporated into all phases of our supply chain management processes. NTESS' core values include a commitment to ensure SB participation in significant and complex aspects of the site's mission. We believe that such SB participation will support project goals, positively affect the local and regional communities, and provide a foundation for growth and expansion. Each line manager is personally responsible and accountable for using SB concerns within their areas of responsibility. We mea sure their performance against the goals as part of their performance evaluations. NTESS's approach is built on the belief that SBs should receive a durable benefit from supporting meaningful aspects of operations where their skills, innovation, and acume n allow us to safely accomplish the Sandia mission. Examples include identifying needed support of existing scope, including more challenging tasks/projects (e.g., design tasks, testing, and support to cutting edge R&D activities) and establishing a long- term based presence (e.g., environmental compliance support). Contract No. DE -NA0003525 Modification 166 Attachment 2 Page 6 of 19 We have identified two SB concerns in this proposal that will perform services under the Sandia M&O contract. Sandia Technical Partners (STP) is a joint venture of four New Mexico -based SBs with a variety of technical capabilities aligned to Sandia mission areas. The partners are Los Alamos Technical Associates (LATA); Strategic Management Associates, Inc. (SMSI); Innovative Technology Partnerships (ITP); and Sigma Sciences, Inc. (SSI). We will employ STP on projects relating to the members' core competencies. Longenecker & Associates, a WOSB, will support Sandia safety, quality, and project delivery activities. One of the ways that we plan to increase SB participation is through implementation of a Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program utilizing the Department of Energy (DOE) Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program. NTESS's program will seek SB concerns that have been in business for at least two years and have not previously participated in a Department of Energy (DOE) Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Through this approach, we provide fair opportunities for established SB concerns to enhance their operational skills. We will select prospective prot\u00e9g\u00e9s based on specific Sandia mission needs and ongoing/projected work scope. For example, we will seek prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the areas of research and development (advanced materials, bioscience, na nodevices), cybersecurity, waste management, project management/project controls, and environmental, safety, health, and quality compliance. Our selection criteria include: (1) qualified as a SB and/or other socioeconomic category; (2) eligible to work under a government contract; and (3) demonstrated ownership and management commitment. We commit to establish up to three DOE Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (MP) agreements within the first five years of the contract period of performance. Each agreement will consist of two (2) base years, with three (3) one-year option periods, with mutual agreement of both parties. Total time in the program, including the exercise of any options, will not exceed five (5) years. This timeframe allows sufficient time to establish clear, a chievable goals for our prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and maintain focus on their development progress through opportunities that support mission needs. This approach also allows us to continue to provide Mentor- Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 opportunities to other capable SB concerns. We will men tor our SB prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to help them strengthen their core competencies; recommend improvements to financial, administrative, and other functions/systems; and help them prepare for additional work. If necessary, we will use a variety of tools to locate and use SB entities from a variety of categories, from the local area as well as across the state and nationwide. NTESS will leverage the small business program knowledge and performance of Honeywell to ensure that the Sandia SB Plan meets or exceeds the established goals. Plan Type: Individual Subcontracting Plan All elements are developed specifically for the entire contract period of performance (including earned option terms) of this contract. Projected dollar and percentage goals are based on subcontracting activities associated with NTESS' contract (DE -NA0003525) with NNSA. SECTION I: GOALS In accordance with DEAR 970.1907-4 Subcontracting Plan Requirements, NTESS will submit proposed subcontracting goals 60 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year during the term of this contract, or by such Contract No. DE -NA0003525 Modification 166 Attachment 2 Page 7 of 19 other date authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. The goals will be negotiated once each fiscal year and the agreement between NTESS and the Contracting Officer will be communicated in writing. This submittal will include subcontracting goals for SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB; all are collectively referred to as \"small business concerns.\" Goals are based on separate dollars and percentages for each small business concern category as specified in FAR 52.219- 9. Subcontracting dollars with Alaskan Native Corporations (ANC) and Indian Tribes are counted towards achievement of subcontracting goals for small business and small disadvantaged business concerns, regardle ss of the size or SBA certification status of the ANC or Indian Tribe. DEAR 970.1907- 4, Subcontracting Plan Requirements states: \"Pursuant to the clause at 48 CFR 52.219- 9 Small Business Subcontracting Plan, which is required for all management and operating contracts, each management and operating contract shall include a subcontracting plan which is effective for the term of the contract. Goals for the contract shall be negotiated annually when revised funding levels are determined. The plan should include provisions for revising the goals or any other sections of the plan. Such revisions shall be in writing, approved by the contracting officer, and shall be specifically made a material part of the contract.\" The partial -FY2017 proposed goals outlined in this section are based on the estimated budget and forecast of procurement requirements, including those for Large Business (LB) concerns. We have used Sandia Corporation's FY 2016 plan goals as the baseline for this plan. Dollar values in thi s plan reflect the five -month period of performance in FY 2017, preceding Transition term, and start of the Base term of the Contract. NTESS will ensure ethical and accurate reporting standards in support of the goals proposed in this Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Our good faith effort to achieve small business subcontracting goals includes on- going commitment and involvement with small businesses through outreach efforts both at the local and national levels. I.A.1. Proposed Small Business Goals SB goals, shown in Figure SB -1, are expressed in terms of a percentage of total planned subcontracting dollars. The proposed goals are applicable to the contract period of performance in accordance with DEAR 970.1907- 4, Subcontracting Plan Requirements . In developing these goals, we considered the site's historical performance in each category, our parent company's lists of subcontractors, and our ability to quickly expand our SB suppliers list by identifying more SBs. As shown in Figure SB-2a, NTESS commits to raising its overall small business goals by 2% per year for the first five years of the contract to 60% by FY 2022; small business socio-economic categories may be renegotiated annually per DEAR 970.1907- 4. Figure SB -2b, shows the neg otiated goals . The goal forecast is prepared from this subcontracting dollar base and is adjusted by allowable M&O subcontracting exclusions for subcontract dollars with foreign- owned businesses, parent company affiliate businesses, exclusions consistent with 13 CFR 125.3 and exclusions designated by the Contracting Officer.

The results of that survey, as shown in Figure SB -4, confirmed that the SB community is capable of meeting requirements across a significan t fraction of Sandia's work areas. NTESS' goal is to subcontract with all SB concerns in all potential categories to the maximum extent possible. NTESS will update the results of this survey periodically to ensure that all viable SB suppliers are given appropriate consideration. Figure SB-4 provides the principal supplies and services planned for subcontracting to SB concerns. NTESS's goal is to use SB concerns to the maximum extent possible within each applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and SB socioeconomic category. Figure SB-4.

E. 1 Method Used to Identify Potential Sources for Solicitation Purposes NTESS will work closely with local, state, and national sources such as Chambers of Commerce, SB development organizations and trade associations to develop a valid and dynamic source list of capable small businesses. NTESS will rely on the information contained in System for Award Management (SAM) found at https://www.sam.gov as an accurate representation of a SB concern's size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a SB source list. In circumstances where a subcontractor is not registered in SAM, NTESS will leverage its existing Supplier Data Sheet process. In addition to the SAM website, NTESS will participate in outreach activities, utilize the SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search Tool, and publicize our subcontracting opportunities on Internet resources such as the DOE Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization's acquisition forecast. NTESS will also participate in regional and national socioeconomic trade fairs when possible, to identify new potential small business sources. Sources we will use to locate small business concerns include - Sandia's Business Opportunity Website DOE Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization NNSA Small Business Program Albuquerque, NM Chambers of Commerce Livermore, CA Chambers of Commerce Hispanic, Native American, and African American Chambers of Commerce Livermore, CA Hispanic and Asian Chambers of Commerce Albuquerque and Livermore Women's Chamber of Commerce Albuquerque Small Business Development Center Southwest Minority Supplier Development Council Honeywell nation- wide Supplier Diversity Programs SECTION I.F.1 Indirect Cost Statement Indirect costs are not included in the SB concerns goals established in this subcontracting plan.
