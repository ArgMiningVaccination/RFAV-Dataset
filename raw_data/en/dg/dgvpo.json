And yet, the trickiest part of the practice seems to be identifying which option makes the most sense for the emotions at hand, especially when leading up to a wedding, they can range from breathtaking anxiety to foot-tapping excitement. To take the guesswork out of it, we turned to Andi Scarbrough, founder of [CrownWorks](https://crownworks.net/shop-3/), the Santa Monica-based brand known for its oft-sold out crystal comb collection. \"A wedding is a landscape ripe for the full spectrum of emotions,\" Andi says. \"The pre-wedding timeline can be a minefield of anxieties\u2014planning squabbles with your beloved, managing Aunt Angie's relentless negativity, warding off invasive nightmare in-laws, and exes popping up from past lives to say \"hey\" (like . . . how do they always know?). Crystals can offer a vibrational support and inspiration for your big day and beyond.\" According to Andi, many cultures have pre-wedding energetic clearing practices like ritual baths, offerings for ancestral blessings, and purification ceremonies to guarantee the next phase of life starts with a clean slate. Energetic stones \"can help tidy up any energies you may not want to carry into the marriage, and also keep one calm, focused, and even amplify joy so that you prepare for and enter into your day with your auric field as pristine as your gown.\" Below, her official bridal guide to healing crystals, covering everything from the stress of planning to the sheer joy of the after-party. IF YOU WANT TO FEEL ROCK SOLID: These stones help one stay grounded, feel centered, stable, and keep bad energy away during venue meetings, guest list drafting, and other potentially charged situations: HEMATITE: a negativity vacuum. The most powerful grounding and protection stone, hematite acts like kevlar to negativity, absorbing the bad into itself instead and granting a sense of calm, stability, and clear headedness to the holder. BLACK TOURMALINE: speak now or forever hold your peace. Black tourmaline is a protective stone that wards off and deflects negative energy\u2014unless that negativity is coming from the inside. It can also bring to the surface any incomplete lessons or patterns that are asking to be cleared in order to move forward in peace. If an ex has popped up and wants to talk to you, or there are tensions with a certain family member, this stone may help you finalize what you need to learn from those relationships and release the past once and for all. SMOKY QUARTZ: the magic maker. An energetic \"transmuter,\" it takes in negative energy from the environment and returns it as positive. This is a great stone to use in conversations or planning sessions that may be difficult to navigate or possibly emotionally charged (like guest lists) to help find a solution all can feel good about. PYRITE: can't throw shade at this sparkle. Otherwise known as Fool's Gold, this glimmering stone often used in abundance manifestations and aids in making challenging financial decisions while offering protection in business dealings. Its masculine energy is very action oriented and increases vitality to keep the energy moving forward in a wise, stable, informed way. FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION: Communication is everything\u2014both in wedding planning and in marriage\u2014and these stones help open the throat chakra for clearer self-expression. CHRYSOCOLLA: a stone of heart centered communication. Packing all the mama goddess vibes\u2014softness, calm and comfort, along with strength and (loving) boundaries\u2014this stone has been used ceremoniously as women pass from one life phase into another, and would be an equally sweet gift for a flower girl or mom. LAPIS LAZULI: speak your truth. The mega magic for an open throat chakra, this stone helps grant the power, clarity, and courage to speak one's own personal truth. Also used in ancient holy rituals and favored by nobility, this crystal is said to symbolize divine guidance. KYANITE: a stone of foresight. Enhancing intuition and opening up deeper levels of empathy and gentle communication, kyanite helps create bridges across gaps of understanding, and may be great for aligning you and your beloved's vision of your perfect day. AMAZONITE: a deeply harmonizing and soothing stone. Bringing peaceful resolutions, amazonite increases our aptitude to come into alignment with our core values, and stand by them, no matter what. This crystal helps move through any fear or judgment, and creates a strong sense of diplomacy. IF YOU WANT TO BE ZEN: Staying mellow in the chaos may require backup . . . and good sleep! These crystals help keep stress levels to a dull roar so you can rest easy leading up to the big day. LEPIDOLITE: moderately non-addictive. Crystal Shaman Colleen McCann, author of [Crystal RX](https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Rx-Rituals-Cultivating-Achieving/dp/006284444X), calls this stone \"the Xanax of the mineral kingdom.\" Meditate with this stone of tranquility on your third eye to ease over thinking and get out of anxiety loops, or place it bedside or under a pillow for deep restful sleep. FLUORITE: the mind cleaner. Amazing for calming an over-busy mind, fluorite is tuned with the element of air, lifting confusion, brain fog, or indecision by offering a higher perspective. From this place, we can hatch great ideas, receive higher guidance, and feel peaceful and rejuvenated. SELENITE: the everlasting good vibe. A champion among the mineral kingdom, selenite offers a constant, unending flow of highest light energy to any person or space. In addition, this stone is used to \"grid\" or anchor a room for positivity, optimism, love, and laughter. Think about it like an air purifier for energy. Keep one by a front entrance and one by the back door of a home to keep the flow of positivity streaming. It's great for high traffic areas, potentially stressful situations, and some people love it for vanquishing bad dreams (but some extra sensitive types find its high frequency a little too energizing for deep sleep.) TO TURN UP THE LOVE: Amplify the joy on the big day by incorporating these stones into decorations, guest favors, or personal crystal grids for hear-to-heart connections. ROSE QUARTZ: unyielding love. There is no other stone more widely known and recognized for expanding a sense of love and well-being than this crystal. It lifts and dissolves fear, jealousy, anger, and resentment and opens and clears the heart chakra for deep meaningful connections. Using Rose Quartz as table decorations or favors could be one way to ensure everyone has a lovely time. CLEAR QUARTZ: the master amplifier. Not just a mystical wonder, clear quartz has also been utilized from ancient history to modern technology for its ability to amplify, focus, and direct energy. Think of it as a magnifying glass\u2014it pairs beautifully with all other stones, and quartz \"seed crystals\" are often used in creating intention grids with other stones. CITRINE: unfiltered joy. Positive radiance as bright as the sun itself, citrine promotes happy, blissful feelings of wonder and childlike glee. Associated largely with the lower chakra systems, this stone is all about finding the pleasure in the human experience, so eat, drink, and be married. IF YOU WANT A HIGH ENERGY AFTER-PARTY: Keep the energy up for the honeymoon and beyond with these all-stars for longevity in passion and vitality. CARNELIAN: pleasure. Warning: carnelian may enhance fertility! This is the stone to use when the desire is, well . . . desire. Its name comes from the word \"flesh,\" and it brings the heat to a stimulate a healthy libido. It also promotes motivation, courage and endurance. GARNET: unending fire. A deeply grounding and protective stone, garnet promotes a sense of stability and security. It offers supreme protection, and some ancient warriors even believed it made them invincible to wounding. It holds the heat of the primordial fire, ever able to create and recreate as time goes on. RUBY: long may they reign. This crystal has been treasured throughout time not only for its fiery radiance, but for its promotion of longevity, protection, and prosperity. Ruby is said to activate blood flow for both heart health and increased sensuality. Supportive in generating life-force energy, it imbues a sense of determination, confidence, and abundance, making it a favorite in wedding ceremonies and gifts. "}
