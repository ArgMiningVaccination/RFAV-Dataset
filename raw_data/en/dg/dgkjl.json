Reexamining the ethical tenets of medical practice and their application in newcircumstances is a necessary exercise. The fifth edition of theCollege's Ethics Manual covers emerging issues in medical ethicsand revisits old ones. It reflects on many of the ethical tensionsfaced by internists and their patients and attempts to shed lighton how existing principles extend to emerging concerns. In addi-tion, by reiterating ethical principles that have provided guidancein resolving past ethical problems, the Manual may help physi- cians avert future problems. The Manual is not a substitute for theexperience and integrity of individual physicians, but it may serve as a reminder of the shared obligations and duties of the medicalprofession.

The secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient. -Francis Weld Peabody (1) Some aspects of medicine are fundamental and timeless. Medical practice, however, does not stand still. Clini- cians must be prepared to deal with changes and reafrmwhat is fundamental. This fth edition of the Ethics Man-ual examines emerging issues in medical ethics and revisitsolder issues that are still very pertinent. Changes to theManual since the 1998 edition include new or expandedsections on professionalism, the physician and patient,third-party evaluations, condentiality, complementaryand alternative care, boundaries and privacy, gifts frompatients, care of patients at the end of life, solid organtransplantation, physician-assisted suicide, the changingpractice environment and managed care ethics, physician-industry issues, selling products out of the ofce, healthand human rights, patient safety, prisoners as patients,strikes and joint actions, consultation and shared care, andresearch ethics. A case method for ethics decision making isincluded (Appendix). The Manual is intended to facilitate the process of making ethical decisions in clinical practice and medicalresearch and to describe and explain underlying principlesof decision making. Because ethics must be understoodwithin a historical and cultural context, the second editionof the Manual included a brief overview of the cultural,philosophical, and religious underpinnings of medical eth-ics. In this edition, we refer the reader to that overview (2,3) and to other sources (4-9) that more fully explore therich heritage of medical ethics. The Manual raises ethical issues and presents general guidelines. In applying these guidelines, physicians shouldconsider the circumstances of the individual patient at issueand use their best judgment. Physicians have moral andlegal obligations, and the two may not be concordant. Phy- sician participation in torture is legal in some countries butis never morally defensible. Physicians must keep in mindthe distinctions and potential conflicts between legal andethical obligations when making clinical decisions andshould seek counsel when they are concerned about thepotential legal consequences of decisions. We refer to thelaw in this Manual for illustrative purposes only; these ref-erences should not be taken as a statement of the law or ofthe legal consequences of a physician's actions, which canvary from state to state. Physicians must develop and main-tain an adequate knowledge of key components of the lawsand regulations that affect their patients and practices. Medical and professional ethics often establish positive duties (that is, what one should do) to a greater extent thanthe law. Current understanding of medical ethics is basedon the principles from which positive duties emerge. Theseprinciples include benecence (a duty to promote goodand act in the best interest of the patient and the health ofsociety) and nonmalecence (the duty to do no harm topatients). Also included is respect for patient autonomy\u2014the duty to protect and foster a patient's free, uncoercedchoices (10). From the principle of respect for autonomyare derived the rules for truth-telling. The relative weightgranted to these principles and the conflicts among themoften account for the ethical dilemmas physicians face.Physicians who will be challenged to resolve those dilem- mas must have such virtues as compassion, courage, andpatience in all aspects of their practice. In addition, considerations of justice must inform the physician's role as citizen and clinical decisions about re-source allocation. The principle of distributive justice re-quires that we seek to equitably distribute the life-enhanc-ing opportunities afforded by health care. How toaccomplish this distribution is the focus of intense debate. *Current and former members of the Ethics and Human Rights Committee who developed this fth edition of the Manual: William E.

Approv ed by the Board of Regents on 17 July 2004.Position Paper 560 \u00a9 2005 American College of PhysiciansMore than ever, concerns about justice challenge the tra- ditional role of physician as patient advocate. The environment for the delivery of health care con- tinues to change. Sites of care are shifting, with progres-sively more care being provided in ambulatory settingswhile the intensity of inpatient care continues to increase.Yet the U.S. health care system does not serve all of itscitizens well, and major reform is needed. Health care -nancing is a serious concern, and society's values will betested in decisions about resource allocation. Ethical issues attract widespread public attention, and debate about them is covered regularly in the press.Through legislation, administrative action, or judicial de-cision, government is increasingly involved in medical eth-ics. Today, the convergence of various forces\u2014scientic advances, patient and public education, the Internet, thecivil rights and consumer movements, the effects of lawand economics on medicine, and the heterogeneity of oursociety\u2014demands that physicians clearly articulate theethical principles that guide their behavior, whether inclinical care, research, and teaching or as citizens. It iscrucial that a responsible physician perspective be heard associetal decisions are made. From genetic testing before conception to dilemmas at the end of life, physicians, patients, and their families arecalled upon to make difcult ethical decisions. The 1970ssaw the development of bioethics as a eld, followed by aseries of reports from the U.S. President's Commission forthe Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedicaland Behavioral Research. Important issues then (and now)include informed consent (11, 12), access to health care(13), genetic screening and engineering (14, 15), and for-going life-sustaining treatment (16, 17). These and otherissues\u2014AIDS, physician-assisted suicide, technologicalchanges including increasing computerization of medicalrecords, and the physician as entrepreneur\u2014challenge usto periodically reconsider such topics as the patient-physi-cian relationship, decisions to limit treatment, and con-dentiality. This Manual was written for our colleagues in medi- cine. The College believes that the Manual provides thebest approach to the challenges addressed in it. We hopethat it will stimulate reasoned debate and serve as a refer-ence for persons who seek the College's position on ethicalissues. Debates about medical ethics may also stimulatecritical evaluation and discussion of law and public policyon the difcult ethical issues facing patients, physicians,and society. Professionalism Medicine is not a trade to be learned, but a profession to be entered (1). A profession is characterized by a spe-cialized body of knowledge that its members must teachand expand, by a code of ethics and a duty of service thatput patient care above self-interest, and by the privilege ofself-regulation granted by society (18). Physicians must in-dividually and collectively fulll the duties of the profes- sion. While outside influences on medicine and the pa-tient-physician relationship are many, the ethicalfoundations of the profession must remain in sharp focus(19). THEPHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT The patient-physician relationship entails special obli- gations for the physician to serve the patient's interest be-cause of the specialized knowledge that physicians possessand the imbalance of power caused by the medical rela-tionship. The physician's primary commitment must always be to the patient's welfare and best interests, whether the phy-sician is preventing or treating illness or helping patients tocope with illness, disability, and death. The physician mustrespect the dignity of all persons and respect their unique-ness. The interests of the patient should always be pro-moted regardless of nancial arrangements; the health caresetting; or patient characteristics such as decision-makingcapacity or social status. At the beginning of and throughout the patient-phy- sician relationship, the physician must work toward an un-derstanding of the patient's health problems, concerns,goals, and expectations. After patient and physician agreeon the problem and the goal of therapy, the physician presents one or more courses of action. If both partiesagree, the patient may authorize the physician to initiate acourse of action; the physician can then accept that respon-sibility. The relationship has mutual obligations. The phy-sician must be professionally competent, act responsibly,seek consultation when necessary, and treat the patientwith compassion and respect, and the patient should par-ticipate responsibly in the care, including giving informedconsent or refusal to care as the case might be. Effectivecommunication is critical to a strong patient-physician re-lationship. Communication through means such as e-mailcan supplement face-to-face encounters; however, it mustbe done under appropriate guidelines (20), and it may notbe effective for some patients. Care and respect should guide the performance of the physical examination. The location and degree of privacyshould be appropriate for the examination being per-formed. A chaperone should be offered to the patient orrequested by the physician for physical examinations asneeded. An appropriate setting and sufcient time shouldbe allocated to encourage exploration of aspects of the pa-tient's life pertinent to health, including habits, relation-ships, sexuality, vocation, religion, and spirituality. Although the physician should be fairly compensated for services rendered, a sense of duty to the patient shouldtake precedence over concern about compensation.Position Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 561Initiating and Discontinuing the Patient-Physician Relationship By history, tradition, and professional oath, physicians have a moral obligation to provide care for ill persons.Although this obligation is collective, each individual phy-sician is obliged to do his or her fair share to ensure that allill persons receive appropriate treatment (21). A physicianmay not discriminate against a class or category of patients. An individual patient-physician relationship is formed on the basis of mutual agreement. In the absence of apreexisting relationship, the physician is not ethicallyobliged to provide care to an individual person unless noother physician is available, as is the case in some isolatedcommunities or when emergency treatment is required.Under these circumstances, the physician is morally boundto provide care and, if necessary, to arrange for properfollow-up. Physicians may also be bound by contract toprovide care to beneciaries of health plans in which theyparticipate. Physicians and patients may have different concepts of the meaning and resolution of medical problems. The careof the patient and satisfaction of both parties are bestserved if physician and patient discuss their expectationsand concerns. Although the physician must address thepatient's concerns, he or she is not required to violatefundamental personal values, standards of medical care orethical practice, or the law. When the patient's beliefs\u2014religious, cultural, or otherwise\u2014run counter to medicalrecommendations, the physician is obliged to try to under-stand clearly the beliefs and the viewpoints of the patient.If the physician cannot carry out the patient's wishes afterseriously attempting to resolve differences, the physicianshould consider transferring the care of the patient. Under exceptional circumstances, the physician may discontinue the professional relationship, provided that ad-equate care is available elsewhere and the patient's health isnot jeopardized in the process. The physician should notifythe patient in writing and obtain patient approval to trans-fer the medical records to another physician. Continuity ofcare must be assured. Abandonment is unethical and acause of action under the law. Physician-initiated termina-tion is a serious event, especially if the patient is acutely ill,and should be undertaken only after genuine attempts aremade to understand and resolve differences. A patient isfree to change physicians at any time and is entitled to theinformation contained in the medical records. Third-Party Evaluations Seeing patients on behalf of a third party, as an indus- try-employed physician or an independent medical exam- iner, raises distinct ethical issues regarding the patient-physician relationship. Within these contexts, thephysician should disclose to the patient when an examina-tion is being undertaken on behalf of a third party; ensurethat the patient is aware that traditional aspects of thepatient-physician relationship, including condentiality,might not apply; obtain the examinee's consent to the ex- amination and to the disclosure of the results to the thirdparty; exercise appropriate independent medical judgment,free from the influence of the third party; and inform theexaminee of the examination results and encourage her orhim to see another physician if those results suggest theneed for medical consultation (22, 23). Confidentiality Condentiality is a fundamental tenet of medical care. It is increasingly difcult to maintain in this era of com-puterized record keeping and electronic data processing,e-mail, faxing of patient information, third-party paymentfor medical services, and sharing of patient care amongnumerous health professionals and institutions. Conden-tiality is a matter of respecting the privacy of patients, encouraging them to seek medical care and discuss theirproblems candidly, and preventing discrimination on thebasis of their medical conditions. The physician should notrelease a patient's personal medical information (oftentermed a \"privileged communication\") without that pa-tient's consent. However, condentiality, like other ethical duties, is not absolute. It may have to be overridden to protect in-dividuals or the public or to disclose or report informationwhen the law requires it. The physician should make everyeffort to discuss the issues with the patient. If breachingcondentiality is necessary, it should be done in a way thatminimizes harm to the patient and that heeds applicablefederal and state law. Physicians should be aware of the increased risk for invasion of patient privacy and should help ensure con-dentiality. They should be aware of state and federal legalrequirements, including the Health Insurance Portabilityand Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy rule (24,25). Within their own institutions, physicians shouldadvocate policies and procedures to secure the condenti-ality of patient records. To uphold professionalism and protect patient pri- vacy, clinicians should limit discussion of patients and pa-tient care issues to professional encounters. Discussion ofpatients by professional staff in public places such as eleva-tors or cafeterias violates condentiality and is unethical.Outside of an educational setting, discussion of patientswith or near persons who are not involved in the care ofthose patients impairs the public's trust and condence inthe medical profession. Physicians of patients who are wellknown to the public should remember that they are notfree to discuss or disclose information about any patient'shealth without the explicit consent of the patient. In the care of the adolescent patient, family support is important. However, this support must be balanced withcondentiality and respect for the adolescent's autonomyin health care decisions and in relationships with healthcare providers (26). Physicians should be knowledgeableabout state laws governing the right of adolescent patientsPosition Paper Ethics Manual 562 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgto condentiality and the adolescent's legal right to consent to treatment. Occasionally, a physician receives information from a patient's friends or relatives and is asked to withhold thesource of that information from the patient (27). The phy-sician is not obliged to keep such secrets from the patient.The informant should be urged to address the patient di-rectly and to encourage the patient to discuss the informa-tion with the physician. The physician should use sensitiv-ity and judgment in deciding whether to use theinformation and whether to reveal its source to the patient.The physician should always act in the best interests of thepatient. The Patient and the Medical Record Medical records should contain accurate and complete information. Ethically and legally, patients have the rightto know what is in their medical records. Legally, the ac-tual chart is the property of the physician or institution,although the information in the chart is the property of thepatient. Most states have laws that guarantee the patientpersonal access to the medical record, as does the federalHIPAA privacy rule. The physician must release informa-tion to the patient or to a third party at the request of thepatient. Information may not be withheld because of non-payment of medical bills. Physicians should retain the orig-inal of the medical record and respond to a patient's re-quest with copies or summaries as appropriate unless theoriginal record is required. To protect condentiality, in-formation should be released only with the written permis-sion of the patient or the patient's legally authorized rep-resentative, or as required under applicable law. If a physician leaves a group practice or dies, patients must be notied and records forwarded according to pa-tient instructions. Disclosure To make health care decisions and work intelligently in partnership with the physician, the patient must be wellinformed. Effective patient-physician communication candispel uncertainty and fear and enhance healing and pa-tient satisfaction. Information should be disclosed when-ever it is considered material to the patient's understandingof his or her situation, possible treatments, and probableoutcomes. This information often includes the costs andburdens of treatment, the experience of the proposed cli-nician, the nature of the illness, and potential treatments. However uncomfortable for the clinician, information that is essential to and desired by the patient must bedisclosed. How and when to disclose information, and towhom, are important concerns that must be addressed withrespect for patient wishes. Western tradition focuses on therights of the individual and full and detailed disclosure.Some patients, however, may make it known that theyprefer limited information, or disclosure to family mem-bers (28). Information should be given in terms that the patientcan understand. The physician should be sensitive to the patient's responses in setting the pace of communication,particularly if the illness is very serious. Disclosure and thecommunication of health information should never be amechanical or perfunctory process. Upsetting news and in-formation should be presented to the patient in a way thatminimizes distress (29, 30). If the patient cannot compre-hend his or her condition, it should be fully disclosed to anappropriate surrogate. In addition, physicians should disclose to patients in- formation about procedural or judgment errors made inthe course of care if such information is material to thepatient's well-being. Errors do not necessarily constituteimproper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure todisclose them may. Informed Consent The patient's consent allows the physician to provide care. The unauthorized touching of a person is battery,even in the medical setting. Consent may be either ex-pressed or implied. Expressed consent most often occurs inthe hospital setting, where patients provide written or oralconsent for a particular procedure. In many medical en-counters, when the patient presents to a physician for eval-uation and care, consent can be presumed. The underlyingcondition and treatment options are explained to the pa-tient or authorized surrogate and treatment is rendered orrefused. In medical emergencies, consent to treatment thatis necessary to maintain life or restore health is usuallyimplied unless it is known that the patient would refuse theintervention. The doctrine of informed consent goes beyond the question of whether consent was given for a treatment orintervention. Rather, it focuses on the content and processof consent. The physician is required to provide enoughinformation to allow a patient to make an informed judg-ment about how to proceed. The physician's presentationshould be understandable to the patient and should in-clude the physician's recommendation. The patient's orsurrogate's concurrence must be free and uncoerced. The principle and practice of informed consent rely on patients to ask questions when they are uncertain about theinformation they receive; to think carefully about theirchoices; and to be forthright with their physicians abouttheir values, concerns, and reservations about a particularrecommendation. Once patients and physicians decide ona course of action, patients should make every reasonableeffort to carry out the aspects of care that are in theircontrol or to inform their physicians promptly if it is notpossible to do so. The physician is obligated to ensure that the patient or the surrogate is adequately informed about the nature ofthe patient's medical condition and the objectives of, alter-natives to, possible outcomes of, and risks involved with aproposed treatment. All adult patients are considered competent to makePosition Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 563decisions about medical care unless a court declares them incompetent. In clinical practice, however, physicians andfamily members usually make decisions without a formalcompetency hearing in the court for patients who lack de-cision-making capacity (that is, the ability to receive andexpress information and to make a choice consonant withthat information and one's values). This clinical approachcan be ethically justied if the physician has carefully de-termined that the patient is incapable of understanding thenature of the proposed treatment; the alternatives to it; andthe risks, benets, and consequences of it. Assessing a pa-tient's understanding can be difcult. Decision-making ca-pacity should be evaluated for a particular decision at aparticular point in time. The capacity to express a partic-ular goal or wish can exist without the ability to makemore complex decisions. The graver the consequences ofthe decision, the greater the proof of capacity the physicianshould require. When a patient lacks decision-making capacity, an ap- propriate surrogate should make decisions with the physi-cian. Ideally, surrogate decision makers should know thepatient's preferences and act in the best interests of thepatient. If the patient has designated a proxy, as through adurable power of attorney for health care, that choiceshould be respected. When patients have not selected sur-rogates, standard clinical practice is that family membersserve as surrogates. Some states have health care consentstatutes that specify who and in what order of priorityfamily members or close others can serve as surrogates.Physicians should be aware of legal requirements in theirstates for surrogate appointment and decision making. Insome cases, all parties may agree that a close friend is amore appropriate surrogate than a relative. Surrogate preferences can conflict with the preferences and best interests of a patient. Physicians should take rea-sonable care to ensure that the surrogate's decisions areconsistent with those preferences and best interests. Whenpossible, these decisions should be reached in the medicalsetting by physicians, surrogates, and other caregivers. Phy-sicians should emphasize to surrogates that decisionsshould be based on what the patient would want, not whatsurrogates would choose for themselves. If disagreementscannot be resolved, hospital ethics committees may behelpful. Courts should be used when doing so serves thepatient, such as to establish guardianship for an unbe-friended, incompetent patient; to resolve a problem whenother processes fail; or to comply with state law. Surrogate decision making is best done with evidence of the patient's wishes. Physicians should routinely encour-age patients to discuss their future wishes with appropriatefamily and friends and to complete a living will and/ordurable power of attorney for health care (31, 32). (Seealso the \"Advance Care Planning in Care of Patients Nearthe End of Life\" section). Most adult patients can participate in, and thereby share responsibility for, their health care. Physicians cannotproperly diagnose and treat conditions without full infor- mation about the patient's personal and family medicalhistory, habits, ongoing treatments (medical and other-wise), and symptoms. The physician's obligation of con-dentiality exists in part to ensure that patients can be can-did without fear of loss of privacy. Physicians must strive tocreate an environment in which honesty can thrive andpatients feel concerns and questions are elicited. Decisions about Reproduction The ethical duty to disclose relevant information about human reproduction to the patient may conflictwith the physician's personal moral standards on abortion,sterilization, contraception, or other reproductive services.A physician who objects to these services is not obligated torecommend, perform, or prescribe them. As in any othermedical situation, however, the physician has a duty toinform the patient about care options and alternatives, orrefer the patient for such information, so that the patient'srights are not constrained. Physicians unable to providesuch information should transfer care as long as the healthof the patient is not compromised. If a patient who is a minor requests termination of pregnancy, advice on contraception, or treatment of sexu-ally transmitted diseases without a parent's knowledge orpermission, the physician may wish to attempt to persuadethe patient of the benets of having parents involved, butshould be aware that a conflict may exist between the legalduty to maintain condentiality and the obligation towardparents or guardians. Information should not be disclosedto others without the patient's permission (33). In suchcases, the physician should be guided by the minor's bestinterest in light of the physician's conscience and respon-sibilities under the law. Genetic Testing Presymptomatic and diagnostic testing raises issues of education, counseling, condentiality, cost, and justice.Such testing may allow clinicians to predict diseases ordetect susceptibility at a time when medicine may not havethe ability to prevent or cure the conditions identied. Thepublic and health care professionals often have a limitedunderstanding of the distinction between prediction andsusceptibility or risk. Genetic testing presents unique prob-lems by identifying risk for disease that has special meaningfor patients and clinicians, as well as for family memberswho may not be under the care of the clinician providingthe test. Because the number of qualied clinical geneticists and genetic counselors is small and unlikely to meet thedemand generated by the exponential growth in genetictesting, clinicians will be increasingly expected to conveythe meaning of genetic test results. Only physicians whohave the skills necessary for pretest and post-test educationand counseling should engage in genetic testing (34, 35). Ifqualied, clinicians should discuss with patients the degreeto which a particular genetic risk factor correlates with thePosition Paper Ethics Manual 564 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orglikelihood of developing disease. If unqualied or unsure, the clinician should refer the patient for this discussion.Testing should not be undertaken until the potential con-sequences of learning genetic information are fully dis-cussed with the patient. The potential impact on the pa-tient's well-being; implications for family members; andthe potential for adverse use of such information by em-ployers, insurers, or other societal institutions should befully explored and understood. As more information becomes available on the genetic risk for certain diseases, physicians must be aware of theneed for condentiality concerning genetic information.Many state governments and the federal government arepromulgating rules that cover access of employers and in-surers to such information. Additional complex ethical problems exist, such as which family member should beinformed of the results of genetic tests. Physicians shouldbe sensitive to these ethical problems, and testing shouldnot be undertaken until these issues are fully discussed andtheir consequences are well understood. The potential for stigmatization and insurance and job discrimination require that physicians ensure the conden-tiality of data. However, the presence of a genetic riskfactor or genetic disease in a family member raises thepossibility that other genetically related individuals are atrisk. The physician should encourage the affected patient'scooperation in contacting potentially affected family mem-bers or obtain the patient's consent to contact them toencourage them to seek genetic counseling. Medical Risk to Physician and Patient Traditionally, the ethical imperative for physicians to provide care has overridden the risk to the treating physi-cian, even during epidemics. In recent decades, with bettercontrol of such risks, physicians have practiced medicine inthe absence of risk as a prominent concern. However, po-tential occupational exposures such as HIV, multidrug-re-sistant tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, andviral hepatitis necessitate reafrmation of the ethical imper-ative (36). Physicians should evaluate their risk for becoming in- fected with pathogens, both in their personal lives and inthe workplace, and implement appropriate precautions.Physicians who may have been exposed to pathogens havean ethical obligation to be tested and should do so volun-tarily. Infected physicians should place themselves underthe guidance of their personal physician or the review oflocal experts to determine in a condential mannerwhether practice restrictions are appropriate on the basis ofthe physician's specialty, compliance with infection controlprecautions, and physical and mental tness to work. In-fection does not in itself justify restrictions on the practiceof an otherwise competent health care worker. Health careworkers are expected to comply with public health andinstitutional policies. Because the diseases mentioned above may be trans-mitted from patient to physician and because they pose signicant risks to physicians' health, some physicians maybe tempted to avoid the care of infected patients. Physi-cians and health care organizations are obligated to providecompetent and humane care to all patients, regardless oftheir illness. Physicians can and should expect their work-place to provide appropriate means to limit occupationalexposure through rigorous application of infection controlmethods. The denial of appropriate care to a class of pa-tients for any reason, including disease state, is unethical(37). Whether infected physicians should disclose their con- dition depends on the likelihood of risk to the patient andrelevant law or regulations in their locales. Physicians should remove themselves from care if it becomes clear thatthe risk associated with contact or with a procedure is sig-nicant despite appropriate preventive measures. Physi-cians are obligated to disclose their condition after the factif a clinically signicant exposure has taken place. Physicians have several obligations concerning nosoco- mial risk for infection. They should help the public under-stand the low level of this risk and put it in the perspectiveof other medical risks while acknowledging public concern.Physicians provide medical care to health care workers, andpart of this care is discussing with those workers their eth-ical obligations to know their risk for such diseases as HIVor viral hepatitis, to voluntarily seek testing if they are atrisk, and to take reasonable steps to protect patients. Thephysician who provides care for a seropositive health careworker must determine that worker's tness to work. Insome cases, seropositive health care workers cannot be per-suaded to comply with accepted infection control guide-lines, or impaired physicians cannot be persuaded to re-strict their practices. In such exceptional cases, the treatingphysician may need to breach condentiality and reportthe situation to the appropriate authorities in order to pro-tect patients and maintain public trust in the profession,even though such actions may have legal consequences. Complementary and Alternative Care Complementary and alternative medicine, as dened by the National Center for Complementary and Alterna-tive Medicine, \"is a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not presentlyconsidered to be part of conventional medicine\" (38). Folkhealing practices are also common in many cultures (39). Requests by patients for alternative treatment require balancing the medical standard of care with a patient'sright to choose care on the basis of his or her values andpreferences. Such requests warrant careful physician atten-tion. Before advising a patient, the physician should ascer-tain the reason for the request. The physician should besure that the patient understands his or her condition,standard medical treatment options, and expected out-comes. Because most patients do not afrmatively disclosePosition Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 565their use of complementary and alternative care, physicians should ask patients about their current practices (40). The physician should encourage the patient who is using or requesting alternative treatment to seek literatureand information from reliable sources (41). The patientshould be clearly informed if the option under consider-ation is likely to delay access to effective treatment or isknown to be harmful. The physician should be aware ofthe potential impact of alternative treatment on the pa-tient's care. The patient's decision to select alternativeforms of treatment should not alone be cause to sever thepatient-physician relationship. Disability Certification Some patients have chronic, overwhelming, or cata- strophic illnesses. In these cases, society permits physiciansto justify exemption from work and to legitimize otherforms of nancial support. In keeping with the role ofpatient advocate, a physician may need to help a patientwho is medically disabled obtain the appropriate disabilitystatus. Disability evaluation forms should be completedfactually, honestly, and promptly. Physicians will often nd themselves confronted with a patient whose problems may not t standard denitionsof disability but who nevertheless seems deserving of assis-tance (for example, the patient may have very limited re-sources or poor housing). Physicians should not distortmedical information or misrepresent the patient's func-tional status in an attempt to help patients. Doing so jeop-ardizes the trustworthiness of the physician, as well as hisor her ability to advocate for patients who truly meet dis-ability or exemption criteria. Care of the Physician's Family, Friends, and Employees Physicians should avoid treating themselves, close friends, or members of their own families. Physiciansshould also be very cautious about assuming the care ofclosely associated employees. Problems may include inade-quate history taking or physical examination, or incom-plete counseling on sensitive issues. The physician's emo-tional proximity can result in a loss of objectivity. Or theneeds of the patient may not fall within the physician's areaof expertise (42). If a physician does treat a close friend,family member, or employee out of necessity, the patientshould be transferred to another physician as soon as it ispractical. Otherwise, requests for care on the part of em-ployees, family members, or friends should be resolved byhelping them obtain appropriate care. Fullling the role ofinformed and loving adviser, however, is not precluded. Sexual Contact between Physician and Patient Issues of dependency, trust, and transference and ine- qualities of power lead to increased vulnerability on thepart of the patient and require that a physician not engagein a sexual relationship with a patient. It is unethical for aphysician to become sexually involved with a current pa-tient even if the patient initiates or consents to the contact. Even sexual involvement between physicians andformer patients raises concern. The impact of the patient- physician relationship may be viewed very differently byphysicians and former patients, and either party may un-derestimate the influence of the past professional relation-ship. Many former patients continue to feel dependencyand transference toward their physicians long after the pro-fessional relationship has ended. The intense trust oftenestablished between physician and patient may amplify thepatient's vulnerability in a subsequent sexual relationship.A sexual relationship with a former patient is unethical ifthe physician \"uses or exploits the trust, knowledge, emo-tions or influence derived from the previous professionalrelationship\" (43). Because it may be difcult for the phy-sician to judge the impact of the previous professional re-lationship, the physician should consult with a colleague orother professional before becoming sexually involved witha former patient (44). Boundaries and Privacy The presence of a chaperone during a physical exami- nation may contribute to patient and physician comfortbecause of particular cultural or gender issues. In appropri-ate situations, physicians should ask patients if they preferto have a chaperone present. Discussion of condentialpatient information must be kept to a minimum duringchaperoned examinations. Gifts from Patients In deciding whether to accept a gift from a patient, the physician should consider the nature of the gift, the poten-tial implications for the patient-physician relationship, andthe patient's probable motivation and expectations. A smallgift to a physician as a token of appreciation is not ethicallyproblematic. Favored treatment as a result of acceptance ofany gift is problematic and undermines professionalism. Itmay also interfere with objectivity in the care of the patient(45). CARE OF PATIENTS NEAR THE END OF LIFE End-of-life care is an important aspect of medical practice. Individual physicians and the medical communitymust be committed to the compassionate and competentprovision of care to dying patients and their families (46),and effective communication with patients and families(32, 47). Patients rightfully expect their physicians to carefor them and provide medical assistance as they live witheventually fatal illnesses. Good symptom control; ongoingcommitment to serve the patient and family; and physical,psychological, and spiritual support are the hallmarks ofhigh-quality end-of-life care. Care of patients near the endof life, however, has a moral, psychological, and interper-sonal intensity that distinguishes it from most other clinicalencounters. Patients Near the End of Life Palliative care near the end of life entails addressing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs and understand-Position Paper Ethics Manual 566 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orging that patients may at times require palliative treatment in an acute care context (48-50). To provide palliativecare, the physician must be up to date on the proper use ofmedications and treatments, including opioids and the le-gality and propriety of using high doses of opioids as nec-essary to relieve suffering. The physician should know howto refer patients to appropriate palliative care specialistsand programs, know how to use home-based and institu-tion-based hospice care, and be aware of the palliative careabilities of the nursing homes to which patients are re-ferred. Families of patients near the end of life should also be prepared for the course of illness and care options at theend of life (51). When clinicians perform cardiopulmonaryresuscitation, family members should usually have the choice to be present. Cultural differences at the end of lifemust be respected by physicians just as in other types ofcare. Differences in beliefs, values, and health care practicesmay prove challenging to physicians, depending on theircomfort and experience with cultural differences (28, 39).Clinicians should also be able to assist family members andloved ones experiencing grief after the death of the patient(52). Making Decisions Near the End of Life Informed adults with decision-making capacity have the legal and ethical right to refuse recommended life-sus-taining medical treatments (53). The patient has this rightregardless of whether he or she is terminally or irreversiblyill, has dependents, or is pregnant. The patient's right isbased on the philosophical concept of respect for auton-omy, the common-law right of self-determination, and thepatient's liberty interest under the U.S. Constitution (54). Many patients, particularly those with terminal or ir- reversible illness, elect to forgo certain treatments or pursuetreatments, even though these are decisions that their phy-sicians may consider unwise. These situations demand em-pathy, thoughtful exploration of all possibilities, negotia-tion, or compromise and may require time-limited trialsand additional consultations. In the unusual circumstance that no evidence shows that a specic treatment desired by the patient will provideany benet from any perspective, the physician need notprovide such treatment. The more common and muchmore difcult circumstance occurs when the treatment willoffer some small prospect of benet at a great burden ofsuffering or nancial cost, but the patient or family never-theless desires it. If the physician and patient (or appropri-ate surrogate) cannot agree on how to proceed, there is noeasy, automatic solution. Consultation with colleagues orwith an ethics committee may be helpful. Timely transferof care to another care provider who is willing to pursuethe patient's preference may resolve the problem. Infre-quently, resort to the courts may be necessary. Patients without decision-making capacity (see the sec- tion on informed consent) have the same rights concerninglife-sustaining treatment decisions as mentally competent patients. Treatment should conform to what the patientwould want on the basis of written or oral advance careplanning. If these preferences are not known, care decisionsshould be based on the best evidence of what the patientwould have chosen (substituted judgments) or, failing that,on the best interests of the patient. Physicians should beaware that hospital protocols and state legal requirementsaffecting end-of-life care vary. Advance Care Planning Advance care planning allows a competent person to indicate preferences for care and choose a surrogate to acton his or her behalf in the event that he or she cannotmake health care decisions. It allows the patient's valuesand circumstances to shape the plan and allows specic arrangements to be made to ensure implementation of theplan. Physicians should routinely raise the issue of advance planning with competent adult patients and encouragethem to review their values and preferences with their sur-rogates and family members. This is best done before ahealth care crisis. These discussions let the physician knowthe patient's views, enable the physician to update themedical record, and allow the physician to reassure thepatient that he or she is willing to discuss these sensitiveissues and will respect patient choices. The patient and thephysician should develop plans to make sure patient wishesare implemented. Discussions about patient preferencesshould be documented in the medical record. The PatientSelf-Determination Act of 1990 requires hospitals, nursinghomes, health maintenance organizations, and hospicesthat participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs to askif the patient has an advance directive, to provide informa-tion about advance directives, and to incorporate advancedirectives into the medical record. Advance planning takes place in conversations with the physician (with documentation in the medical record)or through written advance directives, such as a living willor durable power of attorney for health care (55). Thelatter enables a patient to appoint a surrogate who willmake decisions if the patient becomes unable to do so. Thesurrogate is obligated to act in accordance with the pa-tient's previously expressed preferences or best interests. Living wills enable persons to describe the kind of treatment they would like to receive in the event that theylose decision-making capacity. Uncertainty about a futureclinical course complicates the interpretation of living willsand emphasizes the need for physicians and patients todiscuss patient preferences before a crisis arises. Talkingabout future medical care is an effective method of plan-ning. Some state laws limit the application of advance di-rectives to terminal illness or deem the advance directivesnot applicable if, for example, the patient is pregnant.Many states have documents that combine the living willand the durable power of attorney for health care into onePosition Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 567document. Some specify requirements for witnessing the document. Advance directives should be readily accessible to health care professionals regardless of the site of care. Inaddition, some states have statewide systems for document-ing physician orders on end-of-life care, such as Oregon'sPhysicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)form (56). When there is no advance directive and thepatient's values and preferences are unknown or unclear,decisions should be based on the patient's best interestswhenever possible, as interpreted by a guardian or by aperson with loving knowledge of the patient if available.When making the decision to forgo treatment, many peo-ple give the most weight to reversibility of disease or de-pendence on life support, loss of capacity for social inter-action, or nearness to death. Family members and healthcare workers should avoid projecting their own values orviews about quality of life onto the incapacitated patient.Quality of life should be assessed according to the patient'sperspective (57, 58). Withdrawing or Withholding Treatment Withdrawing and withholding treatment are equally justiable, ethically and legally. Treatments should not bewithheld because of the mistaken fear that if they arestarted, they cannot be withdrawn. This practice woulddeny patients potentially benecial therapies. Instead, atime-limited trial of therapy could be used to clarify thepatient's prognosis. At the end of the trial, a conference toreview and revise the treatment plan should be held. Somehealth care workers or family members may be reluctant towithdraw treatments even when they believe that the pa-tient would not have wanted them continued. The physi-cian should try to prevent or resolve these situations byaddressing with families their feelings of guilt, fear, andconcern that the patient may suffer as life support is with-drawn. Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders Intervention in the case of a cardiopulmonary arrest is inappropriate for some patients, particularly those with ter-minal irreversible illness whose death is expected and im-minent. Because the onset of cardiopulmonary arrest doesnot permit deliberative decision making, decisions aboutresuscitation must be made in advance. Physicians shouldespecially encourage patients who face serious illness orwho are of advanced age, or their surrogates, to discussresuscitation. Although a do-not-resuscitate order applies only to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, discussions about this issueoften reflect a revision of the larger goals and means of thecare plan. The entire health care team must be carefullyapprised of the nature of these changes. Do-not-resuscitateorders or requests for no cardiopulmonary resuscitationshould specify care strategies and must be written in themedical record along with notes and orders that describe allother changes in the treatment goals or plans. It is essentialthat patients or surrogates understand that a do-not-resus- citate order does not mean that the patient will be ineligi-ble for other life-prolonging measures, both therapeuticand palliative. However, the appropriateness of a do-not-resuscitate order during and immediately after a procedureneeds to be individually negotiated. Because it is deceptive,physicians or nurses should not perform half-hearted resus-citation efforts (\"slow codes\") (59). Sometimes a patient or surrogate insists on a resusci- tation effort, even when informed that it will almost cer-tainly fail. A family's religious or other beliefs or need forclosure under such circumstances deserve careful attention.Although the physician need not provide an effort at resus-citation that cannot conceivably restore circulation andbreathing, the physician should help the family to under- stand and accept this position. A more controversial issue iswhether physicians may unilaterally write a do-not-resusci-tate order when the patient may survive for a very brieftime in the hospital. Some institutions, with forewarningto patients and families, allow physicians to write ordersagainst resuscitation over the patient's or family's objec-tions. Empathy and thoughtful exploration of options forcare with patients or surrogate decision makers shouldmake such impasses rare. Full discussion about the issueshould include the indications for and outcomes of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, the physical impact on the pa-tient, implications for caregivers, the do-not-resuscitate or-der, the legal aspects of such orders, and the physician'srole as patient advocate. A physician who writes a unilateraldo-not-resuscitate order must inform the patient or surro-gate. Any decision about advance care planning, including a decision to forgo attempts at resuscitation, should apply inevery care setting for that patient. Decisions made in onesetting should consider future situations and the appropri-ateness of applying that decision in that setting. In general,a decision to forgo attempts at resuscitation should applyin every setting\u2014hospital, home, and nursing home.Many states and localities have systematic requirements forout-of-hospital implementation of do-not-resuscitate or-ders (60), and physicians should know how to effectuatethe order and try to protect the patient from inappropriateresuscitation efforts. Physicians should also be attentive toensuring that orders against trying resuscitation transferwith the patient and that subsequent care teams under-stand and support the decision. Determination of Death The irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain is an accepted legal standard for determining deathwhen the use of life support precludes reliance on tradi-tional cardiopulmonary criteria. After a patient has beendeclared dead by brain-death criteria, medical supportshould ordinarily be discontinued. In some circumstances,such as the need to preserve organs for transplantation, tocounsel or accommodate family beliefs or needs, or to sus-Position Paper Ethics Manual 568 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgtain a viable fetus, physicians may temporarily support bodily functions after death has been determined. Solid Organ Transplantation There is an increasingly unmet need for organs and tissues. Physicians should be involved in community effortsto make potential donors aware of their option to make agift that would enhance life, health, or sight by organ ortissue donation. Ideally, physicians will discuss the optionof organ donation with patients when discussing advancecare planning as part of a routine ofce visit, before theneed arises (61). All potential donors should communicatetheir preference to their families as well as have it listed onsuch documents as driver's licenses or organ donor cards. While a prima facie good, organ donation requires consideration of several ethical cautions. One set of issues concerns the need to avoid even the appearance of conflictbetween the care of a potential donor and the needs of apotential recipient (62). The care of the potential donormust be kept separate from the care of a recipient. Thepotential donor's physician should not be responsible forthe care of the recipient or be involved in retrieving theorgans or tissue. However, the potential donor's physicianmay alert an organ-tissue procurement team of the exis-tence of a potential donor. Once brain death has occurredand organ donation is authorized, the donor's physicianshould know how to maintain the viability of organs andtissues in coordination with the procurement team. Beforedeclaration of brain death, treatments proposed to main-tain the function of transplantable organs may be used onlyif they are not expected to harm the potential donor. Another issue concerns who should make the organ request. Under federal regulations, all families must be pre-sented with the option of organ donation when the deathof the patient is imminent. To avoid conflicts of interest,however, those who will perform the transplant or are car-ing for the potential recipient should not be involved in therequest. Physicians caring for the potential donor shouldensure that families are treated with sensitivity and com-passion. Previously expressed preferences about donationby dying or brain-dead patients should be sought. How-ever, only an organ procurement representative who hascompleted training by an organ procurement organizationmay initiate the actual request. This can include physi-cians, if they have received specic training (63). A third set of issues involves the use of nancial incen- tives to encourage organ donation. While increasing thesupply of organs is a noble goal, the use of direct nancialincentives raises ethical questions, including about treatinghumans as commodities, and the potential for exploitationof families of limited means. Even the appearance of ex-ploitation may ultimately be counter-productive to thegoal of increasing the pool of organs. Retrospective, indi-rect compensation for expenses is less likely to raise suchconcerns. A new set of issues has been raised by the advent ofso-called non-heart-beating cadaveric organ donation. This approach allows patients who do not meet the criteriafor brain death, but whose loved ones are considering thediscontinuation of life support, to be considered potentialorgan donors. Life support may be discontinued undercontrolled conditions. Once the patient has met traditionalcardiopulmonary criteria for death and after a suitable pe-riod of time that allows clinical certitude of death but doesnot unduly compromise the chances of successful trans-plantation, the organs can be harvested. As in organ dona-tion from brain-dead individuals, the care of the potentialdonor and the request from the family must be separatedfrom the care of the potential recipient. The decision todiscontinue life support must be kept separate from thedecision to donate, and the actual request can be madeonly by an organ procurement representative. Becausethese potential donors may not always die after the discon-tinuation of life support, it is unethical, before the decla-ration of death, to use a treatment aimed at preservingorgans for donation if it is likely to cause symptoms or tocompromise the chance of survival. Irreversible Loss of Consciousness Persons who are in a persistent vegetative state are unconscious (64-66) but are not brain dead. They lackawareness of their surroundings and the ability to respondpurposefully to them. Because a persistent vegetative stateis not itself progressive, the prognosis for these patientsvaries with cause. Some physicians and medical societiesbelieve that there are no medical indications for life-pro-longing treatment or access to intensive care or respiratorswhen patients are conrmed to be in a persistent vegetativestate (67). They conclude that these patients cannot expe-rience any benets or suffer any discomfort and that allinterventions should therefore be withdrawn. However,many patients or families value life in and of itself regard-less of neurologic state. For these reasons, goals of care asdecided by a patient in advance or by an appropriate sur-rogate should guide decisions about life-prolonging treat-ment for the patient in a persistent vegetative state in thesame manner as for other patients without decision-mak-ing capacity. Artificial Nutrition and Hydration Articial administration of nutrition and fluids is a medical intervention subject to the same principles of de-cision making as other treatments. Some states require highlevels of proof before previous statements or advance direc-tives can be accepted as rm evidence that a patient wouldnot want these treatments, especially for patients who arenot terminally ill, are not permanently unconscious, orhave advanced dementia. For this reason, physicians shouldcounsel patients to establish advance care directives andcomplete these parts of living wills especially carefully. De-spite research ndings to the contrary, there remain under-standable concerns that discontinuing use of feeding tubeswill cause suffering from hunger or thirst. PhysiciansPosition Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 569should carefully address this issue with families and care- givers. Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia The debate over physician-assisted suicide is very im- portant to physicians and patients. Both groups favor eas-ing the dying process, providing adequate pain control,and avoiding unwanted treatments and protracted suffer-ing. Patients and physicians may nd it difcult at times todistinguish between the need for assistance in the dyingprocess and the practice of assisting suicide. Physician-assisted suicide occurs when a physician pro- vides a medical means for death, usually a prescription fora lethal amount of medication that the patient takes on hisor her own. In euthanasia, the physician directly and in-tentionally administers a substance to cause death. Physi- cians and patients should distinguish between a decision bya patient or authorized surrogate to refuse life-sustainingtreatment or an inadvertent death during an attempt torelieve suffering, from physician-assisted suicide and eutha-nasia. Laws concerning or moral objections to physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not deter physiciansfrom honoring a decision to withhold or withdraw medicalinterventions in appropriate situations. Fears that un-wanted life-sustaining treatment will be imposed continueto motivate some patients to request assisted suicide oreuthanasia. In the clinical setting, all of these acts must be framed within the larger context of good end-of-life care. Manypatients who request assisted suicide are depressed, haveuncontrolled pain, or have potentially reversible sufferingor fears (68). In the setting of providing comfort to a dyingperson, most physicians and patients should be able toaddress these issues. For example, with regard to pain con-trol, the physician may appropriately increase medicationto relieve pain, even if this action inadvertently shortenslife (the \"double effect\") (69, 70). The College does not support legalization of physi- cian-assisted suicide (71). After much consideration, theCollege concluded that making physician-assisted suicidelegal raised serious ethical, clinical, and social concerns andthat the practice might undermine patient trust and dis-tract from reform in end of life care. The College was alsoconcerned with the risks that legalization posed to vulner-able populations, including poor persons, patients with de-mentia, disabled persons, those from minority groups thathave experienced discrimination, those confronting costlychronic illnesses, or very young children. One state, Ore-gon, has legalized the practice of physician-assisted suicide,and its experience is being reviewed (72, 73). Other statesmight legalize this practice, but the major emphasis of theCollege and its members, including those who might law-fully participate in the practice, must focus on ensuringthat all persons facing serious illness can count on goodcare through to the end of life, with prevention or relief ofsuffering, commitment to human dignity, and support forthe burdens borne by family and friends. Physicians and patients must continue to search together for answers tothe problems posed by the difculties of living with seriousillness before death, without violating the physician's per-sonal and professional values, and without abandoning thepatient to struggle alone. THEETHICS OF PRACTICE The Changing Practice Environment Many individual persons, groups, and institutions play a role in and are affected by medical decision making. Inan environment characterized by increasing demand, in-creasing regulation and decreasing professional autonomy,mounting health care inflation, and signicantly con-strained resources, tension and conflict are inevitableamong patients, clinicians, insurers, purchasers, govern-ment, health care institutions, and health care industries.However, all these parties have an obligation to interact honestly, openly, and fairly (74). And while this section ofthe Manual focuses specically on the obligations of phy-sicians in this changing context, it is essential to note thatall of these parties bear responsibility for recognizing andsupporting the intimacy and importance of relationshipswith patients and the ethical obligations of clinicians topatients. Further, concern about the impact of the chang-ing practice environment on physicians and insured pa-tients should not distract physicians or society from attend-ing to the unmet needs of persons who lack insurance.Attention to these larger questions of quality and accesswill require a public dialogue in which all these partiesshould participate. Resource allocation decisions should al-ways be made through an open and participatory process. Physicians have an obligation to promote their pa - tients' welfare in this increasingly complex health care sys-tem. This entails forthrightly helping patients to under-stand clinical recommendations and to make informedchoices among all appropriate care options. It includesmanagement of the conflicts of interest and multiple com-mitments that arise in any practice environment, especiallyin an era of cost concerns. It also includes stewardship ofnite health care resources so that as many health careneeds as possible can be met, whether in the physician'sofce, the hospital, or the long-term care facility or athome. The patient-physician relationship and the principles that govern it should be central to the delivery of care.These principles include benecence, honesty, condenti-ality, privacy, and advocacy when patients' interests may beendangered by arbitrary, unjust, or inadequately individu-alized institutional procedures. Health care, however, doestake place in a broader context beyond the patient-physi-cian relationship. A patient's preferences or interests mayconflict with the interests or values of the physician, aninstitution, a payer, other members of a managed care planPosition Paper Ethics Manual 570 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgwho have equal claim to the same health care resources, or society. The physician's rst and primary duty is to the pa- tient. Physicians must base their counsel on the interests ofthe individual patient, regardless of the insurance or med-ical care delivery setting. Whether nancial incentives inthe fee-for-service system prompt physicians to do morerather than less or managed care arrangements encouragethem to do less rather than more, physicians must notallow such considerations to affect their clinical judgmentor patient counseling on treatment options, including re-ferrals (75). The physician's professional role is to makerecommendations on the basis of their medical merit andto pursue options that comport with the patient's uniquebackground and preferences (76). Physicians have a responsibility to practice effective and efcient health care and to use health care resourcesresponsibly. Parsimonious care that utilizes the most ef-cient means to effectively diagnose a condition and treat apatient respects the need to use resources wisely and tohelp ensure that resources are equitably available. In mak-ing recommendations to patients, designing practice guide-lines and formularies, and making decisions on medicalbenets review boards, physicians' considered judgmentsshould reflect the best clinical literature, including data onthe cost-effectiveness of different clinical approaches.When patients ask, they should be informed of the ratio-nale that underlies the physician's recommendation. Health plans are not obliged to underwrite approaches that patients may value but that are not justiable on clin-ical or theoretical scientic grounds or that are relativelycost-ineffective compared with other therapies for the samecondition or other therapies offered by the health plan forother conditions. However, the plan must have in place afair appeals procedure. In instances of disagreement be-tween patient and physician for any reason, the physician isobligated to explain the basis for the disagreement, to ed-ucate the patient, and to meet the patient's needs for com-fort and reassurance. The physician's duty further requires serving as the patient's agent within the health care arena. In the man-aged care context, for example, advocacy can operate atmany levels. At the individual-patient level, the physicianadvocate must pursue the necessary avenues to obtain treat-ment that is essential to the individual patient's care, re-gardless of the barriers that may discourage the physicianfrom doing so. Moreover, physicians should advocate justas vigorously for the needs of their most vulnerable anddisadvantaged as for the needs of their most articulate pa-tients (74). Patients may not understand or may fear conflicts of interests for physicians and the multiple commitments that can arise from cost-containment pressure under managedcare. Physicians should disclose their potential conflicts ofinterest to their patients. But health care plans have dutiesto foster an ethical practice environment, and should notask physicians to participate in any arrangements that jeop- ardize professional and ethical standards. They should holdphysicians accountable for the quality of care and not sim-ply for economic performance. Physicians should enterinto agreements with insurers or other organizations only ifthey can ensure that these agreements do not violate pro-fessional and ethical standards. Managed care plans shouldnot restrict the information or counsel that physicians maygive patients. Although the physician must provide information to the patient about all appropriate care and referral options,the health plan must disclose all relevant informationabout benets, including any restrictions, and about nan-cial incentives that might negatively affect patient access tocare (77). When patients enroll in insurance plans, they receive a great deal of information on rules governing benets andreimbursement. Meaningful disclosure requires explana-tions that are clear and easily understood. Insured patientsand their families bear a responsibility for having a basicunderstanding of the rules of their insurance (74). Physi-cians cannot and should not be expected to advise patientson the particulars of individual insurance contracts andarrangements. Patients should, however, expect their phy-sicians to honor the rules of the insurer unless doing sowould endanger the patient's health. Physicians should notcollaborate with a patient or engage in efforts to defraudthe insurer. Financial Arrangements Financial relationships between patients and physi- cians vary from fee-for-service to government contractualarrangements and prepaid insurance. Financial arrange-ments and expectations should be clearly established. Feesfor physician services should accurately reflect the servicesprovided. Physicians should be aware that a benecent in-tention to forgive copayments for patients who are nan-cially stressed may nonetheless be fraud under current law. When physicians elect to offer professional courtesy to a colleague, physicians and patients should function with-out feelings of constraints on time or resources and with-out shortcut approaches. Colleague-patients who initiatequestions in informal settings put the treating physician ina less than ideal position to provide optimal care. Bothparties should avoid this inappropriate practice. As professionals dedicated to serving the sick, all phy- sicians should do their fair share to provide services touninsured and underinsured persons. Physicians who par-ticipate in retainer fee practices (\"boutique\" or \"concierge\"medicine) should be aware that by thus limiting their pa-tient populations, they risk compromising their profes-sional obligation to care for the poor and the credibility ofmedicine's commitment to serving all classes of patientswho are in need of medical care (78).Position Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 571Financial Conflicts of Interest The physician must seek to ensure that the medically appropriate level of care takes primacy over nancial con-siderations imposed by the physician's own practice, in-vestments, or nancial arrangements. Trust in the profes-sion is undermined when there is even the appearance ofimpropriety. Potential influences on clinical judgment cover a wide range and include nancial incentives inherent in the prac-tice environment (such as incentives to overutilize in thefee-for-service setting or underutilize in the managed caresetting) (79, 80), drug industry gifts, and business arrange-ments involving referrals. Physicians must be conscious ofall potential influences and their actions should be guidedby patient best interests and appropriate utilization, not byother factors. Physicians who have potential nancial conflicts of in- terest, whether as researchers, speakers, consultants, inves-tors, partners, employers, or otherwise, must not in anyway compromise their objective clinical judgment or thebest interests of patients or research subjects (81). Physi-cians must disclose their nancial interests in any medicalfacilities or ofce-based research to which they refer orrecruit patients. When speaking, teaching, and authoring,physicians with ties to a particular company should dis-close their interests in writing. Most journal editors requirethat authors and peer reviewers disclose any potential con-flicts of interest. Editors themselves should be free fromconflicts of interest. Physicians should not refer patients to an outside fa- cility in which they have invested and at which they do notdirectly provide care (82). Physicians may, however, investin or own health care facilities when capital funding andnecessary services that would otherwise not be made avail-able are provided. In such situations, in addition to disclos-ing these interests to patients, physicians must establishsafeguards against abuse, impropriety, or the appearance ofimpropriety. A fee paid to one physician by another for the referral of a patient, historically known as fee-splitting, is unethi-cal. It is also unethical for a physician to receive a commis-sion or a kickback from anyone, including a company thatmanufactures or sells medical instruments or medicationsthat are used in the care of the physician's patients. The sale of products from the physician's ofce might also be considered by some to be a form of self-referral, andmight negatively affect the trust necessary to sustain thepatient-physician relationship. Most products should notbe sold in the ofce, and the College has taken a positionthat asks physicians to consider seriously the moral issuesinvolved in a decision to do so (83). Physicians should notsell products out of the ofce unless the products are spe-cically relevant to the patient's care, offer a clear benetbased on adequate clinical evidence and research, and meetan urgent need of the patient. If geographic or time con-straints make it difcult or impracticable for patients toobtain a medically relevant and urgently needed product otherwise, selling a product in the ofce would be ethicallyacceptable. For example, a splint or crutches would be ac-ceptable products, but vitamin supplements and cosmeticitems are neither emergent treatments nor unlikely to beavailable elsewhere, and so the sale of such products isethically suspect. Physicians should make full disclosureabout their nancial interests in selling acceptable productsand inform patients about alternatives for purchasing theproduct. Charges for products sold through the ofceshould be limited to the reasonable costs incurred in mak-ing them available. The selling of products intended to befree samples is unethical. Physicians may invest in publicly traded securities. However, care must be taken to avoid investment decisionsthat may create a conflict of interest or the perception of aconflict of interest. The acceptance of individual gifts, hos-pitality, trips, and subsidies of all types from the health careindustry by an individual physician is strongly discouraged.The acceptance of even small gifts has been documented toaffect clinical judgment and heightens the perception (aswell as the reality) of a conflict of interest (84). In additionto applying the Royal College of Physicians' standard andasking \"Would I be willing to have this arrangement gen-erally known?\" (85), physicians should also ask \"Whatwould the public or my patients think of this arrange-ment?\"; \"What is the purpose of the industry offer?\";\"What would my colleagues think about this arrange-ment?\"; and \"What would I think if my own physicianaccepted this offer?\" (81). Physicians must critically evaluate all medical informa- tion, including that provided by detail persons, advertise-ments, or industry-sponsored educational programs. Whileproviders of public and private graduate and continuingmedical education may accept industry support for educa-tional programs, they should develop and enforce strictpolicies maintaining complete control of program plan-ning, content, and delivery. They should be aware of, andvigilant against, potential bias and conflicts of interest (86). If medical professional societies accept industry sup- port or other external funding, they also \"should be awareof potential bias and conflicts of interest and should de-velop and enforce explicit policies that preserve the inde-pendent judgment and professionalism of their membersand maintain the ethical standards and credibility of thesociety\" (86). Advertising Advertising by physicians or health care institutions is unethical when it contains statements that are unsubstan-tiated, false, deceptive, or misleading, including statementsthat mislead by omitting necessary information. THEPHYSICIAN AND SOCIETY Society has conferred professional prerogatives on phy- sicians with the expectation that they will use their positionPosition Paper Ethics Manual 572 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgfor the benet of patients. In turn, physicians are respon- sible and accountable to society for their professional ac-tions. Society grants each physician the rights, privileges,and duties pertinent to the patient-physician relationshipand has the right to require that physicians be competentand knowledgeable and that they practice with consider-ation for the patient as a person. Obligations of the Physician to Society Physicians have obligations to society that in many ways parallel their obligations to individual patients. Phy-sicians' conduct as professionals and as individuals shouldmerit the respect of the community. All physicians must fulll the profession's collective responsibility to advocate the health and well-being of thepublic. Physicians should protect public health by report- ing disease, injury, domestic violence, abuse or neglect tothe responsible authority as required by law. Physicians should support community health educa- tion and initiatives that provide the general public withaccurate information about health care and should contrib-ute to keeping the public properly informed by comment-ing on medical subjects in their areas of expertise. Physi-cians should provide the news media with accurateinformation, recognizing this as an obligation to societyand an extension of medical practice. However, patientcondentiality must be respected. Physicians should help the community and policy- makers recognize and address the social and environmentalcauses of disease, including human rights concerns, pov-erty, and violence. They should work toward ensuring ac-cess to health care for all persons; act to eliminate discrim-ination in health care; and help correct deciencies in theavailability, accessibility, and quality of health services, in-cluding mental health services, in the community. The de-nial of appropriate care to a class of patients for any reasonis unethical. Importantly, disparities in care as a result ofpersonal characteristics such as race have recently receivedincreased attention and need to be addressed (87). Physi-cians should also explore how their own attitudes, knowl-edge, and beliefs may influence their ability to fulll theseobligations. Health and human rights are interrelated. When hu- man rights are promoted, health is promoted. Violation ofhuman rights has harmful consequences for the individualand the community. Physicians have an important role toplay in promoting health and human rights, and address-ing social inequities. This includes caring for vulnerablepopulations, such as the uninsured and victims of violenceor human rights abuses. Physicians have an opportunityand duty to advocate for the needs of individual patients aswell as society. Physicians should advocate for and participate in pa- tient safety initiatives, including error, sentinel event, and\"near miss\" reporting. Human errors in health care are notuncommon (88), and many result from systems problems.Physicians should initiate process improvement and work with their institutions and in all aspects of their practices inan ongoing effort to reduce errors and improve care. Resource Allocation Medical care is delivered within social and institu- tional systems that must take overall resources into ac-count. Increasingly, decisions about resource allocationschallenge the physician's primary role as patient advocate.This advocacy role has always had limits. For example, aphysician should not lie to third-party payers for a patientin order to ensure coverage or maximize reimbursement.Moreover, a physician is not obligated to provide all treat-ments and diagnostics without considering their effective-ness (89) (see also the \"The Changing Practice Environ-ment\" section). The just allocation of resources andchanging reimbursement methods present the physicianwith ethical problems that cannot be ignored. Two princi-ples are agreed upon: 1. As a physician performs his or her primary role as a patient's trusted advocate, he or she has a responsibility touse all health-related resources in a technically appropriateand efcient manner. He or she should plan work-upscarefully and avoid unnecessary testing, medications, sur-gery, and consultations. 2. Resource allocation decisions are most appropriately made at the policy level rather than entirely in the contextof an individual patient-physician encounter. Ethical allo-cation policy is best achieved when all affected parties dis-cuss what resources exist, to what extent they are limited,what costs attach to various benets, and how to equitablybalance all these factors. Physicians, patient advocates, insurers, and payors should participate together in decisions at the policy level;should emphasize the value of health to society; shouldpromote justice in the health care system; and should base allocations on medical need, efcacy, cost-effectiveness,and proper distribution of benets and burdens in society. Relation of the Physician to Government Physicians must not be a party to and must speak out against torture or other abuses of human rights. Participa-tion by physicians in the execution of prisoners except tocertify death is unethical. Under no circumstances is itethical for a physician to be used as an instrument of gov-ernment to weaken the physical or mental resistance of ahuman being, nor should a physician participate in or tol-erate cruel or unusual punishment or disciplinary activitiesbeyond those permitted by the United Nations StandardMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (90). Limited access to health care is one of the most signif- icant characteristics of correctional systems in the UnitedStates (91). Physicians who treat prisoners as patients facespecial challenges in balancing the best interests of the pa-tient with those of the correctional system. Despite theselimitations, physicians should advocate for timely treat-Position Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 573ment and make independent medical judgments about what constitutes appropriate care for individual inmates. Ethics Committees and Consultants Ethics committees and consultants contribute to achieving patient care goals by facilitating resolution ofconflicts in a respectful atmosphere through a fair and in-clusive decision-making process, helping institutions toshape policies and practices that conform with the highestethical standards, and assisting individual persons withhandling current and future ethical problems by providingeducation in health care ethics (92). Accrediting organizations now require most health care facilities to provide ethics consultation at the requestof patients, nurses, physicians, or others (93). Physiciansshould be aware that this resource is available. Consulta-tion should be guided by standards such as those developedby the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities(94). Ethics committees should be multidisciplinary andbroadly representative to assure the perspectives necessaryto address the complex problems with which they are con-fronted. Medicine and the Law Physicians should remember that the presence of ill- ness does not diminish the right or expectation to betreated equally. Stated another way, illness does not in andof itself change a patient's legal rights or permit a physicianto ignore those legal rights. The law is society's mechanism for establishing boundaries for conduct. Society has a right to expect thatthose boundaries will not be disregarded. In instances ofconflict, the physician must decide whether to violate thelaw for the sake of what he or she considers the dictates ofmedical ethics. Such a violation may jeopardize the physi-cian's legal position or the legal rights of the patient. Itshould be remembered that ethical concepts are not alwaysfully reflected in or adopted by the law. Violation of thelaw for purposes of complying with one's ethical standardsmay have signicant consequences for the physician andshould be undertaken only after thorough considerationand, generally, after obtaining legal counsel. Expert Witnesses Physicians have specialized knowledge and expertise that may be needed in judicial or administrative processes.Often, expert testimony is necessary for a court or admin-istrative agency to understand the patient's condition,treatment, and prognosis. Physicians may be reluctant tobecome involved in legal proceedings because the process isunfamiliar and time-consuming. Their absence may mean,however, that legal decisions are made without the benetof all medical facts or opinions. Without the participationof physicians, the mechanisms used to resolve many dis-putes may be ineffective and patients may suffer. Although physicians cannot be compelled to partici- pate as expert witnesses, the profession as a whole has theethical duty to assist patients and society in resolving dis-putes (95). In this role, physicians must have the appropri- ate expertise in the subject matter of the case and honestlyand objectively interpret and represent the medical facts.Physicians should accept only noncontingent compensa-tion for the reasonable time and expenses incurred as ex-pert witnesses. Strikes and Other Joint Actions by Physicians Changes in the practice environment sometimes ad- versely affect the ability of physicians to provide patientswith high-quality care and can challenge the physician'sautonomy to exercise independent clinical judgment andeven the ability to sustain a practice. However, physicianefforts to advocate for system change should not includeparticipation in joint actions that adversely affect access tohealth care or that result in anticompetitive behavior (96).Physicians should not engage in strikes, work stoppages,slowdowns, boycotts, or other organized actions that aredesigned, implicitly or explicitly, to limit or deny servicesto patients that would otherwise be available. In general,physicians should individually and collectively nd advo-cacy alternatives such as lobbying lawmakers and workingto educate the public, patient groups, and policymakersabout their concerns. Protests and marches that constituteprotected free speech and political activity can be a legiti-mate means to seek redress, provided that they do notinvolve joint decisions to engage in actions that may harmpatients. THEPHYSICIAN 'SRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CLINICIANS Physicians share their commitment to care for ill per- sons with a broad team of health professionals. The team'sability to care effectively for the patient depends on theability of individual persons to treat each other with integ-rity, honesty, and respect in daily professional interactionsregardless of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, sex, sex-ual orientation, age, or disability. Particular attention iswarranted with regard to certain types of relationships andpower imbalances that could be abusive or lead to harass-ment, such as those between attending physician and resi-dent, resident and medical student, or physician and nurse(97). Attending Physicians and Physicians in Training The very title doctor , from the Latin docere , \"to teach,\" means that physicians have a responsibility to share knowl-edge and information with colleagues and patients. Thissharing includes teaching clinical skills and reporting re-sults of scientic research to colleagues, medical students,resident physicians, and other health care providers. The physician has a responsibility to teach the science, art, and ethics of medicine to medical students, residentphysicians, and others and to supervise physicians in train-ing. Attending physicians must treat trainees and col-leagues with respect, empathy, and compassion. In theteaching environment, graduated authority for patientPosition Paper Ethics Manual 574 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgmanagement can be delegated to residents, with adequate supervision. All trainees should inform patients of theirtraining status and role in the medical team. Attendingphysicians, chiefs of service, or consultants should encour-age residents to acknowledge their limitations and ask forhelp or supervision when concerns arise about patient careor the ability of others to perform their duties. The train-ing environment should also encourage trainees to raiseethical issues they may encounter (98). It is unethical to delegate authority for patient care to anyone, including another physician, who is not appropri-ately qualied and experienced. On a teaching service, theultimate responsibility for patient welfare and quality ofcare remains with the patient's attending physician ofrecord. Prior permission from the patient's authorized repre- sentative to perform training procedures on the newly de-ceased patient should be obtained in light of any knownpreferences of the patient regarding the handling of her orhis body or the performance of such procedures. Consultation and Shared Care In almost all circumstances, patients should be encour- aged to initially seek care from their principal physician.Physicians should in turn obtain competent consultationwhenever they and their patients feel the need for assis-tance with care (99). The purpose, nature, and expecta-tions of the consultation should be clear to all. The consultant should respect the relationship be- tween the patient and the principal physician, shouldpromptly and effectively communicate recommendationsto the principal physicians, and should obtain concurrenceof the principal physician for major procedures or addi-tional consultants. The consultant should also share his/herndings, diagnostic assessment, and recommendationswith the patient. The care of the patient and the properrecords should be transferred back to the principal physi-cian when the consultation is completed, unless anotherarrangement is agreed upon. Consultants who need temporary charge of the pa- tient's care should obtain the principal physician's cooper-ation and assent. The physician who does not agree withthe consultant's recommendations is free to call in anotherconsultant. The interests of the patient should remain par-amount in this process. A complex clinical situation may call for multiple con- sultations. To assure a coordinated effort that is in the bestinterest of the patient, the principal physician should re-main in charge of overall care, communicating with thepatient and coordinating care on the basis of informationderived from the consultations. Unless authority has beenformally transferred elsewhere, the responsibility for thepatient's care lies with the principal physician. When the patient is in the care of a hospitalist, good communication is key. The principal physician should sup-ply the hospitalist with adequate information about currentand past clinical history to allow for appropriate decision making. The hospitalist should keep the principal physi-cian informed of the patient's clinical course and supplythat physician with a timely and complete description ofcare. Changes in chronic medications and plans for fol-low-up care should be discussed and agreed to by the prin-cipal physician before discharge. The Impaired Physician Physicians who are impaired for any reason must re- frain from assuming patient responsibilities that they maynot be able to discharge safely and effectively. Wheneverthere is doubt, they should seek assistance in caring fortheir patients. Impairment may result from use of habit-forming agents (alcohol or other substances) or from psychiatric,physiologic, or behavioral disorders. Impairment may alsobe caused by diseases that affect the cognitive or motorskills necessary to provide adequate care. The presence ofthese disorders or the fact that a physician is being treatedfor them does not necessarily imply impairment. Every physician is responsible for protecting patients from an impaired physician and for assisting an impairedcolleague. Fear of mistake, embarrassment, or possible lit-igation should not deter or delay identication of an im-paired colleague (100). The identifying physician may ndit helpful to discuss the issue with the departmental chair,or a senior member of the staff or the community. Although the legal responsibility to do so varies among states, there is a clear ethical responsibility to report a phy-sician who seems to be impaired to an appropriate author-ity (such as a chief of service, chief of staff, institutional ormedical society assistance program, or state medical board).Physicians should assist their impaired colleagues in iden-tifying appropriate sources of help. While undergoing ther-apy, the impaired physician is entitled to full condential-ity as in any other patient-physician relationship. Toprotect patients of the impaired physician, someone otherthan the physician of the impaired physician must monitorthe impaired physician's tness to work. Serious conflictsmay occur if the treating physician tries to ll both roles(101). Peer Review All physicians have a duty to participate in peer re- view. Fears of retaliation, ostracism by colleagues, loss ofreferrals, or inconvenience are not adequate reasons forrefusing to participate in peer review. Society looks to phy-sicians to establish and enforce professional standards ofpractice, and this obligation can be met only when allphysicians participate in the process. Federal law and moststates provide legal protection for physicians who partici-pate in peer review in good faith. It is unethical for a physician to disparage the profes- sional competence, knowledge, qualications, or services ofanother physician to a patient or a third party or to state orimply that a patient has been poorly managed or mis-Position Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 575treated by a colleague without substantial evidence. How- ever, professionalism entails membership in a self-correct-ing moral community. A physician therefore has a duty topatients, the public, and the profession to report to theappropriate authority any well-formed suspicions of fraud,professional misconduct, incompetence, or abandonmentof patients by another physician. Professional peer review iscritical in assuring fair assessment of physician performancefor the benet of patients. The trust that patients and thepublic invest in physicians requires disclosure to the appro-priate authorities and to patients at risk for immediateharm. In the absence of substantial evidence of professional misconduct, negligence, or incompetence, it is unethical touse the peer review process to exclude another physicianfrom practice, to restrict clinical privileges, or to otherwiseharm the physician's practice. Conflicts among Members of a Health Care Team All health professionals share a commitment to work together to serve the patient's interests. The best patientcare is often a team effort, and mutual respect, coopera-tion, and communication should govern this effort. Eachmember of the patient care team has equal moral status.When a health professional has signicant ethical objec-tions to an attending physician's order, both should discussthe matter thoroughly. Mechanisms should be available inhospitals and outpatient settings to resolve differences ofopinion among members of the patient care team. Ethicscommittees or ethics consultants may also be appropriateresources. RESEARCH Medical progress and improved patient care depend on innovative and vigorous research. Research is denedunder the federal \"Common Rule\" as \"a systematic inves-tigation including research development, testing and eval-uation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizableknowledge\" (102). Honesty and integrity must govern allstages of research, from the initial design and grant appli-cation to publication of results. Investigators and their in-stitutions are individually and jointly responsible for ensur-ing that the obligations of honesty and integrity are met.Fraud in research must be condemned and punished. Re-viewers of grant applications and journal articles must re-spect the condentiality of new ideas and information;they must not use what they learn from the review processfor their own purposes, and they should not misrepresentthe ideas of others as their own. Scientists have a responsibility to gather data meticu- lously; to keep impeccable records; to interpret results ob-jectively and not force them into preconceived molds ormodels; to submit their work to peer review; and to reportnew knowledge. Contributing to generalizable knowledgethat can improve human health should be the main moti-vation for scientic research. Personal recognition, publicacclaim, or nancial gain should not be primary motivat- ing factors, and physicians should be aware of conflictinginterests when participating in or referring patients to re-search studies (103). Human Subjects Research The medical profession and individual researchers must assume responsibility for assuring that research isvalid, has potentially signicant value, and is ethically con-ducted. Research must be thoughtfully planned to ensure ahigh probability of useful results, to minimize subject riskand maximize subject safety, and to achieve a benet-to-risk ratio high enough to justify the research effort (104).Benets and risks of research must be distributed fairly,and particular care must be taken to avoid exploitation ofvulnerable populations. Functioning as both an investigator and the clinician of a patient-subject can result in conflict between what isbest for the research protocol and what is in the patient'sbest interests. Physician-investigators should disclose thisconflict to potential research participants and should main-tain patient-subject health and welfare as their primaryconsideration (105). Patients should be informed that theprimary motive of a research protocol is to gain newknowledge and that there may or may not be clinical ben-et. It should also be clear to patients that participation inresearch is voluntary and not a requirement for continuedclinical care. Each research subject or an authorized representative (106) must be fully informed of the nature and risks of theresearch so that he or she may give truly informed consentto participate. Physicians have an ethical obligation to en-sure that the informed consent information for a proposedresearch study is appropriate and understandable to theproposed subject population. Clinicians who are thinkingabout participating in or referring patients to research stud-ies should be well versed about the responsible conduct ofresearch and human subjects protections. Independent review is a fundamental principle of eth- ical research. All proposed research, regardless of the sourceof support, must be assessed by an institutional reviewboard to assure that the research plans are valid and rea-sonable, human subjects are adequately protected, the ben-et-risk ratio is acceptable, the proposed research is suf-ciently important and protective of human subjects in lightof the local patient population, and the informed consentprocess and condentiality protections are both appropri-ate and adequate. Physician-investigators and physiciansreferring patients to clinical studies have an independentprofessional obligation to satisfy themselves that thosestudies meet ethical standards. While the formal independent review process was de- signed to protect research subjects, it cannot replace mu-tual trust and respect between subjects and researchers.Maintaining that trust and respect requires that physician-investigators involved in designing, performing, or refer-Position Paper Ethics Manual 576 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgring patients to research studies have primary concern for the potential participants (107). If the risks of a study be-come too great or if continued participation cannot bejustied, the physician must advise patients to withdraw.Physicians should not abdicate overall responsibility for pa-tients they have referred to research studies. Although the responsibility for assuring reasonable protection of human research subjects resides with the in-vestigators and the institutional review board, the medicalprofession as a whole also has responsibilities. Clinical in-vestigation is fraught with potential conflicts. Physiciansshould avoid situations in which they are rewarded forparticular outcomes. Moreover, physicians who enroll theirown patients in ofce-based research have an ethical obli-gation to disclose whether they have nancial ties to spon- sors (81, 108). Giving or accepting nder's fees for refer-ring patients to a research study generates an unethicalconflict of interest for physicians (109). Compensation forthe actual time, effort, and expense involved in research orrecruiting patients is acceptable; any compensation abovethat level represents a prot and constitutes or can be per-ceived as an unethical conflict of interest. While the Common Rule (110) and some state laws have provisions regarding privacy and condentiality re-quirements for research, the HIPAA Privacy Rule now re-quires subject authorization for use or disclosure of pro-tected health information for research. A Privacy Board canwaive the authorization requirement or information can beused in a \"limited data set\" with a data use agreement orde-identied under HIPPA (111), although the HIPPAde-identication requirements are stricter than those underthe Common Rule. Physicians who engage in research studies or who make their patient records available for research purposesshould be familiar with the HIPPA requirements andshould protect their patients' trust by reviewing and ap-proving each study's procedures for protecting data con-dentiality and security. Placebo Controls Physicians may be asked to enroll patients in placebo- controlled trials. While the World Medical Association re-quires that \"the benets, risks burdens and effectiveness ofa new method be tested against the best current prophy-lactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods\" (112), it deemsplacebo-controlled trials, despite the availability of proventherapy, to be only occasionally acceptable: when compel-ling and scientically sound methodologic reasons requirethem or when the study involves a minor condition andpatients receiving placebos will not be subject to additionalrisk for serious or irreversible harm (113). This view, that control group members must receive standard, proven therapies, represents a change from the\"gold standard\" of the double-blind, placebo-controlledtrial. Another view is that physicians may ethically considerparticipating in or referring patients to placebo-controlledtrials when participants freely consent to suspend knowl- edge of whether they are receiving effective treatment; theappropriateness of the study design has been reviewed andapproved by an independent institutional review board(114) and: the health risks and consequences of placebo or de- layed treatment are minimal; or the standard treatment offers no meaningful improve- ment to length or quality of life; or the available standard treatments are so toxic that pa- tients routinely refuse therapy (115). Before referring patients to a placebo-controlled study, a physician should ensure that the study design providesfor monitoring his or her patients, unblinding treatmentassignment to the referring physician, and withdrawing pa-tients from the study if necessary. Innovative Medical Therapies The use of innovative medical therapies falls along the continuum between established practice and research. In-novative therapies include the use of unconventional dos-ages of standard medications, previously untried applica-tions of known procedures, and the use of approved drugsfor nonapproved indications. The primary purpose of in-novative medical therapies is to benet the individual pa-tient. While medical innovations can yield important treat-ment results, they can also produce signicant safetyproblems. Consequently, medical innovation should al-ways be approached carefully. Medical therapy should betreated as research whenever data are gathered to developnew medical information and for publication. Adverseevents should be carefully monitored. When consideringan innovative therapy that has no precedent, the physicianshould consult with peers, an institutional review board, orother expert group to assess the risks, potential adverseoutcomes, potential consequences of foregoing a standardtherapy, and whether the innovation is in the patient's bestinterest (116). Informed consent is particularly importantand requires that the patient understand that the recom-mended therapy is not standard treatment. Scientific Publication Authors of research reports must be intimately ac- quainted with the work being reported so that they cantake public responsibility for the integrity of the study andthe validity of the ndings. They must have substantiallycontributed to the research itself, and they must have beenpart of the decision to publish. Investigators must discloseproject funding sources to potential research collaboratorsand publishers, and must explicitly inform publisherswhether they do or do not have a potential conflict ofinterest (see the \"Financial Conflicts of Interest\" section).Physicians should not participate in privately funded re-search unless the sponsors conrm that they will not pre-vent the publication of negative results. Scientists build on the published work of other re- searchers and can proceed with condence only if they canPosition Paper Ethics Manual www.annals.org 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 577rely on the accuracy of the previously reported results on which their work is based. All scientists have a professionalresponsibility to be honest in their publications. They mustdescribe methods accurately and in sufcient detail andassure readers that the research was carried out in accor-dance with ethical principles. They have an obligation tofully report observations actually made, clearly and accu-rately credit information drawn from the work of othersand assign authorship only to those who merit and acceptit. In general, subject recruitment alone does not meritauthorship. Instead, authorship means involvement instudy conception and design, analysis and interpretation ofresults, drafting or revision of intellectual content, and ap-proval of the nal version (117). Plagiarism is unethical. Incorporating the ideas of oth- ers or one's own published ideas, either verbatim or byparaphrasing, without appropriate attribution is unethicaland may have legal consequences. Public Announcement of Research Discoveries In this era of rapid communication and intense media and public interest in medical news, clinical investigatorsor their institutions commonly call press conferences andmake public announcements of new research develop-ments. Because media coverage of scientic developmentscan be fraught with misinterpretation, unjustied extrapo-lation and unwarranted conclusions, researchers should ap-proach public pronouncements with extreme caution, us-ing precise and measured language. In general, press releases should be issued and press conferences held only after the research has been publishedin a peer-reviewed journal or presented in proper and com-plete abstract form so that the study details are available tothe scientic community for evaluation. Statements of sci-entists receive great visibility. An announcement of prelim-inary results, even couched in the most careful terms, isfrequently reported by the media as a \"breakthrough.\"Spokespersons must avoid raising false public expectationsor providing misleading information, both of which reducethe credibility of the scientic community as a whole. CONCLUSION The delivery of health care can pose challenging ethi- cal dilemmas for patients, clinicians and institutions. Wehope that this Manual will help physicians, whether theyare clinicians, educators, or researchers, to address theseissues. The Manual is written for physicians by a physicianorganization as we attempt to navigate through difcultterrain. Our ultimate intent is to enhance the quality ofcare provided to patients. We hope the Manual will helpthoughtful readers to be virtuous physicians, trusted bypatients and the public.APPENDIX :AC ASEMETHOD TOASSIST WITH CLINICAL ETHICS DECISION MAKING as an \"ought \"or\"should \"ques- \"Should we withhold a respirator for this uncon- scious adult man with AIDS, as his partner requests, or use it, ashis parents request?\" Not: \"This man with AIDS is an ethics problem.\"Not: \"Is it better for terminally ill patients to die with or without a respirator?\" 2a.List signicant facts and uncertainties that are relevant to the question. Include facts about the patient and caregivers (such as intimacy, emotional state, ethnic and cultural background,faith traditions, and legal standing). Example: \"This man and his partner have been living to- gether for 10 years and purchased a house together. The partnerhas been a caregiver throughout the illness. The patient's parents have been unaccepting of his lifestyle and orientation and havebeen distant from him.\" 2b.Include physiologic inca- pable of making decisions; thus, he cannot now tell us whoshould speak on his behalf about his preferences for treatment.\" 2c.Include signicant medical uncertainties (such as prognosis and outcomes with and without treatment). Example: \"Antibiotics can be given for the current lung in- fection, but we do not know whether the patient can be weanedfrom the respirator given the advanced disease. It seems morelikely than not that he will eventually be weaned from the respi-rator. The patient has an estimated life span of 3 to 9 months,but it may be much shorter or somewhat longer.\" 2d.Include the benets and harms of the treatment options. Example: \"The respirator will prolong life, but it is a bur- densome and invasive treatment and will conne the patient to ahighly medicalized setting.\" 3.Identify a decision maker. If the patient has decision-mak- ing capacity, the decision maker is the patient. If the patient lacksdecision-making capacity, identify a proxy decision maker asspecied by court appointment, state law, a durable power ofattorney for health care, living will, or the persons who are bestsituated by virtue of their intimate, loving familiarity with thepatient. Example: \"This is a 32-year-old adult who has lived away from home for 14 years and who has had only occasional contactwith his parents, mainly on holidays. He does not have a livingwill or a durable power of attorney but has spoken often with hispartner about his preferences for health care as his disease hasadvanced. His partner has accompanied the patient to clinic andcared for him as he has become increasingly debilitated.\" 4.Give understandable, relevant, desired information to the decision maker and dispel myths and misconceptions. Example: \"The respirator and antibiotics will prolong life and may allow for treatment of the lung infection, but they willnot reverse the underlying severity of the patient's condition. Noexisting treatments can affect this patient's underlying condition.Position Paper Ethics Manual 578 5 April 2005 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 142 \u007f Number 7 www.annals.orgIf the respirator is started, it can be discontinued if the patient does not respond to treatment. If the respirator is not used,medications can be given to assure that the patient is comfortableeven if his lungs are failing.\" 5.Solicit values of the patient that are relevant to the question. These include the patient's values about life; place in the lifecycle; relation to community, health care, and health care insti-tutions; goals for health care (for example, palliation, enhance-ment of function or independence, prolongation of life, or palli-ation without prolongation of life); and conditions that wouldchange goals; and specic preferences about health care or proxydecision makers that are relevant to this situation. Example: \"This patient made many statements to his partner about wanting exclusively palliative care at this time and speci-cally declined further anti-HIV therapies, as noted in the medicalrecord. He stated that he wanted no life-prolonging treatments ofany kind if he could not communicate with his partner, whichhis present unconscious state prevents him from doing.\" 6.Identify health professional values. Values include health- promoting goals (such as prolonging life, alleviating pain, pro-moting health, curing disease, rehabilitating an injury, preventingharm, providing comfort, empowering patients to make choices,and advocating for patients). Values that pertain to patient-phy-sician communication (truth telling, condentiality, nondiscrim-ination, requirement for informed consent, and tolerance of thediversity of values) are also included, as well as some values thatextend outside of the patient-physician relationship (such as pro-tection of third parties, promotion of public health, and respectfor the law). Example: \"Although the physician may feel that a respirator is indicated for this person with respiratory failure, this patienthas articulated different goals for health care. The physician isobliged to respect the diversity of values and the requirement forinformed consent and respect the patient's goals and prefer-ences.\" 7.Propose and critique solutions, including multiple options for treatment and alternative providers . Example: \"The physician could provide palliative care to a person who has respiratory failure who elects not to receive arespirator or seek to expeditiously transfer the patient to someonewho can provide such care (the latter course would disrupt arelationship between this physician and patient). The physician,in protecting the interests and values of this patient who cannotspeak on his own behalf, must serve as the patient's advocate tothe parents of the patient.\" 8.Identify and remove or address constraints on solutions (such as reimbursement, unavailability of services, laws, or legal myths). Example: \"The parents in this case asserted that the doctor had to obey them because they were family members. A checkwith the hospital attorney showed that this was not true in thisstate.\" From the American College of Physicians, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
