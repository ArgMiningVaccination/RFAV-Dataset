T he Performance Indicators (PIs) describe actions that regulators will require of registration candidates, in order to demonstrate proficiency in the occupational competencies. The regulators will rely upon two assessment vehicles: 1.A ssessment that takes place within an educational program in TCM and / or Acupuncture An Occupational Competency is: A job function that can be carried out to a specified level of proficiency Definition of Entry-Level Proficiency The following statement defines Entry-Level Proficiency, and applies to all Occupational Competencies:2.A ssessment by means of a registration examination developed and administered by the regulators, comprising writt en ( multiple-choice) and clinical case study components The following definitions apply to this document. Definition of an Occupational CompetencyThe Assessment Blueprints provide information on the which PIs may be tested in each assessment vehicle. When presented with routine situations, the entry-level practitioner applies each relevant competency in a manner consistent with generally accepted standards in the profession, without supervision or direction, and within a reasonable timeframe. The practitioner selects and applies competencies in an informed manner. The practitioner anticipates what outcomes to expect in a given situation, and responds appropriately. The entry-level practitioner recognizes unusual, difficult to resolve and complex situations which may be beyond his / her capacity. The practitioner takes appropriate and ethical steps to address these situations, which may include seeking consultation or supervision, reviewing research literature, or referring the patient.Pan-Canadian Standards for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists:Performance Indicators and Assessment BlueprintsIntroduction Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists Page 3Domain Complexity Level 1 Level 2Level 3 Level 4 Level 1 Level 2Level 3 Level 4 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3*assessment vehicles utilized by the regulators are (1) assessment within an educational program, and (2) assessment w ithin a registration examination. Occupational competencies and performance indicators may differ in complexity. Distinguishing complexity levels assists in learning Performance Indicators for each Occupational Competency are listed in the Performance Indicator Grid that follows. Complexity of Performance IndicatorsDefinition of a Performance Indicator A Performance Indicator is: An externally-observable task that may be undertaken by an individual within an assessment vehicle*, successful completion of which provides an indication of the individual's capacity to perform an occupational competency. Performance involves recognizing, and responding within, a required system of beliefs and values Performance involves choosing (preferring) to function within a particular system of beliefs and values Performance involves internalizing a system of beliefs and values and instinctively functioning within itAffective (beliefs and values that affect cognitive and psychomotor actions)Descriptor Performance involves remembering information Performance involves comprehending & applying informationCognitive (knowledge and thinking skills) At entry-level, functioning at Cognitive Level 4, Psychomotor Level 4 and Affective Level 3 is not an expectation. Assessment Blueprint for the Registration Examination Some PIs will be assessed in the registration examination, which consists of written and clinical case study components.Performance involves analyzing and interpreting information Performance involves synthesizing (creating new) information Psychomotor (hands-on activities) Performance involves carrying out simple patterns and tasks Performance involves carrying out complex patterns and tasks & making minor adjustments based upon outcome Performance involves adapting tasks to new situations Performance involves developing new tasksPan-Canadian Standards for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists:Performance Indicators and Assessment BlueprintsIntroduction Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists Page 4T he written component is in multiple-choice format, and lends itself to the assessment of cognitive and (to some extent) affective PIs. The c linical case study (CCS) component consists of 6-8 case studies with open-ended responses. The PIs that are assessed through the registration examination are indicated with a check mark in columns I and J of the PI Grid. In the case of the CCS examinations, the candidate is asked to \"describe how to perform\" a particular Performance Indicator Educational programs in TCM and Acupuncture are expected to include:Assessment Blueprint for Educational Programs - Practical education, in which students work directly with an experienced practitioner and a simulated patient, to develop hands-on abilities which enable them to demonstrate relevant PIs. Assessment of practical education must take place through practical examinations designed to determine proficiency based upon the criterion in the table below. - Clinical education, in which students work directly with patients in a setting designed to provide patient care. Students must be supervised throughout their clinical education, in a manner that facilitates their development of clinical abilities while ensuring that patient care is safe, effective and ethical. Assessment of relevant PIs must take place in a manner designed to determine proficiency based upon the criterion in the table below.- Academic education which takes place in a classroom or through guided independent study, in which students develop knowledge and thinking skills, and beliefs and values, which enable them to demonstrate relevant PIs. Assessment of academic education must take place through written and / or oral examinations designed to determine proficiency based upon the criterion in the table below.Evaluation of students within educational programs lends itself to the assessment of cognitive, psychomotor and affective PIs.Pan-Canadian Standards for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists:Performance Indicators and Assessment BlueprintsIntroduction Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists Page 5Aca demic, A Cr iterion for Success Performance consistent with the definition of Entry-Level Proficiency in an academic assessment environment (such as a written or oral examination) Performance Indicators must be evaluated by educational programs in the Assessment Environment(s) identified in columns K, L and M of the PI Grid.
