These include: - redness - swelling - tenderness These symptoms usually pass within a couple of days and you don't need to do anything about them. Sometimes your child may develop a fever. If you're still not happy with your baby's reaction to any immunisation, speak to your practice nurse or GP. [How to treat a fever in children](/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/fever-in-children/) Comforting your baby It's normal for your baby to be upset for up to 48 hours after having the injection. To help comfort your baby, you can: - give them a cuddle - offer them extra cool drinks (if you're breastfeeding, your child may feed more often) - take them for a walk in the fresh air If the injection site is red, swollen or tender, put a clean cold cloth to the area for about 5 to 10 minutes - this may help to soothe your baby.
