Learn who should take the antiviral medication and whether Tamiflu is safe for kids. By Nicole Harris Updated on November 29, 2022 Medically reviewed by Monika Goyal, M.D. Influenza infects an estimated 9 million to 41 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The highly contagious illness, which is also called flu, brings along a wide array of symptoms\u2014including fever, cough, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and runny nose. Getting a flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu, but if illness strikes your family, your doctor might suggest taking Tamiflu, which is the trade name of oseltamivir, to lessen the severity of symptoms and shorten the course of the illness. Keep reading to learn more about Tamiflu, where to get this antiviral medication, who should take it, and the safety and side effects of Tamiflu in kids. What Is Tamiflu? \"Tamiflu is an antiviral medication that decreases the multiplication of the flu virus,\" says Daisy Dodd, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease doctor for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. To be effective, the medication needs to be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, The flu viruses must multiply in human cells to survive, explains Dr. Dodd. Tamiflu works by blocking this viral replication, decreasing the length of the illness by about 24 hours. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot How Does Tamiflu Work? Early treatment with Tamiflu can lead to milder illness, which lessens the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu. But it's important to note that Tamiflu doesn't actually stop you from having influenza. \"Tamiflu is different from antibiotics,\" explains Rhonda Patt, M.D., a pediatrician at Atrium Health Levine Children's Charlotte Pediatric Clinic-SouthPark. \"Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections such as strep throat, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections. Tamiflu, on the other hand, may help reduce the duration or severity of the flu but does not cure the flu.\" Jimena Roquero / Stocksy Who Should Take Tamiflu? Tamiflu and generic versions of the medication are approved for the treatment of flu in children and babies as young as 14 days old. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for patients with severe cases of influenza, as well as patients who are considered at high risk for developing complications of the flu. Dr. Patt gives the following examples of people who might benefit from Tamiflu: Adults over 65 years oldAnyone taking medications that may suppress the immune systemChildren under 2 years old, who have a higher risk of potentially life-threatening complications like pneumonia and dehydrationPeople with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, or sickle cell anemiaPregnant people or those who have recently given birth Dr. Dodd adds that some parents also request Tamiflu if the family benefits from a speedier recovery\u2014for example if a parent can't work when their child is sick. Common Side Effects of the Flu Shot in Kids Tamiflu Side Effects for Kids Although Tamiflu can shorten the duration of influenza, it's not without side effects. The most common are gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They usually occur during the first two days of treatment. More severe Tamiflu side effects\u2014such as confusion, hallucinations, or unusual behavior\u2014occur on rare occasions, and children should be monitored for these reactions \"It's unclear at this time whether these behavioral changes are true side effects of Tamiflu, but they have been observed in children and teens who have taken Tamiflu,\" says Dr. Patt. Is Tamiflu Safe for Kids? As with any medication, parents and doctors must weigh the risks versus the benefits. \"If a child is having a mild case of the flu, the risk of stomach upset may outweigh the benefits of the medication\u2014meaning that we allow influenza to just run its course without antiviral medication,\" says Dr. Patt. \"However, if a child has a chronic medical condition or is having severe flu symptoms, Tamiflu is more strongly recommended as a treatment option.\" The Flu Vaccine for Children and Toddlers How to Get Tamiflu for Kids To work effectively, Tamiflu must be taken within 48 hours from the onset of illness, says Dr. Dodd. Influenza can be determined with a rapid test or evaluation from your doctor, who might decide to prescribe Tamiflu depending on your child's risk factors. Pediatricians can also treat \"suspected influenza\" with Tamiflu if it would benefit the patient, says the CDC. For example, they might give Tamiflu to a high-risk child who was exposed to the virus through a friend or sibling. Tamiflu isn't an over-the-counter medication\u2014you can only get it through a prescription. It's available in either liquid or pill form, and it's generally prescribed for five days at a time. Doctors determine the correct Tamiflu dosage for kids, depending on factors like body weight and age. If your child takes Tamiflu, you should also encourage other flu-fighting remedies, such as rest, hydration, and possibly fever-reducing medications. \"If a patient is prescribed Tamiflu, it is OK to still take antipyretics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fever or discomfort,\" adds Dr. Patt. When Does Flu Season Start and End? How Much Does Tamiflu Cost? The cost of Tamiflu depends on your health insurance and location. Without insurance, Tamiflu costs typically more than $100 for a five-day supply; it even can sometimes retail for closer to $200. Parents can also ask about generic versions of Tamiflu for kids that might cost less. If you have insurance, your cost may be significantly less. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!
