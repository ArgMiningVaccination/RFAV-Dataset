Background: In 2012, original business planning efforts started under the operating name of \"Delta 9 THC Labs \"with the goal of becoming a Producer of Medical Marijuana in the State of Connecticut. As such, early efforts were aligned with the goal of becoming a cultivation operation. As time went on, the competitive landscape shifted as well-established companies from other states began reaching into Connecticut and developing plans for expansion. Given the cultivation experience and deep financial resources of established medical marijuana companies from other states, the company felt the most prudent course of action would be to make a strategy shift discontinuing pursuit of a Producer License. This was exacerbated by the fact that the State will only awar d three cultivation licenses and had high financial thresholds for cultivator eligibility, which was insurmountable for any smaller in-state entrepreneurial efforts (Exhibit 1). By mid-2013, we had already made many industry contacts, invested considerable time and resources getting trained, attending conferences, and networking. Still wanting to be involved in some way providing this invaluable medicine to patients, we began exploring the opportunity to open a Medical Marijuana Dispensary. The Dispensary side of the busi ness has less interest from out of state entities particularly because of the requirement to have a Licensed CT Pharmacists on staff. As such, a renaming effort was underway to find a business name complimentary to dispensary activities and Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. was born. The company is a minority run business with three of its four Board members being women and the CEO is a woman and majority shareholder. While Connecticut has stated it is not taking an opinion on giving preference to minority/woman run companies like other st ates, we nevertheless feel that it is an important distinction. Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. (abbreviated as NSHWC throughout this application) takes pride in providing excellent care to its patients as well as furthering scientific understanding of the use of medical marijuana and sharing this information with the public. Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. has thoughtfully comprised a diversely experienced and dynamic Board of Directors and Management Team focused on not only treating the patient's symptoms, but leading the way for personalized medicine approaches in medical marijuana through its innovative research plan, while always maintaining patient data privacy at the forefront. Attorney Karen Dietz, JD, MBA ,Member to the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Corporate Secretary, and majority shareholder, will be responsible for strategic oversight, corporate governance, legal compliance, contract negotiations, and providing legal advice to NSHWC, and overseeing the office of the President.

Past experience also includes work in the Pharmaceutical space and other leading insurance provi ders throughout Connecticut. Ms. Sandra Wear, RN , Chair of the Board of Directors , will provide guidance to management on patient relations, patient education, research study ope rations guidance as well as guidance on overall NSHWC operations. Ms. Wear's input will contribute to publications in medical journals from NSHWC as well as patient informational materials. Ms .

Ms. Kokalari's input will contribute to publications in medical journals from NSHWC as well as patient informational materials. Ms. Kokalari is currently a Physician's Assistant in the Cardiology Department at a leading University in New Haven, CT. Mr. Kenneth Kandrysawtz, Facility Manager / Pharmacist, will be responsible for Dispensary Facility Management, overseeing the inventory of me dical marijuana, dispensing medical marijuana to patients, quality control, patient relations, an over seeing other Pharmacists and reception positions. Mr. Kandrysawtz has expertise in opening, running, and managing a pharmacy. I graduated UConn in 1976 after spending my senior year as an intern at Hartford Hospital. I received my CT pharmacy license in 1976 and began working as a Staff Pharmacist for a pharmacy owner who had three separate locations that I rotated around to. A Staff Pharmacist is responsible for supervising the pharmacy technician, inventory control, properly dispensing prescriptions to customers, and providing confidential consultation to patients. This experience lead me to want to open my own pharmacy. Unfortunately, I opened in 1983 and had to close in 1984. The pharmacy and my marriage dissolved at the same time. I then took a Staff Pharmacist position at Burnside Drug (Arthur's Drug) wher e I worked from 1985 to 1998 when a new opportunity arose. I took a position with NeighborCare, which is a network of many Long-Term Care providers. I received the prescriptio n orders, filled them, and shipped the prescriptions out via special courier to the right longer-term care facility for the patients to have their prescriptions. In 2006, NeighborCare was acquired by OmniCare, and I decided to move on to the next opportunity. I took a position at Shop rite Pharmacy in Bristol, CT. After 33 years in pharmacy, I was presented with a unique opportunity to build a luxury home in the mountains of Montana. I took seized this opportunity and when I returned to Connecticut, I decided to take a short break from pharmacy and do a few more projects as a subcontract or for Dave's Tile & Stone. With Medical Marijuana now being legalized, an intere sting, new field is evolving in the pharmacy world and I am excited to have an opportunity to be a part of this emerging industry as the Facility Manager for Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. Mr. Daniel Vaughan, RPh , Pharmacist , will be responsible for dispensing medical marijuana to patients, quality control, patient relations, commun ity outreach through giving presentations about the benefits of medical marijuana and how to seek help for abuse. Mr. Vaughan has previous experience designing, opening, and overseeing other pharmacies. Mr. Vaughan has a thorough understanding of the science of medical marijuana and other herbal supplements and even received training in the Amazon Rainforest. Mr. Vaughan, as the face of NSHWC, has experience in patient consultation and is very compassionate and understanding of patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those who will qualify for obtaining prescriptions for medical marijuana. Graduated UConn School of Pharmacy in 1987 in 4.5 years, a semester early. I immediately began work alongside my Dad, and after being licensed in March (after early Dec. grad), I took over Vaughan's Pharmacy Inc. as the President of the newly formed corporation. My father completely stepped down and I began to rebuild this business. The first year, I completely computerized the paper filing system. Shortly after that, I was approached by the main local physician, Dr. Brenes, offering us business space in his new office building, which I accepted. This is one of two times I moved the entirety of my pharmacy operation to a different location, designing the floor plan, blue print, marketing plan and approach, arranging ever ything necessary, all of the things that you are currently looking to go into a dispensary. A few years later, a better opportunity arose at a free-standing building next store to the medical building I was in at the time. Again, I met with contractors leading them through the construction of my personally designed pharmacy plans (detailed blueprints and interior and exterior sketches). The entire building was renovated adding security and modernization, with a focus on privacy, including a pharmacist care counseling booth. From 1991 to 1995, I was a Certified Diabetic Educator CDE and helped manage and train local diabetic patients on treatment options and healthy living. During this time, I also volunteered with several Connecticut Pharmacist Association groups, incl uding the Pharmacist Concerned for Pharmacists committee becoming the co-chairperson. Shortly thereafter I was nominated to the Executive Committee of the CPA and held that position till 1997. I was very involved in outreach programs to help impaired pharmacists and worked with the CPA to bring smokin g cessation counseling to Connecticut Pharmacists. My biggest interest in pharmaceutical medicine has always been in the area of natural medicine and throughout the 1990s, I grew my pharmacy by expanding into specialty areas. New product lines were brought in, including a full line of nutritional and herbal products. The product lines I offered at my pharmacy were high quality and only available to health professionals. I educated myself in every area of natural medicines from homeopathy to herbals with my main focus on plants. I truly believed that nature offered such a wonderful way to heal the body through plants. I attended many seminars by renowned naturopaths, including a trip to the Amazon Rainforest for specialized training. The course, \"Pharmacy from the Rainforest,\" included presentation from wo rld renowned experts, concluding with a shaman preparing for a jungle ayahuasca ceremony (photos in cluded at the end). This was the beginning of my preparation to open a future medical marijuana dispensary. Some plants have too many biologically active ingredients working in harmony to replicate in the lab, such as cannabis, which has over 80 unique biological components not found in other plants. In 1998, I sold my pharmacy to Rite Aid. My passion of natural homeopathic remedies continues. \"The long -term benefit of homeopathy to the patient is that it not only alleviates the presenting symptoms but it re-establishes internal order at the deepest levels and thereby provides a lasting cure\" (quote by George Vithoulkas, Director, Athenian School of Homeopathic Medicine). I look forward to having the opportunity to share my passion of natural homeopathic remedies to benefit qualified patients in the State of Connecticut as a Pharmacist at Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. Further, with the research plan designed by Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc., I hope to gain further insights that will lead to a more personalized medicine approach providing the most effective strain of medical marijuana to patients based on the type and stage of their disease in order to provide the best treatment result to patients. Finally, I look to focus on education for patients, caregivers and physicians on the benefits of medical marijuana as well as educating the general public in an effort to reduce the stigma of medical marijuana use.

I received my CT pharmacy license in 1976 an d began working as a Staff Pharmacist for a pharmacy owner who had three separate locations that I rotated around to. A Staff Pharmacist is responsible for supervising the pharmacy technician, inve ntory control, properly dispensing prescriptions to customers, and providing confiden tial consultation to patients. This experience lead me to want to open my own pharmacy. Unfortunately, I opened in 1983 and had to close in 1984. The pharmacy and my marriage dissolved at the same time. xI then took a Staff Pharmacist position at Bu rnside Drug (Arthur's Drug) where I worked from 1985 to 1998 when a new opportunity arose. I took a position with NeighborCare, which is a network of many Long-Term Care providers. I received the prescription orders, filled them, and shipped the prescriptions out via special courier to the right longer-term care facility for the patients to have their prescriptions. In 2006, NeighborCare was acquired by OmniCare, and I decided to move on to the next opportunity. I took a position at Shop rite Pharmacy in Bristol, CT. xAfter 33 years in pharmacy, I was presented with a unique opportunity to build a luxury home in the mountains of Montana. I took seized this opportunity and when I returned to Connecticut, I decided to take a short break from pharmacy and do a few more projects as a subcontractor for Dave's Tile & Stone. xWith Medical Marijuana now being legalized, an interesting, new field is evolving in the pharmacy world and I am excited to have an opportunity to be a part of this emerging industry as the Facility Manager for Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc.

Page 28 of 33 Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) located in Norwalk, CT. (myeloma is a rare blood cancer) 2007 - 2009: Contracts Administrator 2009 - Present: In-House Counsel (see resume attached exhibit for more details) The Services of the MMRF are relevant to this RFA because the emerging industry of medical marijuana could benefit from innovative research studies, which the MMRF is a leader for developing cutting-edge research models that can be used in any field of research. x MMRF Research Grants - fund innovative research, which brings new talent into the field of myeloma, an orphan disease. x Collaboration among leading cancer centers to establish a central tissue back for pre-clinical research. x CoMMpass Study - The MMRF's Personalized Medicine Initiative is an eight -year, multifaceted program designed to identify the molecular origins of multiple myeloma and enable physicians to match specific treatment approaches to the patients most likely to benefit. The Personalized Medicine Initiative is centered around CoMMpass (Relating Clinical Outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile), a recently launched, landmark, 1000-patient longitudinal study that will track multiple myeloma patients from initial diagnosis through their course of treatment, accompanied by sequential tissue sampling to identify how a patient's molecular profile may affect clinical progression and individual response to treatment. New treatment approaches tailored to multiple myeloma patients' individual molecular profiles are urgently needed to extend lives and begin to cure the disease. With extens ive experience in genomics and a strong clinical network in place, the MMRF is in the unique pos ition to champion this bold concept and has become a model for other research groups seeking to advance personalized medicine. CoMMpass sits on the razor's edge of science and aims to va stly improve the understanding of the molecular features of multiple myeloma and, by leveraging this knowledge, match patients with the right treatments or combination of treatments. CoMMpass is the first and largest study of its kind to analyze disease progression and response to treatment based on patients' genomic or molecular profiles. Findings from this study can potentially transform multiple myeloma treatment approaches by enabling physicians, for the first time, to find individualized treatments that are most likely to be effective. Notably, academic and pharmaceutical industry partners in this initiative have given up rights to any inventions, signifying their commitment to expediting and revolutionizing the traditional drug discovery and development model. x Consortium - First collaborative research model of its kind that brings together academic and community cancer centers with industry to advance innovative PH1 and 2 trials of the most promising drug candidates. MMRC Member Institutions are supported by an advanced infrastructure (PRC, SC, MMPMs, IST Platform) allow for communi cations across the Membership to discuss the myeloma pipeline at each stage of development and to expand collaboration with those companies with the most promising drugs. x Publications - Emphasis placed on ensuring publications are released to share the data with the public. x Patient / Physician Education - MMRF hosts continuing medical education program sfor physicians and clinical insights programs for patients as well as providing print materials. Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. Page 29 of 33 xResearcher Gateway - The MMRF intends to ensure the most widespread availability of and use of the Data subject to pre-publication review. Coded health information and information from more detailed analyses of the patient coded samples will be put in a controlled access database. Each researcher who requests access to the controlled-acce ss database will be required to obtain approval from a CoMMpass governance committee. The MMRF will share the analyzed results of the study with the public by uploading the CoMMpass results to a secure web-based interface or Gateway which is accessible when the user agrees to an end user agreement that encourages maximum public accessibility and hence, public benefit. xCommunity Gateway - Patients, even those patients not participating in CoMMpass , will have an opportunity to participate in the MMRF Personalized Medicine Initiative and contribute towards a cure for multiple myeloma. Integrated with the Researcher Gateway, there will also be a Community Gateway where patients, physicians, and other caregivers will be able to input data to be shared and analyzed by researchers. Patients will be provided access to multiple myeloma oncology nurses for additional support and can communicate with other pa tients that have similar disease subtypes. In multiple myeloma, knowledge is power, which is why creating a community of patients that are actively engaged in their own treatment and can share their results will contribute to expediting the search for a cure. xClinical Trial Facilitation - MMRF set into motion 47 groundbreaking clinical trials and 26 new drugs and drug combinations with the MMRC. More than 1,100 multiple myeloma patients have received treatment that was previously not possible, thanks to the MMRC. MMRF was instrumental in the launch of 6 myeloma treatments (Velcade\u00ae, Revlimid\u00ae, Thalomid\u00ae, Doxil\u00ae, Kyprolis and Pomalyst\u00ae) that not only doubled life expectancy among some patients, but are being tested or used in more than 30 other cancers.

Date: James Dietz, President Date: Lee Mandell Chief Hydroponicist Boswyck Farms Boswyck the SheepCertificate of Completion This certificate is presented to for successful completion of the BOSWYCK FARMS HYDROPONIC CERTIFICATION COURSE Awarded on March 9th, 2013James Dietz &YIJCJU\u0001\u0014Reprinted from August 26, 2013 By Matt Pilon mpilon@HartfordBusiness.com When the state legalized medical mari- juana last year, health care infor- mation technologist James Dietz thought about vying for a license to grow the drug in Connecticut. The Litcheld resident sees the potential for a lucrative industry to sprout, and he want- ed a piece of the action. But Dietz quickly realized that growing pot here won't be as simple as planting a garden: it will require a signicant investment \u2014 as much as $5 million to $7 million, by his esti- mate \u2014 which will likely price smaller com- petitors like himself out of the market. With only three to 10 cultivation licenses up for grabs, Dietz said he feels moneyed and established interests \u2014 some from other states \u2014 will likely dominate Connecticut's medical marijuana growing industry. And as the unofcial eld takes shape, there are several \"gorillas\" some perceive as favorites to win the coveted licenses when the application period begins in the coming months, Dietz said. \"That's a big hurdle for us to overcome and still have money left over for infrastructure and operating costs,\" Dietz said. \"Without raising somewhere in the magnitude of $5 million to $7 million, it's probably not viable.\"Dietz's concerns come at a critical time for the development of Connecticut's medical marijuana industry. The state legislature's Regulations Review Committee will meet this week to potentially vote on proposed regulations that will in many ways determine how the state's medical mari- juana market blossoms. The 75 pages of regulations, drafted by the state Department of Consumer Protec-tion which will oversee the industry, estab-lishes rules for the sale, production and use of medical marijuana, and have already raised concerns similar to those expressed by Dietz. Some prospective growers say the upfront costs to even compete for a license are too high. Potential licensees, for example, are required to post $2 million in escrow, or an equivalent bond, and pay a nonrefundable $25,000 application fee. There are also concerns that the escrow pay- ment could be seized by the federal government since marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The state has since tweaked some of the draft regulations, allowing the $2 million gure to be reduced as grow operations hit certain benchmarks. Still, the high price of admission has Dietz preparing to opt for a less costly dis- pensary license instead. Seller licenses will be allocated based on the number of registered patients in the state, according to DCP. Sellers too will be tightly regulated with strict siting standards, background checks and pharmacist requirements. It may not come as a surprise that well funded entities have an advantage in a strict licensing process, but Andrew Glassman, an attorney with Pullman & Comley, said the state is right to set minimum capital require- ments, though he harbors concerns that banks will be too nervous about the federal status of marijuana to nance a growing oper- ation in Connecticut. \"They've created signicant barriers to entry with all these fees, but I think those barriers are appropriate,\" Glassman said. \"They're looking for legitimate businessmen and women who want to be in on the ground floor of what I think will be a signicant industry in Connecticut.\" Glassman said he represents a client \u2014 who he declined to name \u2014 that has applied for local approvals for a grow facility, a rst step he thinks potential industry competitors will need to complete before they can seriously contend for a cultivation license from the state. \"I don't think you can have a successful appli- cation if you don't have a site approved,\" he said. \"It looks like there might be four to ve parties currently positioned to make the application.\" BARRIERS TO ENTRY Growing pot in CT will be a high-rollers gamePHOTO | CNN Applications to open marijuana cultivation facilities, like the one shown above, have been sprouting up in cities and towns acr oss the state, as Connecticut prepares to finalize regula- tions that will govern its new medical marijuana industry. Some prospective growers are raising concerns that the cost of entry into the market will be too high. Continued&YIJCJU\u0001\u0012from previous page Applications for grow facilities have been led in Middletown, Watertown, West Haven and Bridgeport. Middletown and West Haven have approved grow locations with Faireld-based Greenbelt Management and Advanced Grow Labs, respectively. DCP Commissioner William Rubenstein said his agency has juggled input from various play- ers as best as it could, but the overall goal is to attract legitimate businesses into the industry. \"We want [potential growers] to be seri- ous and to operate uninterrupted over a long period of time,\" Rubenstein said. He said the serious interest shown so far by potential growers proves that they believe it will be a lucrative and worthwhile investment. \"We looked at the regulatory struc- ture and experience of every other state,\" Rubenstein said. As palliative pot laws have taken hold in nearly half the country over the past decade, Rubenstein said Connecticut will stand out in how much control enforcement authorities will have over the enterprise. \"Colorado had, at one point, over 1,100 licensed producers,\" Rubenstein said. \"Can you imagine the difference in regulatory over- sight and control when you're overseeing 10 or fewer facilities?\" Joseph Palmieri, who owns an environmen- tal rm and maintains a farm in Easton, said he plans to apply for a cultivation license. He's visited Colorado to view grow operations, and even designed a type of pod he plans to grow marijuana in if he wins a license. Right now, those pods are sprouting tomatoes. Palmieri, however, is concerned that there may not be enough patients to sustain three or more grow operations in the state. \"I hope they start smaller,\" Palmieri said. \"With all the costs of doing this, if there's no demand you're in big trouble.\" Rubenstein admitted it's difcult to estimate what sort of market will develop in Connecticut, especially because of the state's strict qualifying conditions. So far, 850 patients have been certi- ed by physicians to use marijuana, but Ruben- stein said he expects that number to increase once dispensaries open and product starts flow- ing. \"The experience with other states is in the rst year, you get a ramp up,\" Rubenstein said. If the Regulations Review Committee doesn't make major changes to draft regulations created by DCP, Rubenstein said a license application period would likely begin within a few weeks. The state would review applications for a few months, and marijuana would be legally for sale in Connecticut within three to six months. QMedical marijuana market Connecticut's new medical marijuana law makes it legal for patients to use the drug for \"palliative use.\" A quali-fying patient must be at least 18 years old and be diagnosed by a physician with one of the following debilitating medical conditions: t $BODFSt (MBVDPNBt )*7t \"*%4t 1BSLJOTPO\bT\u0001EJTFBTFt .VMUJQMF\u0001TDMFSPTJTt\u0001$FSUBJO\u0001TQJOBM\u0001DPSE\u0001JOKVSJFT 8BTUJOH\u0001TZOESPNFt $SPIO\bT\u0001EJTFBTFt 1PTU\u000eUSBVNBUJD\u0001TUSFTT\u0001EJTPSEFS \u0019\u0016\u0011 SOURCE: DEPT.

The exploratory nature of this study will allow for sample size re -estimation after interim statistical analyses. If strong trends suggest that a particular cohort should be expanded, the overall study sample siz e could increase to more than 15 00 or subsequent enrollment to other cohorts could be restricted. Statistical NSHWC -14-001 Version 1.0 January 1, 2014 DRAFT 5 Methods Interim statistical analyses will be conducte d at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after the first patient is enrolled, then annually for the duration of the study. After 12, 18, and 24 months of patient enrollment, we anticipate that approximately 250, 500, and 750 patients, respectively, will have enrolled. At these analyses we will look at dis tributions of treatment and symptom paterns . If these analyses suggest that higher proportions of patients in one or more subgr oups are required, recruitment will be adjusted accordingly. At the 24 -, 30-, and 36-month interim analyses we anticipate a minimum of 250, 500 , and 750patients, respectively, with at least one-year of follow- up. At these analyses we will re-evaluate statistical assumptions and power of the study t o detect clinically meaningful results. These re-evaluations will info rm any changes in recruitment strategy.

While Marijuana in an d of itself has not been found to be addict ive, we nevertheless take responsibility in preventing abuse by not only Medical Marij uana patients, but the greater general population as well. We are co mmitted to working closely with organizations within Connecticu t to combat substance abuse. For th e month of August, NSHWC will donate 10% of pret ax profits to Substance Abuse Programs located within the State of and Wellness Center, Inc.19 Hearthstone DriveBarkhamsted, CT 06063 We are pleased to confirm our understanding of the services we are to provide for Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. for the month ended October 31, 2013. We will audit the financial statements of Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc., which comprise the balance sheet(s) as of October 31, 2013, and the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the month then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. Audit Objective The objective of our audit is the expression of an opinion about whether your financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit will be conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and will include tests of your accounting records and other procedures we consider necessary to enable us to express such an opinion. We cannot provide assurance that an unmodified opinion will be expressed. Circumstances may arise in which it is necessary for us to modify our opinion or add an emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraph. If our opinion is other than unmodified, we will discuss the reasons with you in advance. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete the audit or are unable to form or have not formed an opinion, we may decline to express an opinion or to issue a report as a result of this engagement.2 Audit Procedures Our procedures will include tests of do cumentary evidence supporting the transactions recorded in the accounts, tests of the physical existence of inventories, and direct confirmation of certain assets and liabilities by correspondence with selected customers, creditors, and financial institutions. We may also request written representations from your attorneys as part of the engagement. At the conclusion of our audit, we will require certain written representations from you about the financial statements and related matters. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statem ents; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We will plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether from (1) errors, (2) fraudulent financial reporting, (3) misappropriation of assets, or (4) violations of laws or governmental regulations that are attributable to the entity or to acts by management or employees acting on behalf of the entity. Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, combined with the inherent limitations of internal control, and because we will not perform a detailed examination of all transactions, there is a risk that material misstatements may exist and not be detected by us, even th ough the audi t is proper ly planned and performed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, an audit is not designed to detect immaterial misstatements or violations of laws or governmental regulations that do not have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, we will inform the appropriate level of management of any material errors, fraudulent financial reporting, or misappropriation of assets that comes to our attention. We will also inform the appropriate level of management of any violations of laws or governmental regulations that come to our attention, unless clearly inconsequential. Our responsibility as auditors is limited to th e period covered by our audit and does not extend to any later periods for which we are not engaged as auditors. Our audit will include obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, suff icient to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures. An audit is not designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify deficiencies in internal control. However, during the audit, we will communicate to y ou and those charged with governance internal control related matters that are required to be communicated under professional standards. 3 We may from time to time, and depending on the circumstances, use third-party service providers in serving your account. We may share confidential information about you with these service providers, but remain committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of your information. Accordingly, we maintain internal policies, procedures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. In addition, we will secure confidentiality agreements with all service providers to maintain the confidentiality of your information and we will take reasonable precautions to determine that they have appropriate procedures in place to prevent the unauthorized release of your confidential information to others. In the event that we are unable to secure an appropriate confidentiality agreement, you will be asked to provide your consent prior to the sharing of your confidential information with the third-party service provider. Furthermore, we will remain responsible for the work provided by any such third-party service providers.

Your responsibilities include adjusting the fi nancial statements to correct material misstatements and confirming to us in the management representation letter that the effects of any uncorrected misstatements aggregated by us during the current engagement and pertaining to the latest period presented are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole. You are responsible for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud, and for informing us about all known or suspected fraud affecting the company involving (1) management, (2) employees who have significant roles in internal control, and (3) others where the fraud could have a material effect on the financial statements.

We have audited the accompanying financial st atements of Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. (a Connecticut corporation), which comprise the balance sheet as of October 31, 2013, and the related statements of income and reta ined earnings, and cash flows for the period from inception to October 31, 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting prin ciples generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maint enance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statem ents that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on thes e financial statements ba sed on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditi ng standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require th at we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the fina ncial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risk s of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to frau d or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design au dit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the pu rpose of expressing an opinion on the effect iveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An au dit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonablene ss of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the over all presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obta ined is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 2 Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center, Inc. as of October 31, 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the initial period then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Un ited States of America. Emphasis-of-matter Regarding Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 4 to the financial statements, the Company is applying for a license as a dispensary of me dical marijuana from the State of Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection. The State will be issuing three to five licenses this year. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified wi th respect to that matter. King, King & Associates, CPAs.

(the \" NSHWC \") has a strong desire to control and manage the significant costs incurred in retaining, storing and retrieving records. The NSHWC is also committed to complying with applicable state and federal laws regarding the maintenance of various types of records, including any that may be relevant to actual or threatened litigation involving NSHWC. This policy is designed to establish a systematic, cost-effective policy for controlling, maintaining, processing, retrieving and disposing of files within NSHWC, in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws. ARTICLE II RESPONSIBILITY 2.1 Every employee of NSHWC bears responsibility for meeting the goals of this policy. EACH EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO READ THIS POLICY AND ACKNOWLEDGE IN WRITING HIS OR HER REVIEW THEREOF. ARTICLE III CREATION, STORAGE AND DESTRUCTION 3.1 Creation. Everyone at NSHWC is charged with the duty of creating and indexing files so that they are readily identifiable. Files should normally be kept in active file cabinets until activity related to that file ceases. Thereafter, they should be placed in archive storage for th e appropriate retention period outlined in the attached Record Retention Schedule, as the same may be revised from time to time upon notice to employees by the President as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable law and recognized standards of document retention and disposal. 3.2 Labeling. The retention period for each file shal l begin upon the date activity ceases (for instance, the expiration of the program or the termination of the contract ). Before forwarding documents to archives, every effort should be made to label files in accordance with the di fferent type of records contained in such file and the anticipated disposal date in accordance with the attached schedule. In addition, reasonable efforts should be made not to mix different types of records in a single file before sending such file to archives. Where different types of records must be held in a single file, the latest disposal date will govern the entire file. 3.3 Retention. No employee should retain files either in hard copy or electronic formats for longer than the periods specified in the attached schedule. Items not specif ied on the attached schedule, should be retained only for fairly short periods of time consistent with the limited value associated with the items. Any files residing in personal computers, laptops, notebooks, removable storage me dia, or PDAs are covered by this policy. This policy also applies to any of NSHWC 's records that may be authorized by NSHWC to be in your home or otherwise outside the office. 3.4 Electronic Records. Electronic records are generally subject to the same retention periods as documents in other formats. However, as a general rule, e-mail records should be purged in accordance with the documentation schedule in Section 4.3 herein and all other emails should be purged at fairly short regular intervals because the bulk of e-mail messages have limited value. E-mails that transmit substantive information, such as an acknowledgement of receipt of goods or the transmission of a NSHWC policy, should be retained in accordance with the attached Record Retention Schedule. 7ARTICLE IV SUSPENDED DISPOSAL OF RECORDS 4.1 Suspension. There may be circumstances in which NSHWC must suspend the normal disposal of records because production of those records may be required by subpoena or other forms of compulsory legal process. Failure to suspend record disposal in these situations could lead to liability and adverse evidentiary rulings in court. WHENEVER THE NSHWC FINDS ITSELF IN THE MIDST OF A LEGAL DISPUTE THAT COULD RESULT IN THE FILING OF LITIGATION, AN INVESTIGATION OR AN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST THE NSHWC, IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE NSHWC IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ANY ROUTINE DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION OF ANY RECORDS OR FILES THAT HAVE ANY RELEVANCE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER IN DISPUTE. 4.2 Electronic Records. The above admonition also applies to NSHWC 's electronic records. For example, if NSHWC is faced with litigation, the recycling of backup tapes should be suspended. 4.3 Threatened Action. If you become aware of possible or threatened litigation, investigation or similar action against NSHWC you should immediately alert the President. For clarity, you should suspend disposal of records if NSHWC: xreceives a subpoena for documents; xis served with a complaint or if litigation is threatened against NSHWC; xif NSHWC is embroiled in a legal dispute which NSHWC may eventually seek to litigate; xlearns of a pending or threatened grand jury proceeding against NSHWC; xlearns of a criminal investigation against NSHWC; or xlearns of a government investigation against NSHWC.

(\" NSHWC \") exists to serve its mission and purposes. To these ends, the Board of Directors adopts this Whistleblower Policy in order to encourage and empower NSHWC's directors, officers, employees, and agents to report misuse, inappropriate allocation or diversion of NSHWC's resources , each, a \"Misuse.\" Without limitation, examples of illegal or dishonest activities are violations of federal, state or local laws; billing for services not performed or for goods not delivered; and other fraudulent financial reporting. 1.2 This policy shall be shared among directors, officers and, as appropriate, agents. Employees have received notice of this policy in the employee handbook. ARTICLE II OBLIGATION TO REPORT 2.1 Reporting. Actual, suspected, or threatened Misuses shall be promptly reported to the President, or in the case of a report concerning the President, to the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") or any Board of Director (each a \"Responsible Officer\"). Insofar as reasonably possible, the confidentiality of the person making the report (the \"Whistleblower\") will be maintained. However, identity may have to be disclosed to conduct a thorough investigation, to comply with the law and to provide accuse d individuals their legal rights of defense. Furthermore, a Whistleblower may submit a report anonymously, in writing. However, the Whistleblower should be aware that, in some instances, preserving anonymity could make it more difficult to investigate the report and ensure appropriate resolution of the reported Misuse. The Responsible Officer shall take the following steps: 1. Take appropriate action to investigate the reported Misuse; 2. If, after such investigation, the Responsible Officer reaches the conclusion that no Misuse has occurred, the Responsible Officer shall forward a final written report to the Board of Directors and meet with the Whistleblower (unless the report was made anonymously) for the purpose of providing a copy of the Responsible Officer's report and discussing the report, including decisions re garding the report and recommended resolutions; 3. Any reported Misuse that is believed to be credib le and does not exceed $500 may be resolved by the Director, with a report to the Board of Directors as outlined in Paragraph 2 above; and 4. Any reported Misuse that is believed to be credib le and exceeds $500 shall be forwarded to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall afford the pers on accused of the Misuse an opportunity to defend the accusation in a proceeding that is fair and reasonable. Thereafter, the Board of Directors may further investigate the reported Misuse, as it deems appropriate. 2.2 Determination. The Board of Directors shall determ ine whether a Misuse has occurred, with an affirmative finding requiring a two-thirds vote of the disinterested directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If the Board of Directors determines that a Misuse has occurred, it shall consider and take appropriate action which may include, but not be limited to: (a) requiring the return of any misappropriated assets or funds; (b) removal or dismissal of the person who committed the Misuse; and (c) reporting the Misuse to the appropriate legal and law- enforcement authorities. 11ARTICLE III NO RETALIATIONS 3.1 Good Faith Reports. Every director, officer, em ployee, or volunteer who has a reasonable belief or suspicion that a Misuse has occurred should feel free to ra ise the concern, in good faith, without fear of retaliation. It shall be considered a violation of this Policy for any director, officer, employee, or volunteer to retaliate, encourage, or permit retaliation against a person for reporting an actual, suspected, or threatened Misuse. Employees will not be disciplined, demoted or terminated for bringing concerns, in good faith, to the attention of NSHWC and providing NSHWC a reasonable opportunity to investigate and take appropriate action. Any director, officer, employee, or volunteer who engages in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but not be limited to, removal and/or dismissal. Reports of retaliation should be made pursuant to the reporting procedures of this Policy. 3.2 Disciplinary Action. This Policy is intended to be used in good faith and in a judicious manner. NSHWC may take action against a person who has committed an offense even though they cooperated with the investigation or against an individual who files a complaint without having a reasonable belief in the truth of the matters reported. In both cases such action may include terminat ion. The right of a Whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include immunity for any personal wrongdoing on the part of the Whistleblower.

Dietz, JD, MBA Chief Executive Officer 4EMPLOYMENT 101 Nature of Employment Your relationship with NSHWC is that of an employee-a t-will. Your job status does not guarantee employment for any specific length of time. Your employment with NSHWC is entered into voluntarily and both you and NSHWC are free to end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or advance notice. Your employment at-will status with NSHWC may be altered only with written authorization by the CEO or President. If you have any questions about this please feel free to contact NSHWC at 203-241-6464. If your position requires additional pre-employment crit eria, such as a background investigation and/or a pre- employment drug test and if you have been offered employme nt before any such investigation or test is completed, your employment is contingent upon a satisfactory result on all required tests. 102 Employee Relations If employees have concerns about work conditions or co mpensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. Our e xperience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors, the work environment can be ex cellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that NSHWC amply demonstrates its commitment to employees by responding effectively to employee concerns. 103 Equal Employment Opportunity In order to provide equal employment and advancement oppo rtunities to all individuals, employment decisions at NSHWC will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. NSHWC is an equal employment opportunity employers and do not discriminate against any person because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age, genetic in formation, or any other characteristic protected by law (referred to as \"protected status\"). Th is nondiscrimination policy extends to all terms, conditions and privileges of employment as well as the use of all company facilities, participation in all company-sponsored activities, and all employment actions such as promotions, compensa tion, benefits and termination of employment. NSHWC will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. Any employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the CEO or Pr esident at NSHWC at 203-241-6464. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Anyone found to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 104 Business Ethics and Conduct The successful business operation and reputation of NSHW C is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Our reputation for integrity and excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as a scrupulous regard for the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity. 5 The continued success of NSHWC is dependent upon our constituents' trust and we are dedicated to preserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to NSHWC and constituents' to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence. NSHWC will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers, and employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and inte nt of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct. In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethica l principles, will guide you with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is di fficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter should be discussed openly with the CEO or President at NSHWC at 203-241-6464 for advice and consultation. Compliance with this policy of business ethics and c onduct is the responsibility of every NSHWC employee. Disregarding or failing to comply w ith this standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment. 105 Immigration Law Compliance NSHWC is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States and do not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin. In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Contro l Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired may also be required to complete the form. Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged to contact the CEO at 203-241-6464. Employees may raise questions or co mplaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal. 106 Conflicts of Interest Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guid elines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework with in which NSHWC wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so that employees can seek fu rther clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of oper ation. Contact the CEO at 203-241-6464 for more information or questions about conflicts of interest. Transactions with outside firms must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the CEO and President. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits , unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit either the employer, the employee, or bot h. Promotional plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific executive-level approval. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of NSHWC business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is re lated by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. No \"presumption of guilt\" is created by the mere existe nce of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchas es, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they 6 disclose to the CEO or President as soon as possible the ex istence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which NSHWC does business, but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving NSHWC. 107 Outside Employment Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they meet th e performance standards of their job with NSHWC. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to NSHWC scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If NSHWC determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of NSHWC as they are modified from tim e to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with NSHWC. Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside NSHWC for materi als produced or services rendered while performing their jobs. 108 Non-Disclosure The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and the success of NSHWC. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples: x Patient Information x Confidential Information of Third Parties Entrusted to NSHWC x Customer Lists x Customer Preferences x Financial Information x Marketing Strategies x New Materials Research x Pending Projects and Proposals x Proprietary Production Processes x Research And Development Strategies x Scientific Data x Scientific Formulae x Scientific Prototypes x Technological Data x Technological Prototypes All employees may be required to sign a non-disclosur e agreement as a condition of employment. Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential bu siness information will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not actually benefit from the disclosed information. 109 Disability Accommodation NSHWC is committed to complying fully with the American s with Disabilities Act (ADA) and applicable state law, and to ensure equal opportunity in employment fo r qualified persons with disabilities. All employment 7 practices and activities are conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Hiring procedures are designed to provide persons with disabilities meaningful employment opportunities. Pre- employment inquiries are made only regarding an applic ant's ability to perform the duties of the position. Reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with k nown disabilities will be made unless to do so would be an undue hardship. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the situation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation) as well as in job assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression and seniority lists. Leave of all types will be available to all employees on an equal basis. NSHWC is also committed to not discriminating against any qualified employees or applicants because they are related to or associated with a person with a disability. M NSHWC will follow any state or local law that provides individuals with disabilities greater protection than the ADA. This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. NSHW C is committed to taking all other actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with di sabilities in accordance with the ADA and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. EMPLOYMENT STATUS & RECORDS 201 Employment Categories It is the intent of NSHWC to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Each employee is designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage and hour laws. NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. EXEMPT employees are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee's EXEMPT or NONEXEMPT classification may be changed only upon written notification by management. REGULAR FULL-TIME employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work NSHWC's full-time schedule. Generally, they are eligible for NSHWC's bene fits package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program, typically, employees who work thirty (30) or more hours per week. PART-TIME employees are those who work continuously for a sp ecified number of hours per week which is less than a regular schedule of thirty (30) or more hours per week. Part-time employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance). 202 Access to Personnel Files NSHWC maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information as the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance appraisals and salary increases, and other employment records. Personnel files are the property of NSHWC and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of NSHWC who have a legitimate reason to review information in a file are allowed to do so. 8 Employees who wish to review their own file should co ntact the President. With reasonable advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in NS HWC's offices and in the presence of the President. 203 Employment Reference Checks To ensure that individuals who join NSHWC are well qu alified and have a strong pot ential to be productive and successful, it is the policy of NSHWC to check the employment references of all applicants. NSHWC will respond verbally only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in writing. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment and position(s) held. No employment data will be released without a written authorization and release signed by the individual who is the subject of the inquiry. If you have questions, please contact the COE or President at 203-241-6464. 204 Personnel Data Changes It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify NSHWC of any changes in personnel data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of an emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personnel data has changed, notify the President at 203-241-6464. 205 Performance Evaluation Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to di scuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to- day basis. Formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct we aknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. The performance of all employees is generally evalua ted once a year, beginning at the calendar-year end. Merit-based pay adjustments may be awarded by NSHWC in an effort to recognize truly superior employee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous factors, including the information documented by this formal performance evaluation process. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS 301 Employee Benefits Eligible employees at NSHWC are provided a wide range of benefits. A number of the programs (such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and un employment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your supervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs can be found elsewhere in the employee handbook. The following benefit programs are available to eligible employees: x Medical Insurance x Dental Insurance x Vision Care Insurance 9 x Life Insurance x Long-Term Disability (LTD) x Short-Term Disability (STD) NSHWC will mail newly eligible employees a Benefits Enro llment package (for enrollment in Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and LTD) at their home addresses within a fe w weeks of their hire date, or the transfer date to a benefits-eligible position. If a Benefits Enrollment Pack age is not received in a timely manner, please call the President at 203-241-6464 to request an enrollment packag e. Each enrollment package will have a return deadline for eligibility. If employees miss the return deadline they must wait until the next Open Enrollment period to enroll in these benefits. 302 Vacation Benefits Employees in the following employment classification(s) are el igible to earn and use vacation time as described in this policy: x Regular full-time employees The amount of paid vacation time employees receive each year increases with the length of their active employment as shown in the following schedule: x Upon initial eligibility the employee is entitled to 10 vacation days each year, pro-rated from the date of hire for the first year. x After 5 years of eligible service the employee is entitled to an extra 5 vacation days. The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a calendar year. Paid vacation time can be used in minimum increments of one day. To take vacation, employees must request advance approval from their supervisors. Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing requirements. Approved vacation requests must be submitted to the President. Vacation time off is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of vacation for the amount of days absent. In the event that available vacation is not used by the end of the benefit year, employees will forfeit the unused time. Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for unused vacation time accrued at the rate of 0.385 days per year (or other prorated amount if the employee has more than ten (10) vacation days per year in the year of termination). 303 Holidays NSHWC will grant holiday time off to all active employees on the holidays listed below: x New Year's Day (January 1) x Martin Luther King Jr. Day x Presidents' Day (third Monday in February) x Memorial Day (last Monday in May) x Independence Day (July 4) x Labor Day (first Monday in September) x Columbus Day (second Monday in October) x Veteran's Day (second Monday in November x Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November) x Day after Thanksgiving (fourth Friday in November) 10 x Christmas Eve (December 24) x Christmas (December 25) x New Year's Eve (December 31) NSHWC will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible employees immediately upon assi gnment to an eligible employment classification. Holiday pay will be calculated ba sed on the employee's straight-time pay rate (as of the date of the holiday). Eligible employee classification(s): x Regular full-time employees A recognized holiday that falls on a Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday. A recognized holiday that falls on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday. If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's paid absence (such as vacation or sick leave), holiday pay will be provided instead of the paid time off bene fit that would otherwise have applied and time deducted for that day is counted as a holiday. 304 Workers' Compensation Insurance NSHWC provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no cost to employees. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the c ourse of employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to the applicable legal requir ements, workers compensation insurance provides benefits after a waiting period. Employees who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. 305 Bereavement Leave All employees who wish to take time off due to the deat h of an immediate family member should notify their supervisor immediately. Up to 3 days of paid bereavement leave will be provided to eligible employees in the following classification(s): x Regular full-time employees Bereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence. Bereavement leave will normally be granted unless ther e are unusual business needs or staffing requirements. Employees may, with their supervisors' approval, use any av ailable paid leave for additional time off as necessary. Approved bereavement leave must be submitted to the President. NSHWC defines \"immediate family\" for the purposes of bereavement leave as the employee's spouse (or significant other), and the employee's or employee's spouse's (or significant other's) parent, child, sibling grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts. Special consideration will also be given to any other person whose association with the employee was similar to any of the above relationships. 306 Jury Duty NSHWC encourages employees to fulfill their civic respons ibilities by serving jury duty when required. Employees will be compensated for jury duty consistent with state la w. Employees in an eligible classification may request up to one (1) week of paid jury duty leave over any one (1) year period. 11 Jury duty pay will be calculated on the employee's base pa y rate on the day of absence. Employee classifications that qualify for paid jury duty leave are: x Regular full-time employees If employees are required to serve jury duty beyond the peri od of paid jury duty leave, they may use any available paid time off (for example, vacation benefits) or may request an unpaid jury duty leave of absence. Employees must show the jury duty summons to their superv isor as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Of cour se, employees are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. Either NSHWC or the employee may request an excuse fr om jury duty if, in NSHWC's judgment, the employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. NSHWC will continue to provide health insurance benefits until the end of the month in which the unpaid jury duty leave begins. At that time, employees will become respons ible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage to continue. When the employee returns from ju ry duty, benefits will again be provided by NSHWC according to the applicable plans. 307 Benefits Continuation (COBRA) The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliati on Act (COBRA) gives employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health in surance coverage under NSHWC 's health plan when a \"qualifying event\" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a redu ction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal separation; and a depend ent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full co st of coverage at NSHWC's rate plus an administration fee. NSHWC provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under NSHWC' s health insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations. TIMEKEEPING/PAYROLL 401 Timekeeping (Part time employees only) Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and state laws require NSHWC to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually performing assigned duties. Nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period using NSHWC 's approved tracking system . Overtime work must always be approved before it is performed. If for any reas on an employee's own time records show any sort of disparity from NSHWC 's time records or the workers' pay stubs, then the employee must report that disparity immediately and submit those records to NSHWC in order to ensure accurate wage payments. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Nonexempt employees should not report to work prior to their scheduled starting time nor stay after their scheduled 12 stop time without expressed, prior authorization from their supervisor. It is the employees' responsibility to sign their time records to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The supervisor will review and then initial the time record before submitting it for payroll processing. 402 Paydays All employees are paid biweekly on every other Friday. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed through the end of the previous payroll period. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off such as a weekend or holiday, employees will receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee's paycheck will be available upon his or her return from vacation. 403 Employment Termination Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common circumstances under which employment is terminated: x Resignation - voluntary em ployment termination initiated by an employee. x Discharge - involuntary employment termin ation initiated by the organization. x Layoff - involuntary employment termination initiate d by the organization for non disciplinary reasons. Since employment with NSHWC is based on mutual consent, both the employee and NSHWC have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at an y time. Employees will receive their final pay on the next scheduled payroll. Employee benefits will be affected by employment term ination in the following manner. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid on the next scheduled payroll. Some benefits may be continued at the employee's expense if the employee so chooses. The employee will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions, and limitations of such continuance. 404 Pay Advances NSHWC does not provide pay advances on unearned wages to employees. 405 Administrative Pay Corrections NSHWC takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employ ees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of the President at NSHWC so that corrections can be made as quickly as possible. 13 406 Pay Deductions The law requires that NSHWC make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. NS HWC also must deduct Social Security taxes on each employee's earnings up to a specified limit that is call ed the Social Security \"wag e base.\" NSHWC matches the amount of Social Security taxes paid by each employee. If you have questions concerning why deductions were made from your paycheck or how they were calculated, the Chief Financial Officer can assist in having your questions answered. 407 Compensation It is the practice and policy of NSHWC to accurately co mpensate employees and to do so in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws. Review Your Pay Check We make every effort to ensure our employees are paid correctly. Occasionally, however, inadvertent mistakes can happen. When mistakes do happen and are called to our attention, we will promptly make any corrections necessary. Please review your pay check when you receive it to make sure it is correct. If you believe a mistake has occurred, or you have any questions please use the reporting procedure outlined below. Nonexempt Employees If you are classified as a nonexempt employee, you must ma intain a record of the total hours you work each day. You must accurately record your hours in accordance with NSHWC 's time keeping procedures. Your time record must accurately reflect all regular and overtime hours wo rked, any absences, late arrivals, early departures, and meal breaks. Employees are prohibited from performing any \"off -the-clock\" work. \"Off -the-clock\" work means work you may perform but fail to report. Any employee who fails to report or inaccurately reports any hours worked will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. It is a violation of company policy for an y employee to falsify or alter his or her or another employee's time. It is also a serious violation of company policy for any employee or manager to instruct another employee to incorrectly or falsely report hours. If any manager or employee instru cts you to: 1) incorrectly or falsely under- or over-report your hours worked; or 2) alter another employee's time records to inaccurately or falsely report that employee's hours worked, you should report it immediately to the CEO or President at 1-203-241-6464. Exempt Employees If you are classified as an exempt, salaried employee, you will receive a set salary which is intended to compensate you for any hours you may work. This salary will be establishe d at the time of hire or when you become classified as an exempt employee. The salary will be a predeter mined amount that will not be subject to deductions for variations in the quantity or quality of the work you perform. Under federal and state law, your salary is subject to ce rtain deductions. For example, absent contrary state law requirements, your salary may be reduced for the following reasons: x Full day absences for personal reasons, x Full day absences for sickness or disability, if NSHW C has a sickness or disability policy that provides for wage replacement benefits and you have exhausted or have not yet accrued enough leave time. x Full day disciplinary suspensions for infractions of our written policies and procedures. x Family and Medical Leave absences. x To offset amounts received as payment for jury and witness fees or military pay. x The first or last week of employment in the event you work less than a full week. 14Your salary may also be reduced for certain types of de duction such as your portion of health, dental, or life insurance premiums; state, federal, or local taxes, or social security. Your salary will not be reduced for any of the following reasons: xPartial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability. xAbsences for jury duty, attendance as a witness or mil itary leave in any week in which you have performed any work. xAny other deductions prohibited by state or federal law. xPlease note, it is not an improper deduction to reduce an employee's vacation, personal or other forms of paid time off from an employee's leave bank for full day absences for personal reasons, or for sickness or disability. Should you have any questions with respect to NSHWC 's policy, please contact the CEO or President at 1-203- 241-6464. To Report Concerns or Obtain More Information If you have questions about deductions from your pay, please contact the CEO or President at 1-203-241-6464. If you believe you have been subject to any improper deductions, you should immediately report the matter to your supervisor or the CEO or President at 1-203-241-6464. Every report will be fully investigated and corrective ac tion will be taken where appropriate, up to and including discharge for any employee(s) who violate this policy. In a ddition, we will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report alleged violati ons of this policy or who cooperate in the investigation of such reports. Retaliation is unacceptable, and any form of retaliation in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. WORK CONDITIONS & HOURS 501 Safety To assist in providing a safe and healthful work envir onment for employees, customers, and visitors, NHSWC has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for NHSWC. The President has responsibility for implementing, admini stering, monitoring, and evaluating th e safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. NHSWC provides information to employees about workplac e safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee mee tings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications. Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from empl oyees. Those with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise th em with their supervisor, or with another supervisor or manager. Reports and concerns about workplace safety is sues may be made anonymously if the employee wishes. All reports can be made without fear of reprisal. Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Employees must comply with all occupational safety and health standard s and regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Act and state and local regulations. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor and/or the President at 203-241- 6464. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, who fa il to report or where appropriate re medy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including suspension and/or termination of employment. If you believe that you are being exposed to a known or suspected hazard when working with toxic chemicals or substances, you have a right under the Hazard Communications Law to know about such hazards through Material 15 Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Your supervisor will review th e MSDS with you. If your supervisor does not have this information, your supervisor will contact the President at 203-241-6464. In addition, you will receive information on what hazardous substances are in the work area and regular training on the adverse effects of each toxic substance with which you come into contact in the workplace. You will be protected against discipline or termination that results from exercising employee rights under the law. In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardle ss of how insignificant the injury may appear, employees should immediately notify the President or the appropriate supervisor. Such reports are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance and workers' compensation benefits procedures. 502 Work Schedules Work schedules for each employee will be created between the employee and supervisor based on the specific job of the employee. 503 Use of Phone and Mail Systems Personal use of telephones for outgoing calls, including loca l calls, is not permitted. Employees may be required to reimburse NHSWC for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone. The mail system is reserved for business purposes only. Employees should refrain from sending or receiving personal mail at the workplace. To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always use the approved greeting and speak in a courteous and professional manner. Please confirm information received from the caller, and hang up only after the caller has done so. 504 Smoking In keeping with NHSWC's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking in the workplace is prohibited except in those locations that have been specific ally designated as smoking areas. In situations where the preferences of smokers and nonsmokers are in direct conflict, the pref erences of nonsmokers will prevail. Violations of this policy will lead to discipli ne up to and including termination of employment . This policy applies equally to all employees, customers, and visitors. 505 Meal Periods All full-time all employees are provided with one meal pe riod of 30 minutes in length each workday. Supervisors may schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. 506 Use of Equipment and Vehicles Equipment and vehicles essential in accomplishing job du ties are expensive and may be difficult to replace.

Please notify your supervisor if any equipment, machines, to ols, or vehicles appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent deterioration of 16 equipment and possible injury to employees or others . The supervisor can answer any questions about an employee's responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment or vehicles used on the job. The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment or vehicles, as well as excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations, can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 507 Emergency Closings At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or earthquakes, can disrupt company operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled work will be paid for exempt employees only. 508 Business Travel Expenses NHSWC will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on assignments away from the normal work location. All business travel must be approved in advance by your supervisor of NHSWC. Employees whose travel plans have been approved are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other expenses directly related to accomplishing business travel objectives will be reimbursed by NHSWC. Employees are expected to limit expenses to reasonable amounts. Expenses that generally will be reimbursed include the following: x Airfare or train fare for travel in coach or economy class or the lowest available fare. x Fares for shuttle or airport bus service, where avai lable; costs of public transportation for other ground travel. x Cost of meals. x Mileage reimbursed at IRS annual recommended rate. Employees who are involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report the incident to the President at 203-241-6464.

Reports should be accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses. Expense reports submitted after thirty (30) days will not be paid. Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related to travel arrangements, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses, or any other business travel issues. Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including fa lsifying expense reports to reflect costs not incurred by the employee, can be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 17 509 Computer and Email Usage Computers, computer files, the email system, and softwa re furnished to employees are NHSWC property intended for business use.

Employees who regularly communicate via the telephone may have their conversations monitored or recorded. Telephone monitoring is used to identify and correct performance problems through targeted training. Improved job performance enhances our customers' image of NHSWC as well as their satisfaction with our service. Computers furnished to employees are the property of NHSWC. As such, computer usage and files, including e- mail usage and related files, may be monitored or accessed. 19 NHSWC may conduct video surveillance of non-private work place areas. Video monitoring is used to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage or prevent acts of harassment and workplace violence. Because NHSWC is sensitive to the legitimate privacy ri ghts of employees, every effort will be made to conduct workplace monitoring in an ethical and respectful manner. 512 Social Security Number Privacy Officers and employees are permitted to access and use certain personal information, such as Social Security Numbers, only as necessary and appropriate for such person s to carry out their assigned tasks for NHSWC and in accordance with NHSWC 's policy. The unauthorized access, viewing, use, disclosure, or th e intentional public display of such information and the unauthorized removal of documents from NHSWC 's premises that contain social security number information is prohibited and can result in discipline up to and including termination of employment.

When necessary, documents containing social security information will be properly destroyed through shredding or other means prior to disposal to ensure confidenti al social security information is not disclosed. For more information about whether and under what circumstances you may have access to this information, review your job description or contact your supervisor. 513 Telecommuting Telecommuting is the practice of working at home or at a site near the home instead of physically traveling to a central workplace. It is a work alternative that NHSWC may offer to some employees when it would benefit both the organization and the employee. The employee's compensation, benefits, work status, work responsibilities, and the amount of time the employee is expected to work per day or per pay period will not ch ange due to participation in the telecommuting program (unless otherwise agreed upon in writing). Telecommuting is an alternative method of meeting the need s of the organization and is not a universal employee benefit. As such, NHSWC has the right to refuse to make telecommuting available to an employee and to terminate a telecommuting arrangement at any time. 514 Social Networking and Blogging To protect the NHSWC 's interests, employees must adhere to the following rules: Employees may not post on a blog or social networking site during their working time or at any time using NHSWC equipment or property. The NHSWC 's electronic communication systems are for business use only. 20 If an employee identifies himself or herself as an em ployee of the NHSWC on any social networking site, the communication must include a disclaimer that the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the views of the NHSWC management. All rules regarding confidential business information apply in full to blogs and social networking sites. Any information that cannot be disclosed through a conversation, a note or an e-mail also cannot be disclosed on a blog or social networking site. The transmission of confidential or proprietary information without the permission of the NHSWC is prohibited. If you mention the NHSWC in a blog or elsewhere in online social media, or it is reasonably clear you are referring to NHSWC or a position taken by NHSWC, and also expr ess a political opinion or an opinion regarding the NHSWC 's positions, actions, or products, the post must specifically disclose your relationship with the NHSWC and note that the opinion expressed is your personal opinion and not the NHSWC 's position. Any conduct which is impermissible under the law if expres sed in any other form or forum is impermissible if expressed through a social networking site. For example, posted material that is discriminatory, defamatory, libelous or malicious is forbidden. The NHSWC 's policies, including but not limited to the Equal Employment Opportunity, Sexual Harassment, Harassment and Workplace Violence policies, apply equally to employee comments on social networking sites even if done on nonworking time. Employees are encouraged to review those sections of the Handbook for further guidance. 515 Workplace Violence Prevention NHSWC is committed to preventing workplace violence a nd to maintaining a safe work environment. Given the increasing violence in society in general, NHSWC have a dopted the following guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence th at may occur during business hours or on Company premises. All employees, including supervisors and temporary employee s, should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, \"horseplay,\" or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the company unless contrary to state law. Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another empl oyee, a customer, or a member of the public will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment , including harassment that is based on an individual's protected status. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This in cludes threats by employees, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. All suspicious indi viduals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. Do not place yourself in peril. If you see or hear a commoti on or disturbance near your work station, do not try to intercede or see what is happening. NHSWC will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual maki ng a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, NHSWC may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation. Anyone determin ed to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 21 Problem Resolution If an employee has a problem, suggestion, question or comp laint, it should be talked over with the employee's immediate supervisor. Matters are usually best hand led when they are discussed frankly and promptly. If a discussion with the immediate supervisor does not resolve the matter to employee's satisfaction, or if the problem is with the immediate supervisor, then employee should discuss it with the next level of management. Complaint Resolution Procedure The purpose of this procedure is to establish fair, orderly and speedy resolution of disputes that sometimes arise in the workplace. Usage Employees may utilize this procedure to review an allege d misapplication of Company policies or rules pertaining to employment in the department involved or applicable laws or regulations including anti-discrimination laws or regulations that directly and adversely affect the employee. Informal Resolution of Complaints Regular and forthright communication between employees a nd supervisors reduces the likelihood of the need for more formal review. Such communication is in the mutual best interest of both the Company and employees. Therefore, employees should bring to the attention of their supervisors any work-related problems as soon as possible after they arise and discuss the concern with the objective of resolving it. Supervisors should discuss concerns with staff in a timely fashion in an effort to resolve the matters. Should these initial attempts at resolution not be effective, employees may then cont act the President for further assistance. Employee Relations Assistance President is available for assistance in the resolution of su ch matters. The President may be contacted for informal counseling if the employee believes he or she cannot approa ch the supervisor with the problem. President will meet with the employee, the supervisor(s), or both as may be appropriate, to assist in amicably resolving their differences. President can also provide advice on matter s of policy interpretation and information concerning the formal grievance procedure. Protection Against Retaliation Employees may not be discriminated against for utilizing this procedure. When an employee alleges he or she has been discriminated against for utilizing this procedure, or for participating in as a witness in a dispute resolution, a complaint may be initiated. The Company considers such acts of discrimination by a supervisor against any employee as a result of her or her involvement in this procedure to be unacceptable conduct and a violation of the Company policy. Reporting Claims or Potential Claims It is important that claims or potential claims and complaints are reported to someone in a supervisory role as soon as they become known. If told of any bodily injury, property damage or financial injury allegedly attributable to the NSHWC please collect any available information re garding the incident and immediately forward it to President. It is generally suggested that responses to the speaker/caller be sympathetic, but do not admit any liability, and let the speaker/caller know that the claim or complaint will be reported to management. As soon as President becomes aware of a claim or a po tential claim it should be reported to the appropriate insurance carrier. 516 Cell Phone Usage If you are provided a cellular phone by NSHWC (\"Company Cellular Phone\"), it is provided to you as a business tool only. Company Cellular Phones are provided to as sist employees in communicating with management and 22other employees, their NSHWC associates, and others with whom they may conduct business. Company Cellular Phone use is intended for business-related calls only and personal calls are not permitted. Company Cellular Phone invoices and text messages (including those sent on data pagers) may be regularly monitored to ensure compliance with this policy. Whether the cellular phone is provided by NSHWC or th e employee is using his or her own phone, employees who have access to a cell phone while in their cars should reme mber that their primary responsibility is driving safely and obeying the rules of the road. Employees are prohib ited from using cell phones to conduct business while driving and should safely pull off the road and come to a complete stop before dialing or talking on the phone or writing, sending, or reading a text-based communication. As a representative of NSHWC, cell phone users are re minded that the regular business etiquette employed when speaking from office phones or in meetings applie s to conversations conducted over a cell phone.

A leave of absence, or an y extension of a leave, must be approved by the President. Leave Period When applying the MLFC policy with the Short Term Disability (STD) benefit, there is a one week verification period in which the employee will not be covered under the STD benefit when the leave is deemed foreseeable by our STD provider. In conjunction with the NSHWC STD benefit, NSHWC requires that the employee use one (1) week of Vacation days upon approval of MLFC during the verificati on period. In the event the employee does not have enough Vacation days available, the employee will be required to use any available Vacation days for the verification period, and any remaining days will be processed as unpaid leave for the employee. If the leave is deemed unforeseeable (i.e., on the job accident and/or injury) by our provider, STD cove rage will begin immediately and will not have verification period. Benefits Coverage During FMLA Leave During an approved MLFC Leave, employee benefits elected through NSHWC will remain effective for up to twelve (12) weeks under the same terms th at would have applied had the employee not taken leave Employees remain responsible for payment of the employee contribution while on leave. The employee will be notified in writing of the monthly premium amount that he/she is responsible for prior to the approved MLFC leave. All premiums must be submitted to the President by the first (1st) of each month to cover the employee/dependent/spousal premium contributions. Failure to make timely payments may result in a termination of health insurance benefits. In the event that an employee has exhausted their twelve (12) weeks maximum period of covered MLFC leave, the 24employee will become responsible for the full cost of th ese benefits and may apply for benefits continuation under COBRA. Upon an employee's ret urn from leave, automatic deduction of employee contributions through payroll will be reinstated on the first of the month following the employee's return to work. Employee Returning to Work The employee should notify the NSHWC of his/her intent to return to work at least four (4) weeks prior to the anticipated date of return, or of any medically necessary changes in the date of return. If the leave was due to the employee's serious health condition, a Return to Work Medical Certification form must be submitted before an employee can return to work. Job restoration is not guaranteed. However, when a leave ends, NSHWC will make reasonable efforts to reinstate the employee to the same position previously held by the employee if it is available. In the eve nt that the employee's job is filled, the NSHWC will make reasonable efforts to reinstate the employee to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified; in the event that an equivalent position is not available, then NSHWC may offer to reinsta te the employee to a lower level position. In accordance with section VII (A) of the employee handbook; if an employee fails to return to work within three (3) business days of the agreed upon return date, NSHWC may assume that the employee has voluntarily resigned. EMPLOYEE CONDUCT & DISCIPLINARY ACTION 701 Employee Conduct and Work Rules Effective Date: 10/31/2013 To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possi ble work environment, NSHWC expect employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization. It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment: xSupplying false or misleading information when applying for employment or during employment xPersonal use of company gas or credit cards xTheft or inappropriate removal or possession of property xFalsification of timekeeping records xWorking under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs xPossession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs or abuse of prescription drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment xFailure or refusal to submit or consent to a required alcohol or drug test xFighting or threatening violence in the workplace xBoisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace xNegligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property xInsubordination or other disrespectful conduct xEngaging in unethical or illegal conduct xHaving a conflict of interest xViolation of safety or health rules xSmoking in prohibited areas xSexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment xPossession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, su ch as explosives or firearms, in the workplace xExcessive absenteeism or tardiness or any absence without notice xUnauthorized absence from work station during the workday 25 x Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment x Unauthorized disclosure of business \"secrets\" or confidential proprietary information x Conduct that reflects adversely upon you, NSHWC x Making or publishing false or malicious statements concerning an employee, supplier, client, NSHWC x Violation of personnel policies x Unsatisfactory performance or conduct that do es not meet the requirements of the position x Other circumstances which warrant discipline Employment with NSHWC is at the mutual consent of NSHWC and the employee, and either party may terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. 702 Drug and Alcohol Use It is NSHWC 's desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a safe and satisfactory manner. While on NSHWC premises and while conducting business-related activities off NSHWCpremises, no employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. However, if an employee is attending a function where alcohol is served, employees ma y consume alcohol, but are expected to not overindulge in alcohol consumption and to comport themselves in an appropriate and professional manner. NSHWC shall not be responsible for violations of this policy or any unlawful acts by employee for violations of this policy. The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabi litation or treatment program. Such violations may also have legal consequences. Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid ti me off to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program. Leave may be granted if the employee agrees to ab stain from use of the problem substance; abides by all NSHWC policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the leave will not cause NSHWC any undue hardship. Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should raise their concerns with the President at 203-241-6464 without fear of reprisal. 703 Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment NSHWC are committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive , including sexual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be to lerated. NSHWC provides sexual harassment training to ensure you the opportunity to work in an environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This definition includes many forms of offensive behavior and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same sex as the harasser. The following is a partial list of sexual harassment examples: x Unwanted sexual advances. x Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors. x Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances. 26xVisual conduct that includes leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters. xVerbal conduct that includes making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, or jokes. xVerbal sexual advances or propositions. xVerbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries about an individual's body, sexuallydegrading words used to describe an individual, or suggestive or obscene letters, notes, or invitations. xPhysical conduct that includes touching, assaulting, or impeding or blocking movements. Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment wh en: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment ; (2) submission or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or, (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. If you experience or witness sexual or other unlawful hara ssment in the workplace, report it immediately to CEO or President at 203-241-6464. You can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal or retaliation. All allegations of sexual harassment will be quickly a nd discreetly investigated. To the extent possible, your confidentiality and that of any witnesse s and the alleged harasser will be protected against unnecessary disclosure. Communications will be made to others only on a limited \"n eed to know\" basis. If you make a complaint under this policy and have not received a satisfactory response, you should contact the CEO or President at 203-241-6464.When the investigation is completed, you will be informed of the outcome of the investigation. Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment must immediately advise President or any member of management so it can be investigated in a timely and confidential manner. Upon completion of the investigation, if necessary, corrective measures will be taken. These measures may include, but are not limited to: training, counseling, warning, suspen sion, or immediate dismissal. Anyone, regardless of position or title, found through investigation to have en gaged in improper harassment will be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. If the investigation is inconclusive, NSHWC may still provide counseling or take other appropriate steps. NSHWC prohibit any form of discipline or retaliation for reporting in good faith the incidents of harassment in violation of this policy, pursuing any such claim or cooperating in the investigation of such reports. 704 Attendance and Punctuality To maintain a safe and productive work environment, NS HWC expects employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. You are also expected to take your lunch/meal times within reasonable timeframes. Absenteeism and tardiness place a burden on ot her employees and on NSHWC. In the rare instances when employees cannot avoid being late to work or are unable to work as scheduled, they should notify their supervisor as soon as possible in advance of the anticipa ted tardiness or absence. If you are going to miss work because you are going to be late or you or a family member is sick, you must notify your supervisor before the time you are to report for work. Your supervisor will advise you of an alternative person to contact if he or she is unavailable. If you do not inform either your supervisor or the altern ative, your tardiness or absence will be considered an unapproved, unscheduled absence. If you fail to notify your supervisor after three (3) business days of consecutive absences, you will be considered to have abandoned y our job. These rules will be enforced uniformly on a non- discriminatory basis. Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Eith er may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 27705 Personal Appearance Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the business image NSHWC presents to customers and visitors. During business hours or when representing NSHWC, y ou are expected to present a clean, neat, and tasteful appearance. You should dress and groom yourself accordin g to the requirements of your position and accepted social standards. This is particularly true if your job involves dealing with constituents or visitors in person. If your supervisor feels your personal appearance is ina ppropriate, you may be asked to leave the workplace until you are properly dressed or groomed. Under such circumstance, you will not be compensated for the time away from work. Consult your supervisor if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate appearance. Where necessary, reasonable accommodation may be made to a person with a disability. Without unduly restricting individual tastes, the following personal appearance guidelines should be followed: xTank tops, tube or halter tops , or shorts may not be worn. xMustaches and beards must be clean, well trimmed, and neat. xHairstyles are expected to be in good taste. xFacial jewelry, such as eyebrow rings, nose rings, lip rings, and tongue studs, is not professionally appropriate and must not be worn during business hours and at business events. xVisible excessive tattoos and similar body art must be covered during business hours and at businessevents. 706 Resignation Resignation is a voluntary act init iated by the employee to terminate employment with NSHWC. Although advance notice is not required, NSHWC requests at least 32weeks' written resignation notice from all employees. Prior to an employee's departure, an exit interview may be scheduled to discuss the reasons for resignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits. 707 Security Inspections NSHWC wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms, explosives, or other improper materials. To this end, NSHWC prohibits the pos session, transfer, sale, or us e of such materials on its premises. NSHWC requires the cooperation of all employees in administering this policy. While NSHWC's premises, employees have no expectation of privacy in their belongings or in workplace areas which include, but are not limited to, offices, cubicles, work locations, Company provided or designated parking areas, desks, computers, rest or eating areas, or ve hicles engaged in Company operations, and any personal belongings on or in any of the above. Desks and other storage devices may be provided for the co nvenience of employees but remain the sole property of NSHWC. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can be inspected by any agent or representative of NSHWC at any time, either with or without prior notice. NSHWC likewise wishes to discourage theft or unauthoriz ed possession of the property of employees, NSHWC, visitors, and customers. To facilitate enforcement of this policy, NSHWC or its representative may inspect not only desks, but also persons entering and/or leaving the prem ises and any packages or other belongings. Any employee 28who wishes to avoid inspection of any articles or materi als should not bring such items onto NSHWC's premises. 708 Solicitation In an effort to ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by NSHWC may not solicit or distribute literature in the workplace at an y time for any purpose, without express permission from the President. NSHWC recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the workplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities during working time. Examples of impermissible forms of solicitation include: xThe Collection of Money, Goods, or Gifts for Community Groups xThe Collection of Money, Goods, or Gifts for Religious Groups xThe Collection of Money, Goods, or Gifts for Political Groups xThe Collection of Money, Goods, or Gifts for Charitable Groups xThe Sale of Goods, Services, or Subscriptions Outside the Scope of Official Organization Business xThe Circulation of Petitions xThe Distribution of Literature Not Approved by the Employer xThe Solicitation of Memberships, Fees, or Dues In addition, the posting of written solicitations on comp any bulletin boards is restricted. These bulletin boards display important information, and employees should consult them frequently for: xPostings Required by Law If employees have a message of interest to the workplace, they may submit it to the President for approval. All approved messages will be posted by the President. 709 Employee Discipline This section is to help you understand what is expected of you with regard to proper behavior, performance, and personal conduct. The purpose of this policy is to state NSHWC's position on administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in the wo rkplace. By complying with these standards you will help to maintain a positive, safe work environment for you and your colleagues. To address those times when you have not lived up to positive standards, we may provide you with counseling, institute progressive discipline, or terminate your employ ment if your conduct warrants it. We have the discretion to decide whether counseling, progressive discipline or i mmediate termination is appropriate. The best disciplinary measure is the one that does not have to be enforced an d comes from good leadership and fair supervision at all employment levels. NSHWC's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatmen t of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform, and impartial. The major purpos e of any disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory service in the future. Although employment with NSHWC is based on mutual consent and both the employee and NSHWC have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, NSHWC may use progressive discipline at its discretion. Disciplinary action may call for any of four steps -- verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, or termination of employment -- depending on the severity of the problem and the number of occurrences. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed. 29Progressive discipline will be used when your supervisor NSHWC feels it is appropriate. The system of progressive discipline gives you notice of deficiencies in performance and an opportunity to improve. When misconduct occurs, progressive disciplinary action may include but is not limite d to the following: counseling and/or verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, and/or termination. Depending on the nature and severity of the misconduct as well as whether it has previously occurred, your supervisor and/or the President may investigate your actions. An investigation is designed to obtain all pertinent facts and may include interviewing you and other witnesses, reviewing documents, etc. Your friends, relatives, attorneys or other third parties are not allowed to participat e in internal investigations. Failure to cooperate with an internal investigation is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including discharge. When the investigation is complete, your supervisor and/or an the President will review the facts and the policies. At that point, your supervisor and/or the President wi ll determine whether you should be disciplined up to and including termination. NSHWC recognizes that there are certain types of employ ee problems that are serious enough to justify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual progressive discipline steps. By using employee discipline, we hope that most employee problems can be corrected at an early stage, benefiting both the employee and NSHWC. 710 Problem Resolution NSHWC is committed to all employees. Part of this comm itment is encouraging an open and frank atmosphere in which any problem, complaint, suggestion, or question re ceives a timely response from the company's supervisors and management. NSHWC strives to ensure fair treatment of all employees . Supervisors, managers, and employees are expected to treat each other with mutual respect. Employees are encouraged to offer positive and constructive criticism. If employees disagree with established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, they can express their concern through the problem resolution procedure. No employee will be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a complaint with the company in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution procedure. If a situation occurs when employees believe that a conditi on of employment or a decision affecting them is unjust or inequitable, they are encouraged to bring those issu es to management's attention using the same procedure described in the Harassment policy. xEmployee presents problem to immediate supervisor at NSHWC after incident occurs. If supervisor is unavailable or employee believes it would be inapprop riate to contact that person, employee may present problem to the President. xSupervisor at NSHWC responds to problem during discussion or after consulting with appropriate management, when necessary. Supervisor documents discussion. xEmployee contacts the CEO or President at 203-241-6464 if the problem is unresolved. xThe CEO or President counsels and advises employee. xCEO or President reviews and considers problem. CEO or President informs employee of decision and forwards copy of written response to employee's file. Not every problem can be resolved to everyone's total satisfaction, but only through understanding and discussion of mutual problems can employees and management develop confidence in each other. This confidence is 30 important to the operation of an efficient and harmonious work environment. MISCELLANEOUS 801 Life-Threatening Illnesses in the Workplace Employees with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer , heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. NSHWC supports these endeavors as long as employees are able to meet acceptable performance standards. Medical information on individual employees is treated confidentially. M NSHWC will take reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure . Managers and other employees have a responsibility to respect and maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 802 Recycling NSHWC supports environmental awareness by encouraging recycling and waste management in its business practices and operating procedures. This support includes a commitment to the purchase, use, and disposal of products and materials in a manner that will best utilize natural resources and minimize any negative impact on the earth's environment. Special recycling receptacles have been set up to promote the separation and collection of the following recyclable materials at NSHWC: x Computer Paper x White High Grade or Bond Paper x Ledger Paper x Mixed or Colored Paper x Newspaper x Corrugated Cardboard x Brown Paper Bags x Aluminum x Plastics x Printer Cartridges The simple act of placing a piece of paper, can, or bottle in a recycling container is the first step in reducing demand on the earth's limited resources. Success of this program depends on active participation by all of us. Employees are encouraged to make a commitment to recycle and be a part of this solution. NSHWC encourages reducing and, when possible, eliminating the use of disposable products. Source reduction decreases the consumption of valuable resources through such workplace practices as: x Two-Sided Photocopying x Minimum Packaging x Reusing Paper Clips, Folders, and Binders x Reusing Packaging Material x Turning Off Lights When Not in Use Whenever possible, employees of NSHWC are encouraged to purchase products for the workplace that contain recycled or easily recyclable materials. Buying recycl ed products supports recycling and increases the markets for recyclable materials. 31803 NSHWC Interpretation The President is responsible for the official interpretation of these policies. Questions regarding the application too this practice should be directed to the President. The NSHWC reserves the right to revise this policy at any time with our without prior notice to employees. 32 NSHWC EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT The employee handbook describes important information about my employment with NSHWC and I understand that I should consult with the President at 203-241-6464 regarding any questions not answered in these policies.

Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center NNSHWC MISSION Nutmeg State Health and Wellne ss Center is an experienced group of medical marijuana p rofessionals dedicated to providing the highest quality medi cine, service, and experience to registered Connecticut medical marijuana patients. We are passionate specialists that strive to enhance the lives of our patients while changing the pe rception of marijuana as a viable and safe medicine for many debilitating conditions. Nutmeg State Health and Wellness Center is a grassroots, community-based, Litchfield Co unty dispensary that offers support and alternative health re sources to patients facing health challenges. Contents Medical Marijuana Information 3 Qualified Diseases in CT 4 Patient Registration 5 Caregiver Registration 6 Physician Registration 7 Medical Marijuana Marijuana (scientifically known as cannabis) contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids. 1. Cannabis Indica 2. Cannabis Sativa Cannabis Sativa Medical use of sativa is associated with a cerebral high and many patients expe rience stimulating effects. For this reason, sativa is often used for daytime treatment. It may cause more of a euphoric sensation and tends to stimulate hunger, making it potentially us eful to patients with eating disorders or anorexia. Sativa also exhibits a higher tendency to induce anxiety and paranoia, so patients prone to these effects may limit treatment with pure sativa, or choose hybrid strains. Cannabis Indica Cannabis indica is associated with sedative effects and is often preferred for night time use, including for treatment of insomnia. Indicais also associated with a more \"stoned\" or meditative sensation than the euphoric, stimulating effects of sativa, possibly because of a higher CBD-to-THC ratio. Many strains of cannabis are currently cultivated for medical use, including strains of both s pecies in varying potencies, as well as hybrid strains designed to incorporate the benefits of both species. Hybrids Hybrids commonly available can be heavily dominated by either Cannabis sativa or Cannab is indica, or relatively balanced, such as so-called \"50/50\" strains.Qualified Conditions in the State of Connecticut (as of November 1, 2013) A patient may only register for a medical marijuana certificate if the patient is a Connecticut resident being treated for a debilitating medical conditio n by a Connecticut-licensed physician. Debilitating Medical Conditions include: xCancer xGlaucoma xPositive Status for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immu ne Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) xParkinson's Disease xMultiple Sclerosis xDamage to the Nervous Tissue of the Spinal Cord with Objective Neurological Indication of Intractable Spasticity xEpilepsy xCachexia xWasting Syndrome xCrohn's Disease xPost-Traumatic for a Registration Certificate: xConnecticut resident. xAt least eighteen (18) years of age or older. xCannot be an inmate confined in a correctional institution or facility under the supervision of the Connecticut Department of Corrections.Patient Registration Process Physicians may certify qualified patients for the palliative use of marijuana through an online registration system that the Department of Consumer Protection has developed. 1. Make an Appointment with Your Physician: xOnly your physician can initiate your application by certifying for the State of Connecticut that you have a medical condition that qualifies you for a medical marijuana registration certificate. xYou must have a oValid e-mail address oPrimary telephone number xCreate a State of Conn ecticut Department of Administrative Services Business Network Account by going to: https://www.biznet.ct.gov/AccountMaint/Login.aspx. oYou will need to provide the following: \u0083Proof of Identity \u0083Proof of Connecticut residency \u0083Current passport size photograph \u0083$100.00 registration fee \u0083checks/money orders should be made payable to \"Treasurer, State of CT\" You will be able to upload these documents and pay the fee when you submit your regist ration application online or you can mail them to the Department.2. Register Your Primary Caregiver, if Applicable If your physician certification indicates a need for you to have a primary caregiver, you must register a qualified caregiver before the State of Connecticut will issue you a registration certificate. The State of Connecticut will not register a patient who needs a primary caregiver un til the caregiver's application is completed and approved. xA primary caregiver applicant will only be able to access the online registration system if: oThe patient's physician indicates a need for a primary caregiver; and oThe patient identifies the applicant as the person who will serve as their primary caregiver and provide the following caregiver information: \u0083Valid e-mail address \u0083Primary telephone number xThe Caregiver must create a State of Connecticut Department of Administrative Services Business Network Account by going to: https://www.biznet.ct.gov/AccountMaint/Login.aspx. oCaregiver will need to provide the following: \u0083Proof of Identity \u0083Proof of Connecticut residency \u0083Current passport size photograph \u0083$25.00 registration fee \u0083checks/money orders should be made payable to \"Treasurer, State of CT\"Physician Eligibility Physicians who wish to certify a patient for medical marijuana must: xPossess an active Connecticut medical license issued by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. xPractice within the State of Connecticut. xPossess an active controlled substance registration issued by the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection that is not subject to limitation. xPossess an active Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) controlled substance registration that is not subject to limitation. xBe registered with, and able to access, the Connecticut Prescription Monitoring Program.The physician should be reasonably available to provide follow-up care and treatment for the patient, including any examinations necessary to determ ine the efficacy of marijuana for treating the patient's debilit ating medical condition, or a symptom thereof. Physicians must also have a bona fide relationship with the patient in order to register them with the program. A bona fide physician-patient relationship means a relationship in which the physician has ongoing responsibility for the assessment, care and treatment of a patient's debilitating medical condition or a symptom of the patient's debilitating medical condition whereby the physician has: xCompleted a medically reasonable assessment of the patient's medical history and current medical condition; xDiagnosed the patient as having a debilitating medical condition; xPrescribed, or determined it is not in the best interest to prescribe, prescription drugs to address the symptoms or effects for which the certification is being issued; xConcluded that, in the physician's medical opinion, the potential benefits of the palliative use of marijuana would likely outweigh the he alth risks to the patient; and xExplained the potential risks and benefits of the palliative use of marijuana to the patient or, where the patient lacks legal capacity, to the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the patient.NNSHWC Hours Monday 11pm HIPAA COMPLIANT HOSTING Liquid Web HIPAA Compliant Hosting Protect Your Users With Liquid Web's Paramount Peace of Mind As Liquid Web has grown, we've come to host many enterprises that utilize and/or transfer highly confidential information.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER'S TRUST SERVICES REPORT To the Management of Liquid Web, Inc.: Scope We have examined Management's assertion that as of June 30, 2013, Liquid Web, Inc. (Liquid Web) maintained effective controls over the web hosting se rvices and supporting systems based on the AICPA and CICA trust services availability and security criteria to provide reasonable assurance that: xThe systems were available for operation and use, as committed or agreed; xThe systems were protected against unauthor ized access (both physical and logical) Liquid Web's management is responsible for this assertion . Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our e xamination. Management's description of the aspects of the hosting services and supporting systems covered by its assertion is at tached. We did not examine this description, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion on it. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standa rds established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and includ ed (1) obtaining an understanding of Liquid Web's relevant controls over the availability and security of the web hosting services and supporting systems; (2) testing and evaluating the operating effectiveness of the controls; and (3) performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circum stances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Inherent limitations Because of their nature and inherent limitations of controls, Liquid Web's ability to meet the aforementioned criteria may be affected. For example, controls may not prevent, or detect and correct error or fraud, unauthorized access to systems and in formation, or failure to comply with internal and external policies or requirements. The projection of any conclusions based on our findings to future periods is subject to the risk that changes ma y alter the validity of such conclusions. Opinion In our opinion, management's assertion refe rred to above is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the AICPA and CICA trust services security and availability criteria. Farmington Hills, Michigan August 23, 2013 A member of UHY International, a network of independent accountin g and consultin g firms2 II. MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION Liquid Web's Assertion: As of June 30, 2013, Liquid Web, in all material respects maintained effective controls over the web hosting services based on the AICPA and CICA trust se rvices criteria for security and system availability set forth in TSP section 100, Trust Services Principles, Criteria, and Illustrations for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, an d Privacy (AICPA, Technical Practice Aids ). We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that: xThe system was protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical) xThe system was available for operation and use, as committed or agreed Further, Liquid Web confirms that to the best of our knowledge and belief, that The controls related to the trust services criteria were suitably designed and operated effectively as of June 30, 2013 to achieve those control ob jectives. The criteria we used in making this assertion were that i. The risks that threaten the achievement of the controls related to the trust services criteria have been identified by Liquid Web. ii. The controls related to the trust services criteria would, if operating as described, provide reasonable assurance that thos e risks would not prevent the control objectives stated in the trust serv ices criteria from being achieved. 3 III.

The Management Team meets on a weekly basis to review the results of operations, discuss unusual activity or events, review key metrics and financial results, an d discuss other matters important to the operation of the Company. In addition, the Executive Management Team is responsible for: xReviewing the professional services to be pr ovided by Liquid Web's independent auditors and the independence of such auditors; xReviewing the scope and results of all audits - internal and external; and xReviewing the system of internal accounting controls and other matters relating to Liquid Web's web hosting services. Organizational Structure The Organization employs a staff of approximately 300 people. Liquid Web is divided into operating departments, which provide a framework for planning, directing, and controlling its operations. Personnel and business functions are segregated into distinct process units listed here: xSales and Marketing - Responsible for all new business development for the company as well as Account Management. xFinance and Administration - Supports the company in all traditional Finance, Accounting and G&A functions including maintaining the Ge neral Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Fixed Assets, and Human Resources. xOperations - Responsible for the data center, network infrastructure, client's deployments, and managed services. Supports all technologies, including, but not limited to: hardware, software programs, software development, networks, desktops, telecommunications, andsecurity. Personnel Policies and Procedures Liquid Web's c ontrols cover all critical aspects of employme nt, including hiring, training and development, performance appraisals, and terminations. In addition, all employees have access to an employee handbook, policies, and procedures. Changes to these documents are communicated to existing personnel in writing. The sensitivity of the job determines the level of background checks performed on applicants before his/her employment. The Human Resources Department is primarily responsi ble for recruiting and evaluating job applicants. Hiring practices are designed to ensure that new employees are qua lified for their job responsibilities. The Human Resources Department and the management of th e department hiring the employee must jointly approve each hiring of a new employee. Liquid Web has a structured interview process, which includes application screening, a screening interview, testing, and interviews. Training of personnel is accomplished through supervised on-the-job training and in-house classes. Certain positions require the completion of special training. Department managers are also responsible for encouraging the training and development of empl oyees so that all personnel continue to improve their skills applicable to their functional responsibilities. Risk Assessment Process Liquid Web recognizes that risk management is a critical component of its operation that helps ensure that assets are properly managed and clients are properly served. Through regular and open communication among staff, management, and its clie nt base, Liquid Web identifies risks that could negatively impact the security of the business. F or any significant risks that are identified and communicated, the Executive Management Team is re sponsible for implementing appropriate measures to monitor and manage these risks. Appropriate measures may include the addition or revision of control procedures, conducting specific investigations, or any other means necessary to provide adequate control. 5 Monitoring Management and supervisory personnel are responsibl e for monitoring the quality of internal control performance as a routine part of their daily duties . To assist them, Liquid Web utilizes a series of management reports and other methods to moni tor the business. Key reports are reviewed by management to help ensure appropriat e action is taken as needed. If i ssues arise that cannot be readily resolved, issues are escalated to the Executive Management Team. Liquid Web Data Centers Liquid Web's data center locations are staffed by highly skilled engineers around the clock. Liquid Web data centers are designed with redundancy installed at every level, ensuring that a failure at any level will not affect your server. Liquid Web data centers po wer is conditioned and reliable through the use of centralized UPS solutions backed by state-of-the-a rt generator technology. Liquid Web's network is robust and reliable. We exclusively utilize premium Tier-1 bandwidth providers, ensuring minimal latency and fast connections to all points of the global internet. Security On-Site Datacenter access is strictly limited to technical staff. Electronic security systems control data center access and are accompanied by a full complement of motion detecting security cameras which monitor the entire facility. Our Datacenter facility external walls are reinforced poured concrete. We are a fully managed facility, which means we have level 3 technici ans on site 24 hours per day, allowing incident response times to be kept to a minimum. All Datacenter visitors are required to register an d wear a visitor badge at all times. All visitors are escorted by a Liquid Web associate at all times while on site. Power Systems Our power systems feature extensive fault tolerance an d resilience at every layer. Incoming service is routed underground to a dedicated on-site transformer. This system routes to our automatic transfer switch that monitors power quality, and automaticall y transfers to our emergency generators in the event they are needed. Each facility is also protected by one or more uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), featuring redundant battery cabinets, and full main tenance bypass cabinets allowing for service and upgrades without interruption of power to our servers. Power distribution units handle final power transfor mation and distribution to racks, ensuring clean consistent power to data center equipment. Each facility has multiple emergency generators waiting on standby, featuring over 24 hours of autonomous runtime before requiring refueling. Each ge nerator is test run at least once a week to ensure they are ready in the event they are needed. Generator fuel is maintained in sub-base storage tanks that are locked. Liebert Precision power dist ribution units handle fina l power transformation and distribution to racks, ensuring clean consistent power to data center equipment. Generator power is activated automatically in the event of a utility failure by the transfer switch. The data center load is maintained by the UPS units with at least 15 minutes of capacity, however this is not necessary as the generator is active and up to speed within 10 seconds of a power failure. Cooling Environmental processing systems include redundant Li ebert Precision 22 ton up flow air conditioning units. Temperature and humidity are precisely monitored and regulated year round to ensure optimal equipment reliability. Alerts are sent to Operations personnel any time temperatur e or humidity is outside an established range. Each unit contains independen t compressors and cooling loops to further enhance fault tolerance and reliability. Air filtration systems actively remove foreign particulates from circulation and cycle the entire data center air supply in a matter of minutes. 6 Fire and Smoke Each facility is monitored with state of the art smoke and fire detection systems. In the unlikely event of a fire, automated fire suppression systems are also in place. The Liquid Web Network The Liquid Web network has been designed to ac commodate clients demanding the highest quality network performance. There is a central focus on re dundancy allowing our network to rapidly self-heal failures without interruptions to connectivity. Our re dundancy is multi-tiered with N+1 internal device elements as well as entirely redund ant chassis allowing any routing device to fail without interrupting client data connectivity. All core routing and sw itching equipment is state of the art Cisco. Engineered by Liquid Web Unlike most providers, Liquid Web owns and operat es its entire infrastructure. By engineering and controlling our infrastructure personally, from routers to servers, we are able to immediately respond to any issue directly. This means that the Liquid Web Engineers that you rely on will have direct physical access to the server. Tier-1 Premium Bandwidth Providers Providing the highest quality Internet connectivity and performance is our top priority. We have selected premium Tier-1 bandwidth providers, ensuring minimal latency and fast connections to all points of the global internet. Our aggregate connectivity reaches an astounding 8,500+ networks just a single network away from our uplinks. Network architecture includes a dual feed network fibe r ring connected at two diverse points at opposite ends of the physical building. These network feeds take diverse paths to separate telecommunications providers where separate colocation facilities house co nnections to multiple internet service providers. Core network devices are maintained within a locked cage facility within the main data center. Only network administration personnel have a ccess to the core network devices. Network architecture includes four layers of full redundancy. The first three layers are controlled exclusively by network administrators, with the lowe st level including limited access by the customer service group in order to facilitate customer access requests. Network Security The entire network is constantly monitored using a custom developed real time network monitoring and alerting system. Any unusual or suspicious network activity is highlighted and forwarded to network administrators for investigation and resolution. Logical Security Liquid Web maintains a collection of more than 20 corporate policies dedicated to maintaining the security of the equipment and the data in their facilities. Security policies are regularly reviewed and updated to account for changes in risks and technologies. Security policies are available at all times via the corporate intranet. All employees are required to read and ackn owledge their understanding of all security policies as part of their initial orientation. Employees are al so required to sign a comprehensive non-disclosure agreement to ensure that client privacy and confidentiality is protected. 7 Logical Security (continued) Security Policies include but are not limited to the following topics: xAcceptable Use Policy xE-mail policy xPassword Policy xInformation Sensitivity Policy xPersonal Communication Device policy xRemote Access Policy xMalware Protection Policy xVPN security policy xWireless Communication Policy Liquid Web Heroic Support\u00ae Overview Liquid Web's Heroic Support\u00ae provides 24/7/365 access to level 3 engineers by phone or email, state of the art infrastructure engineered for complete reliability, software hardening to protect the integrity of your server, proactive monitoring and service restoration, co mplete user level tools for monitoring the health of your server, and if anything was to go wrong - a 100% up-time SLA. Heroic Support\u00ae provides our clients confidence and peac e of mind through complete reliability, engineer accessibility, and proactive service restoration. Our average support request phone call is answered within 20 seconds, with an average electronic support response time of 30 minutes. Our Support Staff Liquid Web has established a world class Heroic Su pport team that is professionally educated and available on-site at each data center 24 hours pe r day. Liquid Web currently employs 320+ Heroic Support engineers with specialties in Technical Support, Server Setup, Networking, Security and more. Liquid Web Sonar Monitoring\u00ae Sonar Monitoring is a dedicated division of Liquid Web solely focused on providing service reliability and immediate incident resolution. The Sonar Monitoring team utilizes a robust set of proprietary system level health and service monitoring tools to constantly en sure your server's optimal performance through early detection of problems. In the event that an issue is identified, our Sonar Monitoring Team responds immediately, reducing downtime and repairing any issues proactively, in many cases before the client is even aware of the problem. The Sonar Monitoring team focuses on prevention of, as well as immediate response to, service interruptions, whether they be software, hardware or network-related. With the bulk of service failures being prevented before occurrence, and nearly all remaining service failures being corrected within minutes, the team operates as a pe rsistent proactive manager of client service consistency. The Liquid Web Sonar Monitoring Team has enabled us to pr ovide the industry's leading 30-minute hardware replacement SLA. Comprehensive Statistics System statistics are presented to customers in an overview and drill down format, allowing clients to view all of their server statistics on a single page, includ ing multiple server accounts. Drill down capabilities include the ability to view details on any individual metr ic and view the status graphically over a period of hours, days, or weeks. Trending is both easy and convenient and offers pe ace of mind that would otherwise be impossible with random sampling. Without a tool such as Sonar, off-hour periods of service degradation are nearly impossible to identify. 8 Sonar Improves Server Up-Time Without Liquid Web Sonar, failures of services or severe service degradations are more single hit scenarios where an incident occurs and a restore is in itiated with no clear vector for repair of the base cause. With Sonar in place, the failure of a service will be detected and restoration will be initiated by technical staff, however with Liquid Web Sonar both client and te chnician are able to evaluate the forensic data of all critical statistics leading to that failure and correct the root of the issue. This powerful tool allows Liquid Web to solve problems that could live for many months even with the most vigilant competing managed providers. Escalation capabilities are built into the core of So nar technology, ensuring that any complete system or service failures are instantly sent to the Liquid Web Service Restoration team for correction before clients even need be aware. Liquid Web's Service Restoration Team corrects a huge majority of failures long before the client is even aware. The Service Restorat ion Team is a highly trained division of Liquid Web specializing in restorations of all levels tasked solely with the purpose of keeping the servers of our clients responsive at all times. Dedicated Server Service Level Agreement (SLA) Hardware Replacement Service Level Agreement Liquid Web guarantees that in the event of a dedicated server hardware failure, the faulty hardware will be replaced within 30 Minutes of identifying the problem. In the ev ent that this guarantee is not met, Liquid Web will issue a credit for ten times the actual amount of additional downtime. The amount of compensation may not exceed the customer's monthly recurring charge. This guarantee does not include the time it requires to perform additional software re lated maintenance, including rebuilding web accounts from backups, cloning hard drives, reloading the operating system, reloading and configuring applications, or rebuilding raid arrays. Network Uptime Service Level Agreement Liquid Web guarantees network uptime to be 100% . This guarantee assures that all major routing devices within our network are reachable from th e global internet 100% of the time. Network SLA Exclusions Many possible situations are completely beyond the control of Liquid Web, and therefore are not in the scope of this SLA. These situations include: xScheduled Network Maintenance - occasionally network maintenance will be required. Liquid Web will do everything possible to minimize and avoid downtime during this maintenance. You will receive prior notification of upcoming main tenance at the email address we have on file. Scheduled maintenance periods are not eligible for SLA credits. xHardware Maintenance - on rare occasions, the hardware in your Dedicated Server may need maintenance or replacement. Liquid Web will do ev erything possible to minimize any downtime in these situations per our hardware replacement SLA. Any downtime incurred as a result of this maintenance will not be coun ted towards our network SLA. xSoftware Maintenance - an important part of managing a dedicated server is keeping the software up to date. If you choose to have Li quid Web manage your server, occasional software updates will be required to address security or performance issues. Usually you will experience little or no downtime in these situations, but we cannot guarantee a specific amount of time in all situations. xMalicious Attacks - if a third party not associated with Liquid Web initiates a \"Denial of Service\" or other form of disabling attack against your Ded icated Server or major portions of our network, Liquid Web will do everything in its power to stop the attack, but cannot guarantee a resolutiontime. xLegal Actions - In the case that a legal action is taken against a customer of Liquid Web and Liquid Web is required to act in accordance with the order, Liquid Web shall not be responsible for any SLA damages.9 Network SLA Exclusions (continued) xcPanel Issues - if you choose to run cPanel and Web Host Manager on your Dedicated Server, the default install will be configured for automatic updates of cPanel related software. Onoccasion, one of these automatic updates could adve rsely affect all or part of the cPanel related software on you server. Liquid Web will do wh atever is necessary to fix any cPanel related problems, but cannot guarantee a resolution time. Network SLA Remedy In the event that Liquid Web does not meet this SLA, Dedicated Hosting clients will become eligible to request compensation for downtime. If Liquid Web is or is not directly responsible for causing the downtime, the customer will receive a credit for 10 times (1,000%) the actual amount of downtime . This means that if your server is unreachable for 1 hour (beyond the 0.0% allowed) , you will receive 10 hours of credit. All requests for compensation must be received within 5 business days of the incident in question. The amount of compensation may not exceed the customer's monthly recurring charge. This SLA does not apply for any month that the customer has been in breach of Liquid Web Terms of Service or if the account is in default of payment. Response Time SLA Liquid Web's managed customers are covered by our thirty-minute initial response time guarantee. That means that when you submit a trouble ticket via ou r help desk system you are guaranteed a response from a Heroic Support\u00ae technician within thirty minute s. If Liquid Web fails to respond within thirty minutes, you will be credited 10 times the amount of time exceeding our SLA commitment. That means that if your ticket goes 1 hour past our stated initia l response time guarantee, your account will receive a 10 hour hosting credit. All requests for compensation must be received within 5 business days of the incident in question. The amount of compensation may not exceed the customer's monthly recurring charge. This SLA does not apply for any month that the customer has been in breach of Liquid Web Terms of Service or if the account is in default of payment. 10User Control Considerations Liquid Web controls are only a portion of the overall control of each client. Clients of Liquid Web also need to implement and maintain effective internal controls. This section highlights those controls that Liquid Web believes should be present for each client. Liquid Web has considered the following controls in developing the controls which are described in Section IV of this report. Each client must evaluate its own internal controls to determine if the foll owing controls and procedures are in place. Liquid Web's systems were designed with the assumption that certain controls would be implemented by user organizations. In certain situations, the applicatio n of specific controls at user organizations is necessary to achieve certain control objectives included in this report. This section describes other internal control structure policies and procedures that should be in operation at user organizations to complement the control st ructure policies and procedures at Liquid Web. User auditors should consider whether the following policies and procedures have been placed in operation at user organizations: xEach customer must acknowledge receipt and understanding of the Terms of Service and Service Level Agreement for the partic ular services they sign up for. xFor customers that select optional backup of th eir data, a monitoring an d backup system ensures successful data backup. Verification of backup da ta and restoration of systems and data is solely the responsibility of the customer. xCustomer data backup is an optional service which is provided by maintaining backups of customer data. Procedures for maintaining custom er data backups are available on the company intranet. xCertain security functions may require additional authentication by customer service reps either online or by telephone. xLiquid Web does not provide for data classificati on for customer data. Customers are responsible for classification of their own data. xIf Liquid Web's default backup schedule is not sele cted, client is responsible for determining the backup schedule that is appr opriate for thei r business needs. xClient is responsible for maintaining accurate contact information with Liquid Web personnel. xClient is solely responsible for software and database maintenance. xFor all layers of technology that are not spec ified in a client contract as Liquid Web's responsibility (including, but not limited to , networking, operating system, database, and application layers), the client is responsible for properly administering and securing relevant layers of technology (e.g., determining appropri ate access, segregation of duties, audit trails, etc.). Client is fully responsible for controlling ac cess to supervisor id and passwords that would allow control over customer processing and data. xClients are responsible for the review of metri cs and statistics and for communicating any issues with service levels to Liquid Web. xLiquid Web Terms of Service specify prohibited content, prohibited services and processes. It is each client's responsibility to agree to and abide by the Terms of Service.QUIETSOURCE\u00ae SERIES 22-48 kW AUTOMATIC STANDBY GENERATORS The premium in home and business backup power protection Premium Features Paired with Extra Quiet Operation Premium features are standard on Generac's powerful QuietSource automatic standby generators.
