Once you've had a shot for a particular disease, you might think you're always safe from it. But that's not necessarily the case. For some diseases, you need more than one shot to build strong [immunity](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/10-immune-system-busters-boosters). For others, your protection wears off over time. And some viruses change, or mutate, over time, making your [vaccine](https://www.webmd.com/covid-19-vaccine) less effective. For most vaccinations, you need one more jab after the initial series to get more protection. This extra dose of a [vaccine](about:blank) is known as a booster shot. How Do Vaccine Boosters Work? A vaccine contains weakened forms of the disease-causing virus or bacteria, or parts of these germs. Or it may be made of an altered genetic \"blueprint\" for the germ that can make you sick. The shot triggers your [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) to attack the foreign organism, like it would if you actually got the disease. This helps your immune system \"remember\" the disease-causing germ. If you're exposed to it again, the antibodies can recognize and kill it before it causes harm. Research has shown that booster shots train your body to recognize the virus or bacteria and defend itself. Depending on the type of vaccine and the manufacturer, you might get a booster weeks, months, or even years after your first shot. Who Needs Booster Shots? You may get booster shots as a [baby](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/default.htm), teen, or adult. You may also need to re-up some vaccinations depending on your lifestyle, travel, or job (for example, if you're a [health care](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/default.htm) worker). Vaccine boosters Varicella Vaccine boosters you may need as a teen or adult include: Experts recommend that both children and adults get the seasonal [flu shot](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/fact-sheet-vaccines) each year. While it's not 100% effective, it may prevent severe illness. [Flu shots](https://www.webmd.com/video/truth-about-flu-shots) are especially important for [pregnant](https://www.webmd.com/baby/default.htm) women, older adults, and those who have chronic conditions like [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm) or [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/default.htm). During each pregnancy, women need the Tdap vaccine to protect against whooping cough. You usually get it between weeks 27 and 36 of your pregnancy. Along with the flu and Tdap vaccine, health care workers should stay up to date on their hepatitis B, MMR, [chickenpox](https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-chickenpox), and [meningitis](https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-meningitis-basics) shots. International travelers may need certain vaccines, depending on their destinations. Antibodies from these vaccines wear off over time, so make sure you're up to date on vaccines for diseases like [typhoid](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/typhoid-fever). The CDC's [Traveler's Health](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) page can help you find out which ones you need. If you're not sure which disease you need a booster for, ask your doctor. COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Most people who got a vaccine against COVID-19 are already protected against serious illness from the coronavirus. But even highly effective vaccines often become less effective over time, and the coronavirus vaccines are no exception. Initial evidence on mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna suggest they start to lose some of their power against infection and serious illness, regardless of variant of the virus (i.e. Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron, etc.). If you got the Pfizer vaccine, the CDC recommends a booster for anyone 12 or older as long as you are 5 months or more past your initial vaccination (first 2 shots). You can get the Pfizer or Moderna booster, unless you are 12 to 17 years of age, in which case only the Pfizer is recommended. If you got the Moderna vaccine, the CDC recommends a booster for anyone 18 or older, as long as you are 5 months or more past your initial vaccination (2 shots). You can get the Moderna or the Pfizer booster in most situations. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure. If you got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC recommends a booster for anyone 18 or older, as long as you are 2 months or more past your initial vaccination (1 shot). You can get the Moderna or the Pfizer booster in most situations. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure. "}
