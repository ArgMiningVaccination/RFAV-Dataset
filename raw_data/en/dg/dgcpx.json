Herbal Medicines for Depression and Anxiety which are safe in Breastfeeding - Saffron is Known to be the the world's most expensive spice due to the labour intensiveness of its production, Saffron's use as a medicinal herb has been documented for over 4,000 years. In December 2017, the journal Phytomedicine published the results of a clinical trial on saffron stigma for treating mothers suffering from postpartum depression. Results showed that the group treated with 15mg twice daily of Saffron Stigma showed a 96% remission rate for post-partum depression, twice that of the placebo group. They concluded that it was a safe and significant treatment for mothers suffering from Post-Partum depression. (Tabeshpour et al., 2017). - High doses of Omega-3 liquid from Fish Oil has been shown to reduce depression through lowering neuro-inflammation, and can be especially beneficial in the perinatal period (Kendall-Tackett, 2010). It is also one of the most important nutrients for your baby's brain development. The recommended dose needs to contain approximately 2 grams of EPA per day and will take 3-4 weeks to exert its effects. It is recommended to take before birth to build up stores and to assist in brain development in the infant. It is important to be taking a highly purified fish oil which is tested for heavy metal contamination. - Curcuminoids derived from Turmeric have shown significant benefits for treating depression and anxiety. In a six week study, 50 individuals diagnosed with depression were randomised to receive 20mg/day of fluoxetine (a conventional anti-depressant) and 25 mg/day of Turmeric individually or in combination. The mean change in scores and remission rates were similar across all three groups, suggesting that Turmeric has an equal effect to fluoxetine for the management of depression. It has been shown to be safe in breastfeeding. Use in late term pregnancy is not advised due to its blood thinning effects and theoretical risk of early labour. - Vitamin D is especially important as depression has been linked to low vitamin D levels. This is especially significant during the winter months when sunlight exposure is particularly low. It is also one of the nutrients recommended by the Ministry of Health for healthy development newborn babies. An Adult's recommended doses range from 1000iu a day or more depending on the levels of Vitamin D in the blood. - Another important yet unknown nutrient for mothers and babies is Inositol. Inositol is the third most abundant carbohydrate found in breastmilk and has been shown to be a vital component for your baby's brain development. It has also been shown to be very effective for reducing anxiety, panic disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive disorders. It needs to be taken in high doses (12g - 18g daily) so powders are recommended. - Magnesium has been shown to significantly decrease symptoms of anxiety and supports mood. It also improves quality of sleep. Recommended doses are 300mg of elemental Magnesium once or twice a day. - B Vitamins are essential for healthy stress response and neurotransmitter balance. It is recommended to take a Vitamin B complex as they will work synergistically with each other to achieve better results. - A pilot study in 2012 concluded that there were positive effects of using Aromatherapy as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum anxiety and depression.
