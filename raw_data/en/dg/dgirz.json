Its essence is in the fact that instead of curing the symptoms the root cause of the disease is worked upon. Further, in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the physicians work directly on boosting the natural immunity of the human body. All the treatment procedures begin with the basic body cleansing and [detoxification](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/packages/detoxification-package). This not only prepares the body for properly processing the medicines, but it also boosts its immunity. All the treatment procedures also focus on the body's natural immunity and involve certain metabolism and immunity-boosting medicines and lifestyle changes to cure patients in an effective manner. The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a huge shift towards a healthy lifestyle and has motivated people to work towards boosting their immunity. In Ayurveda, immunity is considered as the disease-fighting and disease-deterring ability of the human body that we are born with. There are lots of bacteria and microbes in our body organs and our environment. When we come close to the environmental microbes, our bodies develop the natural ability to fight the diseases caused by them. This, in turn, boosts the immune system of our body. Distancing ourselves from nature and living in confined spaces have lowered our body defenses. This has led to the weakening of the immune system. As per Ayurveda, the diseases are categorized into - Nija (caused by one's own body, its disposition, and its composition) and Aganthu (caused by exposure to the external factors). Ayurvedic books also acknowledge the communicable diseases that can spread in societies. The ancient texts mention Janapadaudhwamsa that were the local governing bodies responsible for nutritional guidance and sanitation facilities. Charaka Samhita that dates back to 2nd Century AD also mentions the epidemic that can spread across the communities due to a common external factor. This book also mentions the spread of epidemics and diseases by microbes carried by air, water, and soil. Now, as per the [Ayurvedic treatment](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda) methodology, all the diseases originate in our bodies (in the digestive system or gut). Faulty digestion, improper digestion, and indigestion are some of the major reasons for diseases. In Ayurveda, immunity is mentioned and explained under different topics. Out of all these references, Bala and Vyadhi Kshamatha are the two most important ones. Bala refers to the natural ability of our body to nourish and heal itself. Vyadhi Kshamatha refers to the resistance to diseases and illnesses. Another important concept is of Ojas that refers to the supreme resilience of human bodies. While Bala is a result of the overall balance of body, the Vyadhi Kshamatha denotes our immune system functions and its recovery after coming in contact with disease-causing microbes. Ayurveda mentions that every human body has three dispositions - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata is caused by the aggravation of the air element in our body. Pitta is caused by the aggravation of body acids and produces excessive body heat. Kapha is a result of the aggravation of phlegm. Every human body has a distinct reaction to a disease because of its unique disposition. Now that we have explored the various concepts and references related to body immunity, let us move on to explore the connection between immunity and the human mind. Ayurveda considers immunity as an end result of homeostasis and balanced metabolism. However, in the past few decades, the connection between our mind and emotions, and our immunity is being studied comprehensively. This study is termed as Psychoneuroimmunology and studies the effect of our central nervous system on our immune response. The Ayurveda explains Ojas as the one that affects immunity via excessive anger, exertion, cravings, worries, and other such extreme emotions. By understanding the intricate connection between all these elements and our bodies, Ayurvedic experts develop natural medicines and remedies that influence all the doshas and our immunity. Since our immunity system is affected by our actions, lifestyle, and diets, it is in our hands to boost our immunity or to degrade it. Let us find the factors responsible for both situations. Imbalanced diet leads to digestive issues as it has excessive things such as processed sugars, additives, and excessive spices that weaken the immune system. Excessive alcohol intake leads to an excessive increase in body toxins and leads to liver damages. Irregular sleep patterns affect the natural healing ability of our bodies and reduce immunity. High stress and obesity send our hormonal systems into a frenzy and lower our immunity. Chronic medications are taken for a long time and prove detrimental to immunity. Faulty lifestyle habits have a direct impact on our immune system. Increase your water intake to naturally flush the toxins from your body. Don't take conflicting foods together, such as milk and salty or fried foods. Limit the number of spices you add n your daily foods. Include light exercises in your daily routine and do them religiously. Stay away from all types of addictions. Improve your eating habits by including nutritious foods in your daily diet. Consume herbal teas such as Tulsi, Pippali, and ginger, etc. These herbal concoctions detoxify various body organs and cleanse our bodies. Use healthy spices in your food such as turmeric and black pepper that have excellent herbal properties. Minimize intake of meats, red and processed. They are not digested in our bodies and lead to high cholesterol. Take juices such as Amla juice, Aloe Vera juice, Giloy Juice, and Chyavanprash, etc after consulting with an Ayurveda expert. Drink plenty of water. If you can drink warm water, then it is best for your body. This keeps the body hydrated, lubricated, and keeps the mucous membranes moist. Thus, it becomes a good barrier to all kinds of microbes. Daily usage of Ayurveda herbal oil for mild body massage and a warm bath will improve the strength of the body. Adequate sleep of 6-7 hours.
