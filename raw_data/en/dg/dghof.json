The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) promotes, protects, and supports breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant feeding for the first two years, and beneficial to both the infant's and the mother's health. About our Breastfeeding Services: Breastfeeding promotion and support are core components of WIC benefits and services for participants. Examples of WIC benefits and services: Recommendations: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life unless [medically contraindicated](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/contraindications-to-breastfeeding.html), followed by continued breastfeeding for up to two years (or as long as mutually desired by mother and infant) while complementary foods are introduced. Medical Data and Breastfeeding Support Referral Form Healthcare providers may use the form below to refer participants for WIC services and breastfeeding support and share anthropometric data such as height, weight, and hemoglobin with local agency WIC clinics. Workplace Support: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mothers are one of the fastest-growing segments of the workforce. With more women in the workforce, mothers may rely on expressing their breast milk while separated from their babes. Workplace support can increase breastfeeding duration, staff loyalty, and the employer's public image. Consequently, workplace breastfeeding support can decrease absenteeism, employer healthcare costs, and employee turnover.
