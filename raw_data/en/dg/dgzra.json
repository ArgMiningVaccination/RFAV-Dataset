Besides the physical benefits, essential oils can have subtle effects on the mind and emotions. \"Aromatherapy is a nurturing experience,\" says aromatherapist Patricia Hall. \"Plants and their oils have been used to heal and beautify the body since the dawn of creation. Whether the oils are absorbed into the body through the skin or via inhalation, true plant aromas have a powerful effect on the mind, body and emotions.\" Aromatherapists use essential oils in their work, usually in the form of a massage. Essential oils are highly concentrated, volatile substances distilled from aromatic herbs, flowers and trees. They are usually quite fragrant and each scent triggers a different emotion. Aromatherapists don't use medicines to treat illnesses. Instead, they believe that essential oils, coupled with an aromatherapy massage, can relieve headaches and muscular tension, help to alleviate depression and stress, stimulate the immune system to fight off illness, soften dry skin, enhance relaxation and much more. Aromatherapists talk to their clients to diagnose problems, then choose the right treatment to help them. They believe that massage helps the person to relax and encourages the body to heal itself. For every stage and type of disease, there is a corresponding combination of plant oils to correct and balance that disease. The goal of the aromatherapist is to create this balanced remedy for each client. \"Each essential oil has its own set of attributes and personality,\" says Hall. \"Aromatherapy incorporates the use of these oils to deal with the mind and emotions, as well as afflictions affecting the skin and body. It will nourish the body, mind and spirit in a vital and restorative way.\" The oils may be used in baths, since water itself has a therapeutic value that enhances the power of the oils. Or they can be used in a compress, inhaled or used in a vaporizer. Natural perfume can be made by blending different oils. To work as an aromatherapist, you must: - Care for people and want to help them - Have strong hands - Have patience - Be fit and active with a lot of energy - Be interested in plants and science - Be able to find the cause of problems An aromatherapist may work as a massage therapist, a reflexologist, a holistic health practitioner, an esthetician, a salesperson, an educator, a health care practitioner or in a spa.
