He used 20 drops at night, it helps him so much, he's calm, relaxed & sleeps well - Sleep much improved After years of poor sleep, I have very good sleep after taking Avena Sativa comp. Albeit, I take at least 20 drops at bedtime, and same dose again if I wake up in the middle of the night. It costs more than some remedies, but for me, it's worth the relief. - Peaceful I have fibromyalgia, I don't sleep well as a result to painful joints. These drops, help me go straight to sleep! I still wake up but instead of 6times a night, it's reduced to 3. This product is amazing! - Found these efficacious in many situations. I've used these drops occasionally for years and found them particularly useful when flying long haul as I can't normally sleep much on planes. They helped me sleep and wake more refreshed than usual after a long flight. - Brilliant I'm using them for my special needs 14 yr old son with IDIC 15 and autism, he as started with seizures but when we up his meds he is so aggressive, so I decided to try these drops morning and night, seizures have stopped, so has his aggression, and sleeps soundly through the night You may also like [Larch Resin comp.
