By H.E. sun Weidong \"You come from the snow-capped mountains, the spring tide reveals your style; You rush to the east sea, the torrents show your spirit...\" in china, the song of the Yangtze river, which depicts the majestic grace of the longest river in china, is known by all. The Yangtze River is a mother river of china. over the millennia, rushing from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and pouring into the east china sea, it has nourished the underpinnings of chinese civilization, and cultivated the national character of the chinese nation. however, due to over-exploitation in the process of rapid economic growth in recent decades, our mother river has become seriously ill. The river is silted up and its water body polluted with garbage everywhere and the ecological balance broken. It is painful to even look at it. reviving Yangtze river President Xi Jinping highly values the protection and management of the Yangtze river and china's other mother rivers. in 2016, he chaired a meeting in chongqing city on the development of Yangtze river economic belt and highlighted the importance of \"treating the illness of Yangtze river\". in 2018, he visited cities along the Yangtze river and presided over a symposium in wuhan, a major city on the Yangtze river, deliberating on News from chiNa | chiNa-iNdia review |November 2019 | 17 advancing the Yangtze river economic belt and finding solutions to Yangtze river pollution. President Xi pointed out that to cure the \"illness of Yangtze river\", we should follow the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, find the root causes and treat them systematically. The key is to restore the balance between promotion of grand strategies and major breakthroughs, coordinate ecological protection and resource development, synergize overall planning and long-term efforts, replacing old growth drivers with new ones and harmonize self-development and coordinated development. smart Governance after years of efforts, china has developed a set of effective measures for mother rivers' governance. First, Update mindset. All stakeholders shall jointly protect the mother river basin rather than conduct excessive development. we should recognize that \"lucid waters and lush mountains\" are actually \"mountains of gold and silver\". a holistic approach toward ecological environmental protection and economic growth shall be adopted. second, optimize top-level design. incorporate the development of Yangtze river economic belt into the overall national strategy and align it with the overall development of the country. Third, establish an innovative mechanism to harmonize the guiding role of the central government, the overall responsibility of provincial governments and the implementation responsibilities of municipal and county governments. Fourth, apply a unified blueprint and focus on implementation. The source for river pollution lies in the bank and its root cause is industrialization. we should strictly enforce environmental protection laws and push the polluting enterprise to transform and upgrade.president Xi pointed out that to cure the \"illness of yangtze river\", we should follow the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, find the root causes and treat them systematically.18 | News from chiNa | chiNa-iNdia review | November 2019 here is a case in point. it's reported that a chemical company is located close to the Yangtze river. Its industrial capacity ranks the world top three and has been seriously polluting the river for years. The reason for that is the cost for violating environmental law has remained low. following the new concept and policy, local environmental protection agency issued a fine of nearly $3.9 million on the company, the largest ever environmental fine in the Yangtze river basin. The company reflected on it and decided to invest $14 million in sophisticated pollution control equipments and upgraded its production line. Thus, not only the age-old pollution issue was solved, the company transformed itself and upgraded its business with better economic benefits, a win-win scenario. with personal input and leadership of President Xi Jinping, the ecological environment along the Yangtze river basin is improving remarkably. The area is seeing industries upgrading, waters turning cleaner and the harmony between man and river being restored. china has also applied targeted governance measures in the Yellow river area. sabarmati Clean-up recently, i visited ahmedabad and made a special tour of the sabarmati river clean-up campaign. i saw the river with clean water and green trees and people enjoying the benefits of the water. The river bank where President Xi and Prime Minister Modi took a walk together in 2014 has became a beautiful leisure resort for local people. This shows that the indian government also takes the management of Mother-Rivers like the Ganges seriously, and remarkable progress has been made in india's river management efforts. Common responsibility Not long ago, the leaders of china and india held their second informal meeting in chennai, providing strategic guidance for bilateral relations. The leaders stressed that china and india should learn from each other, \"brighten up each other\" and realize the great rejuvenation of the two great civilizations.

To the many old and new friends gathered here from across the world, i give you my warm greetings and best wishes! New Era, shared Future a year ago in this same place, the inaugural china international import expo was successfully held. Today, we are happy to be joined by even more friends in the second expo that carries on the theme of \"New era, shared future\". i trust that you will all find your participation in the event worthwhile and rewarding! at last year's expo, i announced the initiatives China was to take in the five areas of further opening-up and spelt out three specific steps for shanghai to open wider to the world. one year on, these initiatives and steps have been by and large put in place. The shanghai Pilot free Trade Zone now has a Lingang special area, and six other new pilot free trade zones have been set up in other provinces of the country. The Shanghai Stock Exchange launched a sci-tech innovation board, with a registration system being piloted for the listing of companies. in the Yangtze river delta area, a plan for integrated development of the region has been introduced as a national strategy. at the national level, a foreign investment Law will enter into force on January 1 next year. a management system in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the second China international import expo in shanghai on november 5, 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled a slew of defining initiatives for further opening of the Chinese economy and exhorts the international community to work together to build an open world economy for mutual benefits.

Think Global economic globalization represents the trend of history. Like the world's great rivers, the Yangtze, the Nile, the amazon and the danube - they all surge forward in relentless flow, and nothing can stop their mighty movement, not the current of undertows or hidden shoals or rocks beneath the water. of the problems confronting the world economy, none can be resolved by a single country alone. we must all put the common good of humanity first rather than place one's own interest above the common interest of all. we must have a more open mindset and take more open steps, and work together to make the pie of the global market even bigger. We need to strengthen the mechanisms for sharing benefits globally, and explore new ways of international cooperation. The goal is to give more impetus to economic globalization and remove impediments as much as we could. for that to happen, i want to propose the following: First, let us work together to build an open world economy through cooperation. as global value and supply chains continue to develop, countries are inter-connected with each other, and integration of their economy is the order of the day. distances between countries are getting shorter, and interactions among countries are growing, hence the probability of differences and frictions. The right solution lies in consultation and cooperation. all problems could be settled in the spirit of equality, mutual understanding and accommodation. we economic globalization represents the trend of history. like the world's great rivers, the Yangtze, the nile, the amazon and the danube - they all surge forward in relentless flow, and nothing can stop their mighty movement, not the current of undertows or hidden shoals or rocks beneath the water.48 | News from chiNa | chiNa-iNdia review | November 2019 need to promote development through opening- up and deepen exchanges and cooperation among us. we need to \"join hands\" with each other instead of \"letting go\" of each other's hands. we need to \"tear down walls\", not to \"erect walls\".

Countries need to step up cooperation in innovation. we need to facilitate integration of science and technology with economic growth, and increase the sharing of innovation results. we need to remove barriers that hamper the flow of knowledge, technology, talents and other factors of innovation, and support our businesses in technical exchanges and cooperation on their own accord. This is a way to unleash the potential for innovation. And, to benefit mankind with the better use of knowledge, we need to tighten the protection of intellectual property.

Their vilification shows clearly how they deploy double standards on counter-terrorism and de-radicalization issues and use Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in china's internal affairs. Purely Internal Affair Xinjiang affairs are purely china's domestic affairs. The issue Xinjiang faces is not about ethnicity, religion or human rights. rather, it is about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. since 2015, china has released seven white papers on Xinjiang's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts as well as vocational education and training work, which are clear and thorough statements on what happens in Xinjiang. Legal rights for Trainees The vocational education and training centers in Xinjiang were set up in accordance with law, which are by no means \"internment camps.\" all Xinjiang: Stability & ethnic Solidarity Best response to Disinformation Stability,ethnic solidarity, prosperity and harmony in Xinjiang provide the best response to the disinformation campaign on China's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts, says Chinese Ambassador to India H.E. Sun Weidong by h.e. sun weidongNews from chiNa | chiNa-iNdia review |November 2019 | 61 Without a single case of violent terrorist attacks for nearly three years, Xinjiang is witnessing rapid economic growth, social stability, ethnic unity and religious harmony. legal rights of the trainees at the centers have been fully protected, and there is no restriction or deprivation with regard to their freedom. Without a single case of violent terrorist attacks for nearly three years, Xinjiang is witnessing rapid economic growth, social stability, ethnic unity and religious harmony. People's right to life, health and development and other basic rights have been effectively safeguarded. The government's measures have been endorsed by all ethnic groups. since the end of 2018, over 1,000 foreign diplomats, international organization officials and media personnel from more than 90 countries and regions have visited vocational education and training centers. many people expressed the view that Xinjiang's practice of setting up vocational education and training centers is in complete alignment with the UN policies on preemptively combatting terrorism and protecting primary human rights, which is commendable and worth learning by others. Freedom of religion The chinese government protects the freedom of religious belief of all chinese nationals, including Xinjiang Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. There are nearly 200 million religious believers in china. among them are more than 20 million muslims and over 380,000 clerics. There are approximately 5,500 religious groups and over 140,000 places of worship registered for religious activities. in Xinjiang, there are 24,400 mosques, which means there is a mosque for every 530 muslims on average. china is a country under the rule of law with full judicial procedures. The judicial organs in Xinjiang handle criminal suspects based on the specific nature and details of each case in accordance with law and regulations. The freedom of communication and privacy of chinese citizens are protected according to law. mass surveillance and communication restriction are not contentious issues in Xinjiang. Xinjiang's practice has demonstrated that combatting terrorism in accordance with law has met people's eager expectation for security, and effectively safeguarded social harmony and stability, thus making people feel happier and safer. We will continue to implement our Xinjiang policy and ensure the region's sound development. The most powerful response to certain media and individuals is Xinjiang's lasting prosperity, stability, ethnic solidarity and social harmony.62 | News from chiNa | chiNa-iNdia review | November 2019 This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's republic of china and the 60th anniversary of democratic reform in Tibet. over the past 60 years, under the leadership of the communist Party of china, great changes have taken place in Tibet.
