Therefore, we need better tools and an understanding that we are, in fact, helping the whole person including body, mind and spirit. Moreover, any health issue has an endocrine relationship. Hormone imbalances from PMS to post-menopausal complaints plague women of all ages. Men also suffer hormonal imbalances, which can lead to either aggression on one hand or to depression and low libido on the other. The Homeopathic Hormone Rejuvenation System (Created by Dr. Theresa Dale) is designed to balance hormones using non-toxic homeopathic remedies in place of either natural or synthetic hormone replacement. Recent evidence in medical literature has brought to our attention the side effects of synthetic hormone replacement. Even \"natural\" hormone replacement can also cause significant symptoms, including abnormal and toxic hormone levels and liver congestion. We will first look at the cause of hormone imbalances, then at the problems associated with synthetic and natural hormone replacement. In the Homeopathic Hormone Rejuvenation Program, the first step is to remove the blocks to healing, then detoxify the body (particularly the liver), and third is the use of Homeopathic hormone remedies to balance hormones, emotions and the nervous system. What are hormones? Hormones are messengers that your body uses to regulate its functions. The particular hormones we are concerned with are the steroid hormones. These include estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, cortisol and aldosterone. All of these steroid hormones are initially derived from cholesterol. The hormones are incredibly closely related molecularly - this is important as many of these hormones can be converted into another hormone very easily. For example, supplementing with DHEA can produce either testosterone OR estrogen. Most importantly though, is to understand that if you supplement with any ONE of these hormones, you can easily imbalance the entire system. The Causes of Hormone Imbalance include Stress: Adrenal stress in one of the major causes of hormone imbalance. Diet (sugar, caffeine, alcohol, carbohydrates, poor nutrition) Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) Medication (Cortisone, anti-inflammatory drugs, glucose regulating drugs such as insulin, synthetic and natural hormone replacement including thyroid drugs, antibiotics, high blood pressure meds etc.) Dental Issues: Every tooth has an endocrine relationship. Dental material that is not biocompatible can be the source of hormonal issues (such as metal implants or fillings) Scar tissue: Energy flow blockages along acupuncture meridians can develop Environmental exposure to toxins (pesticides, radiation, EMFs, mercury, lead, any toxin) An imbalance in the Autonomic Nervous System: Causes can be structural, electromagnetic, chemical and/or emotional Chronic Stress as a cause of hormonal imbalance The results of chronic stress can affect the body in Four Phases and show the following symptoms at each stage: Phase One: Adrenal Adaptation Phase Four: Blood Sugar Events A hypoglycemic evet occurs when one cortisol level is elevated If two or more cortisol levels are elevated, a blood sugar disorder is likely to be present and/or a genetic predisposition. The Dangers of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) We are continuing to find out the devastating effect of hormone replacement therapy on the human body. Research shows that ALL hormones that are taken or used internally or externally (including natural ones), have a negative effect. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), whether natural or synthetic, is based on the incorrect assumption that your body becomes incapable of producing appropriate hormones simply because we reach a certain age. Yes, your body does alter it's hormone production as you pass through the stages of your life, but hormone problems are a function of how healthy you are, not how old you are. Natural hormone usage has grown since synthetic HRT has been deemed toxic and a potential cancer risk. Millions of women are now using synthetic, natural \"plant-derived\" and synthesized \"bioidentical\" hormones. The problem for the consumer is education about product safety. Natural progesterone, estrogen, and wild yam creams can cause an extreme toxicity in hormone levels. If a woman's progesterone level is 100 and it jumps to 6,500 due to use of a cream, this becomes a toxic burden to the liver and immune system. Moreover, life-threatening symptoms can be easily camouflaged by using natural hormones. Viruses, bacteria, parasites or drugs can stress adrenal cortisol levels, causing hormone imbalance. Once the adrenals become stressed, symptoms like hot flashes, depression, mood swings, hair loss and weight gain can be experienced. Any hormone replacement, whether it is natural or synthetic, actually causes the body to slow down the production of it's own natural hormones. This includes melatonin, DHEA, progesterone, and human growth hormone. HRT does NOT treat the cause of any problem. It only addresses and perpetuates the symptoms. If we use \"natural\" hormones, it is similar to placing a band-aid on a health concern instead of treating the cause. Someone with undiagnosed hepatitis C can easily have hormonal symptoms due to the fact that the liver conjugates hormones and the adrenals are stressed. If we use hormones to address the symptoms, the body might stop communicating the symptoms - this could lead a doctor or practitioner in the wrong direction and towards an incorrect diagnosis - which would be Hepatitis C in this example. Since women are no longer willing to accept the risks associated with synthetic hormones and are searching for safer alternatives, they are vulnerable to the marketing concepts of \"natural\" hormone replacement being portrayed as a safe answer to HRT. Hormone Replacement Therapy - Important FACTS Before and after test results reveal that synthetic, natural and bioidentical compounded hormones cause many problems including: The body shuts down production of it's own natural hormones. A dependence on the replacement hormones develops, aging the body. Toxicity burdens the entire body including the liver, kidneys, blood and the immune system. Hormone levels become toxic Hormone levels become elevated affecting cortisol levels Using these will cover up or camouflage the true cause which could also be life threatening Effects of Estrogen Plus Progestin on Global Cognitive Function in Postmenopausal Women The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Rapp et al.JAMA.2003; 289: 2663-2672 Findings from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) published in the May 28th 2003 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association have revealed yer another downside to combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT)in postmenopausal women. Researchers from Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center found that the combination of estrogen plus progestin is associated with double the rate of dementia in women sixty-five years of age and older who took the hormones for an average of four years compared to those not on HRT. 4,532 women took part in this sub-study of the Women's Health Initiative, which was halted last year when it was discovered combination hormone replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and breast cancer. At the time that these findings were published, data on dementia risk had not yet been calculated. Clinical Testing Toxicity Report Using 1,000 before and after salivary tests, 97% of all women using natural hormone replacement have toxic levels in their saliva test results. (Data taken from Dr. Dale's Wellness Clinic) Progesterone Toxicity Symptoms Include: Estradiol Toxicity Symptoms Include: Why risk using ANY hormones? More shocking statistics: 90% of women using \"natural\" and/or compounded progesterone or estrogens for more than 3 months from wild yam (soy) have elevated toxic levels, abnormal hormone ratios and cortisol levels and/or hormonal toxicity (overly increased hormone levels that burden the liver and immune system) 95% of women using HRT synthetic progesterone and estrogen have abnormal hormone ratios, estrogen dominance, abnormal cortisol levels and toxicity. 100% of women on synthetic hormones risk cancer. Toxic levels of synthetic hormones may take longer to indicate on serum (blood tests) as well as saliva. 1000 before and after saliva tests on women using the homeopathic hormone rejuvenation system show NO TOXICITY. Clinical testing reveals astounding results, including women with a complete hysterectomy. How doe it work on women who have had a hysterectomy? Once the ovaries are out the body is capable of converting hormone production to the adrenals. On a group of 1,000 women with hysterectomies who were tested before and after using a saliva test, 100% of women showed that their adrenal glands are making the needed hormones for their body and 95% of their symptoms have abated. What exactly is Homeopathy and how is it used to create a hormone system? Homeopathy is a therapy developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in Germany over 200 years ago and is the second largest used medical type on earth (next to \"Western Medicine). It is a form of energy medicine Each remedy is very diluted and contains little, if any. of the original substance it was made from. The dilution of the remedy is called the potency and is shown by the number at the side of the remedy. For example, 6x means the remedy was diluted 1 in 10(x) and this was repeated 6 times. 30C means the remedy was diluted 1 in 100(C) and this was repeated 30 times. In classical homeopathy only one remedy is given at a time. In complex homeopathy several remedies are used together to produce a synergistic broad spectrum effect, in the case of hormone rejuvenation we are using a combination of several remedies that have been imprinted into transdermal creams and sublingual drops. Homeopathic remedies are derived from many of the original materials including botanicals, animal organs and glands, minerals, bacteria, chemicals, viruses, radiation, disease, poisons and hormones. Very little, if any, of the original substance remains in a homeopathic remedy because it has been diluted so many times until only the imprint or \"frequency\" of the original substance remains. This frequency is used in the body as a remedy. Sarcodes are one type of homeopathic remedy. They are made from healthy tissue and organs. They bring the specific organ back to correct function. The Homeopathic Hormone Rejuvenation System contains sarcodes and classical remedies. Only the energy of the material remains because of the level of dilution. Caffeine, synthetic fragrance, X-Rays and radiation must be 100% avoided while taking homeopathy. Conventional vs Advanced Homeopathic Approach to Healing Conventional: Homeopathic: Homeopathy & Hormone Rejuvenation Homeopathic Remedies can improve progesterone uptake and metabolism. They also do not interfere with the normal shift from progesterone dominance to estrogen dominance during the month. Another fascinating factor in healing hormonal conditions with homeopathy is that homeopathics do not have any side effects because they contain only minute amounts of substances. Even though there are only trace amounts of therapeutic ingredients in homeopathics, clinical experience with these medicines shows that the infinitesimal doses they offer work on unconscious people, infants and animals and is therefore not a placebo effect. Homeopathy can be utilized effectively for hormone rejuvenation by stimulating production of natural hormones in the human body. The homeopathic substances that are used to treat endocrine and hormonal symptoms may be made from botanical and mineral substances in addition to healthy tissue or secretions of the body, such as hormones. Examples of homeopathic ingredients include chelidonium, which can address liver congestion; Sepia got hot flashes and sulphur for delayed menses and hot flashes. Whether applied topically or taken orally, homeopathic remedies can stimulate a healing response in the targeted organ, thus stimulating the normal functionality of that organ. Homeopathy is non-addictive and it does not replace any innate function of the body. It is truly healing the body, mind and spirit. As the client begins to feel better, the dosage can be lowered. Homeopathic sarcodes actually stimulate a healing response in the targeted organ. Thus stimulating the normal functions of that organ. When healing hormone function using sarcodes, either orally or transdermally, the remedy will stimulate the organ to produce the correct amount of hormones to achieve balance. Homeopathic sarcodes are made from healthy tissue or secretions and each remedy contains a blueprint of a healthy gland, hormone or organ. A sarcode acts as a subtle amplifier of the natural function of an organ by giving off an electromagnetic (EM) signal that attaches itself to a similar signal or imprint. Within seconds of administration, the hypothalamus translates a picture of how the specific healthy organ or gland normally functions directly to that organ in your body and re-educates it. "}
