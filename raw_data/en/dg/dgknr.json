Using the testing procedure laid out by the microbiology field we are able to identify unknown bacteria present in our everyday lives, and along the way learn a lot about their characteristics that separate them from other types of bacteria. Being able to do this is vital in order for us to understand why microbes are present in certain places, how they are able to grow and what restricts their growth, that way they can be combatted if necessary. These techniques for determining unknowns are also important for isolating and testing infectious disease microbes in order to prevent spreading. Another important aspect of being able to identify unknown microbes is the Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually caused by bacteria and are common. Symptoms of both upper and lower infections are similar; therefore, it is important for advanced practice nurses (APNs) to be able to determine the pathophysiology of upper and lower UTIs. The purpose of this discussion is to evaluate the similarities and differences between upper and lower UTIs, clinical manifestations, treatments, and factors affecting all of these things. According to Ron Dagan, acute otitis media (middle ear infection) are most common in kids 3 months old to 3 years old. (Dagan p. 1). In Clinical Bacteriology of Recurrent Otitis Media with Effusion, it states, \"antibiotic resistance has increased due to indiscriminate overuse and misuse of antibiotics.\" The overuse of an antibiotic and/or using the wrong antibiotic to treat the sickness has made bacteria more resistant to the antibiotics. Later on in the passage, Dagan adds, \"we collected nine hundred middle ear fluid samples for six hundred fifty four pediatric patients who underwent ventilation tube insertion due to OME...\" \"Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that the two groups differed in sensitivity to penicillin and erythromycin, but no other antibiotics.\" (Article abstract).Out of the nine hundred samples they took, the group showed the bacteria was defeated by the antibiotic penicillin and the antibiotic erythromycin but the other antibiotics didn't touch the bacteria. The experiment showed people only two antibiotics were fighting off the bacteria. The two of which are being over used and over time will no longer work. If the bacteria continues to grow bigger and better, the antibiotics for ear infections aren't going to work which leads to hearing loss, even to the extent of going Yeast infections most often occur in the moist areas of the body particularly on the mouth and genital area in both men and women. These are caused by many factors including poor diet, hygiene and stress management while the symptoms include red, painful and itchy sores, lesions and rashes. Anyone can easily get meningitis from anywhere, and it is a serious illness that can affect both young people and adults. According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord\" (1). College campuses and dormitories are perfect environments for meningitis to spread. A lot of students are affected and diagnosed with meningitis each year. Most of the students are not aware of the early meningitis symptoms, or they just ignore them. Also, they often fail to get vaccinated. The stress of studying and exams weaken the immune system which will make the student more likely to develop meningitis. Meningitis is one of the most serious and spreadable diseases on college campuses and dormitories because of the number of students that are affected each year, Eliminating excess fluids and waste is a natural process we often take for granted. For most people, urinating or peeing occurs easily and regularly. However, in some cases, you might find yourself having difficulty in the bathroom, especially when you need to collect a sample of urine for a test. Here is some information on how to make yourself pee. Department of Health and Human Services established an objective for Healthy People 2020 to prevent HCAIs, this reflects that the U.S. health care system is committed to and serious about solving this issue. These objectives address two extremely important topics, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Also, there are other major causes of HCAIs that Health and Human Services is working on their prevention such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with catheters, infections of surgical wounds and sites, C. difficile infections, and ventilator-associated Pneumonia. Disease, one of the major killers of the 18th and 19th Century. Hundreds of thousands across the world have died from numerous infectious disease that spread as fast as wildfire. One of the most notorious examples of a plague that spread and wiped out a third of europe was the Bubonic Plague or its common name, the Black Death. How do we keep diseases such as the Bubonic Plague from wiping out the developing new world known as America? What disease could cause cause such panic and uproar that hundreds of citizens to flee from their city to avoid it? According to Mayo Clinic, an overactive bladder is just that: a bladder-storage problem resulting in sudden and frequent urges to urinate. Often these \"urges\" may be so strong that they cannot be stopped leading to incontinence.The amount of urine released may be a small trickle, or it may be a complete emptying of the bladder. The National Library of Medicine notes that the number of seniors with an overactive bladder continues to grow. It is well over 10 percent today and may reasonably be expected to reach a full quarter of seniors in the next two decades. The result of urinary incontinence in seniors is often social isolation, anxiety, fear, and depression linked to the embarrassment of having Antibiotics are a form of medicine that seek out and destroy the bacteria that make us feel sick. Antibiotics work great against bacteria, however they don't work against viruses. Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered by Alexander Fleming, and it was first used to treat infections. Essentially, these powerful medicines fight bacterial infections, and have the potential to save lives. They work by either killing the bacteria or retain them from reproducing, with the help of our body's natural defense system. Irritable bowl syndrome can make daily activities unbearable. Patients usually experience chronic diarrhea or chronic constipation. Fortunately, sticking to an IBS diet plan can relief the symptoms of IBS. Doctors can prescribe medications to treat IBS, but starting a new nutrition plan has been proven to relive symptoms for many people dealing with IBS. distorted picture of how to treat the opposite sex and safer sex practices are deficient. To change sexual behaviors, parents must communicate clearly to their children from a young age about respecting their bodies and when the times comes parents must also listen attentively making sure no outside pressures are persuading them otherwise. Young adults are more impressionable and therefore vulnerable to experiment sexually and many do not feel comfortable talking to their parents so they turn to peers or a search engine for sexual knowledge, which can be misleading. Incontinence can be an embarrassing problem that becomes more frequent with age. Research suggests that up to half of women over 60 deal with issues of incontinence, and nearly half of women who have gone through menopause will face issues related to frequent urination. Many of these problems can be associated with hormone changes, and life events such as childbirth may also increase the likelihood of incontinence. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel In all areas of healthcare, particularly in acute care settings, patients may be unable to care for their nutritional and/or hygienic needs properly. One area that is especially important to address is the perineal care of patients who are incapacitated, or otherwise unable to care for their hygienic needs independently. Normal bacterial flora can develop into an opportunistic infection if the bacteria reaches certain areas of the body. For example, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) is due to Escherichia coli from the colon coming into contact with the urethra (Copstead & Banasik, 2013). If the patient is immunocompromised, elderly, sedentary, or otherwise compromised in their abilities to void, this can predispose the patient "}
