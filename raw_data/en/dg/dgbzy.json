When we feel like this, it's tempting to find ways to boost our energy levels, normally in the forms of fizzy drinks or endless amounts of coffee. However, if we overindulge in these the body can release higher levels of cortisol ( the stress hormone). But too much cortisol can influence and disrupt our sleep patterns, energy levels, cause anxiety and decrease our immune response. Luckily, help is at hand with some of nature's finest herbs and spices - providing lasting energy when it is needed most. Matcha Matcha is made from a special type of powdered green tea that is grown under shade for a few weeks before being harvested. The bright, vivid green of [matcha](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/us/en/wellbeing-articles/unstoppable-rise-of-matcha) is a result of high levels of the light capturing pigment, chlorophyll. This pigment converts sunlight into energy for the plant, and this is transferred to us when we consume it. It's just a bonus that it also tastes delicious. Matcha is a great alternative to coffee, as caffeine is not the primary compound found in matcha and green tea; it is balanced out by other pigments and compounds that help prevent the characteristic 'crash' so often attributed to coffee. Thus, providing us with a sustainable and healthy energy boost. Our Majestic Matcha Chai latte is blended with energizing matcha and aromatic chai spices, promoting memory and focus to power you through the day. Ginseng In traditional herbal medicine, ginseng is well-known for its uplifting properties and as an [adaptogenic herb](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/us/en/wellbeing-articles/what-are-adaptogen-herbs) that nourishes the adrenal glands and central nervous system. A lack of energy is often linked to stress. By modifying the release of stress hormones (such as cortisol), adaptogens such as ginseng, ensure that we are expending and conserving energy in a manageable way that won't leave us feeling frazzled, but instead helps to restore health, happiness and vitality. When ginseng is combined with green tea, which contains a high concentration of the amino acid L-theanine, promoting alpha waves in the brain, it can help to naturally boost energy, enhance brain power, memory and concentration, without giving you the jitters or crash that you might get from coffee. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that nourishes the adrenal glands and central nervous system. Adaptogens help us to adapt to emotional and physical stressors by moderating the release of stress hormones within the body. Ashwagandha can help to calm a racing mind, encourage a healthy sleep pattern and relieve stress or anxiety to in turn restore energy and vitality when you need it most.
