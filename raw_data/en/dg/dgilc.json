As preventive healthcare gained greater significance in the post Covid-19 world, people's attention has steered towards improving immunity and living a life free of toxins as far as possible. Detox or detoxification has become a prominent buzzword in the lifestyle space, and its importance in keeping the body healthy, energized and rejuvenated cannot be understated. Given the rising levels of air, water and land pollution, it has become easier for people to get exposed to toxins from various sources. While the human body has its own mechanism to avoid toxin buildup in the body, you can use some natural ways to detox and stay healthy. Toxins in the body can play havoc with the body's overall immune system, impacting not just digestion, but skin, hair and mental health too. So, it's essential to know how to flush out toxins naturally. Getting rid of toxins is very essential year-round, asserts nutritionist Rashi Chahal. \"When you end up with too many toxins in your body, it can interfere in the normal functioning of your body. It will impede the normal digestion of different foods and absorption of nutrients that play a vital role in balancing hormones. A disturbance in this balance may make you feel irritable, exhausted and bloated, which could further lead to mood swings,\" Chahal tells HealthShots. As industrialisation increases, the environment has become such that humans are exposed to pollutants, pesticides, heavy metals and other industrial waste, more than ever before. Whether it is the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat, these are unavoidable sources of toxins around us. A gradual buildup of toxins in tissues and cells of the body can; cause you poor metabolism and gut health, rise in weight-related issues, increase risk of recurring diseases, boost joint or muscle pain, affect skin and hair, raise stress levels, and more. Some of the benefits of detox, can therefore, include: 1. Promoting weight loss 2. Boosting immunity 3. Working on hormonal balance 4. Benefiting skin Over the years, specific diets, drinks, products and routines have become popular with the emergence of social media promotion of the benefits of detoxification. In Ayurveda, body toxins or undigested food is termed 'Ama', the root cause of diseases. The traditional Indian medicine system underlines the importance of getting rid of toxins with the use of natural herbs, foods and drinks. Health experts claim it is a reboot for the human body, supporting organs such as the liver, kidney and lungs in eliminating toxins through urine, feces, sweat and the respiratory process. The idea is to eat healthy, keep the body clean, consume adequate liquids and be physically active in order to achieve holistic wellness. \"One needs to assist the body with green leafy vegetables, fruits and fluids to help release the toxins,\" adds Rashi Chahal.
