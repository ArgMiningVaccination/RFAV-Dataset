Are you unsure what activities are safe following vaccination? Whether you're vaccinated or not, [AL.com](http://al.com/) will be reaching out to public health experts to get your concerns addressed about the COVID-19 vaccine. Just send an email to [vaccines@al.com](mailto:vaccines@al.com) and we'll get an expert to directly answer your question. [Here are the questions we have been able to answer for readers.](https://www.al.com/topic/COVIDAnswers/) Vaccinations to protect from COVID-19 have grown in importance with the rise of the delta variant and [surging infection numbers](https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/2726-new-covid-cases-in-alabama-1087-from-3-counties.html) and hospitalizations across Alabama. [We are taking your questions about the vaccines and getting answers from healthcare experts](https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/ask-alcom-your-covid-vaccine-questions-and-well-get-you-answers.html). To get some answers, we consulted Paul Goepfert, director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic at UAB. It should be noted that specific questions about your own health should be addressed with your primary care provider. Question: \"What are the long-term possible side effects of each vaccine? What studies have been done which show the impact on the person 2-years or 5-years after receiving the shot? How is it possible to declare the shot safe when these answers remain unknown?\" Answer: \"In short, there are no vaccines that cause long term effects that did not show up within the first month after the final dose. This will almost assuredly include COVID vaccines as well,\" Goepfert said. Two of the varieties of COVID vaccine are given twice, and the mRNA in the vaccine is degraded very quickly. This is the same for other vaccines, so there is no reason to have long term effects when the vaccine is no longer present in the body. This is different from medications that need to be taken every day, such as blood pressure medicines where a side effect can occur later on. In fact, Geopfert said, this is particularly true of the mRNA vaccines. mRNA degrades rapidly. So there should not be long-term side effects from any of the vaccines. In fact, long-term side effects have never occurred with any vaccine, he said. [In an interview on UAB's website,](https://www.uab.edu/news/health/item/12143-three-things-to-know-about-the-long-term-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines) Geopfert went on to talk about the small number of documented side effects during the more than 2 billion COVID-19 vaccinations over the last year, including myocarditis, Guillan-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and a clotting disorder known as thrombotic thrombocytopenia, in comparison to how many shots have been given worldwide. Geopfert said many people worry that the vaccines were rushed into use and still do not have full FDA approval. The vaccines currently have emergency use authorizations. However, he said, because of the number of people vaccinated, we have more safety data about the COVID-19 vaccines than exists for any other vaccine. Question: How long normally do side effects exist after the first vaccine? Received first Pfizer vaccine over a week ago and still having side effects. I am now concerned it may be something else going on. Answer: \"Vaccine side effects should improve after two days. Symptoms persisting after a week would be highly unusual and may be due to something else,\" Goepfert said.
