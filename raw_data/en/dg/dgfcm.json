DHHS is coordinating these activities.4 Copyright \u00a92 0 0 9 i3 | CONFIDENTIAL Regulatory Considerations \u0083EMEA guidance requests a pharmacovigilance plan that specifically includes -Monitoring

Conclusions/Next Steps \u0083We have not yet evaluated the correlat ion between the information in RCS and our research database for H1N1 vaccination and outcome tracking -Planned, but our research database has not yet 'caught up' with the initial wave of vaccinations from the 2009/10 influenza season \u0083Previous experience -We except a significant number of subjec ts may not be able to be linked between RCS and our research database based on lack of a co mmon unique identifier between the 2 sources In another study using both RCS and the rese arch database, we li nked 112,145/141,552 (79%) infants using SSN alone. W hen we added an addition al identifier of family id to identify infants using a parent SSN, this brou ght the number down to around 75%. In this same study, we identified 38 outcomes of interests (IS) in th e RCS data; we linked 28 of these to our research database -For subjects that are able to be linked, we anticipate a strong correlation between outcomes from RCS with outcome s in our research database In the above study, 100% of infants with the outcome of in terest in the RCS data had the same outcome of interest in the research database Little to no change in out comes based on the claims cle aning process has been our observation to-date \u0083Results from the H1N1 vaccine surveillance project will be very important in further evaluating the correlation between information in RCS and our research database21 Copyright \u00a92 0 0 9 i3 | CONFIDENTIAL Preliminary Conclusions/Next Steps \u0083Additionally, we have not yet evaluated the PPV of outcomes in RCS based on a review of medical records for important outcomes (e.g. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome) for H1N1 vaccination and outcome tracking -Planned as part of our research protocol \u0083Previous experience -We except this will vary By outcome By algorithm/codes used to identify the outcome22 Copyright \u00a92 0 0 9 i3 | CONFIDENTIAL Preliminary Conclusions/Next Steps \u0083Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome: our experience from another project -30/105 of possible GBS cases iden tified by claims diagnosis code alone (ICD-9 357.0) were chart- confirmed, with a PPV of 29% -If we used hospitalization plus the GBS diagnosis code, the PPV increased to 41% -If we used neurologist visit (any ) plus a GBS diagnosis code, the PPV increased to 65%23 Copyright \u00a92 0 0 9 i3 | CONFIDENTIAL i3's RCS for Vaccine 85,469*1 + + 61,761*3 = 426,264 inf ant months = 35,522 infant years Expect 1 case per 2000 infant years (17-18 cases) i3 Drug Safety experience that ~50% of claims-based cases were confirmed in medical recordsFreq of Rotateq doses for kids <=1 yr The FREQ Procedure r ot_doses_u1 Frequency Percent Cumulative Cumulative Fre que nc y users with a dx of any intussusception (within 30 days), age <=1year The FREQ Procedure ro ta te q Frequenc y Percent Cumulative Cumulative Fre que nc y Percent 1 34 100 34 10024 Copyright \u00a92 0 0 9 i3 | CONFIDENTIAL Q & A "}
