Three main ingredients Japan's health ministry has released a list of medicines for relieving the side-effects of coronavirus vaccines, such as fever or pain. The main three are: - acetaminophen - ibuprofen - loxoprofen In June, the government received reports from drug store operators about a scarcity of medicines containing acetaminophen. The health ministry then provided a list on its website of commercial drugs with alternative ingredients in a bid to prevent a shortage. Customers confused A drug store in Chiba Prefecture says its supplies of medicines containing acetaminophen became scarce due to high demand. Since receiving a notification from the health ministry, staff now tell customers that Ibuprofen and loxoprofen are also available. One pharmacist says media coverage has led some people to believe acetaminophen is the only option.
