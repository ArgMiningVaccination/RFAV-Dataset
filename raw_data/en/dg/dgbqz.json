Counselors come to this important work by various paths and with vastly different skills and experience. The diversity of backgrounds and types of preparation can be a strength, provided there is a common foundation from which counselors work. This publication addresses the following questions: What professional standards should guide substance abuse treatment counselors? What is an appropriate scope of practice for the field? Which competencies are associated with positive outcomes? What knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) should all substance abuse treatment professionals have in common? Workforce development is essential to the field of substance use disorder treatment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has included workforce development in its Matrix of Priority Programs. A major focus of this workforce development strategy is improving the competencies of professionals in the field. This updated edition of Technical Assistance Publication (TAP) 21: Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice (The Competencies) is a key component of that strategy. In 1998, in cooperation with its Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network, SAMHSA published TAP 21, a comprehensive list of 123 competencies that substance abuse treatment counselors should master to do their work effectively. TAP 21 has been used to develop and evaluate addiction counseling curricula, advise students, and assess counseling proficiencies. The overarching competencies in this updated version of TAP 21 remain largely unchanged from the original TAP 21. The KSAs have been changed from those in the 1998 edition when necessary, in light of new thinking in the field. The competencies and the KSAs in practice di-mensions that address clinical evaluation and treatment planning have been revised to reflect changes in the field. The competencies are defined by sublists of the KSAs needed to master each competency. Bibliographies have been supplemented with new publications through 2005. The format has been improved to make the information more accessible and useful. SAMHSA's TAP series provides a flexible format for the timely transfer of important technical information to the substance abuse treatment field. This updated version of TAP 21 exemplifies the flexibility of the TAP format. We are grateful to the members of the ATTC Network and staff and to all those who participated in the validation and updating of these competency lists. K ana Enomoto, M.A. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Kimberly A . Johnson, Ph.D. Director Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services AdministrationThis page intentionally left blank1introduction In 1998, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) published Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice (The Competencies) as Technical Assistance Publication (TAP) 21. Developed by the National Curriculum Committee of the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network, TAP 21 identifies 123 competencies that are essential to the effective practice of counseling for psychoactive substance use disorders. TAP 21 also presents the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) counselors need to become fully proficient in each competency. TAP 21 has been widely distributed by SAMHSA's Public Engagement Platform (PEP) and the ATTC Network. It has become a benchmark by which curricula are developed and educational programs and professional standards are measured for the field of substance abuse treatment in the United States. In addition, it has been translated into several languages. Because the ATTC Network is committed to technology transfer, after the initial publication of TAP 21, the National Curriculum Committee began exploring ways to enhance the docu-ment for future printings. Successful technology transfer requires more than presenting good information. It entails transmitting scientific knowledge in a way that makes it understandable, feasible to implement in a real-world setting, and supportable at a systematic level\u2014in other words, getting the right information across in a way that makes it useable. The National Curriculum Committee examined how best to package and present TAP 21 to help people learn key elements and adopt new strategies. The result was a revision of TAP 21\u2014a process that was begun in 2000, was completed in 2005, and resulted in the current publication. History of The CompeTenCies In 1993 CSAT created a multidisciplinary network of 11 ATTC Regional Centers geographically dispersed across the United States and in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since its inception, the ATTC Network has collaborated with diverse international, national, State, regional, and local partners from multiple disciplines to recruit qualified addiction treatment practitioners and enhance academic preparation and professional development opportunities in the substance abuse treatment field. The National Curriculum Committee, composed of ATTC Directors, was established at the Network's inaugural meeting. The committee's initial charge was to collect and evaluate existing addiction educational and professional development curricula and establish future priorities for ATTC curriculum development. This effort led to researching existing practice and professional literature and defining an extensive list of addiction practice competencies determined to be essential to effective counseling for substance use disorders. These initial competencies would serve as benchmarks to guide future ATTC curriculum design, develop-ment, and evaluation.2Addiction Counseling Competencies In addition to its own work, the National Curriculum Committee reviewed and incorporated other publications on the work of addiction counselors.1 In 1995 the committee's work resulted in the ATTC publication Addiction Counselor Competencies . Subsequent to this publication, the ATTCs conducted a national survey to validate the competencies (see appendix C). Results supported virtually all of the competencies as being essential to the professional practice of addiction counseling. In 1996, the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (ICRC) convened a national leadership group to evaluate the need for model addiction counselor training. After careful deliberation, the group concluded that much of the work to define such a curriculum standard had already been accomplished by the ATTC National Curriculum Committee and the ICRC in the National Curriculum Committee's Addiction Counselor Competencies and the ICRC's 1996 Role Delineation Study , 2 respectively. Soon after, CSAT agreed to fund a collaborative effort to finalize a document that could be used as a national standard. CSA T convened a panel\u2014The National Steering Committee for Addiction Counseling Standards (NSC)\u2014that comprised representatives from five national educational, certification, and professional associations. The NSC was successful in achieving unanimous endorsement of the Addiction Counselor Competencies \u2014a milestone in the addiction counseling field. Based on this foundation, the National Curriculum Committee began to delineate the KSAs that undergird each competency statement. Input was solicited from a number of key national organizations and selected field reviewers. In 1998 CSAT published the results of this ground-breaking work as TAP 21 (The Competencies ). After TAP 21 was published, the National Curriculum Committee systematically conducted focus groups and a national survey to elicit feedback from the field about the impact of TAP 21. Although feedback was uniformly positive and thousands of copies of TAP 21 were disseminated through SAMHSA's PEP and the ATTC Network, refinements were needed to improve the utility of the publication and enhance its effect in both the addiction practice and educational systems. Feedback obtained from the survey and the focus groups indicated a need for additional informa- tion to help the field incorporate the competencies into daily practice. Feedback also suggested that there was no need to change the competencies. The most common suggestions were to refine the 1998 publication by presenting the content in a more user-friendly fashion and linking it to professional literature and specific applications. The National Curriculum Committee revised TAP 21 in 2000 based on the feedback of dedicated addiction practice and education professionals; however, this revision was never published. A new Update Committee was convened in 2005 to update the revised 2000 edition with literature published between 2000 and 2005. The Update Committee consisted of some of the original mem - bers from the National Curriculum Committee; representatives from NAADAC\u2014The Association for Addiction Professionals, CSAT, the Center for Mental Health Services, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, the National Association for Children of Alcoholics, and the Annapolis Coalition; treatment providers; and experts in addiction research. The current updated edition retains all of the feedback-based improvements of the 2000 revised version and adds relevant literature 1 Birch and Davis Corporation (1986).

In addition, the competencies and KSAs of several practice dimensions, in particular those that address clinical evaluation and treatment planning, were rewritten to reflect current best practices. wHAt you will find inside The Model When creating The Competencies , the National Curriculum Committee recognized a need to emphasize three characteristics of competency: knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Many hours were spent conceptualizing a differentiated model when designing TAP 21\u2014a model that could address general KSAs necessary for all practitioners dealing with substance use disorders while explaining the more specific needs of professional substance abuse treatment counselors. The first section of the model addresses the generic KSAs. This section contains the trans- disciplinary foundations, comprising four discrete building blocks: understanding addiction, treatment knowledge, application to practice, and professional readiness. The term \"trans- disciplinary\" was selected to describe the knowledge and skills needed by all disciplines (e.g., medicine, social work, pastoral guidance, corrections, social welfare) that deal directly with individuals with substance use disorders. The second section of the model specifically addresses the professional practice needs, or practice dimensions, of addiction counselors. Each practice dimension includes a set of com - petencies, and, within each competency, the KSAs necessary for effective addiction counseling are outlined. Many additional competencies may be desirable for counselors in specific settings. Education and experience affect the depth of the individual counselor's knowledge and skills; not all counselors will be experienced and proficient in all the compe - tencies discussed. The National Curriculum Committee's goal for the future is to help ensure that every addiction counselor possesses, to an appropriate degree, each competency listed, regardless of setting or treat - ment model.Figure 1. C omponents in the CompetenCies modelIntroduction The relationship of the compo - nents in the competencies model is conceptualized as a hub with eight spokes (see figure 1). The hub contains the four transdisciplinary foun - dations that are central to the work of all addiction profes-sionals. The eight spokes are the practice dimensions, each containing the competencies the addiction counselor should attain to master each practice dimension.4Addiction Counseling Competencies Recommended Readings Journal articles, book chapters, and other critical literature for each transdisciplinary foundation and practice dimension have been reviewed and included in this document. Moreover, separate bibliographies on attitudes and recovery have been added, as have lists of Internet and cultural competency resources. These can be found in section 3. Appendices Appendices include a glossary (appendix A), a complete list of the competencies (appendix B), a summary of the results of the Committee's National Validation Study of The Competencies (appendix C), a complete bibliography with a detailed overview of the methodology used for literature searches (appendix D), and a list of people who acted as field reviewers or provided research assistance (appendix E). Companion Volume\u2014TAP 21-A As a companion to this volume on counselor competencies, CSAT is publishing TAP 21-A, Competencies for Substance Abuse Treatment Clinical Supervisors, which discusses the qualities and abilities integral to supervising substance abuse treatment clinicians. uses of The CompeTenCies Since its inception, The Competencies has been improving addiction counseling and addiction counselor education across the country in a number of ways. The most common reported applications have been in curriculum/course evaluation and design for higher education; personal professional development; student advising, supervision, and assessment; assessment of competent practices; design of professional development and continuing education pro-grams; and certification standards/exams.

Specific proficiencies, skills, levels of involve-ment with clients, and scope of practice vary widely among specializa-tions. At their base, however, all addiction-focused disciplines are built on four common foundations. This section focuses on four sets of competencies that are transdisci- plinary in that they underlie the work not just of counselors but of all addiction professionals. The four areas of knowledge identified here serve as prerequisites to the development of competency in any of the addiction-focused disciplines. tHe four trAnsdisciPlinAry foundAtions I. Understanding Addiction II. Treatment Knowledge III. Application to Practice IV . Professional Readiness Regardless of professional identity or discipline, each treatment provider must have a basic understanding of addiction that includes knowledge of current models and theories, appreciation of the multiple contexts within which substance use occurs, and awareness of the effects of psychoactive drug use. Each professional must be knowledgeable about the continuum of care and the social contexts affecting the treatment and recovery process. Each addiction specialist must be able to identify a variety of helping strategies that can be tailored to meet the needs of individual clients. Each professional must be prepared to adapt to an ever-changing set of challenges and constraints. Although specific skills and applications vary across disciplines, the attitu- dinal components tend to remain constant. The development of effective practice in addiction counseling depends on the presence of attitudes reflecting openness to alternative approaches, appreciation of diversity, and willingness to change. The following knowledge and attitudes are prerequisite to the develop- ment of competency in the professional treatment of substance use disorders. Such knowledge and attitudes form the basis of understand-ing on which discipline-specific proficiencies are built.This page intentionally left blank7transdisCiplinary Foundation i UNDERSTANDING ADDICTIONThis page intentionally left blank9uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu tf i. understAnding Addiction comPetency 1: Understand a variety of models and theories of addiction and other problems related to substance use.

The Competencies has been an outstanding and essential tool used in the development and delivery of more than 220 online presentations during the past 8 years. Instructors use The Competencies in all ATTC-NE trainings. In addition, the ATTC- NE training staff has designed a Web-based course (Core Functions of Addiction Counseling) that focuses entirely on The Competencies. This training has been delivered at least 10 times to partici- pants from all sectors of the treatment field including counselors, physicians, correctional person-nel, judiciary staff, those in the educational field, and government personnel. The Competencies continues to be a guiding force in course development, and the Web-based training is provided to participants from New England and other regions. The Competencies was used in the development of a B.S. program in chemical dependency and addiction studies at Rhode Island College. It has been used in designing curriculum and developing course content.73PD III.

Developed by a noted educational psychologist, the publication identifies a series of benchmarks that indicate a counselor's progress toward mastery of each competency for the developing, proficient, and exemplary clinician. Work is underway to add competencies for the entry-level counselor. Another NFATTC publication based on The Competencies is called Proficiency Levels for Graduates of Academic Degree Programs. The document establishes proficiency targets for each knowledge, skill, and attitude included in The Competencies at the associate's, bachelor's, and master's levels. In addition, NFATTC developed a 21-hour Clinical Supervision I course and a 14-hour Clinical Supervision II course based on The Competencies. The courses orient supervisors to The Competencies, introduce methods for assessing proficiency, and teach specific strategies for enhancing counselor knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Recent projects in treatment agencies in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington have looked at infusing The Competencies into the agencies' clinical supervision practices. The Competencies is used by each agency to develop specific learn- ing plans for counselors. Idaho endorsed the NFATTC Clinical Supervision model and requires each treatment agency in the State system to use that model.75PD III. Referral bibliogrAPHy PD III.

Evaluators surveyed substance abuse treatment professionals (both front line and management) in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Of 469 respondents, 63 percent were familiar with The Competencies. When asked how they used The Competencies, respondents indicated they used it for the following: 49 percent to improve their job performance 46 percent to guide their professional development 35 percent to improve treatment outcomes 32 percent for self-assessment 27 percent to assess job performance 22 percent to guide supervisory decisions. A 2002 update of this survey in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington showed that, of 609 respondents, the majority of agency directors (79%) and treatment staff (61%) were familiar with The Competencies and, of those who reported familiarity, 80 percent actively used it in their work, showing a pattern of increasing use over time. A 2005 survey update, currently underway, will provide data on the most current uses of The Competencies. NFATTC has convened a regional workgroup, with participants from Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, to develop teaching strategies specific to The Competencies. An educators' \"toolkit\" of student exercises to use with The Competencies will be available on an educator's Web page and in printed form and will be presented at educators' workshops.156Addiction Counseling Competencies comPetency 119: Use a range of supervisory options to process personal feelings and concerns about clients.

Negative counselor attitudes need to be considered within the framework of stigma and its consequences for the counselor, the client, and the field. Attitudes of treatment professionals toward the multiple systems of bureaucracy with which they interact\u2014agency priorities, clinic hierarchies, the criminal justice system, departments of social services, community organizations\u2014may also affect their ability to deliver effective treatment.

There is often significant emphasis on treatment issues, such as treatment approach, therapeutic alliance, client retention, family involvement, cultural competency, and pharmacological intervention. The importance of the ongoing recovery process is sometimes not given sufficient attention. It is crucial to identify and address clients' needs for case management, continuing care, housing, employment, transportation, education, life skills, social support\u2014all the things that help clients reintegrate into the community, build a meaningful life, and sustain their recovery.

Active listening - a counseling skill that enhances rapport and demonstrates interest and understanding through the use of verbal and nonverbal acknowledgment of client statements. Addiction - a chronic, relapsing disease of the brain with social and behavioral manifestations marked by continued alcohol or drug use despite negative consequences.Addiction counseling - professional and ethical application of specific competencies that constitute eight practice dimensions, including clinical evaluation; treatment planning; referral; service coordination; individual, group, and family counseling; client, family, and community education; and documentation. Advocacy - (1) a social or political movement working for changes in legislation, policy, and funding to reflect clients' concerns and protect their rights (i.e., advocacy for clients); (2) a philosophy of substance abuse treatment practice maintaining that clients should be involved actively in their own treatment and have rights in its planning and implementation (i.e., advocacy by clients). Much of advocacy is about shifting the system from the directive model to one in which the client is an empowered, involved participant in treatment decisions. Biomedical - pertaining to the biological and physiological aspects of clinical medicine. Biopsychosocial - the biological, psychosocial, and social influences in human development and behavior. Case management - see \"Service coordination.\" Client - individual, significant other, or community agent who presents for alcohol and drug abuse education, prevention, intervention, treatment, and consultation services.Collateral sources - persons or organizations providing pertinent information about a client (can include family members and legal, educational, and medical personnel).Competency - specific counselor functions comprising requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes.Confidentiality - a client's right to privacy as defined by applicable Federal and State statutes. Confidentiality rules and regulations - rules established by Federal and State agencies to limit disclosure of information about a client's substance use disorder and treatment (described in 42 CFR, Part 2B 16). Programs must notify clients of their rights to confidentiality, provide a written summary of these rights, and establish written procedures regulating access to and use of client records. Confrontation - a form of interpersonal exchange in which individuals present to one another their observations of, and reactions to, behaviors and attitudes that are matters of concern. Feedback is provided on behavior, and an appeal is made to the client for personal honesty, truthfulness in dealing with others, and responsible behavior. Content - the subjects discussed in the context of counseling.172Addiction Counseling Competencies Continuing care - care that supports a client's progress, monitors his or her condition, and responds to a return to substance use or a return of mental disorder symptoms. It is both a process of posttreatment monitoring and a form of treatment itself; sometimes referred to as aftercare. Continuum of care - the array of services that differ in terms of unique needs of clients throughout the course of treatment and recovery.Contracting - the process by which the client and the counselor enter into an agreement to address specific problems, issues, or behaviors.

DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 commonly are used to classify substance use and mental disorders. Disorder - an affliction that affects the functions of the mind and/or body, disturbing physical and/or mental health. Duty to warn - the legal obligation of a counselor (healthcare provider) to notify the appropriate authorities as defined by statute and/or the potential victim when there is serious danger of a client's inflicting injury on an identified individual. Efficacy - the power to produce a desired effect.Elements - specific, definable areas found in three of the practice dimensions (clinical evaluation, service coordination, and counseling). Empirical - relying on observation or experience rather than theoretical principles or theory. Engagement - a client's commitment to and maintenance of treatment in all of its forms. A successful engagement program helps clients view the treatment facility as an important resource.173Appendix A - Glossary Epidemiology - the study of the incidence, distribution, and consequences of a particular problem in one or more populations. Etiology - the study of origins (what causes a disorder).Extrinsic motivator - a rationale for changing substance use that comes from outside the client.

Outcome statement - an agreement between the client and the counselor that identifies the desired results of treatment. Outreach strategies - approaches that actively seek out persons in a community who have substance use disorders and engage them in substance abuse treatment. Patient - see \"Client.\" Peer counselor - individuals in recovery from substance use disorders who have been trained to work in substance abuse treatment settings. Practice dimensions - the eight essential areas of practice that addiction counselors must master to effectively provide treatment activities identified in The Competencies . Prevalence - the percentage of people in the population that has a specific disorder. Prevention - the theory and means for reducing the harmful effects of drug use in specific populations. Prevention objectives are to protect individuals before they manifest signs or symptoms of substance use problems, identify persons in the early stages of substance abuse and intervene, and end compulsive use of psychoactive substances through treatment. Problem statement - a statement that describes a client's current condition in behavioral terms.Process - the way in which a client, counselor, or group engages or interacts.Professionalism - a demonstration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes consistently applied when working with people who use substances and abiding by a code of ethics most commonly held by addiction professionals. Projective identification - the process by which a person places internal negative feelings or concepts about oneself onto others.Protective factors - conditions that promote bonding to prosocial values and institutions and can serve to buffer the negative effects of risks. Psychoactive substance - a pharmacological agent that can change mood, behavior, and cognition process.Rapport - the degree to which trust and openness are present in the relationship between counselor and client; an essential element of the therapeutic relationship.175Appendix A - Glossary Recovery - achieving and sustaining a state of health in which the individual no longer engages in problem behavior or psychoactive substance use and is able to establish a lifestyle that embraces health and positive goals. Regression - a mechanism whereby an individual retreats to the use of early-life or less mature responses in attempting to cope with stress, fears, pain, or memories. Relapse - the return to a pattern of substance abuse or the process during which indicators appear before the client's resumption of substance use. Relapse prevention - a variety of interventions designed to teach people with substance use disorders to cope more effectively and to overcome the stressors/triggers in their environments that may lead them back into drug use and dependence. The interventions can be placed in five categories: assessment procedures, insight/awareness raising techniques, coping skills training, cognitive strategies, and lifestyle modification. Reliability - the degree to which a measure is consistent. Resilience - the ability of an individual to cope with or overcome the negative effects of risk factors or to \"bounce back\" from a problem. This capability develops and changes over time, is enhanced by protective factors, and contributes to the maintenance or enhancement of health. Risk factors - conditions for a group, individual, or identified geographic area that increase the likelihood of a substance use problem or substance abuse.Screening - gathering and sorting of information used to determine whether an individual has a problem with substance use and, if so, whether a detailed clinical assessment is appropriate. Selective preventive interventions - activities targeted to individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing a disorder is significantly higher than average.Self-determination - the extent to which individuals control their lives.Self-help group - a supportive, educational, usually change-oriented mutual-help group that addresses a single life problem or condition shared by all members. Service coordination - the process of prioritizing, managing, and implementing activities in an individual's treatment plan.Significant others - family member, sexual partner, and others on whom an individual is dependent for meeting all or part of his or her needs.Sobriety - the quality or condition of abstinence from psychoactive substance abuse supported by personal responsibility in recovery. Special populations - diverse groups of individuals sharing a particular characteristic, circumstance, or problem.Spirituality - a belief system that acknowledges and appreciates the influence in one's life of a higher power or state of being.Stage of change - transtheoretical description of one of several stages through which a person passes in moving from active use to treatment and abstinence. Stage of readiness - the individual's awareness of need to change. Can be influenced by external pressure (family, legal system, or employer) or internal pressure (physical health concerns).176Addiction Counseling Competencies Substance abuse - a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress such as failure to fulfill major role responsibilities or use in spite of physical hazards, legal problems, or interpersonal and social problems. (See also DSM-IV-TR for specific criteria.) Substance dependence - the need for alcohol or a drugs that results from the use of that substance. This need includes both mental and physical changes that make it difficult for individuals to control when they use the substance and how much they use. Psychological dependence occurs when individuals need the substance to feel good or normal or to function. Physical dependence occurs when the body adapts to the substance and needs increasing amounts to achieve the same effect or to function. (See also DSM-IV-TR for specific criteria.) Substance use - consumption of low and/or infrequent doses of alcohol or drugs, sometimes called \"experimental,\" \"casual,\" \"recreational,\" or \"social\" use, such that consequences may be rare or minor. Systems theory - view of behavior as an interactive part of a larger social structure. Theory - a framework to organize and integrate knowledge to facilitate answering the question, \"why?\" Transdisciplinary - knowledge and attitudes that both transcend and are needed by all disciplines working with persons with substance use disorders. Transference - the process in which a client's strong feelings for significant others may be transferred to the counselor.Treatment barriers - anything that hinders treatment. Examples include financial problems, language difficulties, ethnic and social attitudes, logistics (e.g., child care, transportation), and unhelpful patient behaviors (e.g., tardiness, missed appointments). Treatment goals - objectives based on resolving problems identified during assessment and reasonably achievable in the active treatment phase. Treatment interventions - strategies the counselor and other professionals use to assist the client in achieving treatment goals. Treatment objectives - incremental steps a client takes in achieving treatment goals. Universal prevention - prevention designed for everyone in the eligible population, both the general public and all members of specific eligible groups. Also, activities targeted to the general public or a whole population group that has not been identified on the basis of individual risk. Validity - the degree to which an instrument or process measures what it is designed to measure.177Appendix B - The Competencies APPendix b - t He comPetencies : A comPlete list This is a complete list of the competencies without the knowledge, skills, and attitudes. trAnsdisciPlinAry foundAtion i: u nderstAnding Addiction Competency 1: Understand a variety of models and theories of addiction and other problems related to substance use.

Horvatich, Ph.D., and Jon F. Wergin, Ph.D. Virginia Commonwealth University1 introduction The education of addiction counselors, once based on tradition, myth, and politics, is becoming increasingly professionalized, based on competencies, research, and best practice (Fisher 1997). Treatment for psychoactive substance abuse and dependence has traditionally been provided by addiction counselors. Although many counselors have academic degrees, many others have become counselors following personal experiences with treatment and recovery (Deitch & Carleton 1997). Formal education for addiction counselors has traditionally consisted of specialty training provided by treatment agencies, professional or certification organizations, or human service programs of community colleges that confer associate's degrees. Certification of addiction counselors varies from State to State but usually requires a high school diploma and a specified number of years of experience in the field. A bachelor's degree is required in only some States. In others, addiction counselors require no certification as long as they work in a State-approved facility. Because of a variety of policy and economic factors, training requirements for certification in addiction counseling have become more rigorous. These factors include, among others, the pervasiveness and effect of substance abuse on society, expanded treatment research efforts, and managed behavioral health care. If substance use problems were not so widespread and costly to society, there would be less interest in the credentials of addiction counselors and the outcomes of the treatment they provide. Although treatment research has grown rapidly and has provided useful insights, new informa- tion will be useless unless it is implemented by frontline practitioners. Addiction counselors must be able to understand and apply new knowledge, but traditionally these connections have not been made (Fisher 1997). Efforts to make treatment more efficient have resulted in the integration of substance abuse treatment with mental health services, thereby increasing the role of mental health and other healthcare professionals in substance abuse treatment. Addiction specialties have emerged in medicine, nursing, social work, psychology, and counseling, including rehabilitation counseling. Managed care has made it increasingly likely that master's-level addiction 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented at the American Educational Research Association Annual Meeting, April 13-17, 1998, in San Diego, California. This study was funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Grant Number 5U98 TI 00837. The original version is archived on the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) Web site under ERIC document number ED422545.190Addiction Counseling Competencies counselors will be reimbursed for services provided. Addiction counselors who are currently certified with only a high school diploma may have difficulty making the leap to a master's degree. Many addiction counselors may not be able to obtain the advanced education needed fast enough to survive in the market. In 1993 the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) created the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Program to foster improvements in the preparation of addiction treatment professionals (Rohrer et al. 1996). As part of the ATTC Program, a National Curriculum Committee (the Committee) was established to evaluate existing curricula and to set priorities for current academic programs. At its first meeting, the Committee realized that the field had not defined the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that should be shared by all addiction counselors. Identifying and delineating these competencies became the Committee's first task to professionalize the field. Representing a range of specialties within the substance abuse treatment field, members of the Committee provided practice-related information through a brainstorming process. Once the general responsibilities of the field were identified, the Committee developed task statements for each. Committee members ordered the responsibilities and task statements in a learning sequence, based on the order in which responsibilities are generally performed on the job. The process of identifying responsibilities was considered complete when the Committee reached consensus regarding the accuracy and sequence of the task statements produced. The Committee identified four transdisciplinary foundations and eight practice dimensions encompassing 121 competencies. These results are consistent with the DACUM (Develop a Curriculum) process (Norton 1985), which typically results in 8 to 12 responsibilities and 50 to 200 tasks. The four transdisciplinary foundation categories were understanding addiction, treatment knowledge, application to practice, and professional readiness. The eight practice dimension categories were clinical evaluation; treatment planning; referral; case management; counseling; client, family, and community education; documentation; and professional and ethical responsibilities. Each category had between 3 and 20 competencies in it. This effort resulted in the publication of Addiction Counselor Competencies (Addiction Technology Transfer Centers 1995). Although the Committee incorporated existing literature related to the work of addiction counselors, particularly the practice analysis conducted by Birch and Davis Corporation (1986) and the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium Role Delineation Study (International Certification and Reciprocity Commission/Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse 1991) when developing the competencies that made up Addiction Counselor Competencie s, it also relied on its own contributions. The Committee felt that job-related data provided a snapshot of what is, not what could be. And in the addiction counseling field, what is has been questioned. Because of its peer counselor and personal experience history, treatment provided by some addiction counselors has been described as narrow and inflexible, impeding the adoption of new treatment methods that may better meet the needs of clients. Moreover, lacking traditional academic preparation, some counselors have difficulty understanding literature and incorporating new research results. Consequently, the Committee's work emphasized moving the field forward. To gauge the potential value of the competencies, the Committee conducted a study to determine which of 121 competencies were perceived as necessary for practice by addiction counselors in the field.191Appendix C - National Validation Study metHod The purposes of this study were the following: Validate a set of 121 competencies for the profession of addiction counseling Determine gaps between actual and needed competencies displayed by entry-level counselors Determine congruence among the perceptions of three practitioner groups. The study was conducted in partnership with the ATTCs, CSAT, and the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (Adams & Gallon 1997). A survey was conducted in 16 States and Puerto Rico from November 1996 to January 1997. The survey instrument was distributed through the ATTCs to State-approved substance abuse treatment agencies. State authorities worked with ATTCs to select qualified treatment sites, distribute the surveys with appropriate cover letters from the State authority, and implement followup strategies to ensure an adequate return rate. A random sample of 60 State-approved treatment facilities was selected in each participating State. For States with fewer than 60 qualifying facilities, all State-approved treatment facilities were included in the study, if the facilities were large enough to have a separate clinical supervisor who was not also an administrator in the facility. Each treatment agency director was sent a cover letter and instructions, three copies of the 16-page survey listing 121 competencies, and corresponding postage-paid return envelopes. Directors were asked to distribute the surveys to a clinical supervisor, a least experienced counselor, and a most proficient counselor. \"Least experienced\" was defined as nonsupervisory, direct-care counselors having no more than 3 years of paid experience as an addiction treat-ment professional. Each respondent rated the level of proficiency \"typically demonstrated\" by entry-level counselors at the time of hire, as well as the level of competency \"needed\" at the time of hire. Each respondent was instructed to provide a rating for each item on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (\"very little to no knowledge/skill/attitude\") to 5 (\"excellent knowledge/skill/ attitude\"). Beginning 1 week following the due date of the responses, telephone calls were placed with nonresponding agencies, encouraging them to submit finished surveys. Final response rates varied by State, ranging from 25 percent in North Carolina to 82 percent in Maryland; the response rate nationally was 46 percent. The total number of respondents was 1,238. results Demographics. (See exhibits 1-6.) Respondents included 369 least experienced counselors, 412 most proficient counselors, and 457 clinical supervisors (N=1,238). Females outnumbered males in all respondent groups. The sample was mostly middle-aged, and age increased with level of experience. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were Caucasian, 14 percent African American, 7 percent Hispanic, and 4 percent filled other minority categories or were undeclared. The respondents were well educated with 74 percent reporting bachelor's or master's degrees. As expected, clinical supervisors reported the greatest number of graduate degrees. Clinical supervisors and most experienced counselors reported the longest employment in the field (i.e., more than 5 years). Although \"least experienced\" was defined as no more than 3 years' paid 192Addiction Counseling Competencies exhibit 1. g endeR* *Adams and Gallon 1997.Gender SupervisorMost ProficientLeast Experienced Total Male 198 153 130 481 Female 259 259 239 757 TOTAL 457 412 369 1,238exhibit 2.

This may be the result of a mistaken inclusion of other experiences in the field such as volunteer service, internships, or personal treatment and recovery. The least experienced counselors had the smallest proportion certified, whereas clinical supervisors had the highest proportion certified. Data reduction procedures. Given the huge number of possible cross-tabulations with a survey this size, results have been summarized in three different ways. First, because the pur-pose of the study was to identify \"essential\" competencies, survey responses were collapsed into percentages of respondents rating each item \"4\" or \"5\" (\"good\" or \"excellent\"). Excluding the \"moderate\" ratings provides a more stringent standard for judging the content validity of the competencies. Second, results were provided for the national sample only. Third, responses were summarized across individual competencies within the 12 competency categories. Validation of the 121 competencies. Internal consistency of the survey was high: Cron - bach's Alpha for the 12 sections of the survey ranged from 0.91 to 0.98. Among the clinical supervisors, 40 percent of respondents indicated that entering practitioners needed to be \"good\" or \"excellent\" in all 121 competencies; 60 percent gave these ratings for 118 of the 121 compe - tencies; and 70 percent gave these ratings for 107 of the 121 competencies. Clearly, the surveyed competencies had high content validity for these experienced practitioners. Gaps between actual and needed competencies. Large differences were found between perceived needed and actual proficiency, across all three respondent groups. As exhibit 7 indi - cates, the gap was most pronounced among clinical supervisors. For all but 1 of the 121 items, less than half the supervisors rated actual proficiencies as \"good\" or \"excellent.\" Exhibit 8 displays the percentage gaps for each of the 12 categories, as reported by clinical supervisors only. Gaps between actual and needed proficiencies are evident across categories, ranging from a 44-percent gap for the \"Referral\" category to a 54-percent gap for the \"Counseling\" category. Just as the perceived need for counselor competencies was consistently high, the perceived level of actual competencies was consistently low. Congruence among perceptions of counselor groups. As exhibit 7 indicates, although the three counselor groups are consistent with one another in their ratings of need, they differ consistently in their ratings of actual proficiency. In each category the lowest ratings were given by supervisors, followed by \"most proficient\" and then \"least experienced\" counselors. Differ- ences between supervisors and least experienced counselors were lowest in the \"Treatment Planning\" category and greatest\u2014not surprisingly\u2014in the \"Professional Readiness\" category. Competency subsets. Ratings of some subsets of the competencies indicate a need for further study. For example, supervisors and counselors seemed to undervalue competencies related to research and treatment outcome assessment. The Committee included these compe-tencies because it felt that the counselors' abilities to assess and monitor outcomes and apply research findings to their own practices were important and would contribute to the profession - alization of the field. In sum, this survey revealed large and consistent gaps between actual and needed competencies across all categories, with clinical supervisors perceiving the largest differences. 194Addiction Counseling Competencies exhibit 7.

However, the responses of each professional group also show relatively little discrimination among items and categories, which may account for the high Alpha coefficients. Given the large number of items in the survey, this level of consistency could indicate a substantial halo effect: that is, respondents could have been answering individual items on the basis of an overall impression and not making fine discriminations among the individual competencies. The results also indicate large gaps between what is needed and observed in proficiency for entry-level counselors, even among entry-level counselors themselves. Supervisors noted the greatest gaps, followed by the most proficient and entry-level counselors. Although the least ex-perienced counselors reported the smallest gaps, the gaps were still substantial, indicating that what counselors know they need to do the job and what they can do are two different things. What accounts for supervisors' ratings of entry-level proficiency being more critical than the other respondent groups? One possibility is a contrast effect. That is, supervisors may be us-ing their own level of expertise as the standard for comparison resulting in unrealistically high expectations for entry-level counselors. In this instance, counselors with average proficiency would receive lower ratings against the supervisors' higher standard representing significantly more experience. As a content validation strategy, the survey has limited value. Respondents were given 121 statements to respond to, and little discrimination among the items was observed. However, all the competencies were perceived to be important, and the preparation for each was always reported as inadequate. Respondents appeared to address the list as a whole, rather than the individual competencies. Those who would embark on curricular change should do the same. That is, formal preparation for addiction counselors cannot just be bolstered here and there; it needs to be comprehensively redesigned. The main benefit of the survey results may be as a catalyst for curricular change. This has already proven to be the case. While the survey was being conducted, the Committee was already working on an expanded document that listed the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for each of the 121 competencies. Feedback from the field was obtained on the draft document. Then the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (ICRC) convened a national leadership group to assess the need for model addiction counselor training. After careful deliberation, the group concluded that much of the work to define such a curriculum standard had already been accomplished by the Committee and the ICRC in the Committee's Addiction Counselor Compe- tencies and the ICRC's 1996 Role Delineation Study , respectively. Soon after, CSAT agreed to fund a collaborative effort to finalize a document that could be used as a national standard. CSAT convened a panel\u2014The National Steering Committee for Addiction Counseling Standards (NSC)\u2014that comprised representatives from five national educational, certification, and professional associations. The NSC was successful in achieving unanimous endorsement of the Addiction Counselor Competencies \u2014a milestone in the addiction counsel- ing field. In 1998 CSAT published the results of this groundbreaking work as TAP 21: Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice.196Addiction Counseling Competencies The significance of TAP 21 for addiction counseling was that it provided a single frame of reference for curriculum development, student advising, professional development, and clinical supervision. The current updated edition of TAP 21 continues the work of furthering the professionalization of the addiction counseling field. conclusions Although this is a study of perceptions and professional judgment and further inquiry is needed into the reasons for the discrepancies, these results suggest that clinical supervisors are getting far less than they need in entry-level counselors. More systematic discussions between clinical practitioners and faculty of training programs in addiction counseling should produce a redefinition of curricular goals based on the competencies described in this document. Addiction counseling is a profession in the making. Rather than maintaining its professional culture by relying on tradition, addiction counseling is building its identity from the ground up, by first identifying competencies all addiction counselors are expected to possess. Such an approach addresses directly the \"education-practice discontinuity\" cited by Cavanaugh (1993) as one of the most critical problems in professional education. references Adams, R.J., & Gallon, S.L.

Bibliographies appear at the end of each section and are combined into a complete, alphabetized list here. The Competencies bibliographies serve a number of purposes including the following: Serving as a guide to educators in teaching and curriculum development Offering assistance to counselors preparing for certification or licensure exams Contributing to practitioners' understanding and knowledge of research- and consensus-based practices Furnishing clinical supervisors with current reading suggestions for supervisees Providing counselors and other practitioners with a study resource Supplying administrators with current citations regarding the practice of addiction counseling for use in grant preparation. literAture seArcH metHodology This updated version of The Competencies represents the work of two Committees. In 2000, a Committee began revising the 1998 version of The Competencies. In 2005, a second Committee was convened to review The Competencies and update the 2000 bibliography. The bibliographies in The Competencies do not represent a complete reference list of mean-ingful addiction counseling-related citations. However, they are the result of a thoughtful and extensive literature review, and they represent the intent and spirit of The Competencies. Both literature searches pointed up gaps in literature for several practice dimensions. A scarcity of citations was especially notable in the documentation; service coordination; client, family, and community education; and referral practice dimensions. Addiction counseling professionals might explore these subjects if they are looking for research and writing agendas. 2000 m etHodology The literature search for the 2000 update was conducted by members of the National Addiction Technology Transfer Center Curriculum Committee for each transdisciplinary foundation and practice dimension. Library facilities at Brown University, the State University of New York at Albany, the University of Iowa, the University of Missouri, and the University of Nevada-Reno were used. Criteria for the searches specified that resources be the following: Timely\u2014no citation published before 1989 unless it was deemed seminal Empirically sound Relevant to a particular practice dimension and its associated knowledge, skills, and attitudes.198Addiction Counseling Competencies The results of the searches were mixed. Some practice dimensions yielded many citations, whereas few relevant citations were found for others. The research methods used also differed from institution to institution. The lack of uniformity in search methodology concerned the Com-mittee. Thus, a professional library association specializing in substance abuse\u2014the Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists (SALIS), which uses specially trained librarians to manage, organize, collect, and distribute substance abuse-related information\u2014was hired. SALIS was asked to search materials relevant to the eight practice dimensions using the following online databases: Medline Psych Info ETOH ERIC (U.S. Department of Education) SALIS's library catalog databases (ADAI Library in Seattle, Washington; Wisconsin Clearinghouse Library in Madison, Wisconsin; and Alcohol Research Group in Berke - ley, California). Keywords were used to find other relevant terms and articles. Review articles were gleaned for items not found with online databases, such as chapters from edited works and government documents. Because large numbers of citations were retrieved for a majority of the practice dimensions, SALIS conducted an initial screening of articles based on topic, major researchers, descriptions in abstracts, and source documents. Because entire books are rarely found through online database literature searches, tables of contents for appropriate books were included from cita-tions found on SALIS catalog databases. When SALIS completed the search, it provided the Committee with a list of citations and articles for each practice dimension. Committee members then reviewed the results of the SALIS litera-ture search. Each article received an independent review by two Committee members based on whether it met the following criteria: Relevance to the practice dimension being reviewed Relevance to another practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation Empirically or evidence based Based on clinical practice Contribution to further understanding of the practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation Published between 1989 and 2000, unless considered exemplary or a \"classic.\" After critiquing both the SALIS-generated articles and articles from the Committee's initial search, the Committee cross-referenced the results of each article's evaluation. An article was selected for inclusion only if two Committee members agreed that it correctly represented the intent of a given practice dimension. When consensus was not reached between the primary re - viewers, a third Committee member reviewed the article. Articles were considered for inclusion only if a third review was positive. Articles found to be irrelevant to the practice dimensions or those that did not meet the established criteria were excluded from the bibliography.199Appendix D - Complete Bibliography 2005 m etHodology The literature search for the 2005 update was conducted by the Center for Substance Abuse Research (CESAR). The literature search was for each of the four transdisciplinary foundations and each of the eight practice dimensions. It covered literature from 2000 to 2005. The literature search used the same methodology as the search conducted in 2000. When CESAR completed the search, it provided the Committee with a list of citations and articles for each practice dimension. Committee members also recommended articles that were pertinent to a particular practice dimension. Each article received an independent review by two Committee members based on the following criteria: Relevance to the practice dimension being reviewed Relevance to another practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation Contribution to further understanding of the practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation. The 2005 Committee followed the same methodology as the 2000 Committee in deciding whether to include or exclude articles from the practice dimension bibliographies. Group consensus focusing on creating a balanced representation of the available literature was used to determine whether to include or exclude books for the transdisciplinary foundation bibliographies. Articles and books selected by the 2005 update Committee were added to the bibliographies created by the 2000 update Committee. bibliogrAPHy Ackerman, S.J., & Hilsenroth, M.J. (2003).
