Spring booster eligibility COVID-19 is more serious in older people and in people with certain underlying health conditions. For these reasons, people aged 75 years and over, those in care homes, and those aged 5 years and over with a weakened immune system are being offered a spring booster of COVID-19 vaccine. Timing of the spring booster You should be offered an appointment between April and June, with those at highest risk being called in first. You will be invited to have your booster around 6 months from your last dose but you can have it from 3 months. If you are turning 75 years of age between April and June, you will be called for vaccination during the campaign; you do not have to wait for your birthday. Vaccines in use this spring You will be given a booster dose of a vaccine made by Pfizer, Moderna or Sanofi and approved in the UK. These vaccines have been updated since the original vaccines and target different COVID-19 variants. For a very small number of people another vaccine product may be advised by your doctor. These updated vaccines boost protection well, and give slightly higher levels of antibody against the more recent strains of COVID-19 (Omicron) than the vaccines you would have received previously. As we cannot predict which variants of COVID-19 will be circulating this spring and summer, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has concluded that all of these vaccines can be used and that no one should delay vaccination to receive a different vaccine. The Sanofi vaccine contains an adjuvant (a chemical used to improve the immune response to the virus). This vaccine will only be offered to older people, who may respond less well to vaccines. The adjuvant in the COVID-19 vaccine is similar to the one used in the flu vaccine which is routinely given to over 65 year olds. The NHS website has more information [about vaccine ingredients](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/why-vaccination-is-safe-and-important/). Please accept the vaccination that is offered to you as soon as you are able to - you will be offered the right vaccine for you at the right time. You will be invited for your booster, your GP may offer you the vaccine or you can book using [the NHS app](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/) for [Apple](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nhs-app/id1388411277?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhs.online.nhsonline) You can your [nearest walk-in vaccination site](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/find-a-walk-in-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-site/) from the NHS website. Who cannot take up the offer of a spring booster There are very few people who should not have this booster. If you have had a severe reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine you should discuss this with your doctor. Side effects Common side effects As with your previous dose, the common side effects are the same for all COVID-19 vaccines, including the updated vaccines being used this spring and include: - having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection - this tends to be worst around 1 to 2 days after the vaccine - feeling tired - headache - general aches or mild flu-like symptoms You can rest and take paracetamol following the dose advice in the packaging, to help you feel better. Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, you can call NHS 111 or text or phone 18001 111. Serious side effects Cases of inflammation of the heart (called myocarditis or pericarditis) have been reported very rarely after both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These cases have been seen mostly in younger men and within several days of vaccination. Most of the people affected have felt better and recovered quickly following rest and simple treatments. You should seek medical advice urgently if, after vaccination, you experience: - chest pain - shortness of breath - feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart If you had a serious side effect after a previous dose you may be advised to avoid or delay further vaccination. You should discuss this with your doctor or specialist. Reporting side effects You can report suspected side effects of vaccines and medicines through the Yellow Card Scheme: - online at [Yellow Card Scheme](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) - by downloading and using the Yellow Card app on [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/yellow-card-mhra/id990237487)or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&hl=en_GB) - by calling the Yellow Card scheme on 0800 731 6789 (9am to 5pm) If you are unwell on the day of your booster vaccination If you are unwell, wait until you have recovered to have your vaccine. You should not attend an appointment if you have a fever or think you might be infectious to others. You may still catch COVID-19 after having the booster The COVID-19 booster will reduce the chance of you becoming severely unwell from COVID-19 this spring and summer. It may take a few days for your body to build up some extra protection from the booster. Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective. Some people may still get COVID-19 despite having a vaccination, but any infection should be less severe. Catching up with missed doses If you have not yet had either of your first 2 doses of the vaccine (or a third dose for those with a weakened immune system) you should have them as soon as possible. If you are eligible and you have missed an earlier booster, you should have a dose this spring to catch up. You will not need another dose during the summer. Waiting after you have your vaccine If you have a history of allergies, or if you had a reaction immediately after a previous dose, you may be advised to stay for 15 minutes after the vaccine. Please make sure you tell the vaccinator.
