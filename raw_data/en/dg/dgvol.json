RHD is a highly contagious, fatal viral disease in rabbits caused by multiple virus strains. It is an internationally reportable disease to the world organization for animal health (OIE). WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT RHD VIRUS TYPES? Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus Lagovirus and family Caliciviridae. There are many strains of RHDV, and three major viral subtypes: RHDV (\"classical RHDV\"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb). Related lagoviruses, called rabbit caliciviruses, circulate in healthy rabbits. These viruses can confer varying degrees of cross-protection to RHDV. While most rabbit caliciviruses do not appear to cause any illness, two potentially pathogenic strains have been reported. One virus identified in the U.S. (proposed name \"Michigan rabbit calicivirus\") was isolated from an outbreak that resembled rabbit hemorrhagic disease, although an attempt to reproduce the disease in experimentally infected rabbits resulted in little or no illness. A related strain, the Ashington strain of rabbit calicivirus, was recovered from dead wild rabbits during an outbreak in Europe. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT RHDV1 AND RHDV2 VIRUS TYPES? There are many strains of the RHD virus, but three are of most concern. RHD Type 1 has two forms, RHDV and RHDVa. RHD Type 2 has just one form, RHDV2. The two forms of Type 1 are quite similar and their vaccines are cross-protective. They tend to not affect young bunnies but have a very high mortality rate for adult rabbits. RHDV2, on the other hand, seems less deadly than the Type 1 strains, but affects all ages of rabbits. The RHDV2 vaccine only protects against that type. All RHD virus types are in the viral family Caliciviridae and genus Lagovirus. HOW CAN I TELL IF MY RABBIT HAS RHD? Only laboratory tests can confirm a diagnosis of RHD. However, RHD should be suspected if a rabbitry experiences illness in most/all rabbits, high fevers, poor appetites, depression, inactivity, bloody discharges, seizures, and/or sudden death. Call your veterinarian right away if you have any concerns about your rabbit's health. Usually RHDV2 is associated with mass morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) in a colony or herd. Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 2 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us HOW IS RHD TRANSMITTED? Rabbit hemorrhagic disease spreads between rabbits mostly by ingestion and inhalation of the virus. The virus is present in urine and feces from infected rabbits, so contaminated bedding, food or forage can be a source of infection. The virus can be moved from place to place mechanical vectors and fomites (flies, predators, scavengers, feral domestic and wild rabbits, vehicle tires, clothing, footwear, cages, equipment, and wind and water moveme nt). CAN HUMANS, DOGS OR OTHER ANIMALS CONTRACT RHD? RHD is not a zoonotic disease and there is no public health significance. RHD is specific to rabbits. Dogs, cats, and other pets cannot contract the disease, but can transport the virus just like vehicle s, shoes, and equipment can. CAN RABBITS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND RECOVER OR NEVER BECOME ILL CARRY THE VIRUS? Exposure to the virus does not necessarily mean a rabbit is infected with the virus. Some rabbits will just be exposed; others will be expo sed and become infected and either die or recover. Recovering rabbits will develop antibodies to the virus and become resistant to related calicivirus strains for an unknown period. Infected rabbits can \"carry\" or shed the virus for over a month, perhaps u p to four months (when experimentally infected); they are not believed to be infected and shed for life. WHERE DID THE VIRUS COME FROM? The RHD virus was first identified in China in the early 1980s. Outbreaks occur periodically throughout the world and c ontinually in some countries but have been quite rare in North America. Since 2019 RHDV2 has been an emerging disease issue in North America; British Columbia experienced outbreaks of RHDV2 in 2018 - 2019, primarily on Vancouver Island. Isolated cases were r eported in OH in 2018 and NY in 2020. WA had an outbreak in 2019 -2020. A multistate outbreak in NM, AZ, CA, CO, TX, NV and UT started in 2020 and is ongoing. Mexico has also confirmed detection of RHDV2 virus in 6 northern states. The source of the recent RHDV2 outbreaks has not been identified. WILL THE VIRUS BE HERE FROM NOW ON? The presence of RHDV2 in feral domestic and multiple wild lagomorph species (including jack rabbits and cottontails) complicates disease control and eradication efforts. It is di fficult to control and eliminate diseases that can be spread and maintained in wildlife populations and the disease will likely become endemic in some US states. Perhaps RHD will manifest as periodic die offs of feral domestic and wild rabbit populations. Those who own rabbits and live in states with infected feral domestic and wild populations should plan on enacting recommended biosecurity practices from here on and consider vaccinating if allowed in the state. Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 3 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us ARE ALL RHDV2 VIRUSES THE SAME? The RHDV2 v iruses in the North American outbreak are phylogenetically different. The NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory completed full genome sequencing and analysis of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) isolates detected in the United States f rom 2018 through 2020, including from the ongoing outbreak in the southwestern United States. The phylogenetic analysis indicates isolates cluster by geographical region (NY, OH, and WA are all different from SW states). The most recent southwestern isola tes form a single genetic cluster suggesting that the outbreak of RHD in these states was caused by the introduction of a single genetic isolate into the region; this virus is responsible for the disease in both wild rabbits and hares and domestic rabbits. IS IT TRUE WILD RABBITS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE RHDV2 STRAIN OF VIRUS? RHDV2 has a wide host range and can infect wild rabbit species. The SW US outbreak of RHDV2 has affected native North American rabbits and hares including black -tailed jackrabbits, de sert cottontail rabbits, mountain cottontail rabbits, and antelope jackrabbits. Eastern cottontail rabbits have been shown to be susceptible in experimental studies. As the disease spreads, RHDV2 may be confirmed in additional North American lagomorph spe cies. HOW LONG CAN RHD PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT? The virus can survive for long periods outside the host. Environmental temperature, humidity, and protection by organic material are important factors in virus survival. Viable virus has been detected fo r as long as 105 days on a fomite at room temperature and in decaying tissue of infected carcasses for up to 90 days; it persists in chilled or frozen rabbit meat. The virus can remain viable for 22 -35 days at 72\u00b0F. It survives freeze - thaw cycles. Pelts fr om dead wild or domestic rabbits in premises or geographic areas during an RHDV outbreak should not be processed, transported or sold. Hunting Rabbits WHAT PRECAUTIONS SHOULD I TAKE IF I HUNT RABBITS OR HARVEST DOMESTIC RABBITS FOR FOOD ? (See ODFW guidance for h unting ) RHDV2 can pe rsist in chilled or frozen rabbit meat for an undetermined period of time and may be a source of infection for domestic and wild rabbits. If you find a wild dead rabbit in an area with known infection of RDHV, do not take the carcass home for human or ani mal consumption and do not process the pelt for sale or use. Careful biosecurity considerations for handling meat should be taken. Meat should be cooked thoroughly, all surfaces in contact with meat should be cleaned and disinfected and effective hand w ashing practices should be employed. Rabbits that die of RHD should not be frozen for human consumption due to the risk of virus persistence in the frozen meat and risk of herd reinfection.

Response and Disease Containment HOW MANY CASES OF RHD HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED? Find the most recent information about detection of RHDV2 on this interacti ve map. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY HERD IF RHDV 2 IN CONFIRMED? IS EUTHANASIA REQUIRED? The two options for management of infected domesti c premises include euthanasia with an observed fallow period prior to restocking or no euthanasia with an observed quarantine period prior to restocking. Both options require premises quarantine, proper dis posal, strict cleaning and disinfection protocols and biosecurity implementation. The State Veterinarian will work with you to customize the best plan for your premises based on your individual facility, biosecurity plan and identified risk factors. Some states will not euthanize domesti c or feral rabbit colonies where rabbits have been exposed and recovered from RHD. In areas where the disease is present in wild or feral domesti c rabbits, there will be continued high risk for reintroduction of disease into domesti c rabbit premises. Decisions around colony euthanasia will vary based on risk (indoor vs outdoor, location of the infected premises, biosecurity risk factors, etc). State s and USDA also have no funding for indemnity to reimburse rabbit owner s for thei r losses. Dispo sal Questions WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I FIN D A DEA D FERAL DOMESTIC OR WI LD RABBIT ? (See disposal guidance) If an owned rabbit dies and RHD could be the cause, double bag the carcass in plastic bags and refrigerate it until given more instructions. Disinfect the outside of the bag with 10% bleach or 1% Virkon- S. Do not freeze it. Contact the S tate Veterinarian's office at 1 (800) 347 -7028 for more information. If you find a dead feral domestic or wild rabbit, contact the State Veterinarian to determine whether this carcass should be submitted for testing or properly disposed of. Remember tha t handling dead rabbits increases your risk of bringing disease back to your domestic herd. Also, wild rabbits can die of other diseases like Tularemia and Plague, which are a human health hazard. Always wear disposable gloves when handling a dead ani mal; dispose of them when done and wash yo ur hands. Rabbits that do not qualify for testing should be double bagged and disposed of. CAN I USE A RABBIT THAT HAS DIED OF RHDV FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION? No. Although there is no public health concern with RHDV, the virus can persist for long periods of time and could infect or reinfect a premises. Viable virus has been detected in the tissue of infected carcasses for up to 90 days; it persists in chilled or frozen rabbit meat for years. Meat and pelts from wild or domestic rabbits that Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 5 Animal Health Progr am 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us died from RDHV during an outbreak should not be processed, transported or sold. If you have rabbits that have later b een confirmed with RHDV, you should clean out your freezer and dispose of carcasses of animals that likely died of RHDV. CAN I PROCESS, SELL OR TRANSPORT PELTS FROM RABBITS THAT DIED OF RHDV? No. Pelts from wild or domestic rabbits that died from RDHV du ring an outbreak should not be processed, transported or sold. HOW DO I DISPOSE OF A DEAD RABBIT? Options for disposal include incineration, double bagging with disposal in landfill/garbage, or double bagging with deep burial. Burial must be deep enough to discourage scavenging by wildlife. In most cases, if dead rabbits do not need to b e tested, they should be double -bagged and disposed of in municipal garbage. Vaccination Questions IS A VACCINE AVAILABLE? Yes, but commercial RHD vaccines are manufactured in Europe but not currently authorized for widespread use in the U.S. In situations such as the current o utbreak, the USDA may issue a license to veterinarians to import the vaccine if these veterinarians complete a federal application process. The available vaccine requires an annual booster. IS THE VACCINE AVAILABLE IN OUR OREGON? Although RHD vaccines are readily available in countries where the disease is routinely present, the vaccine is unlicensed in the U.S. and must be approved by USDA APHIS for importation and use. APHIS will conditionally approve limited importation of the vaccine to authorized veter inarians in geographic areas in or near an area where RHD has been diagnosed. Along with biosecurity, vaccination can be a tool for disease control. However, we make no claims to the safety and efficacy of the unlicensed vaccines. Limited production capaci ty and supply of the vaccine restricts vaccine use to rabbits at immediate risk, in or near a quarantine area, or where wild rabbits are infected and maintain the virus. The permit does not allow widespread use of the vaccine in unaffected areas. WHY IS THE VACCINE SO DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN? The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) classifies RHD as a foreign animal disease (FAD), a serious animal disease present in other countries but not the U.S. State Animal Health Officials work together and with Federal partners to id entify and prevent FADs, including RHD, from spreading to animals in the U.S. (continued on the next page) Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 6 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us The vaccine is unapproved and unlicensed in the U.S. and must be imported from Europe. The importation of vaccine requires special permits, port brokers and people to maintain t he vaccine in the cold supply chain to ensure efficacy. In addition, the vaccine companies that manufacture those vaccines have limited production capacity and cannot keep up with U.S. demand. The production process that is necessary to manufacture the ki lled vaccines includes the use of live rabbits. However, Filavac and Eravac are the only viable vaccine options we have at this time. The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) will only approve the use of these killed vaccines for conditional use in t he US as a tool in the face of an outbreak. The Nobiviac Myxo -RHD Plus includes myxomatosis, another serious and fatal disease of rabbits. USDA CVB will not authorize the importation of any vaccines that include Myxomatosis, because those vaccines are live , recombinant viruses and environmental laws prohibit release without extensive testing and risk assessment in the United States. ARE VACCINATED RABBITS CON SIDERED \"INFECTED\" AND SHEDDING VIRUS FOR LIFE? The RHDV vaccine is a killed vaccine; it will not cause the disease and rabbits will not sh ed live vaccine virus after vaccination. It should stimulate vaccinated animals to produce protective antibodies against the RHDV2, thereby preventing illness. If vaccinated rabbits are tested for antibodies by the ELISA laboratory test, antibodies to the vaccine will be detected. A test is available to distinguish antibodies resulting from vaccination vs. infection. In the U.S., the only test available to detect the RHD virus is PCR. The PCR test is not performed for live animals. This test is only availab le at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on Plum Island, NY, because RHD is a foreign animal disease. CAN VACCINATED RABBITS INFECT OTHER RABBITS AFTER VACCINATION THROUGH THEIR SALIVA? No. Killed vaccines are inactivated, so there's no cha nce of the vaccine causing disease spread to other rabbits via saliva, feces, hair, etc. However, vaccinated or unvaccinated rabbits can passively carry the virus on their feet, hair, whiskers, etc. and move it that way, just as with human feet, car tires, shovels, etc. SHOULD ALL RABBITS IN THE QUARANTINE OR CONTROL AREA BE VACCINATED? Vaccination is a tool to protect owned rabbits in high risk areas. Vaccine doesn't prevent infection; it boosts the immune system so most rabbits do not die if exposed. Vacc inations are like insurance --one's use of them reflects one's willingness to accept risk. Because of the seriousness of this disease and how contagious it is, it would be best for all owned rabbits to be vaccinated where infected feral domestics or infecte d wild rabbits have been detected. However, the vaccine is not 100% effective, must be given every year, and may be more expensive than some owners can afford. In that case, rabbit owners must rely on stringent biosecurity to reduce risk. Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 7 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us WHAT ABOUT RABBITS LIVING IN AREAS NOT IN THE DESIGNAT ED ZONES? CAN THEY BE VACCINATED? Until/unless a vaccine is licensed in the U.S., there will be limited quantities of imported vaccine available for use the U.S., so priority must go to rabbits at highest risk, which means those in the affected areas (see map). The vaccine is unli censed, conditionally approved, and only intended to be used to control disease in infected and adjacent zones. WILL RABBIT OWNERS IN THE CONTROL AREA BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE? Yes. Biosecurity Questions HOW SHOULD I CLEAN AND DISINFECT CAGES, ETC.? Remove all visible debris from items to be disinfected (cages, feeding equipment, waterers, etc.). Items made of wood are best discarded or burned. First you must clean by washing items thoroughly with soap and water; rinse well and let dry. Then to disinf ect, you should submerge or saturate with spray or 10% household bleach solution (1 cup bleach to 1 gallon of water). Allow 10 minutes of contact, then rinse and let dry before allowing animal contact. See USDA C&D guidance . The RHD calicivirus is inactivated by 10 minutes of (sodium hypochlorite) at 1:10 dilution 1% Virkon (by DuPont) peroxide products (Rescue, Accel, Virox 5). WHAT BIOSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD I FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH? Rabbit owners and commercial operations should work with their veterinarian or state animal health official to identify the ir biosecurity risk factors. Customized site-specific biosecurity plans should identify key risk factors, establish best practices and make considerations for vaccination or other tools for disease mitigation and control. Plans may vary based on geograph ic location, OIE status, confirmation of infection in wildlife or access to vaccine. Key areas for consideration include: Human Best Practices oHave indoor and outdoor footwear; don't wear outdoor shoes indoors and vice versa. oWash hands before and after handling or caring for rabbits and between groups. oDon't allow visitors who also have rabbits. oDon't handle others' rabbits. oHandle sick rabbits last. oFollow disposal guidance for dead rabbits.Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 8 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us \"Line of Separation\" and \"Perimeter Buffer Area\" oCommercia l operations may apply these concepts during periods of heightened risk, especially in areas where RHDV has affected wild rabbits. Housing oKeep rabbits inside if possible on an impermeable surface. oIf rabbits are housed outdoors, double fence to avoid d irect contact with wildlife. oPrevent direct or indirect contact with wild rabbits. oHouse rabbits in hutches or cages off the ground. oDo not use forage, tree branches or grass for bedding from areas with infected wildlife. Isolate New Rabbits or Rabbits Returning from a Show (see Show/ Exhibition guidance) oKeep rabbits in separate area for 30 days before allowing contact with your colony. oBe aware of animal health and CVI requirements for the state of destination.

Treats can include raw vegetables from grocery stores. oSource hay from unaffected areas. Rabbit health oMonitor your rabbits closely for going off feed, looking limp/depressed, or behaving differently in anyway. oCall your vet ASAP if you note signs of illness in your rabbits. oConsider vaccination for RHDV2 where available (see vaccine guidance). Report all unusual mass morbidity (sickness) and/or mortality (death) events to your State Veterinarian.Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 9 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us Shows and Exhibitions WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT LARGE RABBIT GATHERINGS LIKE ARBA RABBIT SHOWS, 4 -H RABBIT SHOWS, AND FAI RS? If a premises or geographic region is under quarantine, movement of rabbits, rabbit products, and equipment from quarantine areas to shows is prohibited. After the quarantine expires, show/fair management will need to establish policies for exhibitors from the previous quarantine and control areas who wish to attend their show. It is up to each rabbit show's management to evaluate their risks and decide what par ameters they would like to establish and enforce. Oregon law requires a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and Import Permit for any rabbits that are brought into Oregon. While shows are required to follow and enforce these requirements, they may also choose to enforce additional restrictions if they desire. It is recommended that a veterinarian inspect all rabbits prior to entry. Strict biosecurity should be observed. WHAT ARE SPECIFIC BIOSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVENTS? Quarantined premises or P remises under Emergency Rule Restrictions If a premises or geographic region is under official quarantine (authorized by the State Veterinarian), movement of rabbits, rabbit products, and equipment from quarantine areas to shows is prohibited. After the official quarantine expires, show/fair management will need to establish policies for exhibitorsfrom the previous quarantine and control areas who wish to attend their show. NOTE: ARBA established \"quarantine\" areas (ie: 150 miles from infected premises) are member recommendations without legal authority. FAIR, SHOW AND EXHIBITION REQUIREMENTS Consider postponing or cancelling shows in infected states during an outbreak. It is up to each rabbit show's management to evaluate their risks and dec ide what parameters they would like to establish and enforce. ARBA rabbit shows, 4 -H rabbit shows, and fairs can determine if they choose to add additional requirements to attend an event (ie: RHDV2 vaccination). It is recommended that a veterinarian inspe ct all rabbits prior to entry or that a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) is issued prior to arrival. Check with your State Veterinarian for guidance or recommendations based on risk.Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 10 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us INTERSTATE MOVEMENT Each state has different interstate mo vement rules for rabbits. Each state will have differences in their OIE declared status (ie: \"free\", \"stable endemic\") Some States require a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection or have additional restrictions for states with outbreaks of RHDV. Check with the state of destination. WHAT ARE SPECIFIC BIOSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVENTS? In addition to the biosecurity guidance document, special additional considerations should be included for exhibition animals: Showing oJudges and veterinarians should ch ange gloves or wash hands/arms between animals. oJudges should wear short sleeves and not pick up rabbits to avoid contamination of their clothing. oDo not share show carpets and designate one per animal. oBe sure the show has excellent vector control. Flie s, rats, cats, dogs, birds, etc. can move the virus around on their feet or body. Animal Health oMonitor your rabbits closely for signs of illness (going off feed, looking limp/depressed, or behavioralchanges) and seek immediate veterinary care. oRemove sick rabbits from the premises, and keep in designated isolation area. Housing oKeep show rabbits in cages off the ground. oDo not allow nose to nose contact between rabbits. oClean and disinfect daily whenever possible. oDo not allow your rabbit to exercise in common areas on the ground. oDo not allow non -showing spectators into the rabbit areas: fence off the show area Human Best Practices oWash your hands frequently. oWear different clothes and shoes at the show than you do at home and before contacting the rest of your herd. oDo not share equipment, grooming tools, feeding implements. oWash hands before and after handling or caring for rabbits and between groups. oDon't handle others' rabbits.Oregon.gov/ODA | Updated 3/25/21 11 Animal Health Program 635 Capitol St, NE, Salem, OR 97301-2 532 800-347-7028 | rhd@oda.state.or.us Clean and Disinfect Equipment and Common Grooming Stations (See USDA C&D guidance ) oCleaning \u00a7Remove all visible organic debris from items to be disinfected (cages, feeding equipment, waterers, etc.).

Feeding oSource hay from unaffected areas. oKeep feed covered or in a container with a lid while at the show. oDo not share feed, water or treats with other exhibitors. Going Home oClean and disinfect all cages, equipment and transportation after the show. oIsolate all rabbits returning from the event for 30 days prior to reintroduction to the herd. oFeed and care for returning rabbits last. oReport any mortality or morbidity events to your veterinarian. SHOULD RABBIT OWNERS CONSIDER NOT BRINGING RABBITS TO EVENTS OR MEETINGS FOR BIOSECURITY REASONS? Rabbit events or meetings with live rabbits can contradict several biosecurity recommendations. Biosecuri ty practices are always a good idea, not just for RHD, but more common contagious conditions such as Pasteurella, mites, etc. The highest risk areas are those with infected feral domestic or wild rabbits. Indoor rabbits cared for with excellent biosecurity practices are at very low risk. Rabbits co -mingled at club meetings or shows have greater risk of contracting snuffles from an infected rabbit compared to RHD. Risk of disease transmission could be reduced at club meetings by only having rabbits from one premises present per meeting. All club members must wash hands before and after handling rabbits and arrive at the meeting site with clean clothing and clean/disinfected footwear. After returning home, they should change clothes and footwear and wash the ir hands before caring for their own rabbits. We all have different levels of risk we are willing to accept; the most conservative will not take animals away from home or allow them to contact other animals. Not every 4 -H'er is required to show his/her ani mal if they do not want to for whatever reason.
