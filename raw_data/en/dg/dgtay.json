Witnessing the gradual deterioration of someone's precious memories, ability to care for themselves, or even carry on a normal conversation is distressing. While we're still on the hunt for a true cure for cognitive conditions like dementia and Alzheimer's, studies are uncovering some promising clues. We're finding that certain subsets of Alzheimer's may actually be the side effect of exposure to the poisonous compounds found in toxic mold. In this article, we're going to dive into exactly what Alzheimer's is, break down the different types of Alzheimer's, and explore the fascinating link between toxic mold and this devastating disease. Dementia Vs. Alzheimer's: What Exactly Is Alzheimer's? Dementia is actually an umbrella term that is used to refer to a collection of symptoms that disrupt a person's cognitive abilities. The hallmark of dementia is a gradual and progressive decline in the brain's ability to function properly. This alteration in the brain can lead to distressing and often heart-breaking changes to a person's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks and may include:1 - Memory loss and increasing forgetfulness - Confusion, forgetting people and places - Wandering and getting lost (even in familiar places) - Poor judgment - Difficulty keeping track of things - Personality and mood changes including depression, anxiety, agitation, and severe mood swings - Decreased ability to hold a conversation, difficulty with expression and understanding - Experiencing paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations - Acting impulsively - Impaired vision and depth perception - Loss of balance and coordination Alzheimer's is a specific form of dementia that can cause these devastating symptoms due to a few specific changes to the brain which are:2,3 - An abnormal buildup of proteins: Specific proteins found in the brain known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles begin to accumulate in and around brain cells. - A decrease in neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers that allow your brain cells to communicate. In Alzheimer's, neurotransmitters known as acetylcholine and glutamate become significantly deficient. - Progressive shrinkage: Alzheimer's causes damage to the cells in your brain. As certain areas of the brain are injured and cells begin to die off, parts of the brain begin to shrink in a process known as brain atrophy. So what exactly causes these changes to the brain? What Causes Alzheimer's in the Brain? Researchers have not pinpointed a singular underlying cause of Alzheimer's. It's speculated that the development and progression of Alzheimer's is likely due to a potential combination of any number of factors such as:4,5 - Genetics - History of head trauma - Alcohol and drug consumption - Diet and lifestyle - Other diseases and comorbidities - Mental health and brain plasticity (a fancy way of saying ongoing learning, growing, and challenging your brain) - Chronic inflammation - Exposure to pollutants and other toxins (like toxic mold) As with most diseases, Alzheimer's is likely caused by more than one single underlying factor. But there's one potential contributor to Alzheimer's that's garnering more and more attention - exposure to toxic mold. But before we dive into the link between toxic mold and Alzheimer's, it's important to understand the subtypes of Alzheimer's. Types of Alzheimer's: Understanding Type 3 Alzheimer's There are 3 distinct subtypes of Alzheimer's. The first 2 types are characterized as follows: - Type 1 Alzheimer's (Inflammatory): Characterized by systemic inflammation - Type 2 Alzheimer's (Non-inflammatory): Characterized by metabolic abnormalities Studies have found that type 3 Alzheimer's also referred to as cortical - is arguably a fundamentally different disease than the first two types. Rather than losing the ability to form new memories, those with Type 3 Alzheimer's often begin losing their long-term memory and have significant difficulty maintaining their train of thought.6 It's speculated that this distinct difference in type 3 Alzheimer's may be traced back to exposure to biotoxins and the activation of another underlying condition known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or CIRS. Can Mold Really Cause Alzheimer's? Mold and its toxic metabolites known as mycotoxins are potent biotoxins. These biotoxins can cause what's known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or CIRS - a condition in which your entire immune system is thrown out of whack. Researchers have found a significant overlap between Type 3 Alzheimer's and CIRS - suggesting that Type 3 Alzheimer's may actually be a manifestation of CIRS.7 Exactly how mold and CIRS can cause the brain damage seen in Alzheimer's goes something like this:8,9,10,11,12,13 - A spike in free radicals: The toxins found in mold disturb the balance between harmful free radicals (also known as reactive oxygen species) and the antioxidants that neutralize them. As these free radicals go left unchecked, they cause oxidative stress - a process in which electrons are stripped from your healthy cells, leaving them damaged and unable to function properly. - Inflammation of the neuroimmune axis: As mold toxins spread and free radicals continue to induce damage, your neuroimmune axis - or the communication line between your nervous system and immune system - is activated. Once activated, your immune system launches an attack - deploying immune cells and pro-inflammatory signaling molecules to your brain and nervous system. This causes a massive spike in inflammation not only in your nervous system but throughout your body. - Blood-brain barrier breakdown: Your blood-brain barrier is a membrane that acts as a gatekeeper - controlling the selective movement of molecules between your brain and the rest of your body. The inflammation triggered by mold toxins compromises the integrity of this crucial barrier - increasing permeability and allowing unwelcome molecules to sneak past your blood-brain barrier and into your brain. This creates a vicious cycle - further activating your immune system and skyrocketing inflammation. - Protein binding: Your brain relies on certain proteins to allow your brain cells to communicate with each other via pathways known as synapses. Toxic mold binds to these proteins - disrupting your brain cells' ability to transmit messages properly. - Mitochondrial damage: Your mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells and play an important role in neurogenesis - the formation of new brain cells known as neuronal cells. As the poisonous mold toxins continue to infiltrate your cells, they damage your brain cells' mitochondria and hinder their ability to replicate and form new healthy cells. This results in the die-off of old cells, causing brain shrinkage and atrophy. So, if Type 3 Alzheimer's is in fact a manifestation of CIRS, is there anything we can do about it? Is Alzheimer's and Memory Loss From Mold Reversible? Currently, there is no established \"cure\" for dementia or Alzheimer's. But if Type 3 Alzheimer's, mold/biotoxin exposure, and CIRS are in fact all pieces of the same puzzle, there's promising news. While we may not know how to cure dementia, we do have some specific and powerful healing protocols that can address the root cause of mold exposure and CIRS. Breaking down the science behind biotoxin exposure, CIRS, and the healing protocols used to address and reverse these conditions is far too extensive to cover in this article.
