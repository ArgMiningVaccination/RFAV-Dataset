Before learning more about how our firm may be able to help you, let's investigate why alternative medicine can be dangerous. One of the most powerful tools on alternative medicine's side is its marketing power\u2014people like the sound of natural medicine. Public Perception of Natural Remedies While there are many problems surrounding natural remedies and alternative medicines, misinformation is one that persists and continues to put people in danger. When one hears the phrase \"natural remedy,\" they may automatically think that the remedy is good for them and cannot do any harm. This can lead to people trying to treat their symptoms on their own without discussing anything with their doctors. If someone takes alternative medicine in addition with other medications, they could be at risk for a number of problems: - Drug interactions - Allergic reactions - Additional health issues If you're taking herbal remedies, it's possible they could [interact](https://medlineplus.gov/herbalmedicine.html) with other drugs you're taking, whether they're from a prescription or over-the-counter. If they interact, you could experience side effects. Alternative medicine could contain something you're allergic to but you didn't know. You could have symptoms that range from painful to possibly life-threatening. The natural herbal remedy itself could be inherently dangerous to anyone who takes it. However, when people hear the medicine comes from herbs, they could associate being natural with safe, and think it's okay to take them. There are some examples from the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/know-science/natural-doesnt-mean-better) that demonstrate how natural does not equal safe or good for you. Kava, a plant from the South Pacific, has been used as a natural remedy to help treat anxiety. However, there's a possibility the kava plant could be linked to severe liver damage. Ephedra was used to treat colds and fevers, but may also cause heart problems or even death. The FDA banned supplements that had ephedrine alkaloids in 2004 to help keep people safe. It's important to remember that medicine you get from a doctor or at a pharmacy have been rigorously tested and needed to get FDA approval. Natural remedies do not go through this process and they may contain dangers that you don't know about. Who May Be Held Liable? When you're hurt because of alternative medicine, you may not know if you have grounds for legal action. That's why you should meet with a product liability lawyer. You may be able to file a claim against the drug manufacturer. The company that makes the drug may sell it as a health supplement, but then when you take the drug, it causes injuries. For example, they could recommend a dosage that causes health issues. Manufacturers are also supposed to warn consumers of possible dangers so the consumer is informed of the risks when taking the drug. If the label doesn't include safety warnings and the manufacturer didn't take the proper steps to inform the consumer of the drug's possible dangers, then you may be able to hold them liable for your losses.
