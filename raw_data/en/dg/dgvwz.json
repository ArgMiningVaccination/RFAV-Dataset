They are stable and calm in thought, speech, and action, and are easy-going and supportive in relationships. There is an element of steadiness to their step, and a quality of serenity in their smile. Loyalty is usually their second name. They are long, heavy sleepers and uncomfortable in damp, clammy environments. Calm and sweetness of disposition are hallmarks of a balanced Kapha. The Kapha blend contains essential oils of Eucalyptus, Frankincense, Rosemary, Orange Brazil, Cinnamon Leaf, Clove, Juniper Berry, Cedar Himalayan, and Lavender. Great for a diffuser! Avoid with pregnant or breastfeeding women and young children. Certain essential oils maybe contraindicated with certain medical conditions. Ask your doctor if you have any questions before use.
