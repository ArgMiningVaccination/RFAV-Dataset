But if you think hard enough \u2014 and we've maybe thought a bit too much \u2014 the symbols of the season can provide all kinds of healthy reminders. Here's some straight talk on skeletons. Want to have healthy bones? Hit the gym. The typical prescription for a healthy skeleton is to load up on calcium with dairy products. Lesser known is the importance of strength training, which fights off the loss of muscle and bone density. \"Anything that's weight-bearing is going to be beneficial for bone density,\" says Katie Brumley, strength and conditioning coordinator at the Baylor Tom Landry Fitness Center in Dallas. By strengthening muscles, you usually strengthen bone \u2014 and vice versa, she explains, since the two are connected. She recommends resistance training, running, walking and any activity that creates a pushing or pulling effect on the bone. Stress on the bone causes them to break down and regenerate. Don't fall prey to bad blood. All those gory red decorations may have you wondering: \"Is my blood as healthy as it could be?\" For more than 3 million Americans, the answer is no. That's the estimated number of Americans with anemia, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Anemia, the most common blood disorder, is usually caused by iron deficiency and often goes undiagnosed, says Dr. Vikas Bhushan, a hematologist with Texas Oncology at Medical City Dallas. Women, especially pregnant women, are at a higher risk for the disorder. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, pale skin, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain, among others. To avoid anemia that's caused by iron deficiency, Bhushan recommends eating iron-rich foods such as meat, green vegetables such as spinach or broccoli, and iron-fortified cereals and breads. Garlic scares off vampires \u2014 and also bacteria. Growing up, Lona Sandon says her mother would make a homemade tea of garlic, honey and lemon when she or her siblings were sick. Now a registered dietitian at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Sandon realizes her mom's recipe may have done more than soothe \u2014 it may have helped fight harmful bacteria. Garlic has antimicrobial and antifungal properties, thanks to a compound called allicin. The compound causes garlic to mimic the effect of an antibiotic, Sandon says. Garlic also may play a role in lowering bad cholesterol levels, which explains the growing popularity of garlic supplements. There's also some indication that garlic can fight bacteria topically, Sandon says. She's not betting it'll be the next hand sanitizer, however, considering its pungent smell. Throw spices into your caldron. Witches aren't the only ones who can stir up a fancy brew. You, too, can spice up your cooking. \"There's a potential for health benefits, and they make our food more fun and flavorful,\" Sandon says. Not only do spices pack the punch with minimal calories and sodium, research indicates some have a medicinal effect. Curcumin (found in turmeric) and ginger have been linked to anti-inflammatory effects. Cinnamon can lower blood glucose, which is elevated among those with diabetes. You can learn a lot from a mummy. When it comes to bandages, fetid rags work swell if your main goal is to terrorize people. But what if you're actually trying to prevent a wound from becoming infected? Bandages are only the start, says Andria Butler, who works for the Southwest division of the American Red Cross. Butler encourages all families to put together a portable first aid kit. Supplies can be purchased from a local pharmacy or gathered from around the house. She recommends including these basics: sterile gauze bandages in various sizes, a triangular bandage for splints (could be purchased or made by cutting the corner of a bed sheet), a good pair of scissors, a survival blanket with strong insulation, latex-free disposable thermometers, cloth or fabric tape, antiseptic wipes and gloves. Optional items include antibiotic cream, hydrocortisone and any personalized items, such as a backup supply of prescription medication. Check your first aid kit seasonally, because creams can go bad and even uncursed bandages can rot. Prevent the spread of a zombie virus. Is fear of a zombie-pocalypse keeping you up late at night? Do not fear \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has you covered. Check out their posts about emergency preparedness at www.cdc.gov (just search for \"zombies\"). In the meantime, you can do your part to prevent the spread of more everyday health threats, such as the flu. Since the flu can be spread through the air from as far as six feet away or by touching a surface that's contaminated with germs, be sure to wash your hands regularly. Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizer handy. At the workplace and at home, wipe off common spaces with antibacterial wipes. Make sure all shared utensils and dishes are cleaned thoroughly. The CDC also recommends getting an annual flu vaccination. Learn more about flu prevention and find a place to get your flu shot at flu.gov. And if you'd like to track the zombie-pocalypse (or at least the latest virus outbreak), go to healthmap.org/local. Don't be haunted by the ghosts of failed diets. Yo-yo dieting is better than not dieting at all, according to a study from Ohio University that was presented at this year's conference of the Endocrine Society. Researchers tracked the health and life spans of mice that switched between a high-fat and low-fat diet every four weeks. The yo-yo dieters lived 25 percent longer and had better blood glucose levels than the ones that maintained a high-fat diet. The takeaway? Keep striving for better health. Perhaps by making small incremental changes \u2014 eating salad for lunch, skipping dessert, bringing a healthy snack to work \u2014 healthy eating can become a way of life instead of a short-term stint. Even if that attempt fails, keep trying. "}
