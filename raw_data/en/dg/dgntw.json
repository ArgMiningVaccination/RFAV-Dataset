The research is significant for the development of effective and universal flu vaccines and/or vaccination, creating a vaccine against RSV which does not currently exist and understanding neonatal immunology, vaccine-induced immunity and protective immune mechanisms and serious inflammatory pathogens, among other applications. Kang earned his Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Alabama. Research Interests Influenza/RSV Vaccines, Immunity, Inflammation & Pathogenesis My research interests are to design and develop effective vaccines against viral diseases (influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus), to better understand vaccine-induced protective immune mechanisms, to study pathogen-induced inflammation, and to develop anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Rationales and Significances of Focused Research Area: - Development of effective and universal flu vaccines and/or vaccination. Influenza is a serious human disease and there are challenging problems: - Annual updates of vaccines and vaccination - No protection against a new pandemic strain and bird flu - Syringe-needle injection for delivery of vaccines involves pain and side effects as well as weak mucosal immunity. - RSV (respiratory syncytial virus): RSV is the leading cause of inflammatory bronchiolitis pneumonia and viral death in infants and in some elderly adults. No vaccine against RSV is currently available. Millions of children and elderly are affected with RSV disease annually. - Vaccine-induced immunity and protective immune mechanisms are not well understood. - Better understanding of serious inflammatory pathogens: Influenza, RSV, co-infection with bacterial pneumonia. - Neonatal immunology: Most vaccines are given to infants and young children. However, protective immune mechanisms in infants and young children remain largely unknown. Therefore, understanding protective immunity in infants and young children after vaccination is important and highly significant. - Maternal immunization: To provide protective immunity in young infants until their immune system has fully matured. - Development of Adjuvants: Development of safe and effective adjuvants is critically important for enhancing vaccine efficacy. - Development of effective and universal flu vaccines and/or vaccination.
