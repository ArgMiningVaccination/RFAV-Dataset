According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [combined](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/why-vaccinate/combination-vaccines.html) vaccines merge equivalent component vaccines into single products to prevent more than one disease or protect against multiple strains of infectious agents causing the same disease. ProQuad [indicated](https://www.merck.com/news/us-fda-approves-intramuscular-administration-for-mercks-mmrv-family-of-vaccines-m-m-rii-measles-mumps-and-rubella-virus-vaccine-live-varivax-varicella-virus-vaccine-live-and-proquad/) for active immunization for the prevention of MMRV in children 12 months through 12 years of age. Antibody persistence rates one year after a single dose of [Proquad](https://www.merckvaccines.com/proquad/) were 98.9% against measles, and 97.5% against chickenpox. These persistence rates are similar to those observed at one year with the [M-M-R II](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/m-m-r-ii-vaccine) vaccine. However, because a limited proportion mumps, and rubella (MMR) or varicella vaccinees fail to respond to one dose, a second dose is recommended to provide another opportunity to develop immunity. Of those who do not respond to the first dose of the measles component of MMR or varicella vaccine, 97%-99% [respond to a second dose](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html).

The [ FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/142224/download) approved the draft package insert labeling submitted under amendment #2, dated September 15, 2020. [Supplemental Update](https://www.fda.gov/media/147579/download) on April 13, 2021. And then [updated](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/proquad) on April 16, 2021. The Initial Approval is a global research-driven pharmaceutical company dedicated to putting patients first, established in 1891. Proquad Indications Merck's [ProQuad](https://www.fda.gov/media/147560/download) is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children 12 months through 12 years of age. Proquad should not be administered to individuals with certain medical conditions, including blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, or individuals with any immunodeficient condition or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Proquad also not be used in individuals with active untreated tuberculosis or active febrile illness with a fever (> 101.3 degrees F) or [pregnant women](https://www.fda.gov/media/75195/download). Pregnancy: ProQuad is [contraindicated](https://www.merckvaccines.com/proquad/clinical-data/efficacy/) for use in pregnant women. Do not administer ProQuad to women planning to become pregnant in the next three months. Because of the importance of rubella and varicella immunity among women of childbearing age, the postpartum vaccination of women without evidence of immunity to rubella or varicella with MMR, varicella, or MMRV vaccines should not be delayed because of receipt of anti-Rho(D) globulin or any other blood product during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery, says the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html). AU TGA pregnancy category [B2](https://www.aci.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/273931/drug-safety-in-pregnancy.pdf): Drugs that have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage. Proquad Dosage The CDC published updated [vaccination schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html) for 2022 on Feb. 17, 2022. Each 0.5-mL dose of ProQuad is administered [subcutaneously](https://www.merckvaccines.com/proquad/dosing-administration/). The first dose is usually administered at 12 to 15 months of age but can be given anytime through 12 years of age. If the [second dose](https://www.fda.gov/media/75195/download) of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine is needed, ProQuad may be used. This dose is usually administered at 4 to 6 years of age. At least one month should elapse between a dose of a measles-containing vaccine, such as M-M-R II. The third dose of MMR might be recommended in [certain mumps](https://www.fda.gov/media/75195/download) outbreak situations. However, at least three months should elapse between a dose of varicella-containing vaccine and ProQuad. Proquad Side effects The following [cautions](https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/p/proquad/proquad_pi_4171.pdf) have been reported ProQuad: fever, injection-site reactions (pain/tenderness/soreness, erythema, and swelling); irritability; and rash on the body or at the injection site. In addition, systemic vaccine-related adverse events reported at a significantly greater rate in recipients of ProQuad than in recipients of the component vaccines administered concomitantly were fever and measles-like rash. Hypersensitivity: ProQuad is contraindicated in patients with a history of [anaphylactic reaction](https://www.merckvaccines.com/proquad/clinical-data/efficacy/) or hypersensitivity to any vaccine component (including gelatin or neomycin) or an initial dose of measles mumps, rubella, or varicella-containing vaccine. Use caution when administering ProQuad to individuals with anaphylaxis or immediate hypersensitivity to eggs.
