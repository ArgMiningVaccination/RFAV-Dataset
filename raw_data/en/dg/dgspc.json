Call Jill Sweet at 413 717 7209 The Southern Berkshire Public Health Collaborative has released their 2023 schedule for vaccine clinics, including 22 clinics in their member towns, starting the second week of September. Updated COVID boosters will be added as they become available at the end of September. This year's vaccine clinic schedule can be found here. FLU: All vaccine clinics will have regular dose flu vaccine, senior dose flu vaccine and a limited supply of egg-free flu vaccine available for those 6 months old or older. Individuals must pre-register to allow for planning of clinic staff levels and vaccine. COVID: The updated COVID booster is expected to be approved by mid to late September. Once it is available, appointments for the Pfizer COVID vaccine for ages 12+ will be added as an option to the registration page for this clinic. Individuals who have already scheduled a flu vaccine can easily add a COVID booster to their existing appointment before or at the clinic. All vaccines are provided at no out of pocket cost to individuals, however we ask that individuals bring their insurance card and COVID card, when applicable, to the clinic. We are asking that you wear a short-sleeved shirt. Pre-registration is required, and walk-ins will only be accepted as time and vaccine supplies allow.
