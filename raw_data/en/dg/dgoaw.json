More patients are looking to their physicians for guidance on how to incorporate acupuncture into their health care, and pain physicians are accepting the challenge. Similar to allopathic medicine, acupuncture is an intricate diagnostic and therapeutic system. However, for practicing physicians, mastery of the skills necessary for safe and effective treatment of many conditions is well within reach. Used in an integrated medical model, acupuncture is well suited to deal with many of the functional problems that allopathic medicine is not equipped to address. The result is patient and physician satisfaction.
