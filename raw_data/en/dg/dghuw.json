Healing Power of Nature: Promote and support patients' innate healing capabilities. Identify and Treat the Cause: Go beyond symptoms to the cause of the illness or disease. Treat the Whole Person: Integrated care respecting physical, mental, and emotional facets. Doctor as Teacher: Education on how to achieve and maintain health and well-being. Prevention: Focus on overall health, wellness, and disease prevention. Naturopathic Doctors Naturopathic doctors have four-year, post-graduate training at accredited, residential naturopathic medical programs. Training consists of two major parts from one of five accredited schools. The first is a comprehensive study of the conventional medical sciences, including anatomy, physiology, microbiology, immunology, pathology, laboratory diagnosis, physical and clinical diagnosis, cardiology, gastroenterology, gynecology, pulmonology, and the like. The second component is an extensive and detailed study of a natural therapies, including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, exercise prescription, hydrotherapy, and health counseling, as well as intramuscular injections and intravenous administration of nutrients. In addition, Naturopathic Doctors are trained in pharmaceutical therapies, which is reinforced by rigorous continuing education requirements to remain updated and current. As such, we are able to integrate and manage treatments when they are necessary and appropriate. However, naturopathic treatments are often effective in treating a wide variety of conditions without the need for additional intervention. Like other primary care providers (PCPs), naturopathic doctors work to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. We are licensed to perform physical exams, order laboratory tests and imaging (xrays, MRIs, mammograms, etc.), as well as draw blood and perform CLIA-waived laboratory testing as needed to determine an accurate diagnoses and monitor treatment responses. With the exception of medical and osteopathic doctors, NDs have a broader scope of practice than any healthcare provider in California. We are fully licensed as independent providers, unlike allied healthcare professionals like nurse practitioners or physician assistants. With that said, naturopathic doctors can function well within an integrated framework when needed, providing naturopathic therapies to complement and support treatments provided by conventionally trained doctors. Whether providing individual or complimentary care, we take a patient-centered approach that provides the most appropriate treatment for an individual's needs.. "}
