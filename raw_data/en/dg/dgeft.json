Other well-known causes are diabetes, valve dysfunction, arrhythmia, pericardial disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy (e.g., idiopathic), infections (e.g., viral, rheumatic fever), toxins, anemia, thyroid disorders, and treatments for cancer such as radiation and chemotherapy. 1, 2 There are two clinical subtypes: heart failure with (a) reduced and (b) preserved ejection fraction, often referred to as systolic and diastolic heart failure, respectively (Figure 1). In systolic heart failure, there is reduced contraction and impaired emptying of the left ventricle which dilates. In diastolic heart failure, the left ventricle fails to relax properly between beats which leads to filling difficulties of the heart. Despite significant differences in etiological features and response to treatment, there is great overlap in signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles) and symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema).1 Fluid retention is also common in heart failure which may cause weight gain, frequent urinating, coughing (particularly when laying down), and / or acute pulmonary edema (i.e. fluid overload in lungs) which requires medical treatment. Main goals of heart failure management include treatment of (the) underlying cause(s), reduction of symptoms, prevention of further disease progression, prolongation of life, and achieving optimum quality of life. 1 Treatment usually involves pharmacological therapy and behavioral modifications, such as fluid- and sodium restriction. Patients are required to adapt a healthy lifestyle that can be achieved by smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, losing weight, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Medical procedures and surgery may be needed, such as the implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to monitor and correct for arrhythmias by using electrical pulses. In severe heart failure, last-resort treatment options are the use of a left ventricular assist device (i.e. a mechanical heart pump) or a heart transplant.1 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 13 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 114 FIGURE 1. The structural abnormalities of the heart in systolic and diastolic heart failure in comparison with a healthy heart. The burden of chronic heart failure Chronic heart failure is associated with poor quality of life which is even more severely impaired in comparison with many other chronic diseases.5, 6 The decline in quality of life is largely due to the progressive and malignant nature of the condition, increased morbidity, frequent hospitalizations, and poor long-term survival. A high proportion of patients with heart failure suffers from other (chronic) comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, anemia, and renal dysfunction. 7, 8 Patients are likely to experience hampering consequences of their condition that are both direct and indirect, such as dyspnea, fatigue, social isolation, living in fear, losing sense of control 9, limitations in daily activities10, and sexual dysfunction11. Moreover, treatment of chronic heart failure requires a vast amount of self- care, which places a great burden on the daily life of patients. Pathways linking psychological factors and outcomes Accordingly, it may not be surprising that psychological distress such as depression is common among patients with heart failure, and has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes.12, 13 Studies have shown that depression is at least as important as cardiac function in determining health-related quality of life.13 Moreover, a recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that major, and not minor depression predicts all-cause mortality in patients with chronic heart failure.14 Examination of potential mechanisms linking psychological distress to poor outcomes in coronary heart disease has been subject of many studies, and can generally be categorized into a pathophysiological (e.g., immune dysfunction / inflammation, autonomic nervous system) and behavioral (e.g., poor self-care, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking) pathway.15 In heart failure, however, less mechanistic research has been performed despite the increased risk for psychological distress, the relatively poor prognosis, the pathophysiological complexity, and considerable amount of self-care required. 10:23General number of studies on self-care in heart failure has increased tremendously over the past few decades. Self-care can be defined as \"the actions by an individual to capture or maintain a desired level of health and well-being\"16 to actively manage symptoms, treatment, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic medical condition.17 It has also been referred to as a naturalistic decision-making process, which suggests that self-care is the result of rational decision-making that underlies the \"choice of positive health care practices and the behaviors used to manage signs and symptoms of the disease\" in the real-world setting. 18 Self-care in heart failure includes the following: medication adherence, following a low sodium diet, limiting fluid intake, regular physical exercise, daily monitoring of weight and other critical symptoms as indicators of acute disease progression. Moreover, patients are required to continuously interact with their health care professionals as the care for heart failure is ongoing.17 There is heterogeneity in the conceptual definition and assessment of heart failure self-care. Some researchers advocate a distinction between self-care maintenance, i.e. actions used to maintain physiological stability including treatment adherence and symptom monitoring, and self-care management, i.e. the decision-making response to heart failure symptoms. 19 While others tend to focus more on most recommended lifestyle and consultation behaviors.17 What determines heart failure self-care? A multitude of factors are known to affect heart failure self-care.18 Studies have repeatedly shown that self-care is suboptimal, in particular for exercise and weight monitoring.20 According to the 2009 Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association, complicating factors of self-care in patients with systolic heart failure are comorbid conditions, depression, anxiety, older age, poor health literacy, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances.21 Other complicating factors are low education and socio-economic status, poor social support and social isolation, poor heart failure and self-care knowledge, polypharmacy, and lack of experience with the disease.22-25 Gender differences in self- care have also been described, but it is unclear whether this is caused by gender or gender-related differences. 26-29 Yet, poor self-care is not merely the result of patient-related factors. Problems within the health care system also contribute to the level of self-care including variations between health care professionals in their perception of and attention given to self-care education30, treatment of heart failure as an isolated condition while many patients suffer from multiple conditions, and poor communication (between providers).21 Critically, systematic evidence on determinants of self-care is not as straightforward as perhaps assumed. A systematic review on determinants of self-care in heart failure found little evidence for any of the aforementioned factors. 31 In this review, only determinants of self-care included length of time since diagnosis, perceived benefits and barriers for self-care and Type D personality with respect to consulting behavior, but a clear explanation for the absence of evidence was not provided. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 15 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 116Psychological and other risk factors of self-care The adverse relationship between psychological distress and health outcomes in chronic heart failure has been subject of numerous studies in recent decades. Prior research has primarily focused on negative mood states, of which depression and Type D personality are two well-studied psychological risk factors. 32 Type D personality can be defined as the combination of having an increased tendency to experience negative emotions while being socially inhibited, thus not able to express these emotions in an adequate manner in social interaction. 33 Depression and Type D are important predictors of poor health related quality of life in chronic heart failure, but evidence remains inconsistent for their adverse effects on heart failure prognosis. Identification of shared and distinct pathophysiological and behavioral pathways linking both psychological factors to disease progression may provide guidance for clinicians in optimizing clinical care. Adequate psychological resources seem essential to provide patients with the necessary motivation and energy to effectively engage in self-care. Fatigue, however, may hinder patients from successful behavioral change or in being able to sustain in daily self-care activities. Fatigue is a complex phenomenon and one of the most prevalent symptoms in heart failure that has been associated with depression, decreased exercise capacity, dyspnea, poor performance of daily activities, 10 and poor quality of life.34-37 Yet, no studies have examined its relation with self-care, while, given these relations, one can imagine that it may exert negative effects on self-care. Positive psychological factors and self-care At large, there is a dearth of evidence on cardiovascular health effects of positive psychological factors. In terms of self-care, research suggests that self-care confidence or self-efficacy and perceived control facilitate self-care. 26 However, little is known on the role of positive affective factors despite the growing evidence that positive affect is not simply the opposite of negative affect as both states can be experienced simultaneously. 38, 39 Accumulating empirical evidence shows that positive affect and well-being is associated with improved (cardiovascular) health40-44 and pathophysiological function such as reduced inflammation.41, 45 Moreover, positive affect has been associated with enhanced physical activity,41 which hints toward a potential, but so far neglected role in self-care. The prognostic value of heart failure self-care As self-care is primarily targeted at reducing heart failure symptoms to improve the physical condition of patients, one might expect that it would benefit health outcomes by improving quality of life and pathophysiologic function and decreasing risk for hospitalizations and mortality. The available evidence, however, is rather inconsistent which seems largely but not entirely attributable to methodological weaknesses and heterogeneity within the research field. 46 Regarding quality of life, findings from observational studies have yielded inconsistent results with studies reporting a positive47-49 or no relation50-52 with self-care. Similarly, a review on the effects of self- care interventions failed to provide positive effects on quality of life so far.46, 53, 54 As for pathophysiologic 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 16 05-01-16 10:23General introduction17 1function, it has been proposed that self-care is likely to benefit outcomes via neurohumoral and inflammatory function.55 To date, only one cross-sectional study has been published exploring these relations in which only self-care management, and not self-care maintenance, was related to reduced levels of myocardial stress and inflammation. 56 Replication and extension of these findings is needed in a larger and prospective study. Results from prior studies support a beneficial relationship between self-care and event-free survival, but this seems highly attributable to fewer hospitalizations and not decreased mortality per se. 57, 58 Same patterns have been found for effects of heart failure targeted disease management programs, i.e. they are shown effective to decrease hospital readmission, but not in mortality rates.59 One study did show that poor weight monitoring was associated with increased mortality but no support was found for the remaining elements of self-care. 60 Other studies that focused on distinct heart failure self-care behaviors showed that medication non-adherence was associated with increased risk for adverse cardiac events 61 while low sodium intake was associated with increased event free survival (i.e. hospitalization or death).62 However, methodological limitations (e.g., short period of follow-up or small samples) may contribute to the lack of evidence in terms of mortality. Clearly, a closer examination of its prognostic value in terms of long-term mortality in a large cohort seems warranted. AIMS AND OUTLINE OF DISSERTATION The first aim of this dissertation is to study the complexity of psychological factors in their associations with self-care among patients with chronic heart failure. The second aim is to examine how self-care is related to health related quality of life, pathophysiologic function, and mortality as important outcomes. In our empirical studies, self-care was assessed with the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale, which is a 9-item, well-validated and widely-used instrument that assesses most important self- care behaviors. 17, 63, 64 These include limiting fluids, daily weight monitoring, medication adherence, following a low sodium diet, regular exercise, and consultation behavior in case of worsening of heart failure signs and symptoms. An overview of chapters is graphically presented in Figure 2. Part 1 Determinants of heart failure self-care: in search of evidence Given their inconsistent prognostic value in chronic heart failure, a close examination is presented on the current evidence of the association of depression and Type D personality and their association with medical and patient-related outcomes in chapter 2. This includes a detailed discussion of common and distinct relations with pathophysiological processes as well as self-care as potential underlying mechanisms of disease. In chapter 3, it is prospectively examined whether fatigue is associated with HF self-care. The impact of poor sleep 65, 66 and psychological distress66-69 are taken into account while examining these relationships. Given the focus of prior studies on negative mood states, the associations of positive affect as well as anhedonia (i.e. \"a diminished interest in or pleasure 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 17 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 118in response to stimuli that were previously experienced as rewarding\"70) with self-care are examined in chapter 4. Several affect measures were used since there is no gold standard for measuring positive affect. Similar to fatigue, it is examined how heart failure disease severity, depressive symptoms, or other explaining factors contribute to these associations. Finally, a fully comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis is presented in chapter 5 on the current evidence of psychological factors as determinants of heart failure self-care including medication adherence. Part II The complexity of heart failure self-care and outcomes Chapter 6 assesses the longitudinal association of (changes within) self-care and patient reported outcomes while accounting for the role of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and Type D personality). As for pathophysiological function, a prospective examination is provided in chapter 7 on the associations of heart failure self-care with serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 as markers of inflammation, estimated glomerular filtration rate of creatinine and hemoglobin as markers of renal and hematological function. Finally, chapter 8 examines the association of self-care with long-term all-cause mortality. Post-hoc analyses are performed to examine the association of each separate element of self-care with mortality. To conclude this dissertation, a summary of the main findings will be presented in a comprehensive discussion in chapter 9. Moreover, directions for future research and implications for clinical practice will be provided.

Jos Widdershoven Dionne Kessing Ang\u00e9lique Schiffer 2 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 25 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 226ABSTRACT This review aimed to summarize the current evidence for the association of depression and Type D personality with clinical and patient-centered outcomes and self-care in chronic heart failure (HF) patients. Emotional distress is highly prevalent in chronic HF patients. In contrast to results in coronary artery disease, there is inconsistent evidence for the adverse effects of depression and Type D on hard medical outcomes. Type D and depression are important predictors of impaired health status in chronic HF, and patients characterized by depression or Type D report reduced self-care. Pathophysiological processes associated with depression and Type D are discussed, as they may contribute to disease progression. Future research should take assessment issues with depression and Type D into account and should focus on the network of psychophysiological and behavioral factors to elucidate their precise role in chronic HF patients with depression or Type D. Clinicians should address the observed differences in self-care behaviors to improve health in chronic HF patients with depression or Type D personality. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 26 10:23Depression , 2INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability in the world, with almost 23.6 million people dying from CVDs worldwide by 2030.1 The clinical syndrome of chronic heart failure (HF) is the most symptomatic expression of CVD. HF is caused by an underlying cardiac defect in, usually, elderly patients frequently treated for other medical problems. HF patients often suffer from multiple somatic comorbidities, not only related to the cause of chronic HF (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and age but also to its consequences (e.g., arrhythmias, renal disease) and treatment.2 Furthermore, emotional distress is highly prevalent in chronic HF patients. The interrelationship between psychological factors and adverse health outcomes, as well as mechanisms explaining these relations, has been subject of numerous studies. In this context, depression and Type D personality are two often-studied psychological risk factors (Table 1). TABLE 1. Depression and Type D personality Negative emotions Social inhibition Duration Depression Depressed affect in general Not specified <2 years; episodic Type D Negative affect in general Elevated levels (non-expression) >2 years; chronic Depression Definition: a state primarily characterized by persistent low mood and loss of interest and a range of associated emotional, cognitive, physical, and behavioral symptoms. Clinically important episodes of depression that at least exist for two weeks are called major depressive episodes.Examples of symptoms: persistent sadness, fatigue, sleeping problems, feelings of hopelessness Type D personality Definition: the tendency to experience a variety of negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, fear, across time and situations (i.e., the personality trait negative affectivity), together with the tendency not to share these emotions in social interactions, because of fear of rejection or disapproval (i.e., the personality trait social inhibition). 3 Examples of symptoms: frequent worrying, scanning the world for danger, insecure when with others Comparison of depression and Type D personality It has been proposed that depression and Type D are equivalent. 4 However, clear conceptual differences exist. While depression is episodic in nature, Type D personality is a trait characteristic that is stable over long periods of time,5 and is predictive of episodic stress such as depressive episodes.6 Moreover, studies that have examined both together report only a small overlap in patients that are depressed vs. patients having Type D personality.7 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 27 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 228Up to 40% of HF patients experiences clinical levels of depression.8 Depression is more prevalent in HF patients than in healthy elderly and HF patients have a greater risk of developing new onset depression.9 Type D prevalence in HF may be up to 31%.10 Research suggests that health-related behaviors, such as treatment adherence and lifestyle factors, may be associated with emotional distress and may be important for maintaining health in HF. Moreover, there are pathophysiological communalities between HF and respectively depression and Type D, which might be involved in exacerbating disease progression in HF patients with emotional distress as compared to non- distressed HF patients. The aim of this review is to describe the up-to-date evidence of the association of depression and Type D personality with medical and patient-related outcomes, as well as self-care in chronic HF patients. Moreover, existing evidence on shared pathophysiological processes and assessment issues in chronic HF patients are reviewed. OUTCOMES Mortality and readmission Depression - A 2006 meta-analysis reported that chronic HF patients with depressive symptoms or a clinical depression had >2-fold increased risk of death and associated clinical events. However, included studies were heterogeneous with respect to characteristics of study population, depression assessment, and follow-up duration. 11 Since then, several studies have been published that examined the depression-mortality association in HF but found less impressive or no significant hazard ratios (HR) at all. For instance, clinically significant symptoms of depression were associated with an increased HR of 1.56 for death or cardiovascular hospitalization.8 In a prospective study of 1,006 HF patients with a 2.7 year mean follow-up, depression was independently associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.3).12 In another large study in elderly HF patients, patients treated with antidepressants had increased all-cause mortality rates (HR = 1.2) at 1-year follow-up, while readmissions for HF were not increased. 13 Most recently, it was demonstrated that depression was significantly associated with diminished survival in a sample of 985 HF patients over a median 4.4 year follow-up (HR = 1.4).14 The aspect of timing of depressive symptoms has been addressed by showing that HF patients with recently developed depressive symptoms showed a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and patients developing depressive symptoms after re-hospitalization were at higher risk of all-cause mortality three years later. 15 Null-findings have been reported as well, as several studies reported no effect of depression on mortality in HF patients.4, 16, 17 Thus, earlier data indicating a greater than two-fold risk of death in depressed HF patients are not supported by more recent studies. Larger studies, preferably with long follow-up duration, that take complicating factors with respect to depression assessment and HF treatment into account are warranted, to explore the true impact of depression on readmissions and mortality in HF patients. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 2Type D - A recent meta-analysis on Type D and hard medical outcomes reported that, in contrary to coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no evidence for an association between Type D personality and mortality in HF.18 One study reporting a positive association between Type D and mortality was not included in this meta-analysis, possibly due to the specific subsample of HF patients, i.e. HF patients who underwent cardiac transplantation in which Type D was associated with early allograft rejection and increased mortality. 19 It should be noted that the studies reporting no association between Type D and mortality, also report the same null-finding for depression. Explaining heterogeneity and null-findings - With evidence for a mortality link with psychological risk factors being mixed at best, it is important to identify sources of heterogeneity, so that more definite conclusions may be drawn. Differences in HRs between studies may be related to major differences in included patient groups with respect to diagnosis, prevalence of depression and Type D, time-course of depression, and follow-up duration. A source of noise includes the assessment of depression and Type D. Regarding depression, future studies may want to take symptom profiles and dimensions, persistence of depression, confounding with somatic symptoms, and timing in relation to index cardiac event into account. With respect to Type D, there is discussion about the combination of two stable traits into one risk factor, and the use of a dichotomized score to classify persons as having Type D. Another vital aspect concerns the multifactorial nature of HF, and we should question whether psychological risk factors in this end stage of cardiovascular disease play a minor role due to the complexity of multisystem failure and the lower prevalence of cardiac deaths in HF patients. A recent very large clinical trial in 6975 patients revealed that in addition to NYHA functional class, older age and renal dysfunction were the most powerful predictors of mortality in HF patients. 20 Another factor in explaining heterogeneity and decreasing effect sizes is that cardiologic treatment has improved over time. Nowadays, patients with myocardial infarction (MI) are treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention with a subsequent focus on complete revascularization, drug treatment has been intensified and formalized, and the use of device therapies for HF has become standard practice. All these therapeutic changes may have resulted in differences in characteristics and outcomes of HF patient populations over time. Selection bias may also play a role, since the increased mortality risk in CAD may result in fewer CAD survivors with depression or Type D. Future studies may want to take these factors into account. Patient-centered outcomes The assessment of outcomes such as quality of life (QOL) or health status (HS) is a key component of patient-centered care. 21 Improvements in medical treatment may lead to an extension of HF patients' life, but QOL in HF is more impaired than in the general population.22 Furthermore, impaired QOL/ health status has negative prognostic value for HF progression.23 However, comparison between studies is difficult, as agreement on the exact definition of QOL is lacking. The concepts QOL and health status are used synonymously, and many instruments used in studies do not measure the 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 29 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 230essence of QOL, but are actually measuring health status.24 The World Health Organization defines QOL as follows: \"individuals' perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" .25 Since most studies discussed below do not use this definition when referring to QOL, we decided to use the term health status in describing the results of these studies. Depression - One study has shown that treating depressive symptoms with Paroxetine resulted in significant decreases in depression in HF patients, and these reductions significantly correlated with improvements in generic mental, but not with physical health status. 26 Others, however, reported the negative impact of depression on physical health status, also when using measures for depression that do not contain somatic items to prevent overlap in depression measures and measures of physical health status in HF. 27 Several studies have indicated that health status may depend more on the presence of depression than on (somatic measures of ) disease severity.e.g., 28 However, the high prevalence of depression in HF seems closely linked to various somatic features of the disease.29 Furthermore, a dose-relationship between physical symptoms of HF and depression with health status has been reported.30 Depression and health status in HF are associated but their interrelationship and associations with (indicators of ) disease-severity seem to be complex. Until now, studies do not provide a clear, consistent understanding of these relationships. Type D - Only few studies focused exclusively on the associations between Type D and HS in HF. 31 A prospective study on the effect of Type D on a broad health status measure in HF patients found Type D to predict disease-specific mental health status, sub-domains of generic health status, and general health at 12-month follow-up.32 The association between Type D and mental health status was confirmed in a study of 251 HF patients, with Type D as an independent determinant of mental, but not of physical health status at 9 months.33 Another study showed that Type D and non-Type D anhedonic HF patients, as compared to non-anhedonic non-Type D patients, reported lower levels of general mental, but not of physical health status at 12-month follow-up. 34 In conclusion, results suggest that Type D is an important independent predictor of impaired health status in HF, but that relationships are mainly restricted to the mental/emotional domains of health status. MAINTAINING HEALTH THROUGH SELF-CARE Maintaining health in chronic diseases, which is broader than mortality and morbidity, is achieved by managing self-care and lifestyle behaviors. How well patients adapt these behaviors may be affected by their psychological functioning.35 Effective HF self-care, healthy lifestyle behavior, and medication adherence have been associated with enhanced medical and patient-centered outcomes in HF.36-38 There are several factors associated with effective HF self-care behaviors and self-care confidence, such as self-efficacy 39, social support,e.g., 40 and coping41, that may be affected by depressed mood or Type D personality and have shown to be related to medical and patient-centered outcomes. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 30 2Self-care Depression - Depression in HF has been associated with poor self-care behaviors,35 non-completion of cardiac rehabilitation,42 a longer delay between worsening of HF symptoms and contacting a medical professional,43 and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as physical inactivity and smoking.44 Notably, in one study, minor depression but not major depression was associated with poor HF self-care, with the underlying mechanism remaining unclear.45 In some studies, no relationship between depression and self-care has been found,e.g., 46, 47, 48 potentially due to methodological reasons related to sample size or social desirability bias (as self-care is often assessed by means of self-report). In HF, depression has also been associated with self-reported medication non-adherence, e.g., 49 but the association between depression and objectively measured non-adherence is inconsistent. Some studies have found no association49, 50, while others have shown a relationship between depression and objectively measured medication non-adherence,13, 51 without a clear explanation for these differences. While it seems likely that poor medication adherence plays a role in the interaction between depression and HF, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Future prospective research may benefit from the use of objective self-care measures; for instance, objectively measured, but not self-reported medication adherence is associated with improved clinical outcomes in HF.52 Type D - To date, two prospective studies have investigated the link between Type D and HF self-care, and have shown Type D to be associated with poor consultation behavior,53, 54 despite an increased perception of cardiac symptoms and more worrying about health.53 Perhaps the social inhibition component of Type D may drive the decreased tendency to contact a medical professional once symptoms worsen. While no studies have examined the relationship between Type D and other relevant self-care behaviors, lifestyle factors or medication adherence, an association with poor treatment compliance has been observed in a study among patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.55 Moreover, Type D has been associated with a higher display of unhealthy behaviors (i.e. smoking, less physical exercise, and poorer dietary habits) in both healthy participants and cardiac patients,56-58 as well as with medication non-adherence in patients with acute coronary syndrome59 and post-MI patients.60 Self-efficacy, coping, and social support as mediators of effective self-care Depression - Depressed HF patients tend to have more maladaptive coping styles, such as denial and behavioral disengagement.e.g., 61, 62 In a study among 254 HF patients, the relationship between poor social support, depression, and treatment non-adherence was shown to be fully mediated by self-efficacy.63 Depressive symptoms and poor social support appeared to have a synergistic negative effect on event-free survival in 220 HF patients,64 although another study (n = 84) failed to find such a relationship.65 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 31 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 232Type D - While there is a lack of evidence for the HF population, Type D has been associated with maladaptive coping and lower self-efficacy among CVD patients, mediating the relationships between Type D and worse perceived health66 and medication non-adherence.59 In non-cardiac populations, avoidant and passive coping and poor social support have been reported as mediators of the relationship between Type D and physical symptoms. e.g., 67 In conclusion, the evidence for a behavioral pathway through which both psychological risk factors are supposed to link with poor health can be considered rather moderate, since findings reviewed here are mixed and studies on Type D in HF populations are lacking. Future studies are encouraged to examine the association of Type D personality with behavioral mechanisms in HF. One major limitation when examining relevant health behaviors is that mostly self-report measures are used. We recommend future research to use both objective and self-report measurement methods. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES In CVD, shared pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified that may explain the relation of depression and Type D with disease progression. 68 In HF patients, less mechanistic research has been performed. Identifying shared pathophysiological pathways in HF is important, because this provides guidance for clinicians by showing through which pathophysiological pathways psychological risk factors exacerbate disease progression. Autonomic nervous system dysregulation Depression - HF patients are characterized by alterations in autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, reflected in increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiac drive. Such an imbalance in the ANS is also observed in depression 69. Sympathetic dominance increases the risk of cardiac fibrillation, arrhythmias and sudden death70. One of the methods for assessing autonomic cardiac regulation is by assessing heart rate variability (HRV). One study in HF patients reported smaller Low Frequency-HRV values with increasing clinical depression scores, 71 while another study in ICD patients with impaired pump function reported depression to be related to decreased parasympathetic control. 72 This is congruent with most73 but not all studies in CAD patients. e.g., 74 Type D - Type D has been related to ANS dysregulation in both healthy75 and patient populations. In HF, Type D patients may have a maladaptive, blunted heart rate response to mental stress,76 and a reduced heart rate recovery after exercise.77 In ICD patients with an impaired pump function, Type D was associated with an overall lower autonomic cardiac control,72 and an increased risk of sympathetic nervous system-mediated cardiac arrhythmias in those patients who were also anxious.78 outcomes33 2Inflammation Depression - Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the etiology of CVD, and in HF it is associated with impaired cardiac contractility.79 There is evidence for increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers associated with depression in HF. Apart from one smaller study,80 cross-sectional and prospective studies suggested the involvement of the Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)- system.e.g., 81 With respect to other markers of inflammation, evidence is mixed. One prospective study (n = 517) suggested C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 to be elevated in depressed HF patients,82 but in another prospective study, the association with hsCRP was not significant.81 Type D - Cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown that Type D is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers, especially sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in patients with HF.e.g., 83 One recent mediation analysis showed that inflammatory biomarkers mediated a small part of the association between Type D and the change in self-reported physical HS over 1.5 years.84 Endothelial function Depression - The endothelium has an important role in tissue perfusion and may therefore be an important prognostic marker in HF.85 In healthy individuals86 and CAD patients,87 endothelial dysfunction seems to be impaired in individuals with depression. No studies examining this association have been performed in HF patients. Type D - With respect to Type D, one study in HF patients has examined the relationship with endothelial progenitor cells playing an important role in endothelial preservation. Findings showed that circulating endothelial progenitor cells were reduced in Type D HF patients.88 In the general population, no Type D associated differences in endothelial function were found.89 Neurohumoral mechanisms and anemia Depression - Neurohumoral processes, especially involving the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), are important in the etiology and progression of HF. Moreover, high levels of cortisol have been shown to increase the mortality risk in HF90 and depressed men with hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity have an increased risk of cardiac mortality.91 Depression and chronic stress may be associated with activation of the RAAS.e.g., 92 Interestingly, aldosterone seems to be mostly increased in patients with atypical depression characteristics.92 To date, RAAS and aldosterone function have not been examined as a mechanism of depression in HF yet. However, a large proportion of HF patients is treated with RAAS medication. The RAAS is closely related to renal function. In a large German study, major depression was not associated with renal dysfunction in HF. Unexpectedly, hemoglobin was associated with a decreased prevalence of major depression in this sample. 29 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 33 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 234With respect to cortisol, Studies in CAD patients flatter cortisol rhythm curves93 and higher 24-hour cortisol output94 in association with depression, but unaltered levels were reported as well.95 One reason for these inconsistent results may be related to depression profiles, as they relate differently to HPA axis function.96 In HF, depression has not been related to cortisol levels yet. Type D - It is known that renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity in HF patients and that a vicious circle exists between renal functioning, cardiac functioning, and anemia. In a recent study in HF patients, Type D was prospectively associated with reduced hemoglobin levels, and this effect was mediated by deterioration of renal function. Anxious depression was unrelated to anaemia.97 With respect to HPA axis function, no study has examined the relation between Type D and HPA axis function in HF patients. Based on studies in patients with ACS, it may be hypothesized that the HPA axis is overactive in Type D HF patients as well, since ACS patients with Type D demonstrated an elevated daytime cortisol output. e.g., 95 Oxidative stress Depression - One study assessed Xanthine oxidase (XO), which affects contractile function and myocyte hypertrophy in HF, and Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, playing a role in myocyte protection, in a sample of 110 HF patients. Results showed that depression was unrelated to these markers.98 A recent study, using a marker of lipid peroxidation, showed that it was elevated in clinically depressed HF patients.99 The inconsistent findings with respect to oxidative stress in relation to depression in HF patients may be due to differences in markers used, as they reflect different bodily processes and pathophysiological pathways. Type D personality - In one study of 110 HF patients, Type D was associated with an increased oxidative stress burden, apparent in the decreased antioxidant levels and an increased oxidative stress ratio.98 Studies that examine a wider range of markers, including markers of lipid peroxidation to see whether the same variability in results seen for depression is present for Type D as well, and to investigate whether we can define pathways that are specific to either Type D or depression, are recommended. In conclusion, there is some evidence to suggest that depression and Type D are associated with sympathetic dominance, increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. Some markers seem to be associated with Type D only, such as renal dysfunction. For other pathophysiological processes, such as HPA axis and endothelial function, only hypotheses can be formulated based on findings in CAD patients. Patients could benefit from future studies that examine the association between psychological risk factors and pathophysiological processes in HF more extensively, with the aim to replicate and increase our knowledge on the physiological effects of depression and Type D. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 34 , Type D , and HF 2NETWORK OF EFFECTS With respect to behavioral and pathophysiological mechanisms, a great deal of work still needs to be done. For Type D, much of the evidence suggesting a behavioral link with poor outcomes has been conducted in other populations than HF and therefore, future prospective studies are needed to study these mechanisms in HF. Figures I displays the behavioral and pathophysiological relations found in HF (indicated by bold lines) and other populations (dashed lines) for both depression and Type D. Most mechanistic studies have been performed in CAD patients, and it is not certain that these mechanisms can be extrapolated to HF, because about half of the HF patients have a non- ischemic etiology. Not all mechanisms are shared between depression and Type D, suggesting that part of their adverse effect on health may be going through different pathways. Health behaviors may be associated with pathophysiological processes since the association of depression with cytokines and acute phase proteins may be mediated by health behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and body mass index (BMI). 81 On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that depressed mood is a reflection of sickness behavior induced by chronic inflammation.100 Depr ession Type D Disease progression ANS Type Patient c entred outcomes Medi cal outcomes Poor consultatio n beha vior / del ay Low behavioral (A) and pathophysiological (B) relations found in HF and other populations for both depression and Type D.

Moreover, it is important that research considers a more comprehensive multisystem multi marker approach. Stress mediators (i.e. HPA axis and norepinephrine) that are affected in depression and Type D have a pervasive influence on many aspects of bodily functioning. Chronic cortisol exposure affects erythropoietin mRNA expression in the kidneys,101 and may increase the risk of anemia. Moreover, cortisol and sympathetic activation regulate the immune system.102 The parasympathetic nervous system is involved in immune regulation, i.e. in immune to brain communication.103 There is overlap in mechanisms, but unique behavioral and pathophysiological pathways have also been identified. Research is needed to examine whether a cluster of psychological constructs can be viewed as one overarching risk factor, or whether psychological factors have unique influences on behavioral and biological pathways, and therefore could be best evaluated individually. Moreover, behavioral and pathophysiological processes are intrinsically intertwined, and future research is recommended to examine these moderating and mediating effects more intensely. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS The potential mechanisms that have been summarized in the current review provide guidance to possible intervention and treatment programs that may be tailored to the needs of the HF patient with depression or Type D personality. There are important differences in self-care, health behaviors, and shared pathophysiological pathways that could be addressed by clinicians. While behavioral and pathophysiological interventions could be developed to modify the pathways shared by depression and HF, clinicians should treat their depressed patients according to the existing guidelines for depression, irrespective of their heart condition. Until now, there have been two small (n = 34 and n = 146) intervention studies that have examined the effect of stress reduction, either enhancing coping with stress or mindfulness-based stress reduction, on Type D characteristics. Both studies showed reductions for the continuous subscale scores as a result of the intervention. 104, 105 No intervention has targeted Type D personality specifically, and we can only speculate about interventions that may be beneficial. In our opinion, interventions aimed at reducing the negative effects of Type D personality could be concentrated on improvement of self-management and self-care abilities and coping. Furthermore, stimulating and helping the Type D patients with the broadening and consolidation of a social network may be important, as a supportive network may be of great value for these patients, who tend to perceive others and the world as threatening. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 36 05-01-16 10:23Depression , Type D , and 2CONCLUSION In contrast to the effect in CAD patients, depression imposes only a small increased risk of adverse outcome in terms of mortality and/or readmissions on HF patients, while Type D personality seems to have no effect on prognosis in the context of HF. Also, a decline in effect was observed with more recent studies showing weaker associations of depression and Type D with hard medical outcomes. Of importance, there is vast heterogeneity between studied patient populations, with different diagnostic tools and follow-up duration. With respect to patient-centered outcomes, there is a clear relationship between depression and poor health status and between Type D personality and poor mental health status. Both psychological risk factors seem to be associated with poor self-care and health behaviors, potentially mediated via inadequate coping, poor social support, and lower self- efficacy. With respect to psychophysiological processes, evidence suggests the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system, inflammation and oxidative stress for both depression and Type D in HF patients. Much more research needs to be done to replicate and extend current knowledge. It is advised to develop intervention studies to target unfavorable health behaviors and inadequate coping strategies, with the ultimate goal to improve overall health status and the course of the disease trajectory for HF patients. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 37 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 238REFERENCES 1.

Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine whether general and exertion fatigue are distinctively associated with self-care in patients with chronic HF. Methods: In total, 545 outpatients with chronic HF (mean age = 66.2 years; 75% male) completed measures of general fatigue (i.e. a sustained sense of exhaustion including mental efforts), exertion fatigue (i.e. fatigue directly related to physical activity), sleep problems, mood symptoms, and HF self- care behavior at baseline, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Results: Linear mixed modeling results showed that general and exertion fatigue were significantly associated with poor HF self-care (estimate = .10, p = .004; estimate = .06, p = .01, respectively) and poor consulting behavior (estimate = .05, p = .04; estimate = .04, p = .007, respectively) over time, independent of sleep and mood problems, and other clinical covariates. Exertion fatigue was associated with supplementary determinants. Conclusion: This is the first prospective study demonstrating that general and exertion fatigue were both associated with poor HF self-care, which could not be explained by sleep problems or mood symptoms, and was independent of clinical indicators of disease severity. Treatment of fatigue problems may improve HF self-care skills and ultimately quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes. Further research is needed to examine this potential causal relationship. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 44 05-01-16 10:23Fatigue and heart failure self-care45 3INTRODUCTION Fatigue is highly prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure (HF)1, 2 and associated with increased re-hospitalization2 and mortality.3 Fatigue can be explained as a direct consequence of cardiac disorder,4 but also by other clinical factors such as aging,1 anemia,5 poor sleep quality,6, 7 and psychosocial distress.1, 7, 8 In chronic HF, fatigue not only affects quality of life4, 9-11 and the performance of daily activities,12 but may also impede a patient's ability to adhere to HF self-care13 and lifestyle recommendations to maintain good health.14 Related to fatigue, poor sleep has been related to impaired HF self-care through the effects of cognitive impairment.15 As fatigue has been associated with poor sleep,13, 15 it may exert similar effects on self-care. Finally, fatigue has been associated with depressive symptoms, decreased exercise capacity, and dyspnea7; all factors assumed to complicate self-care.16 Regarding predictors of fatigue in HF patients, exertion fatigue (i.e. fatigue related to physical activity) was primarily predicted by physical characteristics, while general fatigue (i.e. a sustained sense of (mental) exhaustion) was predicted by physical and psychological characteristics.7 General and exertion fatigue reflect qualitatively different manifestations of fatigue7 and are differentially related to HF prognosis17 and, thus, may be hypothesized to be differentially associated with self-care. Therefore, we examined fatigue and self-care in patients with chronic HF. Our main objective was to prospectively examine whether general and exertion fatigue were differentially associated with HF self-care at inclusion, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. We also examined whether poor sleep,6, 18 anxiety/ depression,7, 8, 18, 19 or other clinical covariates did explain potential relationships between fatigue and self-care. METHODS Patients and procedure Outpatients with chronic HF were consecutively recruited between 2003 and 2008 from four Dutch hospitals (Amphia Hospital, Breda; St. Elisabeth Hospital, Tilburg; TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg; Zorgsaam Hospital, Terneuzen). Inclusion criteria were HF diagnosis with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40%, age 80 years, and being stable on HF medication. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission one month prior to inclusion, other life-threatening conditions, psychiatric comorbidity except for mood disorders, severe cognitive impairment, or insufficient Dutch linguistic competence. This is a secondary analysis of prospective data from two separate studies. e.g., 20, 21 Eligible patients were approached for participation by their cardiologist or heart failure nurse during an outpatient clinic visit. If willing to participate, patients were called by an independent investigator to schedule a baseline study appointment in which patients were given additional information about the study and signed informed consent. At baseline, 12-, and 18-month follow-up, participants completed questionnaires at home to assess psychosocial and HF self-care that 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 45 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 346were returned by mail. Patients were contacted when either a questionnaire was not returned within two weeks or in the event of missing items. Data originated from two observational prospective studies for which ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees of all hospitals. The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013).22 Fatigue At baseline, 12- and 18-month follow-up, general and exertion fatigue were assessed with the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) 23 and the Dutch Exertion Fatigue Scale (DEFS),24 respectively. The FAS contains 10 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (range from 1 = \"never\" to 5 = \"always\"); examples of items are: 'I get tired very quickly', ' I am bothered by fatigue', and 'Mentally, I feel exhausted'. The DEFS contains nine items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (range from 0 = \"no\" to 4 = \"yes\"); e.g., 'Is it fatiguing for you to walk for 30 minutes / to go upstairs and downstairs?' . Higher scores reflect higher levels of fatigue in both scales. In the present study, Cronbach's were .88 and .93, respectively, indicating good internal consistency. Self-care HF self-care was assessed at all measurement occasions using the 9-item version of the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScB-9).14, 25 Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\"I completely agree\") to 5 (\"I do not agree at all\"). Higher scores reflect poor performance of HF self-care behaviors. The EHFScB-9 comprises a 4-item 'consulting behavior' sub-dimension20, 26 (I contact my doctor or nurse if (i) shortness of breath increases, (ii) my legs/feet are more swollen, (iii) I gain weight, and (iv) I experience fatigue). Cronbach's were .80 and .86 for total self-care and the consulting behavior subscale, respectively, indicating good internal consistency in the current dataset. Demographic and clinical characteristics Socio-demographic variables were assessed at baseline using purpose-designed items including educational level (primary school or less vs. >8 years of education), current smoking status, marital status (alone vs. having a partner), and employment status (yes/no). From patients' medical records, information was obtained on age, gender, disease characteristics (i.e. etiology, LVEF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I-II vs. III-IV), cardiac history (i.e. previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), and pharmaceutical treatment (e.g., beta- heart failure self-care47 3Sleep and mood problems At all time points, sleep problems were measured using three items from the sleep problem subscale of the Health Complaints Scale (HCS)27 which includes: (i) sleep that is restless and disturbed, (ii) trouble falling asleep, and (iii) feeling you can't sleep. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (range from 0 = \"not at all\" to 4 = \"extremely\"), and this scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's = .88) in this study. Symptoms of anxiety/depression were assessed with the 4-item Symptoms of Anxiety-Depression index (SAD4) that has been shown to detect an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorder in cardiac patients.28 SAD4 contains two anxiety (i.e. tension and restlessness) and two depression (i.e. feeling blue and hopelessness) items. Items were answered on a 5-point Likert scale (range from 0 = \"not at all\" to 4 = \"very much\"), and the internal consistency was high in this study (Cronbach's = .90). Statistical analyses Baseline differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables were examined using 2 tests (Fisher's exact test when appropriate) for nominal variables and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables between responders vs. non-responders and to examine the relationships of categorical baseline characteristics with general and exertion fatigue. Pearson correlations were calculated to explore the strength and direction of the relationships of sleep problems, symptoms of anxiety- depression, and self-care with general and exertion fatigue at baseline. To assess the unique longitudinal relationship of general fatigue and exertion fatigue with total self-care and consulting behavior, a sub-dimension of self-care, four separate generalized linear mixed modeling analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood estimation and an unstructured covariance matrix with a two-level structure (i.e. repeated measurement occasions (lower level), participant (higher level)). 29 General and exertion fatigue were not examined simultaneously due to multicollinearity. In step one, general fatigue was examined as a time-varying independent, continuous predictor of total self-care (i.e. all self-care behaviors including consulting behavior) at baseline, 12-, and 18-month follow-up (Model 1). Hence, the linear mixed modeling results represent the association between general fatigue and total self-care across all time points. It was examined whether self-care scores changed significantly over time and whether there was a fatigue by time interaction effect. In step two, additional baseline covariates (i.e. not varying over time) were added (Model 2). A priori selected covariates expected to influence fatigue and self-care were: age, 1, gender,30 NYHA functional class III-IV, LVEF, diabetes mellitus, COPD, kidney disease, partner and employment status, low educational level, and body mass index (BMI). 6, 16 In step three, we controlled for the potential influence of sleep and mood problems using continuous scores (Model 3). This stepwise procedure was repeated to examine the associations between exertion fatigue and self-care, and lastly, between both fatigue constructs and consulting behavior (i.e. a subscale of the total self-care scale). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 47 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 348 Mixed modeling results were presented through estimates (E; i.e. regression coefficients of the dependent variable when the independent variable increases with one unit) with t- and p-values and 95% confidence intervals. It was explored whether the addition of variables in each step contributed significantly to explaining total self-care and consulting behavior using model fit statistics (2 and -2 Log Likelihood (-2LL)). In addition, we examined whether participants with complete data at follow-up vs. participants with data at one or two time points differed with regard to any of the predictors that were examined in the generalized linear mixed models. A p-value < .05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 19 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp USA). RESULTS Sample characteristics Our final sample comprised 545 chronic HF outpatients (mean age = 66.2 \u00b1 9.6 years, 74.9% men) with a response rate of 77% (N = 545/711). Reasons for exclusion were: not eligible (N = 1), refusal (N = 123), death (N = 3), not returning questionnaire (N = 21), missing data (N = 16), and other reasons (N = 2). Baseline sample characteristics and their associations with general and exertion fatigue are presented in Table 1. Compared with responders, non-responders were older (t = 2.80, p = .005) and more likely to have a better LVEF (t = 2.34, p = .02). The completion rate at follow-up was 80% (N = 436) and 93% (N = 409) at 12- and 18-months, respectively, of which a subsample (N = 201) provided self-care data at 18-month follow-up due to differences in study design between the two projects. Generalized linear mixed modeling takes this loss of data at follow-up into account and therefore, all available data were included in the analyses. Descriptive statistics With respect to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, female gender, unemployment status, low education, NYHA functional class III or IV, kidney disease, COPD, and having an implantable device were associated with increased general and exertion fatigue (Table 1). Lower LVEF and a history of a stroke or TIA were associated with increased general fatigue, whereas increasing age, having no partner, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and higher BMI were only associated with exertion fatigue (Table 1). The use of diuretics, nitrates, and psychotropic medication were associated with increased general and exertion fatigue, whereas beta-blocker use was associated with decreased exertion fatigue (Table 1). Following Cohen's classification of effect sizes, 31 sleep problems were moderately associated with increased general (r = .42, p <.001) and exertion fatigue (r = .35, p <.001). Symptoms of anxiety- depression were also moderately associated with exertion fatigue (r = .39, p <.001), and strong correlations were found with increased general fatigue (r = .55, p <.001). Univariate associations 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 48 05-01-16 10:23Fatigue and heart failure self-care49 3between general and exertion fatigue on the one hand and poor self-care and consulting behavior on the other were small to moderate (r ranging from .14 to .16, p <.01). General fatigue and self-care Pearson correlations indicated a strong, positive correlation between general fatigue and exertion fatigue (r = .70, p <.001) when checking the assumptions for generalized linear mixed modeling suggesting that both constructs should not be tested in one model due to risk of multicollinearity. No assumptions for conducting generalized linear mixed modeling were violated. Mean total self-care and consulting scores did not differ significantly over time (data not shown). TABLE 1 .

Chi square statistics indicated that the goodness of fit improved significantly when general fatigue was added as a determinant of total self-care (Model 1: 2 (1) = 7.9, p = .004) and consulting behavior (2 (1) = 6.6, p = .01). In unadjusted analyses (Model 1), general fatigue was significantly associated with poor self-care and consulting behavior over time and this relationship remained significant in subsequent adjusted analyses (Model 2). The inclusion of clinical and demographic covariates improved the overall fit for Model 2 ( 2 (11) = 37.2, p <.001 for total self-care; 2 (11) = 20.7, p = .04 for consulting behavior). After additional adjustment for sleep and mood problems (Model 3), general fatigue remained significantly associated with poor self-care (p = .004) and inadequate consulting behavior scores (p = .04). Neither sleep nor mood problems contributed significantly to total self-care (p = .66 and p = .53, respectively) or consulting behavior (p = .12 and p = .60, respectively) (Table 2). There was also no significant general fatigue by time interaction effect observed for total self-care or consulting behavior (p = .13 and p = .16, respectively), indicating that the relationship of fatigue with self-care as well as consulting behavior did not change over time. The addition of sleep and mood problems did not improve the fit of Model 3 ( 2 (2) = .50, p = .79 for self-care; 2 (2) = 2.4, p = .30 for consulting behavior). To conclude, general fatigue was associated with total self-care as well as consulting behavior, also after adjustment for sleep and mood problems, and other covariates. Other significant predictors of poor total self-care and inadequate consulting behavior in the final model were lack of a partner (E = 2.06, p = .003; E = 1.26, p = .005) and higher BMI (E = .14, p = .02; E = .08, p = .04), respectively. Male gender (E = 1.51, p = .03) and lower educational level (E = 1.83, p = .004) were significantly associated with poor self-care only. In contrast, unemployment (E = -2.14, p = .02) and diabetes mellitus (E = -1.50, p = .02) were associated with enhanced self-care. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 50 05-01-16 10:23Fatigue and heart failure self-care51 3TABLE 2.

Exertion fatigue and self-care Chi square statistics showed significant positive changes in goodness of fit (-2LL, Model 1) when exertion fatigue was added as a determinant of total self-care (2 (1) = 5.2, p = .02) and consulting behavior (2 (1) = 8.6, p = .003). In unadjusted analyses, exertion fatigue was significantly associated with poor self-care and consulting behavior (p = .02 and p = .003, respectively) over time and this relationship remained significant after adjustment for potential covariates (p = .004 and p = .002, respectively) (Table 3). The inclusion of covariates improved the overall fit of Model 2 as well (2 (11) = 38.1, p <.001 for self-care; 2 (11) = 21.5, p = .03 for consulting behavior). In the final model, exertion fatigue remained significantly associated with poor self-care (p = .01) and inadequate consulting behavior (p = .007) and the strengths of the effects had become slightly smaller. However, the model fit did not improve (2 (2) = .7, p = .72 for self-care; 2 (2) = 2.9, p = .24 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 51 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 352for consulting behavior). Sleep problems were not associated with self-care (p = .42), but a trend was observed for its association with inadequate consulting behavior (p = .09). Symptoms of anxiety- depression were not related to self-care or consulting behavior (Table 2). Further, no significant exertion fatigue by time interaction effect was observed for self-care or consulting behavior (p = .19 and p = .16, respectively), indicating that the associations did not change over time. The statistical association was slightly stronger between exertion fatigue and poor consulting behavior compared with self-care, and these time-stable associations could not be explained by other covariates. With respect to covariate associations, lower educational level emerged as an additional risk factor for poor self-care (E = 1.83, p = .004) compared to the general fatigue model. Male gender (E = .97, p = .03) became significantly associated with inadequate consulting behavior, whereas high BMI (E = .07, p = .06) reached borderline significance. DISCUSSION This is the first prospective study demonstrating that fatigue is associated with poor HF self-care including consulting behavior over 18-month follow-up, even after adjustment for sleep and mood problems. No significant differences were observed between general and exertion fatigue in their associations with self-care or consulting behavior. However, exertion fatigue was associated with higher age and BMI, and more comorbidities, underlining that they reflect different fatigue dimensions as demonstrated in previous studies. 3, 7 Our findings confirm the complexity of fatigue.32 Several factors were associated with both general and exertion fatigue (i.e. female gender, unemployment status, low education, higher NYHA functional class, kidney disease, COPD, and having an implantable device). However, only lower LVEF and a history of a stroke or TIA were associated with increased general fatigue, whereas increasing age, lack of a partner, hypertension, diabetes, and higher BMI were associated with exertion fatigue only. As expected, diuretics, nitrates, and psychotropic medication were associated with increased fatigue. In contrast with current evidence 33, beta-blocker therapy was associated with decreased exertion fatigue and no clear explanation for this finding exists. In line with prior studies, 6, 7, 18 associations between sleep problems and fatigue were strong but poor sleep did not contribute to explaining variance in self-care. This was against our expectations according to an earlier published conceptual model suggesting that poor sleep impairs HF self- care. 15 A qualitative study demonstrated that fatigue was experienced by HF patients as a circular process in which the lack of strength and energy leads to (social) sacrificing behavior.34 This implies that perceived fatigue may have a greater devastating effect on the performance of daily life activities compared with poor sleep alone. Mood symptoms were significantly associated with fatigue, which is in accordance with the existing literature,35 but not with HF self-care when fatigue was considered as a predictor. However, while most depressed patients experience symptoms of fatigue, not all fatigued patients are necessarily depressed. 13 Our findings might indicate that fatigue is more powerful in predicting poor 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 52 05-01-16 10:23Fatigue and heart failure self-care53 3compliance with recommended self-care behaviors than depression. To date, no consistent evidence exists for a clear relationship between depression and poor HF self-care and a clear explanation is still lacking.36 Nonetheless, depression should not be disregarded as a contributing moderator of the effectiveness of interventions that aim to improve HF self-care. Depressed patients with HF are shown to be at higher risk for mortality independent of fatigue 17 and seem not to benefit from general disease management programs compared with non-depressed HF patients stressing the need for specific behavioral approaches within HF health care. From a clinical perspective, besides optimal medical treatment (e.g., treating anemia), re- examination of medications, and treatment of existing sleep disorders and / or mood disorders, it would be of interest to examine whether HF patients could benefit from multimodal exercise interventions 37-39 that are aimed at alleviating fatigue along with easy accessible psychosocial support32 including self-care education. A limitation of this study is the use of a self-report measure to assess self-care possibly reflecting an overestimation of actual compliance due to recall bias and social desirability.40 As this is an observational study, no assumptions can be made with regard to causality not excluding the possibility that poor self-care alters fatigue status. Examining whether changes in fatigue are followed by differences in self-care can provide us more insight on temporal relationships among these key variables as fatigue is likely to be both a cause and consequence of poor HF self-care (Figure 1). 41 In addition, we used no validated measure to identify sleep disorders and only a short but valid screening index to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety. Also, our findings cannot be generalized to patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction. Given the increasing number of studies regarding the complex pathophysiology and treatment of HF, future prospective studies on self-care are needed that include patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction. 42 Strengths were the sample size of 545 patients, the prospective design, and the relatively novel statistical method that reckons with correlated data resulting in maximum use of available data by not excluding patients with missing data at a certain time point, thus preserving statistical power.

Accordingly, assessment and treatment of modifiable factors causing fatigue may improve compliance with HF self-care behavior but identification of temporal associations between fatigue and self-care is needed. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 54 05-01-16 10:23Fatigue and heart failure 3REFERENCES AM, RC, Lisowski T, Pini M, Fantuzzi G, Levy WC, et al.

Pelle Nina Kupper crucial in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). While the focus of research has been on negative mood states, adequate psychological resources may be required to successfully engage in HF self-care. Therefore, the longitudinal associations of multiple positive affect measures in explaining HF self-care including consulting behavior were examined while adjusting for depressive symptoms and potential covariates (e.g., disease severity). Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 238 patients (mean age: 66.9\u00b18.6 years, 78% men), with chronic HF completed questionnaires at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Positive affect was assessed with the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Global Mood Scale (GMS). Anhedonia, i.e. diminished interest or pleasure, was assessed with a subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale was completed to assess HF self-care including consultation behavior. Results: Linear mixed modeling results showed that anhedonia was most strongly associated with both poor self-care (estimate = -.72, p <.001) and consulting behavior (estimate = -.44, p <.001) over time, after adjustment for covariates and depressive symptoms. GMS positive affect was related to better HF self-care adjusting for standard depressive symptoms but not when adjusting for anhedonia. PANAS positive affect was not independently related to self-care. Conclusion: Anhedonia was associated with worse compliance with self-care among chronic HF patients over time, irrespective of disease severity and depression. Associations between positive affect and self-care were dependent on the measures used in multivariable analyses. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 58 05-01-16 10:23Positive affect, anhedonia, and self-care59 4INTRODUCTION Chronic heart failure (HF) is a growing major public health problem affecting 1-2% of the general population in developed countries, due to the aging of the population and increased survival after an acute cardiac event.1, 2 Despite the improvement of HF treatment, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, impaired health status, and high number of hospital (re-) admissions, which has led to major healthcare costs. 3, 4 From the patient perspective, chronic HF is a burdening condition as it requires a vast amount of self-care.5 Self-care refers to the actions patients must undertake to maintain healthy functioning and well-being by actively managing symptoms, treatment, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic medical condition. 6 Maintaining health can be achieved by adapting behaviors such as complying with medication and lifestyle regimen, and consulting professionals when chronic HF symptoms worsen (i.e. consultation behavior). 6 Critically, poor self-care has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with chronic HF.7 A multitude of different factors affect and complicate chronic HF self-care behavior.5 Adequate psychological resources are required to provide patients with the necessary motivation and energy to successfully engage in optimal self-care. While the focus of research has been on negative mood states such as depression, it is being debated whether positive affect should be considered as the opposite as both states can be experienced simultaneously. 8, 9 Relatively little is known about the health effects of positive psychological affect (i.e. mood states such as feeling active, joy or cheerful) but preliminary evidence suggests that positive affect may be associated with enhanced cardiovascular health, 10-12 healthy lifestyle (e.g., physical activity),11 and adaptive biological function (e.g., reduced inflammation).11, 13 To date, no consensus exists on the definition and measurement of positive affect and it has recently been stressed that research should include multiple constructs of positive affect to examine its relationship with cardiovascular health outcomes and behaviors. 11 It was previously reported that different positive affect measures reflected different dimensions of positive affect using factor analysis in the current HF sample and that these dimensions were also distinctively related with inflammatory biomarkers.13 One of these measures has been assumed to assess anhedonia,12 a core feature of major depressive disorder that is defined as diminished interest in or pleasure in response to stimuli that were previously experienced as rewarding during a pre-morbid state (DSM-IV-TR).14 Remarkably, while it is often assumed that depression is associated with poor compliance in patients with HF, findings have been inconsistent in confirming this relationship so far. 15, 16 Given these inconsistencies and the assumption that positive affect is not merely the opposite of negative affect, it is of interest whether positive affect and / or anhedonia are associated with compliance with HF self-care activities and consultation behavior as potential behavioral determinants of health outcomes. Therefore, we prospectively examined and compared the associations of positive affect and anhedonia with compliance with self-care behaviors at baseline and 1-year 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 460with chronic systolic HF using several affect measures. In addition, we examined whether disease severity, depressive symptoms, or other potential covariates could explain these associations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants and procedure HF outpatients were consecutively recruited between June 2006 and October 2008 from 3 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands (i.e. St. Elisabeth Hospital, Tilburg; Amphia Hospital, Breda; and ZorgSaam Hospital, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40%, age 80 years, no hospital admission in the month prior to inclusion, and stable on oral HF medication during the month prior to inclusion. Exclusion criteria were life-threatening co-morbidities, severe cognitive impairment, psychiatric comorbidity except for mood disorders, and/or insufficient understanding of the Dutch language. Of 282 eligible patients, 253 patients agreed to participate (response rate = 89.7%) at baseline (Figure 1). Eligible patients were consecutively approached for participation by their cardiologist or nurse during a regular outpatient clinic visit. If willing to participate, patients were called by an independent investigator to schedule a baseline study appointment in which patients were given additional information about the study. At baseline and at 12-month follow-up, participants completed questionnaires at home to assess socio-demographics, psychological variables, and HF self-care that were returned by mail and checked for missing items accordingly. Patients were contacted when either a questionnaire was not returned within two weeks or in the event of missing items. The study was approved by the medical ethics committees of all 3 hospitals, and was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2008). All participants provided written informed consent and anonymity was guaranteed. Positive affect According to our previous study,13 positive affect was assessed with two different measures at baseline and 1-year follow-up: the widely used (i) Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)17 and (ii) the Global Mood Scale (GMS).8 The PANAS is a reliable, and valid 20-item self-report measure of positive and negative affect.17 Ten positive affect items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) regarding the past week with possible total scores ranging from 10 to 50. Items included: attentive, interested, alert, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, proud, determined, strong, and active. Cronbach's was .89 at baseline indicating high internal consistency. The GMS 8, 18 contains ten positive mood terms (i.e. feeling active, lively, hard-working, sociable, cheerful, self-confident, dynamic, enterprising, relaxed, and bright) that were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) regarding the past time with total scores ranging between 0 and 40. The positive affect scale of the GMS has been shown to be highly internally 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 60 05-01-16 10:23Positive affect, anhedonia, and self-care61 4consistent8 and Cronbach's was .91 in the present study. The GMS positive affect scale tends to reflect more vitality concepts compared with the PANAS positive affect scale which reflects a more cognitive-motivational dimension of positive affect.13 For both scales, higher scores reflected higher levels of positive affect. Anhedonia The anhedonia subscale from the HADS was initially designed to detect the lack of positive affect as a key feature of major depressive disorder.12, 14 This subscale consisted of four items that were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (just as much/most of the time) to 3 (not at all) regarding the past week of which 1 item was reversed scored. Items included I look forward with enjoyment to things, I feel cheerful, I can laugh and see the funny side of things, and I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy. Total scores could range from 0 to 12, with higher scores reflecting increased anhedonia, or diminished interest/pleasure in rewarding stimuli. Internal consistency was satisfactory in the present study with Cronbach's of .78. Depression The well-validated 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)19 was used to assess depressive symptoms at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Items were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely / none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the time). Possible scores ranged from 0 to 30, with higher scores reflecting more depressive symptoms. Depression was also assessed at both time points with the 7-item depression subscale of the HADS. 20 Possible scores could range from 0 to 21, with higher scores reflecting increased depressive symptomatology. Self-care The European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScB-9)21 was used to measure compliance with recommended HF self-care behaviors to maintain healthy functioning as our dependent variable at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Items were answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I do not agree at all). Apart from global self-care (total score), the total scale also consisted of a 4-item consultation behavior subscale 21, 22 (i.e. I contact my doctor or nurse if (a) shortness of breath increases, (b) my leg/feet are more swollen, (c) I gain weight, and (d) I experience fatigue) and a 5-item 'adherence to regimen' subscale (i.e. I weigh myself every day, I limit the amounts of fluids, I eat a low sodium diet, I take my medications as prescribed, and I exercise regularly). However, the latter subscale has not been recommended to be used separately due to low internal consistency21 (Cronbach's alpha was .55 in this sample). Cronbach's alpha in the current sample was .80 for the total scale and .83 for the consultation behavior subscale. The EHFScB-9 scores were reversed in the present study, i.e. higher scores reflected enhanced self-care. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 61 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 462 Number of eligible patients N = 282 Non-response (N = 29) Refused to participate (N = 5) Did not return ques tionnai re (N = 21) Death (N = 3) Enrolled at baseline N = 253 (respons e rate = 89.7%) Excluded (N = 15) Missing data in baseline predictor(s) Number of patients included in nal sample N = 238 (completion rate = 94% ) Drop-out (N = 29) Refused to participate (N = 10) Did not return ques tionnaire (N = 9) Unreachable (N = 1) Exclusion due to dem entia (N = 1) Death (N = 8) Number of patients at 1-year follow-up N = 209 (completion rate = 88% ) FIGURE 1. Flow chart of patient inclusion Demographic and clinical characteristics Socio-demographic variables were assessed through purpose-designed questions and included age, gender, marital status, educational level, and employment status. Clinical variables were obtained from patients' medical records and included the etiology of chronic HF, current smoking status, LVEF, NYHA-functional class, cardiac history (i.e. previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Information on pharmaceutical treatment was also obtained from the patients' medical records (e.g., beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and self-care63 4Statistical analyses Baseline differences in sample characteristics were examined using Chi-square tests for discrete variables and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables between responders (N = 238) vs. non-responders (N = 29) and excluded patients (N = 15) due to missing data. Marital status (single vs. having a partner) and current employment status (unemployed vs. employed) were dichotomized. To examine the strength of relations (i.e. an effect size), Pearson correlations were calculated between all affect measures and self-care using the grand means. Separate linear mixed modeling analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood estimation and an unstructured covariance matrix23 to prospectively assess the unique relationship of each positive affect dimension with self-care and consultation behavior when it was controlled for potential covariates. This statistical technique allows data to be correlated. Also, bias is limited by not excluding participants from analyses when information is missing on a time-point therefore preserving statistical power. First, each positive affect dimension was examined in separate models as a time-varying independent, continuous variable (continuous scores) (Model 1) representing the association between positive affect and self-care (dependent variable using continuous scores) across baseline and 1-year follow-up. It was examined whether self-care scores changed significantly over time. In addition, we examined which other potential confounders assessed at baseline (i.e. not varying over time) predicted self-care over time including age, gender, time since HF diagnosis, partner and employment status (yes), educational level, disease severity (NYHA functional class and LVEF), and co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). We finally adjusted for the potential influence of depressive symptoms (time-varying variable) using continuous scores (Model 3). This stepwise procedure was repeated for each positive affect measure to examine its unique relationship with self-care beyond the associations of potential explaining covariates. In addition, analyses were repeated for consultation behavior as a continuous outcome. Linear mixed modeling results were presented through estimates (i.e. unstandardized regression coefficients of the dependent variable when the independent variable increases with one unit) with p-values. Predictors were entered as fixed effects to examine its general association with the variance of the averaged self-care and consultation behavior scores over time. We finally inspected which of the three positive affect measures was the strongest predictor of self-care and consultation behavior using model fit statistics ( 2 and -2 Log Likelihood (-2LL)). In the final PANAS and GMS models, sensitivity analyses were performed controlling for depression by using the continuous HADS-depression subscale scores instead of the CES-D 10. A p-value < .05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 19 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0.

This resulted in a total sample of 238 chronic HF patients with N = 236 at baseline and N = 209 patients at 1-year follow-up (Figure 1), i.e. data was missing for two patients at baseline that did provide self-care data at 1-year follow-up. The baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of our sample (mean age = 66.9 \u00b1 8.6 years, 78% men) are presented in Table 1. Compared with responders (N = 238), non-responders (N = 29) and excluded patients (N = 15) were characterized by increased disease severity and more comorbidities as they were more likely to have NYHA functional class III or IV (27% vs. 9%; p = .004), other medical comorbidities (i.e. hypercholesterolemia (86% vs. 67%; p = .01), kidney disease (16% vs. 6%; p = .01), diabetes mellitus (48% vs. 28%; p = .008)), and to receive beta-blockers (89% vs. 69%; p = .009) and statins (91% vs. 70%; p = .004). There were no significant differences with respect to other socio-demographic or clinical variables. Positive affect, anhedonia, and self-care Pearson correlations indicated a strong, positive correlation (r = .80) between the PANAS and GMS positive affect measures using their grand means suggesting that these constructs should not be tested in one model due to the risk of multicollinearity (Table 2). Both positive affect measures showed moderate to strong negative correlations with depression and slightly stronger negative correlations with anhedonia that, in turn, was strongly associated with depression (r = .73) (Table 2). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 65 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 466TABLE 2 .

Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 10). a As measured with the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale ** p <.01 ***p <.001 Comparing the correlations between all affect measures and self-care, HADS anhedonia seemed to be the strongest determinant of self-care indicated by a medium effect size (r = -.27). PANAS positive affect was slightly less but still significantly correlated with increased self-care (r = .17), indicating a small effect size. This was also the case for depression using the CES-D 10 that was negatively associated with self- care (r = -.18). GMS positive affect was non-significantly associated with increased self-care (r = .12). No assumptions for conducting linear mixed modeling were violated. Overall, HF self-care scores remained stable over time (data not shown). Chi square and -2LL statistics indicated that goodness of fit improved most when anhedonia (HADS) was added as a predictor of self-care (2 (1) = 15.28, p <.001) compared with GMS positive affect (2 (1) = 5.25, p = .02) and PANAS positive affect (2 (1) = 3.78 , p = .05). In unadjusted analyses (Model 1), GMS positive affect was significantly associated with enhanced self-care over time, also after adjustment for potential confounders (Model 2) and depressive symptoms (Model 3; Table 3). We found similar but stronger associations for HADS anhedonia with self-care. PANAS positive affect was no longer associated with self-care after adjustment for depressive symptoms. However, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with reduced self-care in the final model (Model 3). Being unemployed, higher NYHA functional class, and having comorbid diabetes were consistently associated with enhanced self-care across all final models (Table 3). In the final HADS anhedonia model, increasing age was a significant predictor of enhanced self-care as well. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 66 05-01-16 10:23Positive affect, anhedonia, 4Positive consultation behavior subscale Inspecting the univariate Pearson correlations (Table 2) showed that both positive affect measures were not associated with consultation behavior, a subscale of the total self-care scale, whereas anhedonia showed moderate negative correlations with consultation behavior. Depression was also significantly correlated with decreased consultation behavior, indicated by a small to medium effect size. Goodness of fit improved significantly when HADS anhedonia was added as a predictor of consultation behavior (2 (1) = 13.66, p <.001) in the linear mixed modeling analysis. GMS positive affect (2 (1) = 2.73, p = .10) and PANAS positive affect (2 (1) = 2.58, p = .11) did not significantly improve the model fit in explaining consultation behavior. HADS anhedonia was significantly associated with decreased consultation behavior over time in both unadjusted (p <.001) and adjusted (p <.001) linear mixed modeling analyses (Table 3). Depressive symptoms were not associated with consultation behavior in the final model of HADS anhedonia. Positive affect measured with the GMS and PANAS were not associated with consultation behavior over time in unadjusted linear mixed models (Model 1; Table 3). After adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, associations became slightly significant (Model 2) but statistical significance was lost again after adjustment for depressive symptoms (Model 3). In both final models, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with reduced consultation behavior. In contrast to self-care, diabetes was not associated with increased consultation behavior. Increasing age, being unemployed, and higher NYHA functional class were significantly associated with increased consultation behavior (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analyses showed that positive affect was no longer associated with self-care (PANAS positive affect: estimate = .05, p = .38; GMS positive affect: estimate = .06, p = .20) or consultation behavior (PANAS positive affect: estimate = .01, p = .84; GMS positive affect: estimate = .01, p = .66) after adjustment for depressive symptoms as assessed with the HADS-D and other covariates. In these final adjusted models, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with decreased self- care (PANAS model: estimate = -.37, p < .001; GMS model: estimate = -.36, p = .001) and consultation behavior (PANAS model: estimate = -.25, p <.001; 3.

Our results indicate that anhedonia measured with the HADS12 was robustly related with decreased self-care including consultation behavior, irrespective of depressive symptoms. Associations between positive affect and increased self-care were no longer significant after controlling for depressive mood, depending on the measure used. GMS positive affect 8 was associated with increased self-care when the CES-D 10 depression scale was taken into account, but was no longer significant after adjustment for the HADS depression scale. We found no significant associations between PANAS positive affect and HF self-care after adjustment for depressive symptoms using either the CES-D or the HADS-D. While an association between negative mood states and health outcomes has been the focus of prior research,24 our findings contribute to the existing body of literature by showing that, in 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 68 05-01-16 10:23Positive affect, anhedonia, and self-care69 4comparison with positive affect, anhedonia, or the inability to enjoy things in daily life was associated with poor compliance with HF self-care and consultation behavior. While anhedonia is considered as a core symptom of major depression, not all anhedonic patients are necessarily depressed. Moreover, anhedonia can also be a characteristic of other mental disorders such as an anxiety disorder, schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia.14 There has been considerable debate regarding the definition and neurobiological mechanism underlying anhedonia. Recently, the term 'decisional anhedonia' has been introduced to address the influence of anhedonia on reward decision-making and by moving away from anhedonia as a steady-state, mood-like phenomenon.25 It has been proposed that deficits in the hedonic response to rewards and a diminished motivation to pursue them lead to impaired decision-making. This redefinition of anhedonia may help explain our results as HF self-care has already been referred to as a naturalistic decision-making process underlying the choice of health practices and behaviors to manage signs and symptoms. 5 Thus, there is a distinct possibility that anhedonia may prevent patients from adequate HF self-care due to deficits in the neural substrates underlying decision-making. Our findings confirm that the presumed relation between depression and HF self-care is not as consistent and straightforward since the relation with self-care was highly dependent on which type of depression measure was being used. While the 10-item version of the CES-D, an instrument developed to assess depressive symptoms in older adults, 19 was not associated with self-care but only with consultation behavior when positive affect was taken into account, the HADS-D subscale was associated with both outcomes, irrespective of positive affect. Accordingly, a next step would be to examine and replicate whether anhedonia underlies the association between depression and cardiovascular outcomes.26-28 Apart from psychological factors affecting HF self-care, our results are consistent with previous findings examining determinants of HF self-care and consultation behavior.5, 29 As expected, advancing age and higher NYHA functional class were associated with increased consultation behavior implying that older and sicker HF patients are more reliant on their health care providers compared with younger HF patients with less complaints. 29 Remarkably, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was linked with enhanced self-care, but not with consultation behavior perhaps because these patients are better instructed and trained to adhere to diet restrictions with respect to their diabetes. Still, caution is warranted since non-responders were more likely to have more co-morbid conditions such as diabetes. Diabetes remains a potential risk factor for increased hospitalizations and mortality in HF patients.30 However, the link between diabetes and better self-care in our study implies that the higher risk associated with diabetes may not to be attributed to poor self-care maintenance in these patients but replication of our results is needed to draw firm conclusions. Several study limitations should be mentioned. The HADS positive affect subscale was derived from an instrument that was originally designed to assess anhedonia as a depressive symptom. Increasing criticism has been published regarding the latent structure of the HADS stating that it is more a measure of general distress as it does not separate well between symptoms of depression 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 69 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 470and anxiety.31 However, our the 4-item anhedonia subscale of the HADS was closely related to poor self-care in patients with HF. Another limitation is that no conclusions can be drawn with regard to causal relationships since this is an observational cohort study. From our findings it cannot be determined whether anhedonia leads to poor self-care or whether poor self-care leads to increased anhedonia. Also, self-care was assessed via self-report, which may not reflect actual self-care. We cannot exclude the possibility that selection bias has occurred during the inclusion phase affecting the generalizability of our results. We did not have information on the total number of patients that were approached for study participation, and comparing responders with non- responders and dropouts showed that the latter could be characterized by increased disease severity and co morbid conditions. However, the fact that our sample resembles the general HF sample characteristics reported in other studies e.g., 32 supports the clinical validity of the study population. Strengths of this study were the standardized assessment of self-care, the inclusion of symptoms of depression using multiple measures, the prospective design over one year of follow up, and the statistical technique minimizing selection bias and maintaining statistical power. In conclusion, anhedonia as assessed with the HADS was longitudinally associated with poor compliance with recommended self-care and consulting behaviors among chronic HF patients over 1-year follow-up, independent of disease severity, demographics, and depressive symptoms. More research is needed to replicate our findings including measures of both psychological well-being and ill-being, to investigate a potential mediating role of self-care between anhedonia and poor health outcomes, and to reach consensus on how to define, assess, and differentiate between positive affect, anhedonia, and depression. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 70 05-01-16 Auricchio A, Bohm M, Dickstein K, et al.

This systematic review and meta-analysis describes the current evidence concerning psychological determinants of self-care in patients with chronic HF. Methods: Eligible studies were systematically identified by searching electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Web of Science) for relevant literature (1980 to 17 October 2014). Study quality was assessed according to the level of risk of bias. Quantitative data were pooled using random-effects models. Results: Sixty-five studies were identified for inclusion that varied considerably with respect to sample and study characteristics. Risk of bias was high in the reviewed studies and most problematic with regard to selection bias (67%). Depression (r = -.19, p <.001), self-efficacy (r = .37, p <.001), and mental well-being (r = .14, p = .030) were significantly associated with self-reported self-care. Anxiety was not significantly associated with either self-reported (r = -.18, p = .24) or objective self-care (r = -.04, p = .79), neither was depression associated with objectively measured medication adherence (r = -.05, p = .44). Conclusions: Psychological factors (depression, self-efficacy, and mental well-being) were associated with specific self-care facets in patients with chronic HF. These associations were predominantly observed with self-reported indices of self-care and not objective indices. Methodological heterogeneity and limitations preclude definite conclusions about the association between psychological factors and self-care and should be addressed in future research. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 74 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants of self-care75 5INTRODUCTION Psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) has been associated with poor outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and it is assumed that this may, in part, be due to poor self-care.1, 2 Effective HF self-care is important for maintaining health and to prevent patients from exacerbation of HF and subsequent hospitalizations due to clinical congestion.3 Self-care has been defined as a \"naturalistic decision making process\" that consists of performing a number of HF-related health practices (i.e. self-care maintenance) and managing HF symptoms (i.e. self-care management). 4 Those practices include limiting dietary sodium, taking prescribed medications, keeping physically active, and monitoring for symptoms of fluid retention by daily weighing and limiting fluids. 5 In addition, patients are required to manage their disease by recognizing, treating, and monitoring their HF symptoms and seek medical care when necessary. Poor self-care remains challenging in the care for chronic HF as it involves complex lifestyle and decision-making activities imposing a daily burden on the life of an individual patient. 6 Most common factors known to complicate self-care are age, male sex, HF (self-care) knowledge, experience and severity,7 low socio-economic status, poor health literacy, lack of social support, poor functional status, presence of comorbidities, and poor cognitive function.8, 9 Clinicians have also been recommended to take psychological risk factors, such as depression and anxiety into account when focusing on optimizing HF self-care skills. 1, 8-10 However, a recent systematic, narrative review11 stated that patients' beliefs and Type D personality were associated with self-care and poor consulting behavior, respectively, but no empirical evidence was provided for associations between depression, anxiety, and HF self-care. However, no clear explanation was given for these null-findings, nor did the authors provide a quantitative overview of the literature or distinguish between objective versus self-reported self-care. Accordingly, a critical examination of studies examining psychological predictors of self-care is lacking to help clarifying empirical inconsistencies, as the absence of evidence does not necessarily imply an absence of a relationship. The objective of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive, narrative overview of the current evidence concerning a broad spectrum of psychological determinants of self-care behavior in individuals with chronic HF. A quantative data synthesis is provided for the psychological factors most commonly assessed. We compared findings of objective versus self-reported self-care. In addition, potential mechanisms linking psychological factors to self-care as well as methodological and clinical recommendations are provided for future study. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 75 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 576METHODS Search strategy Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines,12 eligible studies were systematically identified by searching electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Web of Science) for relevant literature (1980 to 17 October 2014). Keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) used to identify eligible studies are shown in Table 1. Additionally, reference lists of included studies were scanned to identify additional studies meeting our selection criteria. If full-text articles could not be obtained, the corresponding author was contacted by DK to request a full-text version. TABLE 1. Search terms Search terms Keywords (\"heart failure\" or \"congestive heart failure\" or or \"positive affect\" or optimism or \"life satisfaction\" or pessimism or coping or happiness or attitudes or \"self efficacy\" or \"health locus of control\" or beliefs or perception or confidence or worry or rumination or panic or \"panic attacks\" or \"post traumatic stress disorder\" or phobia or \"generalized anxiety disorder\" or resilience or \"quality of life\" or \"social desirability\" or defensiveness or \"vital exhaustion\" or fatigue or barriers or neuroticism or conscientiousness or extraversion or openness Compliance; Medication Adherence; Depression; Anxiety; Personality Study selection Two investigators (DK and NK) independently identified studies in an unblinded, standardized manner meeting the following selection criteria: only cohort studies representing adults (>18 years) with chronic HF that were published in either English, German, French or Dutch as a full report until October 17, 2014, including at least one psychological determinant (e.g., depression, self-efficacy, personality) and at least one HF specific self-care behavior (e.g., general self-care, medication adherence, sodium restriction). Both prospective and cross-sectional studies were included. Qualitative studies were excluded. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 76 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants bias Following Cochrane recommendations,13 study quality was assessed according to the following domains of potential bias14: (a) selection bias, (b) attrition bias for prospective studies, (c) information bias, (d) reporting bias, and (e) lack of precision. The overall potential risk of bias summary score for each study was defined as low (i.e. low risk of bias for all key domains), high (i.e. high potential risk of bias for one or more key domains), or unclear (i.e. unclear risk of bias for one or more key domain). To assess potential risk of bias, we developed a tool which was pilot-tested by DK and NK in five randomly selected studies on the most important self-care outcome measure. Pilot results were compared by both investigators to identify issues that needed refinement. Several changes were made with regard to lay-out of the tool and the formulation of an additional criterion with regard to selection bias (i.e. \"Was the response rate reported by the researcher(s)?\"). The final tool was used to assess risk of bias for each study (DK and NK) using preselected criteria according to study design and features. Reasons for judgments were documented and discrepancies were resolved by discussing the discrepant judgments or by a third rater (JD). The tool for assessing potential risk of bias is presented in Appendix I. Data extraction and analysis A data extraction form was developed, pilot-tested on five randomly selected included studies to be refined accordingly. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between DK and NK and if no consensus could be reached, a third investigator (JD) would decide. DK extracted data from selected studies on: ( 1) study and sample characteristics (i.e. country, inclusion criteria, sample size, mean age, male gender (%), NYHA class III/IV (%), mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)), (2) design (i.e. cross-sectional versus prospective), (3) psychological determinant(s) and measure, (4) self-care outcome variable(s) and measure, (5) selected covariates, and (6) statistical results. Fourteen study authors were contacted for additional information on statistical results. All studies are presented in Table 2 - 4. We clustered studies according to study design (i.e. prospective versus cross-sectional) and type of psychological determinant. Extensive qualitative data synthesis (i.e. consistency and direction of findings, risk of bias) was performed for each psychological determinant including all available studies. In addition, meta-analysis was performed for the most commonly assessed psychological determinants (4 studies available) using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.0) (Biostat Inc). To pool effect sizes, random-effect models were used. A standardized effect size (correlation and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) was calculated for each comparison. We distinguished studies based on measurement method, i.e. self-report versus objective self-care measure. We examined sources of heterogeneity from risk of bias using sensitivity analyses whenever applicable. Statistical heterogeneity in effects between studies was assessed by calculating the Q- and I 2 statistics. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 77 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 578RESULTS Search strategy and study selection In total, 65 studies were identified for inclusion in this systematic review (Figure 1). The search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases provided a total of 2001 records after removal of duplicates. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 1853 of these records (93%) did not meet the criteria as described and after full-text inspection of the remaining records, 85 additional records were excluded. One study was discarded due to the unavailability of the full-text. An additional two studies meeting the criteria were identified by checking the reference lists of included articles. No unpublished relevant studies were retrieved. Finally, 65 studies were included in the current review. Figure 1 displays the flow of the study selection process. Study characteristics Characteristics and the association of each psychological determinant with self-care for the included studies are shown in Table 2, 3, and 4. Studies varied with respect to sample characteristics, design, and applied statistical methods (e.g., univariable versus multivariable analyses). In case of multivariable testing, substantial differences were found with respect to choice of covariates. Eighteen prospective studies were identified with great ranges in sample size (39 to 648 patients), average age (57 to 78 years), and follow-up time (one week to 58 months). The percentage of male participants ranged from 33% to 99%. In addition, 47 cross-sectional studies were identified with even greater ranges in sample size (29 to 958 patients) and average age (51 to 80 years). The percentage of male participants varied less, between 52% and 99%. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (N = 31). These studies were most comparable with respect to sample characteristics (e.g., on average younger age) and methodological approaches compared with studies from other countries. Studies were also conducted in: the Netherlands (N = 11), Australia (N = 5), Germany (N = 3), Canada (N = 3), United Kingdom (N = 2), Taiwan (N = 2), Iran, Italy, Japan, Scotland, and Sweden (all N = 1). Three studies recruited patients in both Australia and the United States. Clusters of psychological determinants After reviewing the psychological determinants within selected studies, three main clusters of determinants were identified: (1) emotional / affective (e.g., anxiety and depression), (2) cognitive (e.g., health beliefs and self-efficacy), and (3) personality determinants (e.g., neuroticism and Type D personality). Generally, self-report measures were used with the exception of one study in which a clinical interview was conducted to determine depression status.15 With regard to emotional determinants, the vast majority of studies examined depression while fewer studies looked at anxiety or fear, emotional health-related quality of life, psychosocial adjustment to illness, positive affect or 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 78 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants of self-care79 5perceived stress. In most studies, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) were used to assess depressive symptoms. Most frequently examined cognitive determinants were self-care confidence / self-efficacy, and beliefs (i.e. perceived benefits and / or barriers). Other cognitive constructs were self-concept, health locus of control, perceived control, and health satisfaction. Self-efficacy and self-care confidence tend to reflect the same construct as they both have been defined as the perceived ability / confidence of a patient in performing HF self-caree.g., 16, 17 and controlling symptoms.18 The term self-care confidence was only applied in studies that used the Self-Care Heart Failure Index for measuring self-care, which contains a self-care confidence subscale. Studies that used the term self-efficacy used other measures. Since both terms can be used interchangeably, we chose to use the term self-efficacy from this point forward. Choice of measures varied considerably with the exception of self-care confidence that was consistently assessed with the Self-Care Heart Failure Index. Relatively few studies examined personality factors, i.e. Type D personality and hostility were both assessed as determinants in three studies, whereas neuroticism and sense of coherence were assessed only once. Type D personality was consistently assessed with the Type D Scale-14. Assessment of HF self-care behavior Given the wide range of instruments used in assessing self-care, only a few of the most commonly used are mentioned here. For the assessment of HF self-care, most studies used (modified versions of ) the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale, 19 the Heart Failure Compliance Questionnaire,20 and the Self-Care Heart Failure Index.21 Medication adherence was commonly assessed with the Medication Adherence Scale22 or the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.23, 24 Other measures to assess self-care and / or medication adherence were (modified versions of ) generic adherence measures or newly developed questionnaires by the study authors themselves. Objective measures of medication adherence comprised the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), refill rates / pill counts, or blood serum activity. One study assessed adherence to sodium restriction using 24-hour urinary sodium excretion levels. Noteworthy, self-reported medication adherence rates were generally higher than objectively measured adherence rates in studies that used both measures. Three studies examined delay as a measure of self-care, which reflects the time between HF symptom onset and hospital admission. Other indirect measures of adherence were withdrawal from an exercise intervention or study medication trial. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 79 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 580 PubM ed N = 1416 Total numb er of records N = 2808 Records screened N = 2001 Excluded b ased o n title/abstrac t N = 185 3 Not eligible*: N = 1493 No psychological determinant: N = 193 Review/editorial/abstract: N = 106 Age < 18 years: N = 5 Animal studies: N = 17 Publ ished before 1980: N = 8 Qualita tive study: = 31 Full -text articles assessed for eligib ility N = 148 Excluded b ased o n article N = 85 Not eligible*: n = 30 No psychological determinant: n = 12 Abstract: n = 19 Qualita tive study: n = 24 Studies includ ed N = 63 PsycINFO N = 244 Web o f Science N = 1148 Remo val duplic ates N = 807 Studies includ ed in /f_inal review N = 65 Studies after han d search N = 2 FIGURE 1.

Nineteen studies were rated as having low risk of bias and the total risk of bias remained unclear for four studies, resulting in an overall potential risk of bias in the remaining 42 studies (Figure 2). The vast majority of studies did not provide details on the response rate and characteristics of non-responders resulting in a high potential risk of selection bias in nearly two-thirds of the studies. Potential risk of attrition bias was high or unclear in nearly 72% of the prospective studies (i.e. missing or unclear information), indicating that either attrition exceeded the acceptable range of <20% for follow-up <1 year and <30% for follow-up >1 year, or that analyses did not take attrition into account, or that it remained unknown how study authors dealt with attrition. Information bias and lack of precision were unclear or high in 18% of the studies most often due to the use of non-validated measures, or statistical results inappropriately being chosen or reported, e.g., standardized beta-values >1, contradicting results that were not further explained.

Summary of risk of bias assessment Emotional determinants of self-care Depression - Eleven prospective studies25-34 examined the association between depression and HF self-care (Table 2). Taking high study quality into account, prospective associations between depression and poor self-care 33 and less physical activity32 were reported. However, associations were dependent on the type of measure being used. For instance, depression as assessed with the CES-D was a weak predictor of self-care, while depression as assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale did predict poor self-care. 33 In the same study, anhedonia was robustly associated 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 97 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 598with poor self-care when distinguishing between depression and anhedonia, a core symptom of depression.33 Another high quality study34 examining whether depression contributed to self-care trajectories (i.e. getting worse or better over time) unexpectedly showed that greater depression was associated with a decreased odds of having a decline in self-care management over time. Regarding the remaining prospective studies, depression was associated with medication non-adherence,25, 26, 30 but no longer after taking other explaining factors such as age, disease severity, and medication burden into account.26, 30 In line with prospective findings, cross-sectional studies of high quality showed a relation between depression and poor physical activity as well35 but inconsistent results regarding general self-care. While several high quality studies found no robust association with self-care36-40 or medication adherence,41 a negative association between depression (PHQ-9) and general self-care was found in a large high quality study (N = 612), even after controlling for disease severity and HF self-care knowledge.42 Depression was also associated with increased delay36, 43 between HF symptom onset and hospital admission, but not with self-reported consultation behavior in another large high quality study (N = 958). 36 Considering the remaining cross-sectional studies, an association with poor exercise adherence was reported as well,35, 44 whereas evidence from other studies was mostly weak, inconsistent or lacking.16, 45-53 Most associations disappeared when other explaining variables were taken into account, e.g., disease severity, social support, or self-efficacy. Intriguingly, only minor but not major depression based on a clinical interview was associated with poor HF self-care in one study possibly indicating a non-linear relationship. 15 Anxiety - Inconclusive evidence was found for anxiety as a determinant of HF self-care among the five prospective studies25, 27, 28, 34, 54 (Table 2). One study considered of high quality indicated that increased anxiety at baseline was associated with an increase in HF self-care over time.34 In the remaining studies, anxiety was associated with poor objectively measured medication adherence25, 54 whereas anxiety was not or only weakly related with general HF self-care,28 sodium restriction,54 and compliance with an exercise program.27 Cross-sectional studies of high quality42, 46 showed inconsistent findings with respect to general HF self-care. In one study,42 anxiety was no longer negatively related to HF self-care when clinical factors and HF knowledge were taken into account, while anxiety remained associated with decreased odds of being an expert in self-care management and consulting beyond potential covariates in the other high quality study.46 Differences in sample characteristics and assessment methods including the choice of covariates (i.e. taking HF knowledge into account) may have contributed to these inconsistencies. Findings from the remaining cross-sectional studies were inconsistent as well and at times contradicting. The largest cross-sectional study (N = 689) showed no association with self- care,16 but anxiety did predict poor adherence to dietary restrictions in another study.47 In contrast, anxiety was related with increased smoking avoidance and alcohol restriction,48 indicative of a protective effect. Fear of the consequences of seeking help was associated with increased delay (i.e. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 98 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants of self-care99 5time between symptom onset and hospital admission), while anxiety was associated with shorter symptom duration as an indication of shorter delay in an elderly cohort of patients with HF.55 Other emotional determinants - Eight studies examined emotional determinants of HF self-care other than depression and anxiety (Table 2). One prospective high quality study showed that positive affect was no longer associated with self-care after taking depression into account. 33 In other cross- sectional studies of high quality, psychosocial adjustment to the illness56 and increased mental well- being57 were facilitating determinants of self-care but results depended on type of self-care outcome57 and measure.56 Regarding these findings, together with those from the remaining studies, it seems that mental well-being is more likely to be associated with effective self-care maintaining behaviors, i.e. lifestyle behaviors, than with self-care management, i.e. symptom managing. 20, 57, 58 Of note, two studies found no relation between mental well-being and self-care. These studies comprised relatively older HF cohorts with a mean age around or higher than 70 years. 59, 60 Perceived stress was not related with medication adherence based on refill rates, but this may have been the result of selection bias as non-adherent, thus potentially more distressed, patients appeared to be less likely to participate in this study. 61 Cognitions related to self-care Thirty-three studies (51%) investigated whether cognitive determinants were associated with self-care (Table 3). Although most studies used validated measures of cognitions and self-care, substantial heterogeneity in the studied cognitions and employed measures complicated comparison of findings across studies. Health beliefs and barriers - Two prospective and eight cross-sectional studies examined health beliefs and / or barriers as potential determinants of self-care (Table 3). Of those studies, one large cross-sectional study 35 was considered of high quality in which perceived benefits and barriers regarding diet and medication were associated with self-care. Specifically, perceived benefits were related to effective sodium restriction and exercising but not to weight monitoring and fluid restriction, which were determined by HF knowledge.35 Also, perceived barriers regarding diet restrictions were negatively associated with self-reported sodium restriction.35 Compared to this study, other studies examining dietary adherence with objective measures (i.e. urinary sodium excretion62 and nutrition diaries63) showed no significant associations with beliefs and barriers. Prospective studies showed that perceived benefits64 and barriers26 with respect to medication were associated with objectively measured medication adherence and increased study withdrawal from a medication trial, respectively. No such evidence was found in any of the cross-sectional studies61, 65 that were relatively small (N = 58)65 or comprising a relatively healthy sample (i.e. only 13% of patients was classified with NYHA function class III or IV).61 With respect to self-reported medication adherence: one study showed that belief in the necessity of the treatment regimen was correlated 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 99 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 5100with better self-reported medication adherence.66 Overall, beliefs were likely to be associated with self-care, but the direction and strength of association was highly dependent on type of belief and self-care behavior being assessed. With respect to general self-care, having someone to confide in67 and the belief in the illness having serious consequences were positive determinants of self-care whereas the perceived impact of medication use on lifestyle was associated with poor self-care. 68 Self-efficacy / self-care confidence - Nineteen studies were included that examined self-efficacy or self-care confidence as determinants of HF self-care (Table 3). In studies rated as having low risk of bias,17, 38, 42, 69-71 self-efficacy was quite consistently associated with HF self-care. All studies accounted for the effects of potential covariates, such as disease severity or perceived health status. Two prospective studies showed no associations between self-efficacy and HF self-care 72, 73 but both samples were small. Also, baseline levels of self-care were included as predictors of self-care at one month follow-up in one study 73 and it can be questioned whether self-care is likely to change over such a short period of time. Self-efficacy was also positively associated with HF self-care behaviors in the remaining studies. 16, 18, 48-52, 58, 74-77 One study51 showed that the relationship between depressive symptoms and treatment adherence was mediated by self-efficacy. A gender effect was found in another study showing that self-efficacy was only predictive of better self-care in women and not in men. 50 Findings varied slightly when studies distinguished between self-care maintenance and self- care management but no consistent pattern could be observed. Other cognitive determinants - A number of cross-sectional studies examined other cognitive determinants of self-care, such as perceived control16, 42, locus of control61, self-concept78, 79, and health satisfaction20 (Table 3). One study of high quality reported a significant association between perceived control and self-care beyond disease severity, comorbidities, and HF knowledge,42 while it was not associated with being novice, expert, inconsistent in self-care in another study.16 The inclusion of several other psychosocial factors (self-efficacy, social support, and hostility) may have accounted for the null-finding in the latter study. Health satisfaction 20 and self-concept78, 79 were associated with higher self-care in other studies, but only univariable associations were reported. Locus of control was no significant determinant of medication adherence in a study in which the impact of medication burden and beliefs were included as well. 61 Personality determinants of self-care A paucity of studies (14%) has looked into personality as a determinant of HF self-care (Table 4). Two studies 80, 81 of high quality consistently indicated that Type D personality was prospectively associated with decreased consulting behavior despite the increased tendency to perceive more cardiac symptoms and worrying about health,80 but these studies were based on the same cohort. Type D personality was also associated with poor objectively as well as subjectively measured medication adherence in another cohort in which negative affectivity seemed to drive this negative association 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 100 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants of self-care101 5and not necessarily the combination of negative affectivity and social inhibition.82 Hostility was associated with medication non-adherence in a study considered of high quality,41 but not with HF self-care in another large study.16 The latter study, however, included several other potentially underlying psychosocial factors. Remarkably, hostility was associated with better compliance with an exercise program in a small study of 39 patients.27 The study authors explained this as a potential form of response shift; patients who are less engaged in prescribed treatment may also experience less hostility. However, another explanation may be that the reliability of results was hampered by low statistical power. Sense of coherence was associated with better self-care at baseline, but not with a change in self-care at 1-month follow-up. 73 Also, one study showed that neuroticism was not associated with total self-care but negative associations were reported for adherence to follow-up visits, medication, and exercise. 20 Quantative data-synthesis We were able to pool results for depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and mental well-being on HF self- care outcomes. We grouped studies based on (a) psychological factor and (b) self-care measurement method (objective versus self-report). Quantitative data synthesis was possible for a total of 36 studies examining self-reported self-care (Figure 3) and 7 studies in which self-care was measured objectively (Figure 4). In nearly all studies that used objective methods, medication adherence was assessed, with the exception of one study in which anxiety was examined as a predictor of dietary restrictions. 54 After pooling results, depression was significantly associated with lower self-reported self-care (r = -.19, p <.001) (Figure 3), but not with objectively measured medication adherence (r = -.05, p = .44) (Figure 4). Figure 3 and 4 also show that anxiety was not significantly associated with either self-reported (r = -.18, p = .24) or objective self-care (r = -.04, p = .79), but the number of available studies was small (N = 3 for self-report; N = 2 for objective self-care). Self-efficacy (r = .37, p <.001) and mental well-being (r = .14, p = .03) were both significantly associated with higher self-reported self-care (Figure 3). Sensitivity analyses for high study quality was only possible for depression and self-reported self-care, which led to a slightly weaker, but still significant pooled correlation (r = -.13, p = .03). Overall, heterogeneity statistics were significant for depression (I 2 = 66% for self-reported and 70% for objective outcomes), anxiety (I2 = 88% for self-reported and 86% for objective outcomes), self- efficacy (I2 = 81% for self-reported outcomes). Heterogeneity statistic was not significant for included studies examining mental well-being (I2 = 29%). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 101 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 5102 Study name Subgroup within study Comparison Outcome Statistics for each study Correlation and 95% CI Lower Upper Correlation limit limit Z-Value p-Value Anxiety Self-report Study name Subgroup within study Comparison Outcome Statistics for each study Correlation and 95% CI Lower Upper Correlation limit limit Z-Value p-Value Anxiety Self-report FIGURE 3.

While it is generally assumed that psychological factors such as depression contribute to poor self-care performance,83 the available evidence is less consistent. The assumed relation of depression with poor general self-care is not as straightforward as has previously been assumed, and this can partially, but not completely, be attributed to methodological differences in assessment methods. In this review, we found that depression was a better predictor of poor self-reported self-care, while this relation appeared generally absent in studies that assessed self-care with objective measures (Figure 3 and 4). Also, depression was related to poor physical activity and increased delay, that is time between symptom onset and hospital admission, but not necessarily to all aspects of HF self-care. The absence of relation can partly be explained by methodological reasons. Type of measure seemed essential considering that the majority of null-findings were reported in studies using the CES-D. 29, 35, 40, 51 Differences with respect to construct and / or convergent validity of the several depression measures may partially help to explain the inconsistent evidence. Another explanation may be less variance due to sample selection as depressive patients may be more reluctant to participate in studies that were more invasive in which serum / urine samples or monitoring equipment were used in addition to questionnaires. Also, depression is characterized by cognitive bias, hence a tendency to interpret their self-care performance in a negative manner. 84 It must be noted that most studies that used objective measures, assessed medication adherence and not HF self-care in general. Thus, findings are not generalizable very well to other elements of self-care. The lack of evidence is in contrast with the current literature that clearly indicates that depression is a risk factor for poor medication adherence in both non-cardiac and cardiac populationsm. 85, 86 Therefore, future research is necessary that eliminates and accounts for potential sources of methodological and sampling bias. Our review demonstrated that anxiety was negatively, but also positively related to self-care (Figure 3 and 4). The nature of anxiety and type of self-care outcome seemed to determine whether anxiety served as a psychological facilitator or barrier of self-care. Also, positive affect and mental well-being were facilitating psychological determinants of self-care, and primarily in younger cohorts. Yet, it remains unknown whether these psychological facilitators would remain significant when accounting for negative psychological factors such as depression. Cognitive determinants may also be relevant for self-care. Self-efficacy was strongly associated with improved HF self-care. Health beliefs such as increased awareness of (the benefits of ) self-care were also associated with improved self-care including medication adherence, but these relations were not found for objective self-care. Perceived barriers (e.g., self-care having an increasing impact on daily lifestyle) seemed to prevent patients from adequate self-care. Perceived control, health satisfaction, and self-concept might be important facilitating determinants of self-care, but the amount of evidence was limited. Certain caution is warranted by interpreting these results since they were mostly based on a single study, significantly reducing the strength of evidence. More than half 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 104 05-01-16 10:23Psychological determinants of self-care105 5of included studies provided unadjusted results only, not taking other explaining factors into account. The development of standardized measures to assess health beliefs and barriers related to HF self-care should enable us to gain better insight into which specific cognitions are most crucial. For personality, findings suggested that internalizing personality characteristics, such as neuroticism and Type D personality, may be negatively associated with specific elements of self-care, particularly with social elements related to consultation (i.e. adherence to follow-up visits or adequate communication with physicians). The association of self-care with the externalizing characteristic of hostility seemed to be dependent upon the element of self-care that was being assessed. However, the amount of studies examining personality as determinant of self-care was scarce. Biobehavioral mechanisms A mechanism through which psychological factors may contribute to self-care is via neurobiological processes, for instance through reward system deficits caused by dopaminergic dysfunction which has been related to certain subtypes of depression.87, 88 A paucity of studies has examined biobehavioral mechanisms associated with self-care in patients with HF. Lee et al.16 showed in a cross-sectional study that better self-care management was associated with reduced systemic inflammation and lower N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, suggesting less HF burden due to water retention. With respect to psychological determinants of HF self-care, it is conceivable that health behaviors may be associated with biobehavioral processes, since the association of depression with inflammatory markers may be mediated by health behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and body mass index. 2 Future research One of the main conclusions of the current review is that this research field is hampered by a considerable amount of methodological heterogeneity between and shortcomings within studies, serving as one of the most plausible explanations for the many inconsistent and/or lack of results. As the majority of studies were cross-sectional of design, more prospective studies are needed. As self- care is not amenable to change over a short period of time, studies with long follow-up are needed to examine potential longitudinal effects. Future studies are highly recommended to minimize the level of risk of (selection) bias by reaching sufficient statistical power, by providing information on response and attrition rates, characteristics of non-responders and drop-outs, and by controlling for baseline differences and important confounding and modifying variables. This can be accomplished, for instance, through matching, stratification, and performing multivariable analyses that are grounded on theoretical (a priori hypotheses) and empirical evidence. Also, the role of covariates should be explicitly given attention, as some may be confounders, but other in fact may serve as mediators. When searching for effect mechanisms, this is important to consider. The information theoretic model selection based on 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 105 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 5106Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)e.g., 89 is highly preferred over the use of certain stepwise methods including forward selection and backward elimination, which are prone to produce spurious results and poor generalizability due to bias in parameter estimates and inconsistencies among algorithms of model selection. 90 As many studies used self-constructed scales for the psychological predictors and self-care outcomes, it is recommended to use standardized and well-validated measures to decrease the heterogeneity currently existing. This would improve the comparability of findings across studies. However, there is no gold standard for measuring self-care behavior in the HF population but suggestions for instruments have already been made by other researchers. 9 A significant limitation of self-report adherence measures is that it is complicated by systematic response biases. It is shown that concordance of self-report with other measures of adherence varies widely based on the type of measures.91 This is confirmed by our findings, as we showed that psychological factors played a greater role in self-reported than objective self-care. Considering the low number of studies that used objective methods, no firm conclusions can be drawn with respect to objective self-care. Critically, objective measures are also complicated by several practical (e.g., high costs, technical and logistic problems) and methodological limitations.92 For instance, MEMS registers when the bottle is opened, but this does not ensure that medication is actually taken. Also, monitoring equipment might alter behavior due to increased awareness that adherence information is recorded. 93 Future researchers are therefore recommended to include multiple measurement strategies to assess 'true' self-care including self-report (e.g., European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale, Self-Care Heart Failure Index), (tele-) monitoring systems, accelerometers for physical activity, refill rates for medication adherence, and biological measures. 94 Research should be focused on the validity and clinical applicability of multiple types of self-care measures taking their benefits and limitations into account. In addition to methodological research implications, we found that only a limited number of studies examined positive psychological determinants, except from self-efficacy, compared with the amount of studies examining negative psychological determinants, primarily depression. Also, the number of studies examining personality was small and none of those included other personality traits of which some are known for their association with adherence. For instance, conscientiousness from the five-factor model of personality has been associated with better medication adherence in a recent meta-analysis. 95 For future research, it is recommended to examine a broader spectrum of personality traits and to include both positive and negative psychological factors. Finally, little is known about potential (mediating) mechanisms underlying the association between psychological factors and its relations with distinct self-care behaviors, such as depression, or between self-care and somatic outcome for that matter. More specifically, research needs to focus on which and how specific psychological symptom clusters or subtypes (e.g., anhedonia 33) and their neurobiological substrates play a role with respect to self-care. Our findings show that relationships are often moderated by multiple other factors (e.g., age, gender, social support, HF knowledge, clinical condition). More mechanistic and intervention studies are needed to make causal inferences on the relation of psychological determinants of actual self-care and its mediators implications HF by a multitude of dimensions / factors96 necessitating a multifaceted approach of improving self-care. From the current review, several psychological barriers and facilitators of HF self-care have been identified beyond other socio-demographic and clinical determinants8, 97 as we have illustrated in a conceptual model (Figure 5). Accumulating evidence shows that there is considerable mutual interaction among psychological variables and it remains unknown which of these variables contribute most to (which facets of ) actual self-care. Their amount of contribution is ultimately determined by a complex of socio-demographic, clinical, and contextual variables 98 possibly explaining several null-findings. How well patients eventually perform the recommended HF self-care behaviors not only depends on the amount of HF knowledge they encompass or education they receive 42, 99, but also on their emotional state, cognitions, and personality (Figure 5). This may help explain why educational or other types of interventions that were aimed at improving self-care without taking the complexity of psychological factors into account have not always been found effective.100 Other factors (e.g., self-efficacy, social support, disease severity) have consistently been shown to explain the relation between depression and poor self-care and contribute to the complexity of psychological factors which should not be overlooked in clinical practice. Adequate performance of a multitude of burdening behaviors that need to be performed on daily basis requires adequate psychological resources including intrinsic motivation. Self-care performance is not only determined by conscious motivation, but also the result of unconscious mental processes and other patient-related (e.g., health literacy 101, cognitive impairment37), social, and contextual (e.g., patient-healthcare professional relationship102) factors.96 While self-care has been referred to as a naturalistic decision making process,4 which implies the involvement of conscious cognitive activity, we believe that there are also many factors that contribute to the quality of self-care in a more indirect and unconscious manner. Psychological emotional barriers, such as depression, may cause a lack of motivation (e.g., anhedonia), energy, concentration (e.g., forgetting medicines), and social support complicating effective self-care.103 These barriers do not automatically lead to poor self-care since there are also other important factors that determine whether a patient ultimately performs a certain behavior. On the more conscious level, psychological facilitators such as perceived benefits of self-care and adequate self-efficacy are needed to increase the motivation and decision-making of patients. Perceived barriers are likely to prevent patients from self-care when the perceived barriers outweigh the perceived benefits despite adequate awareness of the importance of self-care. Personality traits such as Type D personality and hostility determine how adequate patients perceive self-care, cope with their disease, and interact with their healthcare providers. 104 Our review draws attention to the differences in results with respect to self-reported versus objective self-care. While self-report measures are popular because of their low costs and ease in administration, clinicians should be aware that self-report measures are prone to systematic response biases, e.g., social desirability or negative response bias, as mentioned earlier. Clinicians are therefore recommended to base their care not only on the self-report of patients, but also on clinically more 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 107 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 5108objective methods, such as refill rates and biological measures. In addition, home telemonitoring is shown feasible to monitor important health parameters as a proxy for HF self-care behaviors in patients with chronic HF105, improving ecological validity of self-care findings. In terms of optimizing HF self-care, clinicians are suggested to provide HF education and to address inadequate health or self-care beliefs or barriers, for instance, through motivational interviewing.106, 107 Several interventions (e.g., exercise training, telephone contact) have been demonstrated successful in decreasing emotional distress, but not in improving self-care yet. 108, 109 One intervention study showed that improving self-efficacy was accompanied with an improvement in self-care.69 Individualized and psychological care110 is recommended to decrease emotional distress,108, 109 to increase self-efficacy, positive psychological resources, and to optimize other non-psychological contributing factors103, 111 in order for patients to perform effective self-care. Ultimately, actual self-care performance is likely to be determined by a complex interaction between the individual patient workload (e.g., polypharmacy, transportation difficulties, job) and capacity (e.g., physical and mental functioning, literacy, social support), a mechanism that has been proposed by Shippee et al. in the patient-level cumulative complexity model. 112 Psycho logical barriers (-) and facilitators (+) Emotions (-) Depression (-) Anhedonia (+/-) Anxiety (+) Mental well-being (+) Positive aectCognitions (-) Barriers, negative beliefs (+) Benets, adequate beliefs (+) Self-ecacy / condence (+) Perceived control Personality (-) Type D personality (-) Neuroticism (-) Hostility (+) Conscientiousness HF Self-care Self-care maintenance Medication adherence Dietary restrictions Regular physical activity Self-care management Consulting / short delay Monitoring / respond ing to symptoms Adherence to follow-up visits FIGURE 5. Conceptual model of psychological barriers (-) and facilitators (+) of heart failure self-care. Determinants that have been associated with self-care in non-HF indicated determinants of self-care109 5CONCLUSIONS From the current review, it is concluded that consistent associations of psychological factors with self-care were often found for specific self-care facets only, and for only a limited set of psychological factors. Also, empirical evidence was mostly available and consistent with respect to self-reported self-care but consistent evidence was lacking concerning objective self-care, most likely due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity in this research field. Overall, we can conclude that depression was consistently associated with self-reported self-care, specifically with poor physical activity and increased delay. Type D personality was associated with inadequate consulting behavior, but analyses were based on partially the same cohort. Consistent evidence was also found for a positive relation between self-efficacy and mental well-being with HF self-care. Importantly, cognitive health beliefs and anxiety were found to serve both as psychological facilitators and barriers of self-care, depending on the nature of belief / anxiety and facet of self-care after qualitative data synthesis. Future research should attempt to overcome the methodological issues that have been addressed in this review as the majority of studies were rated as having high risk of bias. Considering the complex interplay of contributing (psychological) determinants of self-care, conclusions from this systematic review emphasize the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and patient-tailored approach using multiple measurement strategies in future research and the clinical care of patients with chronic HF. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 109 05-01-16 10:23Chapter SB, KL, et al.

The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the association of (changes in) self-care with HRQOL while adjusting for psychological distress. Methods: In total, 459 patients (mean age = 66.1\u00b110.5 years, 73% male) with chronic HF completed questionnaires at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up. Self-care and HF-specific HRQOL were quantified with the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Results: Using general linear models, multivariable between-subject (estimate = -.14, p = .005) and no within-subject effects of self-care were found for better HRQOL over time. Associations between self-care and HRQOL were fully explained by depression (estimate = 1.77, p <.001). Anxiety (estimate = 4.49, p <.001) and Type D personality (estimate = 13.3, p <.001) were associated with poor HRQOL, but only partially accounted for the relation between self-care and emotional HRQOL. Conclusions: Self-care was prospectively associated with better disease-specific HRQOL in patients with HF, and this was fully accounted for by depression, and partially by anxiety and Type D personality. Changes in self-care within a person did not affect HRQOL. Psychological distress should be considered in future efforts to address self-care and HRQOL. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 122 05-01-16 10:23Self-care life123 6INTRODUCTION Chronic heart failure (HF) is a clinical progressive syndrome affecting 2-3% of the global population.1, 2 Despite medical advances, it is associated with frequent hospital admissions, imposing a vast burden on industrialized countries.3, 4 Standard treatment of HF is aimed at prolonging life by maintaining physiological stability.1 It usually involves a complex regimen of daily self-care behaviors including pharmacological therapy, symptom monitoring, and lifestyle modifications. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is profoundly impaired in patients with HF. 5 Many patients suffer from other conditions, including diabetes, anemia, and renal disease,6 but also from psychological distress.7, 8 Patients with HF are prone to experience disabling psychosocial consequences of their burdening condition, such as social isolation and fear.9 Several demographic and clinical factors are known to impact HRQOL, such as younger age, increased disease severity, and poor functional capacity. 10 It seems likely that self-care would benefit HRQOL, as it is targeted at reducing HF symptoms to improve the patient's physical condition. However, findings from previous, primarily cross-sectional and small studies have yielded inconsistent results 11-14 as well as on the effects of self-care interventions on HRQOL.15 We therefore examined the longitudinal association of HF self-care and HRQOL in a large cohort of patients with chronic HF. We extend previous work by examining whether differences in self-care within and between patients were related to HRQOL over time. Furthermore, as psychological distress adversely relates to HRQOL, 7, 11 we explored whether depression, anxiety, and Type D personality explained potential relations between self-care and HRQOL. METHODS Patients and procedure Consecutive patients attending the outpatient HF clinic of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden teaching hospital (Tilburg, the Netherlands) between October, 2003 and October, 2008 were approached for participation in a longitudinal study with five measurement occasions over a total follow-up of 18 months. 16, 17 Exclusion criteria comprised: diastolic HF, age 80 years, a myocardial infarction or hospitalization in the month prior to inclusion, a life-threatening disease with a life expectancy <1 year, serious psychiatric illness except mood disorders, or insufficient understanding and fluency of Dutch. Patients were informed about the study and recruited by their cardiologist or specialized HF nurse. If patients agreed to participate, they were called the same week to arrange a baseline appointment. At baseline, patients completed a psychological survey at home, which was returned in a self-addressed envelope. At 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up, patients were contacted to complete the psychological survey again. In case of missing items, patients were contacted by phone or e-mail in an attempt to obtain the missing answers. If the questionnaire was not returned within two weeks, patients received a reminder telephone call or letter. Of 570 eligible patients, 465 agreed to participate, 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 123 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 6124and 459 patients (81%) returned the baseline questionnaire. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The institutional medical ethics review boards of all participating hospitals approved the study protocol. Self-care The 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScB-9)18 was administered to assess self-care at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up. Items were rated on a 5- point Likert scale from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I completely disagree). To calculate sum scores, item scores were reversed with a possible range of 9 to 45. Raw sum scores were transformed into a standardized score from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better self-care. 19 It includes a 4-item 'consulting behavior' subscale that measures whether patients contact their physician in case of a sudden increase of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, ankle swelling, weight gain, and fatigue. The remaining items assess how patients judge their adherence to the most commonly recommended self-care behaviors: daily weight monitoring, limiting fluids, low sodium diet, regular exercise, and medication adherence. The internal consistency of the total self-care and its consultation scale were respectively acceptable (Cronbach's = .79) and good (Cronbach's = .87) at baseline. For descriptives, we split the person- mean of self-care (i.e. an individual's self-care scores averaged over all time points) at the median, to denote low and high self-care, as there are no well-validated cut-off values published in the literature. Health-related quality of life The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire was administered to assess HF- specific HRQOL at all time points.20, 21 The MLWHF is designed to assess the effects of HF symptoms, functional limitations, and psychological distress on the patient's quality of life. Twenty-one items are answered on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5. Higher scores indicate worse HF-specific HRQOL, with a difference of >5 denoting a clinically relevant change.22 It provides a total score that includes additional social, HF-specific, and health-care related items, as well as a physical and emotional dimensional subscale score. Depression The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)23 was used to assess depressive symptomatology, a well- validated self-report measure and found reliable to measure depressive symptomatology in patients with chronic HF. 24 Each item is rated on a 0-3 scale. A total score is obtained by the sum of all items. We had three assessments of depressive symptoms at baseline, 12-, and at 18-month follow-up. Internal consistency was good at all measurement occasions, with Cronbach's being .86, .83 and .82, respectively. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 124 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and health-related quality of life125 6Anxiety Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the two anxiety items (i.e. tension and restlessness) of the Symptoms of Anxiety-Depression index (SAD4) that has been shown to detect an increased risk of anxiety disorder in cardiac patients.25 Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale with a range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The internal consistency was high in this study (Cronbach's range = .87 to .92). Type D personality The 14-item Type D scale (DS14)26 assessed Type D personality, which is defined as the combination of the negative affectivity and social inhibition personality traits. Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true). The DS14 consists of two 7-item subscales, negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI), that are time-stable and internally consistent (Cronbach's = .88 / .86). 26, 27 In the current study, Cronbach's was .87 for NA and .84 for SI. The standardized cut-off score 10 on both subscales was used to classify individuals with a Type D personality.26 Sociodemographic and clinical covariates We included demographics (i.e. age, gender, educational level, living alone), cardiac history, and comorbidities. We did not include NYHA functional class, as its criteria largely overlap with the items of the MLWHF questionnaire. LVEF was also not included as a covariate as the majority of studies found no association with HRQOL.10, 11 Statistical analysis We examined the course of total, physical, and emotional HRQOL over all measurement occasions using pairwise comparisons. We stratified the course of HRQOL for above- and below-median level of total self- care. To analyze the effects of the level and change of self-care over time on the course of HRQOL, we conducted linear mixed modeling analyses (ML estimation; unstructured covariance matrix). We calculated the person-mean of self-care over the measurement occasions to address a between-subjects effect. Then, we calculated the deviation from this person-mean at each time point to get information on the person- specific change in self-care to address within-subjects effects. These two variables constituted our independent variables. Three separate analyses were performed for total, physical, and emotional HRQOL as outcome measures. Separate analyses were performed for total self-care and for the consultation behavior subscale.13 In step 1, the self-care variables (person-mean and deviation) were entered (Unadjusted model). In step 2, we adjusted the models for demographic (low education and living alone) and clinical (cardiac disease severity, and comorbidity) covariates. In a final step, we separately added depression, anxiety, and Type D personality. All illness-related and psychological covariates were time-varying, except for demographic variables and Type D personality. Estimates were reported, 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 125 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 6126which represent the unstandardized regression coefficients of the dependent variable when the independent variable increases with one unit. Analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp USA). Tests were two-tailed with a p-value <.05 indicating statistical significance. RESULTS Sample characteristics Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Patients with below-median scores of total self-care received less education and were more often living alone. They demonstrated less favorable health behaviors (reduced physical activity and higher BMI). The below-median self-care patients more often had a cardiac history and a larger comorbidity burden, as well as fewer implanted ICDs or pacemakers. Angiotensin-related medication and loop diuretics were less likely to be prescribed to the below median self-care group. Those low in self-care reported increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Type D personality tended to be more prevalent in the low self-care group. Health-related quality of life over time HRQOL differed over time (F = 3.96, p = .01), with pairwise comparisons showing that HRQOL was on average better at all follow-up occasions than at baseline (p <.04; Figure 1). At 1 year, HRQOL was better than at six months (p = .05), while at 18 months, HRQOL was not significantly different from HRQOL at 12-month follow-up. Physical and emotional subscale scores showed a main effect of time (F = 2.84, p = .04; F = 9.51, p <.001 respectively), although the pattern of differences was different. Physical HRQOL had a waveform with patients doing better at 1-year follow-up and moving back towards baseline levels at 18-month follow-up. Emotional HRQOL was worse at baseline compared to all other three follow-up occasions. More patients in the above-median self-care group (42%) showed a clinically relevant improvement in HRQOL over the first 6 months compared to the below-median self-care group (32%), which included a larger number of patients that significantly deteriorated (37% versus 29%). At 12 months, there were more deteriorating patients in the low self-care group (31% versus 22%). The percentage- improving patients was equal for low and high self-care. At 18 months, differences between low and high self-care groups altered, with a similar percentage of clinically relevant deterioration as compared to baseline in HRQOL (32 versus 27%) and more divergent percentages of patients clinically improving (32% versus 42%). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 126 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and health-related quality of life127 1.

Higher self-care was associated with better HRQOL over time, while within-person variation in self-care over time was unrelated to the level of HRQOL over time. After adjusting for established covariates (Step 2), the relation between self-care and HRQOL remained similar. Low education was a significant predictor of worse HRQOL. All three psychological distress variables were strongly related to total HRQOL. Depression shared almost all variance with self- care, as the estimate for self-care was reduced to nearly zero. Anxiety overlapped partly with self-care in explaining variance in HRQOL over time, indicating that self-care affected HRQOL independently from anxiety. Type D overlapped the least with self-care in explaining variance in HRQOL over time, with the estimate of self- care largely remaining similar to the estimate in the prior step. TABLE 2.

In unadjusted analyses, between-subject differences in self-care were significantly related to difference in physical and emotional HRQOL over time. This effect disappeared for emotional HRQOL in adjusted analyses. Low education and a larger comorbidity burden were both related to poorer physical, but not emotional HRQOL. It was shown that psychological distress was strongly related to poorer physical and emotional HRQOL. Higher self-care remained a predictor for better physical HRQOL when anxiety and Type D were included. Self-care no longer predicted emotional HRQOL when psychological distress variables were included. TABLE 3.

We found a main effect of between-subject differences (F = 16.74, p <.001) but no within-subject effects on consultation behavior (F = 1.25, p = .26) (Table 3). These main effects were similar for the physical (F = 17.55, p <.001; F = 1.56, p = .21) and emotional HRQOL (F = 8.95, p = .003; F = .001, p = .97) subcomponent. Between-subject differences in consultation behavior affected levels of HRQOL in unadjusted analyses; poorer consultation behavior was associated with worse HRQOL, and this remained significant and of similar size when adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Within-subject variation of reported consultation behavior over time was unrelated to HRQOL. When considering psychological distress, poorer consultation behavior remained a predictor for poorer HRQOL when anxiety and Type D were included. Depression reduced the effect of consultation behavior to non-significant. With respect to the physical and emotional subcomponents, similar patterns appeared as observed for total self-care. DISCUSSION The current study examined the association of self-care and HRQOL over a follow-up period of 18 months in 459 patients with chronic HF. Results led to two primary conclusions. First, between-subject but no within-subject changes in self-care were associated with HRQOL over time. Lower self-care was associated with poorer overall HRQOL as well as its physical and emotional subcomponents. Associations were robust since they were hardly affected by established covariates, and were similar for total self-care and the consulting for HF symptoms subscale. In the background of the inconsistent results published so far, the current study supports that HF self-care is prospectively associated with HRQOL. 11-14 Self-care was most relevant in terms of total HRQOL, which involved additional social, HF-specific, and health-care related items in comparison to the physical and emotional HRQOL subcomponents. This study extends previous work on the impact of psychological factors on cardiac disease28 by showing that psychological distress affected the relation between HF self-care and HRQOL negatively; either a substantial part or the entire relation was explained by psychological distress levels. Depression fully explained the relation between self-care and all HRQOL domains. While anxiety and Type D personality were related to poor HRQOL, they only explained the relation between self-care and emotional HRQOL. In line with the majority of studies, patients low in self-care reported higher levels of psychological distress.29 Depression, anxiety, and Type D personality should be considered in future attempts to address self-care and HRQOL. Why depression was more relevant with respect to self-care and physical HRQOL may be explained by its somatic-affective component greatly impacting physical function through direct and indirect effects. Research increasingly shows that somatic rather than cognitive depressive symptoms are related to poorer cardiovascular health, e.g., reduced heart rate variability,30 as well as increased mortality risk in HF.16 We hypothesize that somatic-affective symptoms may be of indirect influence on physical HRQOL, preventing patients from performing daily self-care behaviors. Another 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 131 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 6132reason may be negative cognitive bias often present in people with depressive symptoms leading to poor perceptions of both self-care and HRQOL.31 HRQOL improved over time, but this was not clinically significant (<5 points). Clinically significant deteriorations in HRQOL were observed more often in patients low in self-care, especially within the first year of follow-up. Against expectations, 13 within-person variations in self-care did not relate to changes in HRQOL. Perhaps, changes in self-care within a person are necessary to maintain stable physical and emotional homeostasis, which may therefore not be reflected in significant changes in HRQOL. Further studies are necessary to replicate and examine such a mechanism. Predictors of poor HRQOL other than self-care were low education and increasing CCI, which reflects the burden of comorbid conditions and aging. Further study should examine which components of psychological distress serve as potential mediators of the relation between self-care and HRQOL. Accumulating studies suggest that specific psychological characteristics or dimensions (e.g., anhedonia or somatic symptoms) of depression are more important with respect to specific facets of self-care 29 and HRQOL.32 Given the lack of effectiveness of self-care interventions on quality of life,15 interventions designed to improve self- care may have to incorporate the role of psychological distress to impact HRQOL. This is supported by a meta-analysis showing that face-to-face psychosocial interventions are beneficial in improving quality of life in chronic HF.33 There are several limitations. Self-care was assessed by means of self-report, which is subjective to systematic biases and may not reflect actual behavior.34 It would also have been preferable to use a more extensive anxiety measure or interview. The follow-up period of 18 months might have been too short to detect relevant changes in self-care and / or HRQOL. Our findings suggest that psychological distress mediates associations of self-care and HRQOL. This was not addressed with statistical methods as it diverted from the main aim of the study. Finally, given the observational nature of study design, no conclusions can be drawn regarding causality of relationships. Strengths of this study were the large sample size, the longitudinal design with self-care and HRQOL as time-varying variables, and the inclusion of psychological distress. Also, this is the first study that examines whether changes of self-care within a person were associated with changes in HRQOL. Advances in cardiovascular treatment have led to better survival rates. Consequently, the chronicity of HF continues to increase and the risk for hospitalization remains high. Clinicians are challenged to minimize devastating effects of HF on HRQOL, possibly through effective self-care. This study confirmed that self-care was associated with HRQOL, but this relation was greatly affected by psychological distress, primarily depression. Changes in self-care within a person over time did not contribute to HRQOL. From a clinical perspective, our results emphasize that psychological distress is essential in underlying the relation between self-care and HRQOL. Further research will enable us to gain better understanding of potential psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to overall HRQOL in patients with chronic HF. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 132 Ponikowski P , Poole-Wilson PA, et al.

The aim of the current study was to prospectively examine the association of self-reported HF self-care with serum levels of tumor (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10, estimated glomerular filtration rate hemoglobin (HgB) at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Methods: Consecutive outpatients with chronic HF (N = 460, 66.2 \u00b1 9.6 years, 75% male sex) completed questionnaires and provided blood samples at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Cytokines were log-transformed due to skewed distributions. Linear mixed multivariable models were used to examine the prospective associations of global self-care and the individual self-care behaviors with logTNF-, logIL-6, logIL-10, clinical covariates. Results: Global self-care was only associated with lower GFRcreat (estimate = -.09, p = .017). With respect to the individual self-care behaviors, multivariable associations were found for regular physical exercise and higher GFRcreat (estimate = 1.72, p = .006), lower logIL-6 (estimate = -.04, p <.001) and logIL-10 (estimate = -.02, p = .047) concentrations. Daily weight monitoring was associated with increased TNF- (estimate = .01, p = .022). Fluid restriction was associated with lower GFRcreat (estimate = -1.23, p = .022) while low sodium intake was associated with lower HgB (estimate = -.10, p <.001) and anti- inflammatory IL-10 (estimate = -.03, p = .012). Conclusions: Global self-care was prospectively associated with renal dysfunction. Regular exercise was consistently associated with better pathophysiological function, whereas fluid- and sodium restriction and daily weight monitoring were associated with worse renal, hematological function, and increased inflammatory activity, respectively. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 136 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and pathophysiological function137 7INTRODUCTION Chronic heart failure (HF) is among the leading causes of hospital admissions and mortality in developed countries, affecting about 15 million people across Europe.1, 2 The prevalence is expected to increase due to the aging of the population, which places a significant clinical and economic burden to society.3 Despite therapeutic advances and a decrease in admission rates for HF, effective management of HF remains challenging for both health care providers and patients with chronic HF. In addition to medical treatment, patients with HF are recommended to perform a complex regimen of multiple self-care behaviors (i.e. sodium and fluid restriction, regular exercise, medication adherence, monitoring and consulting for HF symptoms). 4 It is assumed that HF self-care is associated with better health outcomes (e.g., quality of life, hospital admissions, and mortality), but the available evidence is inconsistent.5 Potential mechanisms have been proposed suggesting that self-care benefits HF outcomes via neurohormonal and inflammatory function. 6 To date, only one cross-sectional study has been published showing an association between self-care management (i.e. evaluation of symptoms and treatment effects) and reduced myocardial stress and systemic inflammation in a sample of 168 patients with HF. 7 Intriguingly, those reporting to be highest in self-care management were at increased risk for myocardial stress and inflammation. However, the sample size was relatively small and findings were restricted to self-care management; no associations were found for other elements of self-care such as dietary restrictions. Emerging evidence shows the prognostic importance of cardiorenal and hematological function in patients with chronic HF. 8 Due to chronic volume overload, chronic HF is associated with progressive renal dysfunction, impaired renal perfusion, and excessive production of vasoconstrictive neurohormones. 9 Renal dysfunction and associated elevated inflammation may lead to a decrease in erythropoietin levels and reduced hematopoietic proliferation, evolving into anemia.10 Chronic anemia is associated with reduced tissue oxygenation, which, in HF patients, results in hemodynamic compensatory responses to enhance oxygen carrying capacity, thereby worsening cardiac function. As self-care behaviors intend to reduce volume overload and avoid decompensation, they might relate to markers of the cardiorenal syndrome of chronic HF. No prior study has examined the longitudinal relationship between self-care and pathophysiological markers of HF disease severity. 11 Therefore, the aim of this study was to prospectively examine the association of self-reported HF self-care with serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10 as markers of inflammation, estimated glomerular filtration rate of creatinine (GFRcreat) and hemoglobin (HgB) as markers of renal and hematological function, respectively, at baseline and 1-year follow-up. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 137 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 7138METHODS Study population and design Consecutive outpatients with chronic HF were recruited between October 2003 and 2008 from three general hospitals in the Netherlands (Amphia Hospital, Breda; Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg; Zorgsaam Hospital, Terneuzen). Information on study design and inclusion procedures have been published before.12 Inclusion criteria were: a confirmed diagnosis of HF with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) function class I-III, stable on HF medication, and age 80 years. Exclusion criteria were: a hospital admission one month prior to inclusion, other life-threatening conditions with a life expectancy <1 year, psychiatric comorbidity (except for anxiety and / or depression), severe cognitive impairment, or insufficient competence of the Dutch language. The cardiologists or HF nurses approached eligible patients for participation during an outpatient clinic visit. An independent study investigator called invited patients to schedule a baseline appointment in which they were given additional information about the study protocol before signing informed consent. After their baseline study appointment and at 12-month follow- up, participants completed questionnaires at home to assess sociodemographic and psychological variables including HF self-care that were returned within two weeks by mail in a stamped and pre- addressed envelope. Questionnaires were checked for completeness. Participants were contacted in the event of a missing questionnaire or items. Venous blood samples were drawn for cytokines measurement and clinical laboratory values during daytime in a planned outpatient clinic visit at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Participants were instructed not to exercise, smoke or drink prior to their blood draws, and were told to reschedule when ill (cold or fever). In total, 709 patients were eligible and invited to participate in the study of which 548 patients (77%) finally participated. Blood collection at baseline was not available for 52 participants and 36 participants were excluded due to missing data on any of the baseline clinical variables or questionnaires. The final sample included 460 participants with complete data at baseline. A flow- chart of inclusion is presented in Figure 1. Data originated from two observational cohort studies for which ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees of all participating hospitals. The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Self-care We used the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale (EHFScB-9)13 to assess self-care at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I completely disagree). Item scores were reversed in order to calculate sum scores with a possible range of 9 to 45. Scores were then transformed into a standardized score from 0 to 100, 14 with higher scores reflecting better self-care. The EHFScB-9 includes a 4-item 'consulting behavior' subscale that measures whether patients contact their doctor / nurse in case of shortness of breath, ankle swelling, weight gain, and fatigue. According to most recent psychometric insights,14 two adherence (weight monitoring, limiting fluids, and exercising regularly) and provider based-adherence (taking a low sodium diet, taking medication as prescribed). The reliability of total self-care scale and its three subscales in the current database at baseline and 12-month follow-up varied considerably with Cronbach's = .79 for the total scale, = .86 for the consulting scale, = .37 for the autonomy based adherence scale, and = .24 for the provider-based adherence scale. Due to these low internal consistencies, we decided not to use the autonomy- and provided based-adherence scales. We included the global self-care score and the consultation score in our main analysis. In addition, we analyzed the individual self-care items.

Flow chart of inclusion 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 139 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 7140Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics Sociodemographic variables were assessed at baseline using purpose-designed items including educational level (primary school or less versus >8 years of education), current smoking-, marital- (alone versus having a partner), and employment status (yes / no). Patients' medical records were searched for information on body mass index (BMI), disease characteristics (i.e. (ischemic) etiology, LVEF, NYHA function class), cardiac history of previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and pharmaceutical treatment (e.g., beta- blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and The presence of the following medical co-morbidities was documented: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastrointestinal disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease including transient ischemic attack, liver disease, and renal failure. Measurements Venous blood samples were drawn and centrifuged at baseline and at 12-month follow-up of which procedures have extensively been published before. 15, 16 Renal function was measured according to the K/DOQI-guidelines17 by calculating the glomerular filtration rate of creatinine. The MDRD equation defined as GFRcreat <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 was used to define renal dysfunction.18 Inflammatory biomarker data (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10) were available for a subsample, as the blood substudy started later, and obtained using standard hospital protocol. Venous blood samples were drawn and centrifuged. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 20 minutes and centrifuged. Aliquoted serum samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C in anticipation of further processing. Concentrations of IL-6 assay (Immulite 1000, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Breda, the Netherlands). All tests were measured in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The sensitivity of all tests was calculated as the mean of six zero-values plus three SDs extrapolated on the standard curve. The intra-assay variation was less than 10%, and the inter-assay variation less than 11%. Plasma hemoglobin (HgB) was determined using the Siemens ADVIA 120 Hematology system in the hospitals' central Clinical Chemistry & Hematology Laboratory as an indicator of anemia. 16 Continuous levels of HgB were used in the analyses due to the lack of a clear definition of anemia. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 140 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and pathophysiological function141 7Statistical analysis For comparison, group differences in baseline characteristics were analyzed for (a) patients with and without complete data at baseline and / or 12-month follow-up, and for (b) patients with and without biomarker data using Student's t-tests for independent samples and Chi-square tests (Fischer's exact test when appropriate) for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. All markers were tested for outliers of >3 SDs, which were excluded from further analyses. Prior to running analyses, skewed data were log-transformed. Pearson correlations were calculated for baseline levels of GFRcreat, HgB, TNF-, IL-10, and IL-6 with self-care. Descriptive baseline statistics were run for the participants stratified by above and below the median longitudinal person-mean level of self-care using Student's t-tests for independent samples and Chi-square test for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. For descriptive purposes, baseline sociodemographic, clinical, and pathophysiological characteristics were provided for the total sample and for those stratified by above and below median longitudinal person-mean level of total self-care due to the lack of a well-validated cut-off score. Separate linear mixed models with Maximum Likelihood estimation (covariance type: unstructured) were used to examine longitudinal associations between continuous self-care (time-varying independent variable) and continuous levels of pathophysiological markers (dependent variables) of renal and hematological function and inflammation at baseline and 12-month follow-up. In the first models, time and self-care were added as predictors of each pathophysiological marker. Second, we adjusted for sociodemographic and health behavioral fixed covariates that were chosen a priori based on their established association with the pathophysiological marker of interest and / or self-care including age, sex, partner status, education, current smoking status, BMI, and diabetes. 10 In final models, we adjusted for HF disease severity (NYHA function class and LVEF), time since diagnosis in years and prescribed medication (i.e. angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and creat and HgB10; aspirin for inflammatory cytokines). To examine the relative contribution of each self-care behavior to pathophysiological function, multivariable linear mixed models were repeated with the consultation subscale score and the individual self-care item scores as time-varying independent variables for each pathophysiological outcome as a time- varying dependent variable. A two-tailed p-value <.05 was considered of statistical significance and all analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 141 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 7142RESULTS Descriptive statistics The total sample included 548 patients, who did not differ significantly from non-responders in sociodemographic baseline characteristics. Of the total sample, 460 patients (mean age 66.2 \u00b1 9.6 years, 75% male sex) provided complete questionnaire and blood data at baseline and / or 12-month follow-up, constituting our final sample. No differences were found between included and excluded (N = 88) patients in any of the sociodemographic characteristics. With respect to clinical characteristics, excluded patients were characterized by a poorer LVEF (30% versus 32%, p = .016) and increased prescription of diuretics (85% versus 73%, p = .016) compared with included patients. Data on inflammatory biomarkers were available in a subsample of 306 patients that were characterized by a higher LVEF (32% versus 30%, p <.001) and a lower class (I-II class: 81% versus 50%, p <.001), indicative of better cardiac function, but more likely to have COPD (20% versus 13%, p = .025) compared with those of whom no inflammatory data was available. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the final sample at baseline are presented in Table 1. For descriptive purposes, non-transformed levels of pathophysiological outcomes at baseline and 12-month follow- up are illustrated in Figure 2, stratified by dichotomized total self-care (median split). Global self-care and pathophysiological outcomes Linear mixed modeling results showed that GFRcreat levels did not change significantly over time from baseline to 12-month follow-up (F = .23, p = .632) (Table 2). In unadjusted analysis, better total self-care was significantly associated with decreased GFR creat over time (F = 6.59, p = .011), indicative of poorer renal function. This association remained significant after controlling for baseline sociodemographic and health behavioral covariates (F = 6.82, p = .009). In the final model, self-care remained associated with lower GFR creat (F = 5.39, p = .021) beyond clinical covariates. Significant covariates of decreased GFRcreat in the final model were increasing age, lower LVEF, and prescribed diuretics. Time effects differed for type of cytokine. In unadjusted models, there was no significant effect of time for logTNF- (F = 1.97, p = .162). However, logIL-6 decreased significantly over time (F = 10.34, p = .002) and logIL-10 increased over time (F = 18.77, p <.001), indicative of less inflammatory activity.

Abbreviations: GFRcreat, glomerular filtration rate of creatinine; IL, alpha. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 147 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 7148Next, multivariable linear mixed models were run to examine the association of each self-care behavior with the pathophysiological markers while adjusting for the same covariates as tested in the models for total self-care (Table 3). Correlations between the individual self-care items were moderate ranging between .07 and .40, therefore not violating the assumption of risk for multicollinearity by testing all behaviors in one model. Multivariable results showed that increased daily weight monitoring was significantly associated with higher logTNF-. Fluid restriction was associated with reduced GFRcreat whereas low sodium intake was significantly associated with reduced concentrations of HgB and logIL-10. In contrast, regular physical exercise was significantly associated with higher GFRcreat and lower logIL-6 and logIL-10 concentrations. Consulting behavior and medication adherence were not associated with any of the markers in multivariable analyses. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that examined the association of self-reported HF self-care and important pathophysiological processes related to inflammation, cardiorenal- and hematological function in a fairly large cohort of 460 patients with chronic HF. We found a robust prospective association between better global self-care and renal dysfunction beyond other clinical covariates, such as HF disease severity and diabetes. Global self-care was not related to HgB or inflammatory markers. Critically, we showed that distinctive self-care behaviors were differentially associated with the pathophysiological outcomes. In line with the literature, 19-23 regular physical exercise was robustly associated with less inflammation and better hematological and renal function. Same trends were found for medication adherence and better pathophysiological function. In contrast, fluid and sodium restriction were associated with poorer renal and hematological function, respectively. In addition, daily weight monitoring was associated with higher TNF-, indicative of increased inflammation. Low sodium intake was associated with lower anti-inflammatory IL-10, thus more inflammation. Against initial expectations, we found no evidence for a relation between global self-care and pathophysiological function with the exception of renal dysfunction. A possible explanation may be that self-care as assessed by the EHFScB-9 does not represent a homogenous construct, especially not in the context of explanatory mechanisms and HF outcomes. While the psychometric reliability for the total self-care scale is satisfactory, this seems most contributable to the high internal consistency of the consultation subscale. Moreover, internal consistencies were extremely low for the remaining self-care subscales including fluid- and sodium restriction, daily weighing, regular physical exercise, and medication adherence. When examining the associations of these individual self-care behaviors with pathophysiological function, distinctive and even contrasting patterns were found, that possibly serve as an explanation for the lack of associations found for global self-care. Our findings are consistent with the notion that HF signs and symptoms may play an important role in driving self-care in chronic diseases. 7, 24 The necessity of performing health behaviors to monitor 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 148 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and pathophysiological function149 7and manage symptoms becomes relevant or perhaps instructed by health care providers once HF pathogenic function starts to worsen. This is in line with the findings reported by Lee et al. who found that HF patients performing well with regard to self-care management were at increased risk for myocardial stress and inflammation. 7 From these findings, it should be examined whether patients need to alter their self-care habits in an earlier, perhaps preclinical phase of their disease. It is possible that increased self-care in patients with HF involves an appropriate response to disease progression and, thus, also represents a clear marker of worsening clinical condition. It is unclear whether all self-care behaviors are equally beneficial within each phase of HF disease progression and / or for every patient with HF. Given that chronic HF is a complex systemic disease, patients varying in disease severity may respond differently to self-care behaviors. Importantly, recommendations on level of sodium restriction have been mainly based on research among patients with hypertension 25 and less on patients with HF. Recent studies increasingly show that the amount of sodium intake as well as HF disease severity are important factors to consider in terms of long term prognosis. For instance, a <3 g/day sodium intake was only beneficial in terms of prognosis in patients with advanced HF (NYHA function class III or IV) and not in patients with mild HF. 26, 27 Another study showed that (too) strict sodium restriction of <1.8 g/day was associated with activation of neurohormones and cytokines and body dehydration, thus worsening outcomes in patients with advanced HF.28 In our current study, fluid- and sodium restriction and prescribed diuretics were associated with worse pathophysiological function. While we assessed self-care by means of self- report, our findings conform to the results from studies that assessed fluid- and sodium restriction with objective measures, for instance with 24-hour urine collection logs. A critical examination of potential harms and benefits of fluid- and sodium restriction and diuretic dose in terms of long-term prognosis may be needed while considering the different stages of HF disease severity in future research. Regular physical exercise was consistently associated with more favorable HF pathophysiological function beyond clinical parameters of HF disease severity. This emphasizes the importance of physical activity in the context of maintaining health in HF. 23 In contrast, fluid- and sodium restriction were associated with cardiorenal dysfunction and lower HgB concentrations, respectively, whereas weight monitoring was associated with increased inflammation as indicated by higher TNF- levels. Counterintuitively but supported by recently published evidence,26-28 our results may also suggest a potential harmful effect of extensive dietary restricting behaviors on pathophysiological function in patients with HF. Accordingly, it seems unlikely that correction and / or intensification of all HF self-care behaviors will simply lead to improved pathophysiological function; relations are complicated by a multitude of clinical interacting factors. Renal dysfunction, neurohormonal and pro-inflammatory activation, and anemia are complexly interacting systems in the pathogenesis of HF. 10 With respect to cytokines, IL-6 concentrations affect TNF- (-) and IL-10 (+) concentrations. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in turn, are inversely associated with HgB concentrations and contribute to the development of anemia by multiple mechanisms. For instance, TNF- and IL-6 have been shown to inhibit erythropoietin 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 149 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 7150production in the kidney as well as the function of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow.29-31 These mutual interactions may also affect their relations with self-care. Thus, self-care may alter pathophysiological function and vice versa. Future research is needed to examine these potential interacting mechanisms. In accordance with previous findings and according to expectations, several sociodemographic and clinical covariates of pathophysiological outcomes were found. Diabetes, a well-known risk factor for HF disease progression, 32-34 was consistently associated with increased inflammation and poor hematological function in our study. Increasing age was associated with increased systemic inflammation and renal dysfunction. Higher NYHA functional class, female sex, and prescribed diuretics were associated with lower HgB concentrations which has also been reported in earlier studies. e.g., 10, 22 Other significant predictors of renal dysfunction were lower LVEF and prescribed diuretics. Increasing BMI was associated with increased systemic inflammation, but also with better hematological function. This latter finding fits the 'obesity paradox' in HF, a phenomenon showing that overweight and mild / moderate obesity are associated with a mortality benefit with complex underlying pathophysiological processes. 35 Findings from this study should be interpreted in the background of several limitations. First, self- care was assessed with a self-report measure, which is an easy and preferred assessment method in clinical practice that aims but does not reflect actual behavior. Self-report measures are complicated by systematic biases and it is therefore recommended to include multiple measurement strategies to assess self-care behavior.36 Also, we used single items to examine individual self-care behaviors. While there are several limitations to the use of single-item measures, they are shown reliable as health measures.37 As blood collection started at a later time point within the study data collection, cytokine levels were assessed in a subsample of patients who were characterized by better cardiac function. However, we aimed to take these clinical differences into account by including cardiac disease severity in our multivariable analyses. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to causality as results were based on observational data. Moreover, a 1-year time distance may be too short to actually pick up higher frequency variation in symptom exacerbations and self-care responses, and may be too short to pick up large shifts in health. In conclusion, global self-care was prospectively associated with renal dysfunction as indicated by lower GFR creat in a cohort of 460 patients with chronic HF over 12 months of follow-up. No associations were found between global self-care and respectively HgB concentrations and inflammation. Regarding individual self-care behaviors, physical exercise and medication adherence were associated with less pathophysiological dysfunction. Fluid restriction, low sodium intake, and daily weight monitoring were associated with worse renal, hematological function, and increased inflammatory activity, respectively. However, methodological limitations prevent us from drawing any directive conclusions. Future studies are required that use multiple self-care measurement strategies and distinguish between separate self-care behaviors in order to understand the complex mechanisms between actual self-care and Ponikowski P , Poole-Wilson PA, et al.

Background: Although self-care is crucial to maintain health in patients with chronic HF, studies examining an association with clinical outcomes are scarce. Methods: Consecutive patients with chronic HF (N = 559, mean age 66.3 \u00b1 9.5 years, 78% men) completed the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale. Our endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations between self-care and all-cause mortality were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression accounting for standard sociodemographic and clinical covariates, psychological distress, and self-rated health. Results: After a median follow-up of 5.5 \u00b1 2.4 years (range, 16 weeks-9.9 years), 221 deaths (40%) from any cause were recorded. There was no evidence of a mortality benefit in patients high over those low in global self-care (p = .71). In post-hoc analyses, low self-reported sodium intake was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR = 1.47, 95% CI [1.10-1.96], p = .01). Other significant predictors of mortality were: male sex, lack of a partner, NYHA functional class III-IV, and increasing co-morbid conditions. Conclusions: Global self-care was not associated with long-term mortality whereas low self- reported sodium intake independently predicted increased all-cause mortality beyond parameters of disease severity. Replication of findings is needed as well as studies examining the correspondence of subjectively and objectively measured sodium intake and its effects on long-term prognosis in patients with chronic HF. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 154 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and all-cause mortality155 8INTRODUCTION Chronic heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of (re-) hospitalization and death,1 and a significant clinical and economic burden for health care systems of developed countries.2 Besides established risk factors, poor HF outcomes have been attributed to poor HF self-care.3 Self-care refers to the complex regimen patients with chronic HF are instructed to undertake in order to maintain their health, e.g., sodium- and fluid restriction, weight monitoring, and medication adherence. While it is assumed that self-care is associated with improved outcomes, the available evidence is less clear. Preliminary findings suggest a potentially beneficial relationship between self-care and event- free survival that is predominantly due to fewer hospitalizations.4, 5 Methodological limitations leave uncertainties about a relationship with mortality rates. Previous studies comprised mostly small samples and were limited in follow-up period (<2 years). Studies that focused on distinct self-care behaviors showed that medication non-adherence was associated with increased risk for adverse cardiac events in patients with HF 6 while low sodium intake was associated with increased event free survival (i.e. hospitalization or death).7 Until now, HF-targeted disease management programs that emphasize self-care have repeatedly been associated with decreased hospital readmission, but evidence on mortality rates is lacking. 8 Given the dearth of evidence in terms of long-term mortality, we aimed to examine the association of self-reported self-care with all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with chronic HF. We hypothesized that self-care was associated with a greater benefit in long-term prognosis. Post-hoc analyses were performed in order to examine the association of each individual self-care behavior (e.g., low sodium intake) with mortality. METHODS Participants and procedure Eligibility requirements and inclusion procedures have been described previously.9 Between 2003 and 2008, patients with chronic HF were consecutively recruited from three cardiology outpatient clinics from hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria comprised a diagnosis of chronic systolic HF, LVEF 40%, age 80 years, stable on oral HF medication for 1 month, and absence of a myocardial infarction or hospital admission in the month prior to inclusion. Patients were treated optimally according to prevailing HF guidelines. 10 Patients were excluded in the case of other life-threatening co-morbidities with a life expectancy <1 year, psychiatric comorbidity except for mood disorders, severe cognitive impairment (e.g., documented dementia or Alzheimer's, extracted from medical records), or insufficient Dutch linguistic competence. In total, 709 eligible patients were approached for participation by their treating cardiologist or nurse during their outpatient visit to the cardiology department. If willing to participate, patients were called within two weeks by an independent investigator to schedule a study appointment 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 155 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 8156in which additional verbal and written information about the study was provided. Patients signed informed consent before participation. To guarantee anonymity, study numbers were assigned to each participant that were only available for members of the research team. Patients completed a questionnaire at home to assess socio-demographic, psychological variables, and HF self-care that was returned in a stamped and pre-addressed envelope. We checked for missing items accordingly and patients were contacted when a questionnaire was not returned within two weeks or in case of missing items. Our final sample consisted of 559 patients (response rate = 79%). This is a secondary analysis of data originated from two observational prospective studies9, 11 for which ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees of all hospitals. The investigation conforms the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Self-care HF self-care was assessed using the 9-item version of the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour (EHFScB-9) scale (Figure 1). 12 Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I do not agree at all). Scores ranged from 9 to 45 with higher scores reflecting worse self- care. The total scale consists of a 4-item consulting behavior subscale that assesses whether patients contact their physician when HF-specific symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, weight, fatigue) increase.11 Psychometric properties of the EHFScB-9 have been shown reliable for the total scale and consultation behavior subscale previously.13 Cronbach's was .80 for the total scale indicating good internal consistency in this dataset. Median split was used to distinguish between patients high versus low in global self-care since no validated cut-off score is available for the EHFScB-9. Scores of 21 and 9 were used to define low (i.e. worse) global self-care and consulting behavior, respectively. Low performance of each separate self-care behavior was categorized with a score of 3. A sensitivity analysis was performed with a standardized cut-off score of 70 indicating better self-care, which corresponds with the recommended cut-off point for another well-known self-care measure, i.e. the Self-Care Heart Failure Index scale. 14 Covariates We used purpose-designed items in the questionnaires to assess socio-demographic variables including educational level, current smoking status, partner status, and employment status. From patients' medical records, information was obtained on age, sex, disease characteristics (i.e. etiology, LVEF, NYHA functional class I-II versus III-IV), cardiac history (i.e. previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), serum sodium, and pharmaceutical treatment (e.g., beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, psychotropic medication). Body mass index was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 156 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and all-cause mortality157 8 Comorbidity at baseline was identified from searching patients' medical records. An abbreviated version of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)15 was used which included myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, renal dysfunction (i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a formal diagnosis of renal failure in the medical record), and cancer. The index was calculated by assigning a weight of 2 to renal dysfunction and cancer, and a weight of 1 to the other comorbid conditions. The final comorbidity score was the arithmetic sum of the value assigned to each identified condition. To minimize the number of predictors in the multivariable model, we accounted for increasing age by adding one point to the score for each decade of life >50 at baseline. Psychological distress was assessed with the short 4-item Symptoms of Anxiety-Depression Index (SAD 4) that has been validated in a post-MI population against generally accepted methods to assess psychological distress.16 The SAD4 assesses anxiety symptoms (i.e. tension and restlessness) and depressive symptoms (i.e. feeling blue and hopelessness). Items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Cronbach's was .86 in a previous study 16 and .90 in the current sample indicating excellent internal consistency. Elevated psychological distress was defined according to a previously defined cut-off score of 3. 16 Self-rated health was assessed with the general health item from the RAND 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36): \"In general, would you say your health is [...]\".17 The item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). A score of 4 was indicative of poor self-rated health. Items I completel y agree I don't agree at all 1. I weigh myself ever y day 1 2 3 4 5 2.

Information on mortality including date of death was collected in the first week of March, 2013 by checking patients' medical records and/ or by contacting the general practitioner. The median time of follow-up was 5.5 \u00b1 2.4 years. Death was recorded in 221 patients (40%). We classified cause of death into cardiac, HF-related or multisystem failure (N = 126) versus non-HF-related (N = 95) cause of death. The non-HF-related group, however, consisted for a substantial part out of patients with an unknown cause of death. Accordingly, it was chosen to use all-cause mortality as our endpoint. Statistical analyses Patients were classified into high or low global self-care performance and compared for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics using independent samples t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables and 2 test or Fisher exact tests for nominal variables. Person-years of follow-up were calculated from date of inclusion (i.e. baseline) until death, last follow-up visit, or March 1, 2013. To assess the impact of self-care at baseline on all-cause mortality, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and survival in patients performing high versus low self-care was compared using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The proportional hazards assumption was violated for self-care after inspection of the Log-minus-Log plots indicating that the effect of self-care on survival changed over time. When splitting the sample on HF-related (log-rank 2 = .009, p = .925) versus non-HF related (log-rank 2 = .539, p = .463) mortality, similar findings were found including a violation of the hazards assumption. In post-hoc analyses, cumulative Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed for the association of each individual key element of self-care with mortality. If the hazards assumption was held, Cox-proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship with all-cause mortality. Unadjusted and adjusted models were performed for relevant covariates that were selected a priori18 and entered using forced entry in a second block: sex, partner status, NYHA function class (III-IV), CCI, prescribed medication (i.e. beta-blockers and diuretics), current smoking status. In a third block, we controlled for elevated symptoms of anxiety/depression as well as for self-rated health given its predictive value in terms of mortality19 and significant correlations with self-care in the current study (r = .14, p = .001). A two-tailed p-value <.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance for all analyses. Analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 158 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and all-cause mortality159 8RESULTS Baseline characteristics In Table 1, we presented baseline characteristics for the total cohort and stratified for mortality status. Those deceased at follow-up were older, more often male, unemployed, and lower educated. With respect to clinical characteristics, those deceased had a lower LVEF, higher NYHA functional class, a higher comorbidity score, and lower levels of serum sodium. Deceased patients were less often prescribed with beta-blockers but more often with diuretics. Self-rated general health was poorer in patients that were deceased at follow-up. Elevated anxiety/depression was present in 33% of all patients and 55% rated their general health as poor. In Table 2, baseline characteristics were compared for patients reporting high versus low self-care. The incidence of mortality in patients performing high (40%) versus low (39%) self-care did not differ significantly. The prevalence rate of poor self- rated health was significantly higher among those performing low self-care. High self-care performers were more likely to have a partner, lower body mass index scores, to be prescribed with angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics, and not smoking compared with low self-care performers (Table 2). Self-care and all-cause mortality The proportional hazards assumption for self-care was violated given the crossing lines at multiple time points, indicating that the effect of global self-care on survival changed over time (Figure 2A). For all covariates, the hazards assumption was met. No significant difference in survival was found between those performing high self-care (mean survival 6.7 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) [6.4 to 7.2]) and those performing low self-care (mean survival 6.9 years, 95% CI [6.5 to 7.3]) (log-rank 2 = .139, p = .710) (Figure 2A). Sensitivity analyses with a standardized score of 70 indicating better global self-care did not lead to different results (high self-care mean survival = 6.7 years versus 6.9 years in those with low self-care; log-rank 2 = 1.46, p = .23). No differences were found between those high versus low in self-reported daily weight monitoring, fluid restriction, consultation behavior, regular exercise, and medication adherence. With respect to low sodium intake though, the cumulative hazard survival curve differed significantly between patients highly limiting their sodium intake (mean survival time = 6.6 years, 95%CI [6.3 to 6.9]) versus those low (mean survival time = 7.2 years, 95% CI [6.8 to 7.6]) in limiting their sodium intake (log-rank 2 = 4.95, p = .026) (Figure 2B). In unadjusted Cox regression analysis, low self-reported sodium intake (HR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.04 to 1.84], p = .03) was significantly associated with an increased mortality risk. After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, low sodium intake (HR = 1.47, 95% CI [1.10 to 1.97], p = .01) remained associated with an increased risk for mortality. In the final block controlling for psychological distress and self-rated health, low sodium intake still predicted mortality. Other multivariable predictors of all-cause mortality were male sex, NYHA function class III-IV, CCI, and the lack of a partner (Table 3). 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 159 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 8160TABLE 1.

Cumulative survival curve for (A) global self-care, (B) low sodium intake, respectively, and all-cause mortality DISCUSSION This is one of the first studies investigating the association of self-reported self-care with long-term all-cause mortality in a fairly large cohort of patients with chronic HF. However, neither global self- care nor any of the individual self-care behaviors predicted all-cause mortality except for low sodium intake. Patients reporting high self-care differed from those low in self-care in baseline characteristics but this did not seem to explain the lack of an association with mortality. No differences were found with respect to HF disease severity or other comorbid conditions, but those high in self-care were more likely to be prescribed with HF medication. They were also more likely to have a healthier life 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 162 05-01-16 10:23Self-care and all-cause mortality163 8(-style) in general, to have a partner and a higher educational level compared with those low in self-care, reflecting that social support and education level contribute to effective self-care.20 Other predictors of all-cause mortality in the current study were male sex, NYHA function class, comorbid conditions and lack of a partner, which is in accordance with the current literature. 18 Despite assumed benefits of self-care on prognosis, our finding is in line with the available literature; none of the prior studies have been successful in demonstrating an association between self-care and mortality, only with fewer hospital readmissions.4, 21 Systematic reviews documented that HF-targeted and self-care education interventions seemed effective in decreasing hospital readmissions, but not in mortality rates.8, 22 Similar findings have been reported for the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. Recent meta-analyses supported associations with fewer hospital readmissions, but not with mortality. e.g., 23 Only one randomized controlled clinical trial has documented an all-cause mortality benefit of a nurse-directed comprehensive chronic HF management program that was administered in a cardiac rehabilitation setting. It must be noted that the sample was small (N = 105) with a follow-up of 12 months, stressing the need for larger clinical trials with longer follow-ups replicating these, yet promising results. The absence of proof does not imply that self-care is not crucial in prolonging life expectancy. Although patients being poor in self-care are at increased risk for being hospitalized, medical treatment may ultimately prevent them from early deceasing. A recent study showed that poor self-rated health predicted increased healthcare utilization. 24 In our study, those low in self-care also tended to have poor self-rated health. Therefore, effective self-care remains important in the treatment of patients with chronic HF in order to decrease the clinical and economic burden of HF on the health care systems. 22 We found that low self-reported sodium intake was robustly associated with an increased mortality risk in post-hoc analyses, irrespective of important risk factors. A clear explanation why low sodium intake was adversely associated with prognosis cannot be provided, mainly because of the use of a single item to assess sodium restriction as well as the generally poor correspondence between self- report and objective measures of adherence. 25-28 This is further complicated by (potentially circulating) mechanisms underlying the association of self-reported sodium intake and medical outcome including treatment effects including self-care education and knowledge, and disease progression.29, 30 In advancing HF, both the physician and the patient may have an increased awareness of the importance of sodium restriction to prevent further decompensation. Future research is needed to replicate our findings and to examine the (a) ecological validity of self-reported sodium intake and (b) correspondence between self-reported low sodium intake with objective measures (e.g., urinary sodium) and its actual relationship with long-term mortality. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results. Foremost, self-care was assessed with a self-report measure, which has limitations such as recall bias and over- and underestimation. 26-28 The EHFScB-9 does not reckon with the disease stage of the individual patient nor is every patient recommended to each self-care behavior. It could be argued that the items lack specificity as they ask for general level of adherence that is greatly influenced by the subjective 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 163 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 8164interpretation of the patient. In general, it is recommended to use multiple types of self-care measures in order to assess 'real' self-care.29 However, the EHFScB-9 has been recommended as a reliable and valid self-care instrument.31 Other limitations were the lack of a validated cut-off score to compare high versus low self-care and the use of single items to assess the separate elements of self-care. Nevertheless, changing the cut-off score to 70 using a standardized self-care score did not lead to different results. We can only carefully hypothesize that (too) low sodium intake may be adversely associated with HF prognosis due to the psychometric limitations as well as potential multiple testing effects. Further, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the effect of change in self-care over time. However, self-care does not tend to change greatly over time.32 Finally, no information was available on re-hospitalization preventing us from running secondary analyses on cardiac events and HF-related hospitalization. This study is among the first that examined self-reported self-care in relation to mortality in a relatively large sample of >500 patients with a significant median length of follow-up of >5 years. While global HF self-care was not associated with all-cause mortality, low self-reported sodium intake predicted increased all-cause mortality beyond clinical and self-reported parameters of disease severity. Clinical perspectives Our findings indicate no association between self-reported self-care and long-term all-cause mortality. On the contrary, a negative association was found for low self-reported sodium intake and long-term prognosis. More awareness and research is therefore warranted on the clinical use and (psychometric) meaning of self-reported self-care in chronic HF in terms of prognosis, especially with respect to sodium intake. Translational outlook Based on our findings, more studies are needed to examine the correspondence between subjectively and objectively measured self-care, such as sodium intake, and its actual relationship with long-term prognosis. Large scale clinical trials of patients with newly diagnosed HF that are being followed over time in which subjective and objective measures of self-care are assessed would provide better insight into the long-term effects of self-care on prognosis. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 164 05-01-16 10:23Self-care Lloyd-Jones DM, Benjamin EJ, Berry JD, Borden WB, et al.

Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2015 [Epub ahead of 10:23Summary and general discussion169 9SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION Background and aims of this dissertation Heart failure is a malignant, clinical syndrome that, despite therapeutic advances, remains associated with increased morbidity, frequent hospitalizations, and poor long-term survival.1 The ongoing care of patients with chronic heart failure involves a vast amount of self-care, which refers to the constant actions by patients to manage symptoms, treatment, and lifestyle modifications that are fundamental in maintaining health and well-being.2 Poor self-care is common among patients with heart failure, which seems due to a multitude of factors such as poor self-care knowledge, comorbid conditions including cognitive dysfunction, and depression.3 It has been assumed that poor self-care may explain the relation between psychological distress and poor outcome. However, systematic proof supporting any of these relations is inconclusive in the heart failure population. 4 The first aim of this dissertation was to investigate current caveats in the evidence of psychological determinants of self-care. In a narrative review, we explored whether depression and Type D personality are associated with health outcomes in chronic heart failure, and discussed the potential behavioral (i.e. self-care) and pathophysiological mechanisms of this association. Next, it was prospectively examined whether fatigue, a common and complex symptom of chronic heart failure, contributed to poor self-care. Based on published differences in associations with clinical outcomes, 5 it was explored whether relationships varied for general fatigue, which includes mental fatigue, versus exertion fatigue, which is exclusively related to physical activity. Further, a longitudinal study examined the contribution of positive affect and anhedonia to self-care beyond depression; an area of research that is receiving increasing interest. Finally, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to examine the current evidence of psychological determinants of self-care. The second aim of this dissertation was to examine how self-care was related to several key patient- reported and clinical outcomes of heart failure over time. First, a longitudinal analysis was performed to examine the association of respectively (a) changes in self-care within and (b) differences in self- care between patients with long-term health-related quality of life. Next, we examined longitudinal associations between self-care and crucial heart failure-related pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, renal function, and anemia. Finally, we examined whether self-care was related to all-cause mortality at long-term follow-up (>5 years) in patients with chronic heart failure. Data collection This dissertation is based on secondary analyses of data collected in the Elisabeth-Tweesteden Heart Failure Cohort Study, an observational, longitudinal study in the Netherlands in which three teaching hospitals (Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg/Waalwijk; Amphia Hospital, Breda; and Zorgsaam Hospital, Terneuzen) participated. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of stable, chronic systolic heart failure, a New York Heart Association function class I-III, and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%) were consecutively recruited from cardiac outpatient clinics between October 17, 2003 and 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 169 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 9170October 3, 2008. Data were collected at baseline, and at 2 (only for a subsample), 6, 12, and 18 months after inclusion. Reasons for exclusion included a preserved ejection fraction (i.e. diastolic heart failure), age 80 years, a cardiac incident in the previous month, life-threatening illness with a life expectancy <1 year, severe cognitive dysfunction and/or psychiatric comorbidity with the exception of mood disorders, and insufficient understanding of the spoken and written Dutch language. Data collection procedures differed slightly with respect to choice of questionnaires and biological measures available between hospitals. Depending on the type of research question, sample sizes (N = 238 to 559) and follow-up duration (12 to 18 months) varied between the studies described in this dissertation. AN OVERVIEW AND DISCUSSION OF KEY FINDINGS PART I - Determinants of heart failure self-care: in search of evidence The evidence presented in Chapter 2 showed that depression and Type D personality were consistently associated with poor patient reported outcomes. However, depression was associated with only a small increased risk of hospital readmissions and/or mortality while no evidence supported such a relation for Type D personality. Besides methodological reasons, several clinical explanations were provided for these results as well. It was noted that psychological risk factors may play a minor role in affecting mortality as cardiac treatment has continued to improve over the years. Subsequently, mortality in the end stage of this condition is more likely to be determined by clinical predictors and multisystem failure than psychological factors.6 This may clarify why weaker effects and null-findings were generally published in more recent studies. With respect to behavioral pathways, depression and Type D personality have both been related to poor self-care and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, but inconsistencies across studies were underlined. Potential mediators of these relations were addressed, such as maladaptive coping, poor social support, and lower self-efficacy. Regarding pathophysiological pathways, there seems a potential role for the sympathetic nervous system, inflammation, and oxidative stress for both depression and Type D personality. Not all relations of presumed pathways discussed in this review have been confirmed among patients with heart failure, therefore limiting the validity and generalizability of findings, which necessitates future research. The results presented in Chapter 3 demonstrated that general and exertion fatigue were equally associated with poor global self-care as well as consulting behavior over 18-month follow-up in a cohort of patients with chronic heart failure. These associations were significant irrespective of parameters of heart failure disease severity, sleep disturbances, and psychological distress. Despite their similar relationship with poor self-care, general fatigue and exertion fatigue were associated with both unique and shared baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics indicating that they represent related but different dimensions. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 170 05-01-16 10:23Summary and general discussion171 9 Chapter 4 described the longitudinal associations at baseline and 1-year follow-up of several positive affect measures, anhedonia (i.e. a diminished interest in or pleasure in response to stimuli that were previously experienced as rewarding), and self-care while controlling for important covariates, including depression. The associations with poor self-care were most robust for anhedonia. Positive affect was associated with enhanced self-care beyond demographic and clinical covariates, but no longer when depression was taken into account. The systematic review and meta-analysis of psychological determinants of heart failure self-care Chapter 5 included data from 65 studies. A substantial number of studies were considered to have high risk of bias, primarily due to selection bias (67%). Quantitative data synthesis was possible for 42 studies and data were pooled for most commonly assessed determinants. Results showed that depression was associated with poor self-care, whereas self-efficacy (or self-care confidence) and mental well-being were associated with better self-care. Psychological factors were often related to specific facets of self-care. Depression was most robustly associated with poor physical exercise and increased delay (i.e. time between symptom onset and hospital admission). After qualitative data synthesis, health/self-care beliefs and anxiety were found to either complicate or enhance self-care, depending on the type of belief and type of anxiety. Critically, associations were mainly found with self-reported and not objective indices of self-care. Why depression has been associated with self-reported self-care and much less consistently with objective self-care remains largely unknown, but may be caused by methodological and sampling bias. Depressed patients may generally be more reluctant to participate in invasive or time-consuming studies that use daily monitoring equipment, blood serum or 24-hour urine samples to assess self- care. Aside from sampling bias, cognitive bias may explain the stronger relation with self-reported self- care which is reflected by an increased tendency to wrongly interpret situations and own behavior in a (too) negative manner which does not automatically corresponds with 'reality' . 7 PART II - The complexity of heart failure self-care and outcomes In Chapter 6, between-subject but not within-subject differences in self-care were shown to be associated with improved health related quality of life over a follow-up of 18 months in patients with chronic heart failure. Remarkably, psychological distress greatly affected the relation between self-care and health related quality of life, as it explained a considerable part (i.e. anxiety and Type D personality) or the entire relation (i.e. depression). It was also shown that psychological distress was significantly higher in patients with low self-reported self-care. Chapter 7 represents the first prospective study to date that examined the association of self- care and pathophysiological processes at baseline and 12-month follow-up in 460 patients with chronic heart failure. Remarkably, global self-care was associated with renal dysfunction and not with inflammation and anemia. In post-hoc analyses, distinct self-care behaviors were examined showing that regular exercise was consistently associated with less pathophysiological dysfunction whereas 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 171 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 9172limiting fluids, low sodium intake, and daily weight monitoring (i.e. treatment adherence) were associated with respectively worse renal function, anemia, and increased inflammation. The key finding of Chapter 8 was that global self-care was not associated with long-term all-cause mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. To date, self-care as well as heart failure specific disease management interventions have only been successful in decreasing hospitalizations. 8-11 Nonetheless, medical treatment during hospitalizations may prevent patients from deceasing, which may serve as a potential explanation for the lack of a relation between self-care and mortality. Remarkably, low sodium intake was associated with an increased mortality risk, even after adjustment for important parameters of disease severity. This finding fits the contemporary debate on potential health risks of (too) low sodium intake in the systolic heart failure population. 12, 13 A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON SELF-CARE: A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH What determines the level of self-care? Based on the existing literature, a large amount of factors are known to complicate effective self- care including comorbid conditions, older age, poor health literacy, cognitive impairment, low socio- economic status and low education, poor social support, sleep disturbances, polypharmacy, lack of disease experience, and poor knowledge.2, 3, 14-16 Poor self-care is also impacted by health care related factors such as poor access and communication2 and differences between health care professionals in their (perception of ) self-care education.17 In general, we found that patients with worse heart failure severity were more likely to report better levels of self-care. Also, while the existing literature does not support clear gender differences18, we did find that female patients reported better self-care. Remarkably, diabetes was associated with better self-care, which might be due to their experience with diabetes self-management. From this dissertation, we learned that the contribution of psychological factors to self-care is rather complex. We showed that the evidence for a relation between psychological factors and self-care is not straightforward. Relations vary for different self-care facets and can be influenced by many factors. Importantly, the facilitating role of positive psychological factors, e.g., self-efficacy, mental well-being, and positive affect, has been established in the current dissertation. We highlighted the mutual interaction among beliefs, personality, and emotions / affect of which their contribution is finally determined by their interaction with demographic, clinical, and contextual factors (PART I). This dissertation extends previous work by showing that fatigue (Chapter 3) and anhedonia (Chapter 4) were robust determinants of self-care, and may be crucial in (the sustainment of ) successful self-care. Potential deficits in the neural substrates of the hedonic response to rewards and motivation to pursue these health behavioral guidelines, may be underlying anhedonia, therefore complicating decision-making processes. 19 Anhedonia and fatigue are highly related but not exclusive to depression. Importantly, anhedonia can be a characteristic of other psychopathology as well such as anxiety, 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 172 05-01-16 10:23Summary and general discussion173 9personality disorders, or schizophrenia20, whereas fatigue can also be determined by clinical factors including cardiac pump dysfunction and sleep disturbances.21, 22 Accordingly, we propose that there are important non-rational factors at the unconscious level that contribute to the performance of self-care behaviors. Hence, self-care is not only the result of an active, naturalistic decision-making process; a definition of self-care that has been widely used and adapted in the current field.23 Elaborating further on existing dual-processing theories in social psychology on behavior, the performance of self-care is more likely determined by the complex interaction of (a) explicit (i.e. active, conscious, reasoning, and controlled) and (b) implicit (i.e. passive, unconscious, intuitive, and automatic) mental processes that is, in turn, affected by cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms. 24, 25 Patient complexity and self-care: the balance between capacity and workload Evidently, heart failure self-care is difficult to define and predict. Self-care has been assumed to benefit outcomes in patients with heart failure and, in recent decades, a great number of studies have been published to better understand and improve self-care. However, the current evidence of determinants of self-care shows a complex interaction among multiple variables (PART I) and so far, effects of intervention studies remain disappointing.26, 27 A clear relation with hard medical outcomes is lacking (PART II) and one may even question whether all facets of self-care are equally beneficial in terms of long-term outcomes. This dissertation has emphasized a complex interaction between self-care and health outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. It was shown that self-care was related to better health-related quality of life, however, this was greatly influenced by psychological distress, predominantly by depression. Changes in self-care within a patient did not contribute to the level of well-being, but more important were overall level of self-care and psychological distress. It was hypothesized that self-care changes within a person are needed to maintain physiological homeostasis, thus not leading to significant changes in overall well-being (Chapter 6). Relations between self-care and pathophysiological processes and outcomes (all-cause mortality) were not as clear-cut as one might assume. Different mechanisms seem to apply for distinct elements of self-care. Also, we showed a potential interaction between self-care and the amount of cardiac care received as patients low in self-care were less likely to be treated with implantable device therapy and standard heart failure pharmacotherapy despite their increased (non-) cardiac burden (Chapter 6). Thus, self-care is not solely determined by the sum of individual psychological components such as self-care knowledge and motivation (PART I). Neither is it automatically related to health benefits (PART II). Given this complexity, it is more likely that self-care is inherently related to the balance between the total of daily demands (i.e. workload), which includes self-care, and the abilities (i.e. capacity) of a patient to handle these demands. This complex mechanism has been theoretically well-defined in the comprehensive Cumulative Complexity Model by Shippee. 28 This model illustrates 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 173 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 9174how patient complexity interacts with disease progression of which its perceived burden serves as a feedback loop that, constitutes an accumulating cycle of (a) further deterioration of the patient capacity and (b) intensification of patient workload.28 Based on the existing literature and our findings, we applied the Cumulative Complexity Model to the heart failure population while integrating self-care. A graphical representation of this model is illustrated in Figure I.

The Cumulative Complexity Model for patients with chronic heart failure Based on this model, it is comprehensively illustrated how self-care in patients with chronic heart failure is both determined by and related to health outcomes. While self-care is (a) clearly part of the patient workload, it also shows that (b) the level of self-care performance is determined by the balance of the patient capacity and workload and that (c) self-care mediates the relation with outcomes that, in turn, serve as a feedback loop. Originally, self-care is aimed to decrease the burden of illness, which would enhance the patient capacity by improving pathophysiological function (e.g., less fatigue; Chapter 3, 7). However, this model also clarifies why self-care can be considered as a marker of (heart failure) disease severity and, moreover, can induce a greater burden of treatment. This supports our finding that better global self-care was associated with renal dysfunction (Chapter 7). Increasing disease severity (e.g., fluid retention, decompensating symptoms, renal failure) requires intensification of treatment, hence self-care, which subsequently affects the patient capacity-workload balance by an increased burden of the heart failure condition and treatment. Thus, self-care is both part of 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 174 05-01-16 10:23Summary and general discussion175 9as well as the result of the patient workload-capacity balance, associated with outcomes that, in a feedback loop, affect this balance, in both positive and negative manners. Clearly, mechanistic (and experimental) research would be the best way forward in our quest to better understanding of the complex relationships between psychological factors, self-care, and health outcomes in the chronic heart failure population. IMPLICATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE A general conclusion from the present dissertation is that there is a considerable amount of methodological heterogeneity and shortcomings across and within studies. This dissertation has raised several issues with respect to the assessment of self-care, such as heterogeneity in measurement methods and conceptual concerns. First, to reduce the gaps in our understanding of self-care, it is recommended to use existing, well-validated measures, i.e. the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior scale or the Self-Care Heart Failure Index.29 Despite their thorough psychometric testing, our findings indicated that the individual self-care elements (e.g., exercise versus sodium intake) have distinct determinants and are not equally related to important heart failure outcomes. Therefore, global self- care does not represent a homogenous construct. Researchers are recommended to adapt a tailored approach in examining (mechanisms of ) self-care, while using (and improving) multiple instruments and distinguishing between self-care elements. Furthermore, the current knowledge from this dissertation is predominantly based on self-reported self-care, which is an easily performed and low-cost method, and therefore highly preferred in both research and clinical practice. However, studies have shown differences in adherence rates between self-report measures and more objective indicators of self-care. 30 In general, self-report measures have been associated with higher adherence rates when compared with objective methods.31 We extend to this by showing that psychological factors were mainly related to self-reported self-care and less consistently associated with self-care that was assessed with more objective methods (Chapter 5). To assess 'true' self-care, it is suggested to use a combination of several measurement methods (e.g., self-report, biological measures such as urinary sodium, telemonitoring, and real-time technology). 32 However, objective methods are also complicated by several limitations, as they are not necessarily free from bias or nuisance (e.g., technological errors), are often time-consuming, expensive, and more invasive. Hence, improvements and better insights on the reliability and applicability of self-report measures of self-care should be obtained from future research. Also, more prospective studies with long-term follow-up and high methodological quality are needed in which researchers adapt a multisystem multi-marker approach. Clearly, there are shared but also unique reciprocal pathways among different psychological factors, distinct self-care behaviors, and different health outcomes. More knowledge is needed on potential harms and benefits of each distinct self-care behavior as (too) aggressive treatment may have adverse effects in patients with 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 175 05-01-16 10:23Chapter 9176advanced heart failure (Chapter 7, 8). Self-care recommendations such as sodium intake are largely based on studies among patients with coronary heart disease and hypertension, and not heart failure.33 Relatively little is known about long-term effects of self-care on pathophysiological function and clinical outcome, which should be addressed in future research by taking disease stage into account as well. More knowledge is essential on which and how specific psychological symptoms clusters contribute to self-care and health outcomes in heart failure patients. Specific psychological characteristics or components (e.g., somatic affective symptoms, anhedonia) may be more relevant than others in affecting the workload-capacity balance that simultaneously includes and impacts self- care. Clinicians are recommended to take a comprehensive approach by targeting complicating factors of patient capacity, such as depression, polypharmacy, and fatigue. Moreover, patient capacity can be improved by enhancing self-efficacy, positive affect, adaptive coping, knowledge, and social support. Motivational interviewing that involves elements of the cognitive theory and the stages of motivational readiness for change has been shown promising in its effects to change behavior and could be adapted in clinical practice in efforts to improve self-care. 34 However, clinicians should take into account that each additional intervention, which is most often targeted at long-term behavioral or clinical benefits, is likely to intensify the patient workload in the short term. Without sufficient patient capacity, which is, unfortunately, often hampered in patients with chronic heart failure, interventions are at great risk to fail. Subsequently, worsening of the heart failure condition may induce a greater burden of treatment, which intensifies patient workload as self-care becomes more crucial in managing symptoms and pathophysiological homeostasis. Simultaneously, expanding symptoms (e.g., fatigue) with respect to number and severity lead to an increase of the burden of illness, affecting the ability of patients to perform effective self-care. We therefore urge both researchers and clinicians to adapt... \u00b7 a dynamic, multidisciplinary, and multidimensional approach, \u00b7 that aims to continuously improve the patient workload-capacity balance, \u00b7 by integrating and patient-tailoring self-care \u00b7 in efforts to enhance long-term physical and mental well-being, ...in the ongoing care of patients with chronic heart failure. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 176 05-01-16 10:23Summary and general SD, Auricchio A, Bohm M, Dickstein K, et al.

THE AUTHOR Dionne Kessing was born on August 16, 1985 in Enschede, the Netherlands. At the age of four, she and her family - including two brothers and a sister - moved to Breda. During high school, she moved with her parents and younger brother to a small town in the United States where her father got tem- porarily stationed at the Hill Air Force Base near Salt Lake City, Utah. There, she attended Davis High School as a sophomore. After one year of tasting the American way of life, she moved back to Breda where she finished her high school. From 2004 to 2010, she attended Tilburg University. She obtained her Bachelor's degree in Psy- chology & Health and two Master's degrees in Clinical Health Psychology and Medical Psychology with a specific track in Clinical Neuropsychology. In her Master theses, she examined (1) health related quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing brachytherapy and hormonal therapy in a longitudinal design and (II) cognitive impairment after a delirium in a geriatric population. Afterwards, she started to work as a psychologist at the Department of Medical Psychology at the TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg/Waalwijk, and then as a PhD student at the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic diseases (CoRPS), Tilburg University. Her research focused on psychological factors, self-care, and health outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. During the third year of her PhD, she started to combine her PhD research with a part time position as a psychologist at M\u00e1xima Medisch Centrum (MMC) hospital in Eindhoven/Veldhoven, the Netherlands. Currently, she is enjoying her fulltime position at MMC hospital where she will start with a two-year training next January to obtain her post-Master degree as a health care psychologist. Besides a wide variety of populations includ-ing bariatric surgery and specialized dentistry, Dionne works mostly with patients from the cardiac rehabilitation program. In the future, she hopes to combine the two worlds of research and clinical practice into one. 13378_Kessing_BW.indd 193 05-01-16 10:23TAKING CARE OF THE FAILING HEART: A view Dionne KessingUITNODIGING Voor de openbare verdediging van mijn proefschrift TAKING CARE OF THE FAILING HEART A comprehensive view on self-care Op vrijdag 5 februari 2016 om 14.00 uur aula van Tilburg University, Warandelaan 2, Tilburg Aansluitend bent u van harte welkom op dionnekessing@gmail.comTAKING CARE OF THE FAILING HEART A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW ON Dionne Kessing SELF-CARE TAKING CARE OF THE FAILING HEART A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW ON Dionne "}
