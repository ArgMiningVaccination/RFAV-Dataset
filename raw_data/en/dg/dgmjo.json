Anthroposophic doctorsregard physical and mental existence together with personalityas a unit, each element having the capacity to influence the others.One of the fundamental aspects of anthroposophic medicine is totake this into account during diagnosis and therapy. Nevertheless, it is not an \"alternative medicine\" - it doesn't aim to replace conventional medicine. On the contrary - it isbased on accepted medical science; it just takes things a stepfurther. Or in other words, anthroposophic medicine makes useof everything that scientific research has revealed to be of benefitto the human being. Moreover it supplements \"material science\"with aspects of spiritual science in order to assess the individualas a whole entity. For instance, this may include body language,personal history, breathing, and many other aspects besides - allof which determine an individual's personality. Anthroposophicmedicine therefore attempts to include the individuality of thepatient, as well as the accepted features of an illness, in the treatment process. For just as each person is unique, so is eachtreatment - even though some may appear to apply to many people. Anthroposophic medicine is not pre-determined. It avoids pure routine. Even if, owing to their characteristic features, thesame disease pictures constantly recur, each illness manifestsitself differently in each patient - a manifestation inseparablefrom the uniqueness of the individual. Anthroposophic medicinetherefore aims to form a picture of the physical, psychological, andpersonal circumstances that have paved the way for an illness totake hold. Taking such factors into consideration during diagnosisand therapy and re-applying the process to every new patient, gu ided by scientific findings, medical experience, personal discernment,and intuition, is fundamental to anthroposophic medicine. Anymedicine that ignores the person as an individual cannot claimto be true human medicine. 2 31 For many people, anthroposophic medicine is a difficult concept. But in fact, it is quite easy to explain. It is an integrative form of medicine, derived from two sources - \"material scientific medicine\"with its methods and results, on the one hand, and \"spiritual scientific\"findings on the other. Neither one may be taken in isolation. What is anthroposophic medicine? Iris germanica, Bearded Iris. The root extract helps regulate the fluid balance in cases of lymphostasis and oedemasAnthroposophic medicine does notseek to replace conventionalmedicine, but ratherto complement it2 4 The main difference between anthroposophic medicine and conventional medicine is that it doesn't only look for the illness in the person, but rather the person in the illness. The diagnostic procedures and thesymptoms observed therein may be identical, but a holistic interpretation can lead to different treatmentsbeing recommended, or conventional therapies being supplemented by additional measures.How is anthroposophic medicine different from other systems?Patients don't just passively accept treatment, they are also activelyinvolved in the therapy Medicine based purely on material science is limited to explai- ning an illness solely on the basis of the laws of physics and che-mistry. Anthroposophic medicine is more ambitious. It takes intoaccount additional factors, both general and individual, that mayaffect the patient's life, mind, and soul, and their physical mani-festation: in growth, regeneration, microcirculation, fluid reten-tion in the skin, muscle tone, biorhythms, heat distribution, posture, uprightness, gait, mental focus, speech. When illnessoccurs, examination of the above may reveal deviations, imba-lances, and extremes - additional diagnostic parameters thatneed to be considered when selecting a therapy. Anthroposophicmedicine also has a different understanding of the role played bythe patient in overcoming illness. The patient is not simply a passive recipient of medical skill, but an equal partner with thedoctor. After all, nobody can know the patient better than the patient. During an illness, the patient has the opportunity to recognise the state of imbalance body and soul have reached, tounderstand this and rectify it. The illness can provide an oppor-tunity to learn new modes of behaviour, to develop further insights, and acquire greater maturity. Anthroposophic doctors offer the patient support during this process. They strengthen patient autonomy, recognise patientresponsibility, and promote the patient's right to involvement inthe selection of an appropriate therapy. 5Monarda dydima, Bergamot. An extract of the herb is used for digestive complaints.4 6 73 Illness and health The pendulum of life swings us back and forth between illness and health, which is why anthroposophic doctors always examine both aspects together. Health is produced when the polar extremes of life are held in dynamic balance: waking and sleeping, stillness and movement,joy and sorrow. It results from actively searching out and choo-sing the path we as individuals take into the world and back intoourselves. There are therefore as many healthy states as thereare people in the world. Health is not an end in itself; it simply helps us make the most of our personal and social lives.Anthroposophic doctors do not just treat illness; they also striveto promote the health of the individual, strengthening thepatient's own resolve to remain healthy. Will anthroposophic doctors recommend all available methods of diagnosis and treatment? Anthroposophic doctors are acquainted with the entire range of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Nevertheless, they do not necessarily use all of them. They are particularly critical of the tendency to use certain conventionalprocedures or drugs as a matter of course. They question whetherthese familiar methods are really suited to solving the specificproblem of the patient. Treatment should only proceed when thediagnostic or therapeutic course of action would benefit the patient's individual profile - nothing should be done simplybecause \"that's the way it's always been\". The benefits mustalways considerably outweigh any risks associated with the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.Viscum album, Mistletoe. Extracts made from leaves, twigs, and berries harvested in winter and summer areamong the most frequentlyprescribed substances for treating cancer. 5 6 8 9 Medical technology is also used In the diagnosis of an illness, anthroposophic doctors will use all the procedures offered by conventional medicine. Nevertheless when it comes to medical aids, they prefer initially to rely on their own senses. They examine the individual from top to toe, observing body language, expressions, and gestures, the patient's handshake,gait, posture - in fact, their entire appearance. They feel whe-ther skin and extremities are warm or cold, clammy or dry to thetouch, and they also feel and listen to the body. They listen tothe patient's own estimation of his or her well-being and mentalhealth, and assess how strong the patient's will to live is - nowand in reference to past personal history. Only then does the question arise whether or not a technical procedure might aid diagnosis. The central issue is always: whatnew information might such an investigation reveal and what would be the therapeutic consequence? Is such a step even relevant for this particular patient? Medical technology is notused as a matter of course, but only when it could bring recog-nisable benefits for the patient. Unnecessary investigations aretherefore avoided, meaning anthroposophic doctors work in aparticularly cos t-conscious manner. Nevertheless, whenever a technical method is considered appropriate, anthroposophicdoctors are only too willing to apply modern technology for thegood of the patient.Corallium rubrum, Red Coral. Ground to a fine powder, it stimulates haemopoiesis. What therapeutic procedures are used? Medical procedures such as operations, the whole spectrum of physiotherapy, and the allopathic drugs of conventional medicinedon't require any active patient involvement. Artistic therapiessuch as elocution, music, painting, sculpture, and therapeuticeurythmy, discussion therapy (psychotherapy, biographicalcounselling), nutrition, movement, and relaxation techniques, onthe other hand depend entirely on the patient getting involved. Treatment with drugs is partly based on dosing with naturally based anthroposophic drugs, the composition of which is determined by the typical features of an illness. In addition,other substances tailored to the patient's unique characteri-stics are administered. These are frequently homeopathic sub-stances designed to stimulate the organism and its powersof self-healing. On the one hand, anthroposophic medicine uses procedures that require passive acceptance on the part of the patient; these are supplemented, however, by procedures demanding the patient's active involvement.7 10 Equisetum arvense, Field Horsetail. Extracts of this herb stimulate toxin excretion in cases of kidney complaints and rheumatism.Plant extracts are used in bothconcentrated andhomeopathically diluted form orally,externallyand injected What defines an anthroposophic drug? Drug therapy within anthroposophic medicine is based on the ancient principle: as little as possible, as much as necessary. In cases of severe and chronic illness, or if a patient's own strength reserves are exhausted, the use of allopathic drugs maybe preferred. However, whenever possible, symptoms are not sup-pressed; instead the intention is to activate powers of self-hea-ling with the aid of homeopathically produced anthroposophicdrugs, and to stimulate the body into finding its own naturalrhythm once more. During treatment, anthroposophic doctors try to observe what special stimuli the organism could require to make a fullrecovery. For instance, bitter substances from the root of the yellow gentian or chicory stimulate the production of digestivejuices and promote intestinal movement. Essential oils withwarming properties extracted from the labiatae genus or fromnative Mediterranean plants can help ease muscular tension andpromote blood circulation.Additional substances tailored to the illness in question are also used: their composition is based on the general features of thedisease picture. These include both whole plant extract prepara-tions and those of mineral or animal origin. Which substance a doctor selects, whether as whole extract or homeopathic concentration, depends on the type and courseof the illness, the symptoms, pains, length of illness, patientstrength, age, but above all the patient's internal and externalactivity levels. Anthroposophic drugs are produced to pharmacopoeial stan- dards of quality and wherever available to specific national,European and international pharmacopoeias. Anthroposophic medicine's aim of understanding both patient and illness therefore also demands a pluralistic, holistic approach to drug therapy. 118 9 12 13Modern medicine needs a pluralistic approach! If the perception of what constitutes health and illness differs from person to person, it is logical that a range of diagnostic and therapeutic methods will be required to accommodate these variations. The more specific the methods, the better equipped they are to deal with the peculiarities and needs of individual cases. Today'spluralistic society demands methodological variety. Individualsshould be able to opt for the medicine that suits them best.Despite this, modern medicine is generally dominated by a one-sided materialistic school of thought, which assumes that thehuman organism can be explained away entirely in terms of thelaws of physics and chemistry. This means \"conventional medicine\" only addresses the ma- terial aspect of human existence - everything else is systemati-cally excluded. This reductionist medical doctrine therefore is not qualified to make general pronouncements which relate to themore holistic aspects of medicines. Moreover, hardly any researchhas been done by the conventional schools in possible alternativeapproaches. Therefore: \"The European Parliament calls on theCommission to launch a process of recognizing non-conventionalmedicine and, to this end, to take the necessary steps to establishappropriate committees\" (Resolution on the Status of non-con-ventional medicine n\u00b0 A4-0075/97 dd. 29.05.1997 - EuropeanParliament). Rewarding and challenging Patients used to high tech medicine often find the intensive personal attention they receive from an anthroposophic doctor stimulating. During consultation, they experience the very respect and inte- rest they are seeking as patients. Moreover, not only may theytake part in the various therapeutic procedures, they are active-ly encouraged to do so - a rare occurrence in conventional medi-cine. Neither is the doctor's interested questioning of the patientduring an appointment superficial; it is indeed one of the essen-tial tools of his trade. In order to treat a patient satisfactorily,the doctor must gain a thorough understanding of the individu- al in all his or her complexity. For anthroposophic doctors, being able to exploit the whole range of medical procedures - conventional and complementary- in the treatment of a patient is a rewarding challenge. Theyregard the unrestricted choice of therapy as a valuable and indispensable possession.Hypericum, St. John's Wort. Oil extracted from the flowers relieves muscular tension. Alcohol-based herb tinctures alleviate depression. 10 Thymus serpyllum , Thyme. The extract of stems, flowers, and leaves reducesacute coughing. 14 15 Anthroposophic medicine is modern What makes anthroposophic medicine so contemporary is that it takes the whole person into account. These days, patients don't want to be seen merely as an illness, but as a person with an illness. Anthroposophic medicine continues to develop in pace with medical progress. It regularly embraces new issues and trends,searching out the means to reflect these latest interpretationsof illness and health. Over the last few decades, for instance,anthroposophic doctors have developed an internationally re-cognised therapy programme for addicts. As soon as the bene-fit of a new diagnostic or therapeutic procedure has been pro-ven, it is accepted and integrated into the range of medicaloptions. Anthroposophic medicine also pursues its own scienti-fic research. Within conventional science-based medicine, theexperience of doctors in the field is more often than not over-ridden by methodology. This is the pre-condition for randomi-sed (two groups divided at random), placebo-controlled (com-pared with a pseudo drug), double blind trials (neither doctornor patient knows who is taking the actual drug and who theplacebo). Such trials replace the consultation-based doctor- patient relationship with generalised, experimental and anony-mous situations, entirely at odds with routine therapeutic rea-lity. The clinical pharmacologist Georges F\u00fclgraff described theprocess thus, \"It entails replacing reality with models; the morecomplex reality is, the simpler the models are, until, in a finalirony, the only part of reality that is perceived is that whichoccurs in the model. In this way, we no longer acquire medicalexperience: treatment is based on models and not on reality.\"In proving the efficacy of their therapies, anthroposophic scien-tists strive to employ new scientific methods and develop themstill further, enabling anthroposophic treatment, with its manyapproaches, to be demonstrated in day-to day practice. Anthro-posophic medicine is constantly on the move - yet another reasonwhy it's so contemporary.Anthroposophic medicine is con-stantly changing -yet another it's so contemporary11 16 17 Echinacea angustifolia, Purple Coneflower. Whole plant extracts strengthen the immune system to fightinflammatory diseasesThat's why you'll find anthroposophic doctors in general practice as well as in all the major medical disciplines: from surgery, paediatrics (children), internal medicine, cardiology (heart),endocrinology complaints), ortho-paedics (musculoskeletal system) to neurology (nervous system)and psychiatry (mind). In addition to their chosen specialism, doctors then complete a minimum of three years study focusing on the main emphasesof anthroposophic medicine. Training centres are located atanthroposophic clinics in Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Swedenand Switzerland. Practical experience in this alternative diagno-stic and therapeutic approach to patient care is gained throughwork experience in the anthroposophic practices of other doctors, or in the doctor's own practice under the supervision of mentors. Various specialist schools in Germany and Switzerland offer training courses. In addition, postgraduate courses are regularlyheld for those doctors who have already qualified in anthropo-sophic medicine. The latest scientific findings and therapeuticdevelopments are presented and discussed within working groupsand at national or international conferences, where anthroposo-phic attitudes to current medical issues are also worked out. Lectureships or professorships in anthroposophic medicine currently exist at the universities of San Francisco (USA), Ham-burg (Germany) and Berne (Switzerland). Furthermore introduc-tory lectures on anthroposophic medicine are included in the syllabi of many universities in Europe and elsewhere. Every anthroposophic doctor completes a standard conventional medical training. Following a degree in medicine, the doctor is licensed by their Governing Body and then undergoes specialist training. How are anthroposophic doctors trained? Anthroposophic doctors are certified accordingto international criteria13 12 18 19Do anthroposophic doctors treat state-funded/insured patients? Wherever possible, anthroposophic doctors are fully integrated in the health service of an individual country. Anthroposophic medicine is recognised by the public health ser- vices of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, GreatBritain, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. There are also many anthr oposophic doctors and therapists in these countries, as well as in Denmark and Spain, who offertheir services privately. May anthroposophic doctors be called upon to act in an emergency? Of course! That's something every doctor is taught. Anthroposophic doctors feel just as duty-bound to provide first aid as any other doctor. Every anthroposophic clinic boasts an ICward with all the latest essential equipment. Not without reasonhas the anthroposophic Filderklinik near Stuttgart been the A&E hospital for Stuttgart Airport - processing national and interna-tional flights - since 1975. Cinnabar. Powder and tablets relieve acute and chronic catarrh in therespiratory tract.14 15 20 21Why and how did anthroposophic medicine come about? Anthroposophic medicine has been around for almost a hundred years. Dr. Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), founder of the anthroposophic school of thought, developed the medicine's integrative conceptwith Dr. Ita Wegman (1876-1943). Both believed it vital that anthroposophic doctors remain abreast of the latest scientificfindings. With this in mind, they aimed to extend conventionalmedical practice with aspects of spiritual science. That is syste-matic anthroposophic scientific study of the none material aspectsof the human being. The term \"anthroposophy\" is made up oftwo Greek words \"anthropos\" - man, and \"sophia\" - wisdom. This puts the emphasis on the individual and a knowledge of self - anapproach that extends to medicine as well. As early as 1921, the first modest clinics dedicated to the application of this innovative medical approach opened in Arles-heim, near Basle (Switzerland), and in Stuttgart (Germany).From these small beginnings, anthroposophic medicine has con-tinued to grow, develop and change over the decades. Hospitals, sanatoria, and other clinical institutions dedicated toanthroposophic medicine are located in Brazil, Germany, GreatBritain, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland. Furthermore, there arenumerous practices and independent therapeutic institutesworldwide, where doctors and therapists specialising in variousdisciplines work together. Branch and sales offices of manufac-turers of anthroposophic drugs exist in most European countries, as well as in North and South America, Russia, South Africa,Egypt, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Worldwide there arealso more than 350 institutes in 26 European and 12 other coun-tries, which work according to their own concepts of healing andsocial therapy - including anthroposophic medicine. Anthroposophic medicine is practised in over 80 countries around the world: in Cape Town and Helsinki, Moscow and San Francisco, Hamburg and Manila. Where is anthroposophic medicine practised? Bryonia, Bryony. The root extract reduces inflammatory oedemas 16 17 22 23Belladonna, Deadly Nightshade. Whole plant extracts ease spasms andrepel inflammationWhat legal status does anthroposophic medicine have in the EU? A European Union guideline concerning anthroposophic medicine has yet to be developed. Efforts are underway, however, to draft a guideline or integrate anthroposophic medicine into existing guidelines. In six European member states - Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy - and in Switzerland, anthro-posophic drugs have at least been awarded formal recognitionand a legal foundation within one medical law. Further legal ini-tiatives are in progress, for instance, in the Netherlands, Belgium,and Sweden. The European Parliament's Collins Resolution, dating from 29th of May 1997, 'on the status of non-conventional medicines',specifically mentions anthroposophic medicine, along with seven other unconventional schools of therapy. Resolution 1206(1999) of the Council of Europe - 'A European approach to non-conventional medicines' - also mentions anthroposophic medi-cine in document 8435 as one of the most important forms ofcomplementary therapy. Therefore, the term of anthroposophicmedicine is well known enough to be integrated in one of theexisting guide lines. Never was anthroposophic medicine more necessary! In an age when increasing emphasis is being placed on indivi- dual responsibility for health, any medicine that approachesthis task methodically and seriously is a social necessity. In anage which, despite the pluralistic nature of society, is showingan increasing tendency towards wholesale generalisation andstandardisation, the need for a medicine that offers a range of specific holistic options and places the uniqueness of the individual at its centre is all the more urgent.
