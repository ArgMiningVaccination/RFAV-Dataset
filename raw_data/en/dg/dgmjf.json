Wayne State 's annual economic impact to the state of Michigan has been estimated at more than $2 billion. The university has a substantial effect on the economy of Southeast Michigan. Contributing factors include: WSU 's non -payroll expenditures for teaching, operations and research Expenditures by students, faculty and staff, and visitors Direct state taxes paid on earnings because of WSU expenditures 6 Table of Contents Strategic Focus and Goals Fact Book 2022 -23 Based on insight from the Wayne State University Board of Governors and input from internal and external stake- holders, the following were identified as strategic focus areas for the university 's 2022 -27 strategic plan. Research and Discovery : We will expand and nurture initiatives that address local, regional and global societal challenges and real -world problems. We will do this by leveraging strengths and talent across disciplines, schools and colleges, and centers and institutes as a platform for university identity, community impact, educational access, research advancement and faculty development. Technology, Learning and Student Success : We will build upon our remarkable and acclaimed improvements in student success, made possible by our strategic commit- ment to support every student, no matter their back- ground. This commitment is centered in our dedicated and accomplished faculty, woven into our culture, and present at every level of the university. We recognize that many members of our society need the opportunity to finish or expand their education, and we will be the university that best facilitates their needs. We will build on all we have learned during the pandemic to be nimbler and more flexible in order to meet the diverse needs of students at all levels. Outreach and Engagement : We will expand and build upon our long history of community engagement, devel-opment and impact by leveraging the combined power of our faculty expertise, student interest, business engage- ment and entrepreneurial activities. In this way, we will continue to foster growth and opportunity, partnerships and solutions, entrepreneurship, and business develop- ment that distinguish Wayne State as an institution of op- portunity and access for our city, our state and the world. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion : We are proud to be Michigan 's most diverse campus, but we will not be satis- fied until every student feels welcomed, supported and included, and every member of our campus community shares and lives our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. This requires that we ensure that the diversity of our students is mirrored in the faculty and staff who serve them. Financial Sustainability and Operational Excellence : The time is now to build the financial strength necessary to realize our strategic ambitions. We will establish a new culture of financial excellence, undergirded by improved acumen, better tools, and common understanding of costs and revenues. Financial decisions will be guided by strate- gic need and financial soundness. Most of all, we will redouble our efforts to recruit students at all educational levels and stages of life, from near and far, who will benefit from an education provided by excellent faculty at a top research university in the heart of Detroit. Vision We will be a preeminent, public, urban research university known for academic and research excellence, success across a diverse student body, and meaningful engagement in its urban community and around the world. Values Our values guide us in our approach to work, our expectations of performance and behavior, our assessment of results, and our approach to working together. Our values cut across organizational activities, bind us culturally, and permeate our strategic and tactical initiatives. These values include collaboration, diversity and inclusion, excellence, integrity, innovation, and leadership. Mission We create and advance knowledge, prepare a diverse student body to thrive, and positively impact local and global communities. 7 Table of Contents University Accreditation* Fact Book 2022 -23 Institutional Accreditation North Central Association of Colleges and Schools \u2014The Higher Learning Commission Specialized Accreditation Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

Fact Book 2022 -23 10 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 Past Presidents Henry convinced the state legislature to provide funds for veterans ' educa- tion to accommodate the post -war enrollment surge. During this era, State Hall and Science Hall were constructed and tuition residency was enlarged to include all Michigan residents \u2014 putting the university on the path to becoming a state university. During World War II, Bow led WSU through some of its most challenging and important times. Under his leader- ship, the university became an official War Information Center, preparing more than 400,000 people for jobs in Detroit 's war production efforts. Bonner led the university as the nation suffered a severe recession. Under his leadership, Wayne State expanded its international reputation, forging exchange agree- ments with universities in Israel, Germany, Poland and Costa Rica. It also became the nation 's second university to establish scholarly exchanges with the Chinese Academy of Science. As Wayne State 's longest -serving president, Adamany reorganized the university, created three new colleges and launched the then -largest building program in university history. In 1994, one of his major goals was realized when Wayne State was designated a \"Research I\" university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Frank Cody 1933-42 Warren E. Bow 1942-45 David D. Henry 1945-52 Cody began Wayne State University 's commitment to Detroit and its surrounding communities. Cody 's vision was that schools and colleges should be community centers \u2014 a belief that the university still holds today. Thomas Bonner 1978-82 David Adamany 1982-97 11 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 Past Presidents Hilberry oversaw the university 's transformation into a state university in 1956. During this time, Wayne State also saw tremendous growth, with 18 new buildings \u2014 including the McGregor Memorial Conference Center and the College of Education \u2014 changing the face of the campus. Keast held Wayne State together during the turbulent late 60s, engaging students in discussions about the Vietnam War, civil rights and the 1967 Detroit riot. During this time, enrollment continued growing and Wayne State offered its first course on African Ameri- can history and opened its first community extension center. Gullen continued WSU 's commitment to diversity by initiating an affirmative action policy, establishing the President 's Commission on the Status of Women and appointing the university 's first female vice president. Under Reid's leadership, Wayne State underwent an amazing transformation, with the addition of three residence halls, the Mort Harris Recreation and Fitness Center, the WSU Welcome Center, and more. During Reid 's tenure, TechTown \u2014 a 43 -acre technology park adjacent to campus \u2014 was also created. Noren collaborated with School of Medicine leaders to strengthen the university 's relationships with the Detroit Medical Center, Henry Ford Health System and other partners.

Historical Events Fact Book 2022 -23 24 Table of Contents 2022 Developments Fact Book 2022 -23 Wayne State launches new strategic plan In January, Wayne State University launched its 2022 -27 strategic plan, \"Our Moment in Time, \" which will serve as a guide for the university 's initiatives for the next five years. As a leader in equitable access to higher education and social mobility for its students, a key contributor to the workforce development in Michigan, and an institution renowned for its Carnegie -ranked research and community engagement, Wayne State unveiled a new vision that builds on its longstanding commitment to student success and its deep connection to the city of Detroit and state of Michigan. \"Wayne State has been an anchor in Detroit for more than 150 years, and we 're not going anywhere. Our commitment to the community has provided opportunities for our university to have a positive impact on many people and in many ways \u2014 most importantly in providing a world -class education to stu- dents from all walks of life, \" said President M. Roy Wilson. \"We remain steadfast in this commitment to our students, our community and our state. \" The adoption of the new strategic plan came as Wayne State, and the world, reflect on lessons learned from the pandemic that will serve as opportunities to improve. \"The pandemic tested, but did not break, Wayne State Univer- sity,\" said Board of Governors member Marilyn Kelly, who served on the Strategic Plan Steering Committee. \"We came together as a community to first protect our people and serve our mission, but we also took the opportunity to adapt and grow, and we 've made incredible progress in moving our uni- versity forward. Together, we are stronger than ever. The launch of our new strategic plan gives us further opportunity to refocus our efforts based on where we 've been, what we 've learned and where we want to be in the future. \" Key objectives in \"Our Moment in Time \" include: Increase undergraduate, master 's, professional and certificate enrollments, with an overall enrollment goal of 28,000 Launch a campuswide initiative to recruit, support and further educational attainment of people with partial college educations Increase overall six -year graduation rate to 60% Increase historically marginalized student six -year graduation rate to 50% Launch the university's next comprehensive fundraising campaign Advance in rankings for overall research expenditures Expand the Office of Multicultural Student Engagement to include campus development of spaces and initiatives that support the wide diversity of races, cultures, creeds and orientations Develop new facilities to support leading -edge health sciences education and research Student success initiatives \u2014 including academic support and timely graduation; career readiness; meaningful interactions with faculty, staff and peers; and a vibrant campus life experience \u2014 are interwoven throughout the plan. Additionally, the plan emphasizes a renewed focus on business engagement and the role WSU plays in supporting the local and state economy. WSU plans to build upon its unique ability to help returning students complete their education, thereby further contributing to the talented workforce. \"So many of the doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, business leaders and other professionals serving the metro Detroit area are Wayne State graduates. We know that there can be even more, \" said Wilson. \"A college degree has the ability to change someone 's life, and an educated workforce is crucial to keeping Michigan thriving. Increasing access for those who may not be traditional students is beneficial to us all. \" 25 Table of Contents Graduation rates continue to soar The steady, dramatic increase in Wayne State 's six-year graduation rate continued, including jumps among student groups across the board. WSU 's new six -year graduation rate is 60.3% \u2014 an 8% increase over last year and more than double that of the low 26% rate just over a decade ago. Gains are particularly significant this year among first - generation (27%), low -income (18%) and Hispanic students (31%). On the heels of a big increase last year, the Black graduation rate went up another 14% this year and is now close to 40% \u2014 more than five times the rate in 2011. \"I am proud of our overall improvement and that we continue to make significant strides to close the student success equity gap among students of color, \" said WSU President M. Roy Wilson. \"This work takes a lot of effort and focus, but we 've shown that it can be done. \" Darryl Gardner, senior director of academic student affairs in the Office of the Provost, said the ongoing success is the result of a change in culture initiated and supported by Wilson to one in which every single student matters. \"This shift has transformed the student experience at Wayne State and led to the university becoming one of the most rapidly improving large public universities in the nation, \" said Gardner. \"I think it really speaks to the collective hard work of the entire campus. \" Gardner said no single initiative can be credited; rather, student success operations have improved steadily each year across the board. It began in 2011, with a $10 million invest- ment that allowed for the hiring of 45 additional academic advisors, improving curriculum in general education courses, increasing support for faculty teaching development, bolstering support for underprepared students, establishing first -year ex-periences for new students and strengthening financial aid. In 2018, the Association of Public and Land -grant Universities named Wayne State University the winner of its Project Degree Completion Award, honoring its dramatic graduation rate improvement and innovative strategies and programs to increase retention and decrease achievement gaps. In 2019, under the leadership of Associate Provost for Student Success Monica Brockmeyer, the Student Success Operational Excellence (SSOE) office was developed to provide the concen- trated effort required to inspire the next wave of innovation and deepen collaboration campuswide. SSOE initiatives have included deepening and facilitating collab- oration with all student success stakeholders across campus, deepening the role of faculty with regard to undergraduate student success, and expanding the use of data and predictive analytics to offer more proactive support to students. In response to the pandemic, a Student Success Collaborative was quickly formed and managed by the SSOE team to transition many academic support programs and academic advisors to the remote and online environment. Six working groups were created and eventually 25 action teams were launched to work on critical problems facing students. This included teams helping students reach graduation and one looking specifically at policies through an equity lens that could disproportionately impact specific student groups. \"After more than a decade of improving graduation rates, continuing the upward trajectory \u2014 particularly with the difficulties brought on by the pandemic \u2014 is a challenge, but the success of our students remains our highest priority, \" said Mark Kornbluh, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. 2022 Developments Fact Book 2022 -23 26 Table of Contents 2022 Developments Fact Book 2022 -23 WSU again ranked best university in Michigan for social mobility Wayne State University was once again ranked the best public university in Michigan at helping economically disadvantaged students succeed and graduate, accord- ing to the U.S. News & World Report 2022 -23 Best Colleges rankings. The rankings, now in their 38th year, rank Wayne State 90th in the country and first in Michigan for the social mobility it provides for its students. \"Helping economically disadvantaged students earn college degrees and prepare them for prosperous careers is a goal of our strategic plan, so this is an acknowledgement that we are fulfilling our mission, \" said WSU President M. Roy Wilson. \"No matter a student 's background, a Wayne State education can enhance their life and have a generational impact on their family. \" The social mobility ranking is calculated by looking at the number of students who enroll and graduate and who received Pell Grants. Students who receive Pell Grants typically come from households with family incomes of less than $50,000. According to U.S. News , \"Economically disadvantaged students are less likely than others to finish college, even when controlling for other characteristics. But some colleges are more successful than others at advancing social mobility by enrolling and graduating large proportions of disadvantaged students awarded with Pell Grants. \" 27 Table of Contents 2022 Developments Fact Book 2022 -23 Following a 60 -year run, with more than 600 productions, Wayne State University 's Hilberry Theatre took its final bow on Nov. 20. The historic building then began its much - anticipated transformation into the Gretchen C. Valade Jazz Center, part of the university 's Hilberry Gateway complex, set to open in 2023. \"We do not feel that we are saying goodbye to the former Hilberry space, so much as we are making way for the incredible opportunity to build the Valade, a world -class jazz center that will feature our extraordinary educational music programming and also welcome guests from all over the world, \" said Mary Anderson, chair of the Maggie Allesee Department of Theatre and Dance. In a nod to its early days of performing primarily Shakespearean works, the Maggie Allesee Department of Theatre and Dance in the College of Fine, Performing and Communication Arts presented The Merry Wives of Windsor as its final production in the theatre. \"Both the Gateway and the Valade give Wayne State the opportunity to fulfill its mission as an anchor institution in new ways, \" said Anderson. \"We have always been a hub for the campus and the community; now, we will have the facilities to welcome the campus and the community to help us build new stories, new relationships and new futures for the arts. \" Located in the heart of Midtown Detroit, the Hilberry Theatre was built in 1917 as the First Church of Christ Scientist. The building was bought by Wayne State in 1961 for $250,000. The university remodeled the church 's 60-foot stage and 1,512 -seat auditorium into a 532 -seat theater. The structure was renamed the Hilberry Theatre in homage to Wayne State 's fourth president, Clarence B. Hilberry, and reopened in January 1964. The first play performed at the Hilberry Theatre was Shakespeare 400, which honored of the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare 's birth. The second -to-last theatrical performance at the Hilberry Theatre was the Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize -winning musical Rent , which took place earlier in the fall. The Gretchen C. Valade Jazz Center will retain much of the classical architecture of the existing Hilberry Theatre. The new main entrance will be from Hancock Street and will highlight the columns that define the building. The jazz center will include a main performance space seating 350 and the Dee Dee Bridgewater space in the former Underground Theatre, which will seat 110. Final curtain falls for Hilberry Theatre 28 Table of Contents The Wayne State University School of Medicine and Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute 's plans to construct a new building complex to further their unique academic and research -based partnership got additional support in 2022. The estimated $300 million capital pro- ject is becoming more of a reality with an appropriation of $100 million from the State of Michigan. WSU and Karmanos plan to house collaborative medical education, research and laboratories, and health science and commu- nity health clinics in the new spaces. The investment will provide employment opportunities for Detroit -area residents, as well as attract and retain new talent. Planned to be built at a yet -to-be-determined location near the two campuses in Midtown Detroit, the new complex will emerge as a Detroit hub where faculty, students, researchers and scientists collaborate to ensure greater equity in health outcomes.

This collaborative study is made up of 31 faculty in six colleges and schools at Wayne State along with researchers from Henry Ford Health System, Michigan State University, Ann Arbor Technical Services Inc., North Carolina State University and University of Florida. Francesca Luca, School of Medicine Funder : National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health Amount : $3.36 million; 3/11/2022 - 12/31/2026 Title : Psychosocial and Genetic Effects on Gene Expression and Asthma Description : This project will investigate the relationship between psychosocial experiences and health in children affected by asthma and their asymptomatic siblings. The goal is to dissect the role of different cell types, disease status versus psychosocial environment and genetic variation in transcriptional dysregulation observed in children with asthma living in risky family environments. Results will be important to design personalized medical and behavioral interventions to alleviate disease severity in children with asthma. Wayne State University's research portfolio has grown markedly over the years, further establishing the university as one of the nation 's preeminent research institutions. In 2022, Wayne State received more than $288 million in research awards - a 23% increase from fiscal year 2017. The work done by these researchers will go on to save lives, further knowledge and change the world. Here are six of the top funded research awards received by Wayne State researchers in 2022. 74 Table of Contents Top Research Awards of 2022 Fact Book 2022 -23 Amanda Leggett, Institute of Gerontology Funder : National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health Amount : $1.9 million; 9/1/2022 - 5/31/2026 Title : Profiling Psychosocial Dementia Caregiving Networks: The Impact of Dementia Care Networks on Care Outcomes of Medicare Enrollee Persons Living with Dementia Description : Despite decades of research on dementia caregiving, prior work has largely focused on a primary caregiver, neglecting the reality that caregiving is provided within complex networks that have the potential to support \u2014 but also complicate \u2014 the work of caregivers. The public health impact of this study is through profiling the shared compositional and psychosocial characteristics of caregiver networks to better understand how they impact the well - being and health care use of persons living with dementia such that interventions and supports may be targeted to- ward at -risk caregiver networks. Interventions to support these individuals require a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of caregivers ' networks, while the broader field of caregiving research would benefit from widening its perspective to fully examine these networks. Stephanie Brock, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Funder : Department of Energy Amount : $1.9 million; 9/1/2022 - 8/30/2027 Title : Tunable Platforms for Solar Fuels Generation via Programmable Integration of Colloidal Components Description : Efficient and cost -effective solar -driven photocatalysis is of considerable interest because the direct conversion of solar energy to fuels enables clean, renewable energy that is truly distributed, bypassing the need for an integrated system of photovoltaics coupled to electrolyzers or batteries and associated energy conversion losses. However, the price for this functional simplicity is a great deal of complexity in materials design. Quantum dots (QDs) hold promise because of their unique and tunable photophysical characteristics. The team 's long -term goal is to establish integrated gel networks comprising a QD network as photosensitizer/electron transport pathway interfaced to a secondary QD network with energy levels designed to extract and conduct holes; each network embracing catalytic nanoparticles to achieve solar fuels generation. The central hypothesis guiding the research is that the temporal sequence of exciton generation, charge separation, carrier transport and redox catalysis can be tuned by programming the assembly of constituent elements into defined architectures and engineering the interfaces to facilitate or retard individual kinetic events to achieve rapid and sustained turnover. 75 Table of Contents Top Research Awards of 2022 Fact Book 2022 -23 Mohsen Ayoobi, College of Engineering Funder : National Science Foundation Amount : $1.5 million; 10/1/2022 - 9/30/2028 Title : ASSET: Assuring Students Success in Engineering Technology Programs Description : This project will contribute to the national need for well -educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high -achieving, low -income students with demonstrated financial need at Wayne State University. Over its six -year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 48 unique undergraduate students who are pursuing bachelor 's in engineering technology (ET) programs. These non -traditional students face significant financial and personal challenges in completing their degrees. This project will provide high - achieving low -income students with financial support, implement evidence -based active learning techniques, and offer various professional and academic support services to strengthen students ' engineering identity and commitment to enter the STEM workforce or graduate school upon graduation. The overall goal is to increase STEM degree completion of low -income, high -achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Based on identity theory that seeks to understand the links between social organization and individual behavior, this project hypothesizes that early engagement, and continuous support play a key role in fostering engineering identity, retention and persistence of ET transfer students, thus improving their academic and professional outcomes. Stephanie Brock, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Funder : National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institutes of Health Amount : $1.39 million; 9/1/2022 - 5/31/2027 Title : A new paradigm of general transcription factor TFIIB functionality in termination and promoter directionality Description : A number of viruses like hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus -1 and Thogoto virus target the general transcription factor TFIIB to regulate expression of viral -specific genes during pathogenicity. TFIIB has also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia, and cardiac hypertrophy. With a view to understand functioning of TFIIB in a cell, this research award will focus on elucidation of the overall role of TFIIB in transcriptional regulation in the cell. The successful completion of this proposal will enable the research team to comprehend the role of transcription factors in the broader context and will serve as a paradigm for understanding the coordination among steps of the transcription cycle in yeast and mammalian systems. 76 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 Current Fund Research Expenditures by Source of Fund (in thousands) What are WSU 's National Science Foundation (NSF) research expenditures?

The foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation. Though independent of the university, it partners with the Division of Development and Alumni Affairs in realizing Wayne State 's overall advancement objectives. The foundation is governed by a board of directors made up of prominent business and community leaders. It is led by a chair chosen from among these individuals and a president who also holds the university title of vice president for development and alumni affairs. Working together, the Wayne State University Foundation and the Division of Development and Alumni Affairs cultivate private support to advance the university 's mission. Funds raised enable Wayne State to offer undergraduate and graduate student scholarships, endow faculty chairs and professor- ships, advance academic and scientific programs and investigations, and enhance the campus infrastructure. During Fiscal Year 2022, Wayne State University raised more than $72.2 million in new gifts and pledges from more than 26,300 donors. The Wayne State University Foundation includes an investment committee that assists the board with all investment -related decisions, including oversight of the university 's endowment. As of Sept. 30, 2022, the end of the last reporting period, the endowment totaled $451.9 million. Earned income from the endowment provides funding for donor -identified purposes in perpetuity. Nearly two -thirds of the endowment at Wayne State is designated for student and faculty support. The university 's most recent comprehensive fundraising campaign, \"Pivotal Moments, \" concluded on Sept. 30, 2018. The campaign, which had a goal of $750 million, raised more than $776.5 million to sup- port scholarship, research, community engagement and campus infrastructure priorities at Wayne State.

Wayne State University will enhance the growing and vibrant area just south of campus and further solidify its reputation as an artistic leader by creating the Hilberry Gateway, a $69.5 million performance complex for theatre, music, dance and arts -related events. As part of the complex, which broke ground in spring 2020, the Hilberry Theatre will be renovated to become the Gretchen Valade Jazz Center (GVJC), a high -caliber venue for music and dance performanc- es. The 317-seat GVJC will offer ample seating for parents, patrons, donors and community members for dance events. The renovated space also will enable the dance program to feature master classes and lectures. The Hilberry Gateway performance venue will herald a new approach to theatre at Wayne State. Faculty members have unanimously approved a move away from repertory theatre toward a model that allows for greater variety, better serves students and reflects regional theatres across the nation. A new curriculum in musical theatre, for example, will create a series of performances that blend dance, music and theatre. The Hilberry Gateway performance venue will include: A new 513-seat main proscenium theatre and a 143-170 flexible seat black box theatre on the corner of Cass and Forest Full-thrust stage with appropriate wing space and a fly system New dressing rooms, makeup rooms, green rooms and production accommodations New audio and visual booths will bolster the performances, allowing state -of-the-art audio, video and lighting technology during production New office space located within the complex for administrative purposes Patron lobby will allow invited guests to relax and socialize before the show Construction on the Hilberry Gateway is expected to be complete in early 2023. The renovation of the for- mer Hilberry Theatre into the Gretchen Valade Jazz Center will commence in early January 2023 and is anticipated to be complete by November 2023. Fact Book 2022 -23 Recent Construction Projects at WSU 95 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 State Hall renovation Built in 1948 and expanded in 1957, State Hall is the university 's third -largest classroom building, with 75 classrooms and more than 160,000 gross square feet. State Hall provides five floors \u2014 including a partial basement \u2014 of general -purpose classrooms with active learning capabilities on the fourth floor. It is one of the most -scheduled lecture buildings on campus and supports much of the academic programs offered at Wayne State. With a substantial investment of $70 million, the university will transform the nearly 80 -year -old State Hall into a flexible, 21st -century learning environment with upgraded offerings that support a wide range of teaching styles. Recent projects on campus such as the fourth floor renovation in State Hall, Integrative Biosciences Center and the STEM Innovation Learning Center serve as benchmarks for how Wayne State Uni- versity envisions the design of new and renovated spaces. These projects specifically represent the level of quality desired for flexible learning spaces and modern technology in State Hall. This renovation will effectively address the deferred maintenance backlog within the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and building exterior systems. All system updates will be of a modern, energy efficient standard and will further the university 's commitment to meet or exceed LEED Silver certification. Substantial upgrades will also be made throughout the building to meet current life safety and accessibility codes. Construction began in spring 2022; as a result, State Hall is closed through summer 2023. The newly renovated State Hall will reopen in fall 2023 for classroom instruction. 96 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 Elevator maintenance Across the United States, there are approximately 900,000 elevators in operation, averaging 350 million rides each day. Wayne State 's campus is home to 165 elevators, with approximately 60,000 rides occurring daily. Elevators break down an average of four times a year, with each breakdown taking an average of four hours to fix. After an extensive RFP initiative, WSU 's elevator maintenance provider was replaced in January 2021. Since this change, we have seen a decrease in service calls, from 870 calls in 2019 to 260 calls in 2022. Along with managing service calls, the new vendor is also tasked with developing a preventative maintenance plan in conjunction with Facilities Planning and Management to continue to ensure reliable and consistent service. Since 2019, Wayne State has allocated $12.2 million to elevator repair and modernization across campus. The focus has been on elevators in the most frequently used buildings and those with the most outdated controls. In this timeframe, a total of 13 elevators have been completely upgraded, which contributes to overall reliability. Over the next five years, Facilities Planning and Management intends to allocate between $8 million and $12 million to address current and preventative needs. Fiscal Year 2023 alone has $5 million already allocated to elevator projects. The current focus is to upgrade or modernize elevators with relay (mechanical) controls to electronic controls. Contingent on equipment availability and labor, WSU plans to modernize 10 elevators each year for the next five years. 97 Table of Contents Fact Book 2022 -23 Technology at Wayne State University Academica Wayne Connect Academica is Wayne State 's single -sign-on portal, providing secure access to most Wayne State systems and services.
