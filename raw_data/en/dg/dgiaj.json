My name is Jill Vaslow, Cigna's Managing Director of Global Benefits and Employee Well -being, and a member of our Cigna Human Resources Leader ship Team. And I'm delighted to host today's podcast. Jill Vaslow 00:24 As vaccine distribution and administration increases across the United States, and we see the emergence of a number of Coronavirus variants, the future state of this pandemic contin ues to evolve. One important concept -- herd immunity -- has become a topic of interest to many, including employers as they consider what the future will hold for themselves, their employees and their businesses. Jill Vaslow 00:47 Joining us today is D r. Alan Stricoff, Cigna Senior Medical Director. It's great to have you here with us, Alan. Dr. Stricoff 00:55 Thanks very much for inviting me to join you today, Jill. Jill Vaslow 00:59 Let's dive right into this topic, one we hear mentioned quite a b it these days in the media -- the concept of herd immunity and how it's connected to the COVID -19 pandemic. Can you tell us where this concept of herd immunity came from? Dr. Stricoff 01:14 Yes. Thanks, Jill. Well, actually, this concept dates back to observations made by American livestock veterinarians, early in the 1900s. Cattle and sheep would get sick, many would die. However, those that presumably got infected and survived became immune . Soon enough, enough of the livestock were immune that the virus had difficulty infecting other animals and the infection went away. Dr. Stricoff 01:38 I think we could think of this as a raging fire. When there's no more wood to fuel the fire, eventua lly a fire dies out. - 2 - Dr. Stricoff 01:47 I should mention that the term herd immunity probably needs to be modernized. People are not livestock, and I've heard that some people don't like being compared to cows and sheep. Perhaps we can call this popu lation immunity instead. Jill Vaslow 02:00 That makes sense. So how does this all relate to COVID -19? Dr. Stricoff 02:04 The concept of herd immunity is that when enough of a population becomes immune to a disease, it makes the spread of the disease fr om person -to-person harder and less likely. With herd immunity, the whole population -- or herd -- is protected, not just those who are already immune. Jill Vaslow 02:20 Got it. So, what percentage of the population needs to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity? Dr. Stricoff 02:28 Well, that's a really interesting question. And I'm going to give you a long answer, but please bear with me. Dr. Stricoff 02:33 It really differs by disease and how contagious or deadly that particular disease is. F or example, a highly contagious virus like measles requires an estimated 90% or more of the population to be immune to stop the spread. With COVID -19 estimates vary, but we if we can get to having 70 to 80% of the population immune or vaccinated, that woul d be okay. And when I say immune , I mean naturally immune. There's no absolute for a number that we can pinpoint at this point. But estimates are changing, and did change recently. Dr. Stricoff 03:07 Certainly higher is better, if we want to reopen soci ety. It should be noted that Dr. Fauci has been slowly upping the estimated percentage. And percentages can change based on what we learned about variance and how effective vaccines are, how quickly we get children vaccinated, and frankly, how quickly we can move to achieve this globally. Bloomberg has some estimates on the rate of vaccinations and the time to get to 75% in the US, and it's thought to be about four -to-six months, and we're certainly on our way. Jill Vaslow 03:37 So interesting. So, can you tell us what we know now about the percentage of the population that has natural immunity from having had COVID -19? And how long we think that that immunity will last? - 3 - Dr. Stricoff 03:50 Yeah, those are really good questions, Jill. Recent estimates based on blood bank donations, where they check for antibodies, indicate that there are about one in five or 20% of the population that have antibodies to COVID -19. That's certainly a start. But that's not enough. We also don't know how long this naturally might last. Jill Vaslow 04:10 It's still fascinating. This whole topic is so fascinating. So Alan, I'm wondering, are there different strategies to achieve herd immunity? Dr. Stricoff 04:19 Yeah, there certainly are. You know, the first strategy is to simply allow people to get infected naturally. This is what happened back in 1918 during the Spanish flu. There wasn't a vaccine and therefore no choice. Those who survived became immune. But at a tremendous cost. Many lives were lost. Dr. Stricoff 04:38 In the case of COVID -19, the vast majority of scientists, academic centers, the CDC, the FDA, they just disagree on, you know, with using this strategy because of the hundreds of millions of Americans who would need to be infected to achieve this herd i mmunity, which would lead to a catastrophic death toll that could be 10 to 15 times higher than we have already seen or expected. Dr. Stricoff 05:02 What's more, which impacts us all, the sheer numbers of sick individuals would overwhelm our healthcare system, preventing those that need care for getting it and leading to illness and death for people with non -COVID related illnesses, like heart attacks, who need an ICU bed, or cancer patients with a serious infection. Dr. Stricoff 05:22 We also need to be concerned about long -term symptoms from COVID. So, we are still learning about the disease, and it's not the same as the flu. Some countries like Sweden tried this strategy , and it failed for many of the reasons that we've just discussed. Dr. Stricof f 05:39 The second and better way to achieve herd immunity is to have a safe and effective vaccine that prevents a significant illness and mortality associated with the virus. There's actually statistical models for this. For COVID -19, assuming that vacci nes have an efficacy rate of 90% or greater -- which they do -- and that 10 to 30% of US population will have been infected naturally, by the time the general population has access to the vaccine, it's likely that 60 to 70% of Americans, at a minimum, woul d need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. - 4 - Dr. Stricoff 06:13 It's also likely that we'll need to continue vaccinations at some time interval because we don't yet know how long this immunity will last, whether the virus will mutate, and how some patients may respond, including those who are older or have specific clinical conditions. But fortunately, there's reason for optimism as millions of Americans could be vaccinated by the summer of 2021. Dr. Stricoff 06:38 But until then, we really need to continue to practice mitigation measures, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings until we achieve herd or population immunity. Jill Vaslow 06:49 Yeah, absolutely. I thank you for that great information. Dr. Stricoff. So, let me ask you, what would prevent us from achieving herd immunity? Dr. Stricoff 06:59 Well, there really are two concerns. The first is vaccine hesitancy. If none of the population is going to get vaccinated, we run the risk that there will still be enough unprotected individuals for the virus to continue to spread. Some of the unprotected individuals will unfortunately die from COVID when this could have been prevented. Just like mask -wearing, vaccinations are not just to protect you, they can prote ct others as well. Dr. Stricoff 07:25 The second concern are the vaccine variants. We're in a race against time. The vaccines we have today were designed based on the original SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus. Overtime, it's possible that these vaccines will lose their effectiveness due to the new strains emerging. The goal is to get enough people vaccinated and end the pandemic before the new strains become dominant and potentially cause a new round of infections. This is achievable, although we may need to have a booster vaccination down the road to prevent reemergence of COVID. I see light at the end of the tunnel if we can vaccinate swiftly and achieve herd immunity. Jill Vaslow 08:03 Oh, that's great. That's great news. I think as an employer, and I'm thinki ng about all of the activities that we're doing to help think about how we might return to our work sites and get our employees back together for all the activities we've been missing this y ear. I'm just excited that opportunity is here , we're sort of seeing that light at the end of the tunnel. Jill Vaslow 08:25 So, I do want to thank you, Alan, for the information that you shared.
