It is especially prized in the Ayurvedic herbal tradition and is commonly known as Indian ginseng, poison gooseberry, or winter cherry. Ashwagandha a perennial herb native to Southern Asia and is cultivated in the drier regions of Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and India. It features small, green flowers and fruit that is orange to red when ripe. A member of the Solanaceae family, or [nightshade](https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/nutrition/are-nightshade-vegetables-unhealthy/) family, ashwagandha is related botanically to potatoes, pepper, and tomatoes. Ashwagandha Is Used For: Each part of the ashwagandha plant - the roots, leaves, and fruit - has been used in traditional [Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/balanced-living/wellness-therapies/ayurvedic-medicine/) for a variety of treatments. The leaves and fruit are applied externally to the skin to treat wounds, tumors, [back pain](https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/back-pain/), and carbuncles (cluster of boils). The tuberous ashwagandha root is most often used orally to help improve brain function and alertness, relieve stress and anxiety, and reduce pain and swelling. Ashwagandha is considered an adaptogen, a substance that enhances the body's adaptive response to stress and balances normal body functions. Animal studies have found constituents of the herb, including alkaloids, steroidal lactones, and saponins, to reduce inflammation and calm the nervous system. In one clinical trial of people with moderate to severe [anxiety](https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/stress-anxiety/anxiety/), researchers compared the effects of a mixture of 300 mg standardized to 1.5% withanolides, prepared from root, to psychotherapy. After the eight-week trial, the group that received the ashwagandha mixture had decreased anxiety and fatigue and increased concentration, compared to those who had psychotherapy. The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database found insufficient evidence to rate the effectiveness of ashwagandha for a variety of conditions including tumors, tuberculosis, liver problems, [fibromyalgia](https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/autoimmune-disorders/fibromyalgia/), and [infertility](https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/pregnancy-fertility/infertility/).

Dr. Weil Says: I recommend ashwagandha - along with other measures - for the [treatment of insomnia](https://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02004/insomnia) when stress is a contributing factor. If this is an issue for you, try to stick to a routine at bedtime - go to bed at the same time every day, avoid caffeine and get plenty of exercise during the day. A dark room free of noise may also help.
