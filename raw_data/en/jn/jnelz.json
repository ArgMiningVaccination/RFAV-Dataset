Manufacturing: The definition of manufacturing includes: a) The making or assembling of the product; b) The enclosing or packing of the product in any container in a form suitable for administration or application, and the labelling of the container and; c) The carrying out of any process in the course of any of the foregoing activities. (as defined in Regulation 2, CDCR 1984 ) Medicinal Prod uct: The term refers to product as st ated in Regulation 2, CDCR 1984 which is applicable to pharmaceutical and natural products OTC: Refers to Generic (Non -Scheduled Poison) Product O wner: A person, company or entity who is the legal/ registered owner of the product formulation and/or process with whom the marketing authorization holder has a contract (glossary used in ACTD and ACTR). Product Registration Holder: The company or corporate or legal entity in the field of pharmaceuticals whose name the ma rketing authorization has been granted. This party is responsible to all aspects of the product, including quality and compliance with the conditions of marketing authorization. The authorized holder must be subjected to Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 13 legislation in the country that iss ued the marketing authorization, which normally means being physically located in that country (glossary used in ACTD and ACTR) . The Authority: Refers to Drug Control Authority (DCA) The System: Refers to QUEST system in website of NPCB Glossary for Homeopathic Products: Active substance: Active substances are considered to be source materials processed by one or a sequence of homeopathic manufacturing procedures listed in pharmacopoeias in official use and other officially recognized documents (e.g. mother tinctures, dilutions or triturations). Diluent: Substance used for the preparation of a stock/ starting material or the potentisation process and which may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Liquid diluents usually consist of purified water, aqueous solution, glycerol or ethanol of a suitable concentration or for which there is an appropriate monograph. The commonest solid diluent is usually lactose monohydrate. Dilution: Dilution has two meanings in homeopathy: For a product, a dilu tion is a liquid homeopathic preparation which is potentised as described below (see the definition of potentisation). Individual dilutions are also called potencies; As a procedure, dilution means the de -concentration process of a liquid or a solid prepar ation. One part of each stage in the preparation of a homeopathic medicine from its stock or previous dilution (potency) by adding one part of a previous solid or liquid phase to a predetermined weight or volume of the diluent (see Potentisation below). Di lution occurs at all stages of production of the homeopathic medicines whether by addition of solid excipient in trituration or the addition of diluent in the liquid phase and succussion. Dosage form: a dosage form in homeopathy complies with any relevant specifications for that dosage form for which an appropriate characterization exists in a pharmacopoeia in official use, or in other officially recognized documents. The most commonly encountered homeopathic dosage form, the globule (pillule or pellet) , is a Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 14 solid spherule which consists of lactose, sucrose or any other suitable vehicle. Usually, preformed globules are impregnated with a dilution or directly by a mother tincture. The homeopathic dosage form tablet is a solid preparation which complies with any relevant characterization in the pharmacopoeia in official use (or in other officially recognized documents) for tablets. Homeopathic medicines in tablet form are either prepared by impregnation of preformed tablets or by compression of triturations w ith the vehicle. The most commonly used liquid homeopathic medicines are either alcoholic solutions or oral liquids. Excipient: Substance needed for manufacturing a dosage form (used after potentisation) such as wheat starch and magnesium stearate for tab lets. It may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Homeopath: A qualified provider (practitioner) of homeopathic treatment. Homeopathic medicines: Any medicine prepared in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described by a ph armacopoeia in official use or other officially recognized documents. A homeopathic medicine may contain a number of homeopathic preparations. Homeopathy: Classical homeopathy is a system of medicine using preparations of substances whose effects, when ad ministered to healthy subjects, correspond to the manifestations of the disorder in the individual pat ients. Mother tincture (also called tincture): The initial homeopathic preparation made from source material that can be further potentised (also call ed \"liquid stock\"), sometimes used as homeopathic medicines, is regarded as the most concentrated form of a finished homeopathic medicine. Mother tinctures are obtained classically by maceration or percolation (sometimes also by digestion, infusion, decoct ion or fermentation) techniques from source materials according to a procedure prescribed by a recognized homeopathic pharmacopoeia. Sometimes a mother tincture corresponds to the first decimal dilution, \"1D\" or \"1X\" (10 -1), mostly when dry plant material is used as starting material. Nosodes: Homeopathic medicines prepared from disease products from humans or animals; from pathogenic organisms or their metabolic products; or from decomposition products of animal organs. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 15 Potency: The denominated degree o f serial trituration or dilution and succession that is reached for each homeopathic medicine. The degrees of dilution or potencies are normally indicated by the letters D, DH or X for successive 1 to 10 (decimal) dilutions, the letters C, CH or K or CK fo r successive 1 to 100 (centesimal) dilutions while Q or LM denote successive 1 to 50 000 (Hahnemannian quinquagintamillesimal) dilutions. Dilution by 1 to 10 denotes 1 part processed with 9 parts of diluent (Hahnemannian decimal), dilution by 1 to 100, 1 p art processed with 99 parts (Hahnemannian or Korsakovian centesimal), and so on. The number preceding the letters (e.g. D, C or LM) normally indicates the number of dilution steps employed (Table 1). As a consequence of different views in various approach es in homeotherapy and because the notion of these terms may depend on the nature of the starting materials, the terms \"high potency\" and \"low potency\" cannot be defined unambiguously. Potentisation (also called dinamization) : The combined process of seri al dilution and succussion or trituration at each step in the manufacture of homeopathic medicines from stocks. (According to the tenet of homeopathy, potentisation represents the process by which the activity of a homeopathic medicine is developed.) Table 1: Potency table Dilution ratio designation(s) etc. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January only the Hahnemannian method of manufacture (multi -flask method) is us ed. bFor 1:100 dilution ratios a C potency is assumed to use the Hahnemannian method of manufacture (multi -flask method) and can also be denoted as CH. When the Korsakovian method of manufacture (single -flask method) is used, the potency is designated as C K or K. Sarcodes: Homeopathic medicines made from healthy animal tissues or secretions. In Greek, sarcode means fleshly. Source material (raw material, starting material, mother substance): Source material is the original raw material used for the produc tion of homeopathic medicines. This material is obtained from natural sources, e.g. of botanical, zoological, microbiological, mineral, chemical, animal and human origin, or synthetic procedures. Source materials may undergo preliminary treatment in order to be further processed. Stock: Substances or preparations made from the source materials (e.g. by maceration, succussion or trituration) used as starting points for the produc tion of homeopathic medicines.

Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 34 1.2.2 BIOLOGICS The term biopharmaceutical was coined in the 80s to define proteins that were made by recombinant DNA technology [which includes hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production] . Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active substance is made by or derived from a living org anism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormones, enzymes or antibodies. Biological substan ce is defined as a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs, for its characterization and the determination of its quality , a combination of physicochemical -biological testing together with the production process a nd its controls. Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Biological products can also be defined as: \"a protein (including antibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other than direct extraction from a native (non-engineered) biological source\". This corresponds to the new biotechnology view (that is, by elimination, it is largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products) . The term Biotechnology product and Biological prod uct are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceuticals (by the broad biotechnology view) . Note: Today, biologics have become inextricably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consensus is that the term Biologic and Biopharmaceutical are in terchangeable . Biologics include a range products such as: Vaccines; Blood products; Monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics); Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 35 Recombinant proteins: - Insulins - Hormones - Erythropoetins and other hematopoiet ic factors - Cytokines: Interferons, interleuki ns, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis does not include: Metabolites from microorganisms; e.g . antibiotics and synthesis; . peptides/ oligo - nucleotides produced by chemical synthesis; Whole blood or cellular blood components. Note: This document is not intended to apply on the control of genetically modified live organisms designed to be used directly in humans, e.g. live vaccines For details, please refer Appendix 3: Guideline on Registration of Biologics and Guideline on Registration for Biosimilars in Malaysia 1.2.3 GENERICS A generic product is a product that is essentially similar to a currently registered product in Malaysia. However, the term generic is not applicable to Biologics. Generics may be further classified into two groups: 1. Scheduled Poison (Known as Controlled Medicine/ Controlled Poison) Products containing poisons as listed in the First Schedule under Poisons Act 19 52. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 36 2. Non-scheduled Poison (Known as Non -Poison or \"Over -the-Counter\", OTC) Product s conta ining active ingredients which are not listed in the First Schedule under Poisons Act 1952; and is excluding active ingredient which is categorized under health sup plement s or natural product s or cosmetic s. 1.2.4 HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS A Health Supplement (HS) means any product that is used to supplement a diet and to maintain, enhance and improve the health function of human body. It is presented in small unit dosage forms (to be administered) such as capsules, tablets, powder, liquids and shall not include any sterile preparations (i.e. injectable s, eyedrops).

In recent years, many consumers also rely on a variety of \"dietary supplements\" to improve their health. These diverse products are freely available through a myriad of outle ts. A variety of products are available in the market, supposedly for the maintenance, prevention and even treatment of chronic diseases. These products may range from foods modified to have special properties or pure forms of vitamins and minerals to extr act of various botanical or animal products. It is important to monitor and regulate the marketing and sale of these products so as to protect the interest of the consumer. Some of these products are not clearly marketed as \"food\" or \"drugs\". These have been termed as \"food -drug interface (FDI) products\" and include a variety of so -called health products. Previously, it had been difficult to determine which authority within the Ministry of Health Malaysia should regulate the marketing and sale of such p roducts, either FSQD or NPCB. This has caused difficulty to the companies intending to market such products. It is also not beneficial to the consumer as the products could be in the market and not regulated by either of the authorities. To overcome thes e problems and to enable a decision to be made as to which authority should regulate a particular product, the Committee for the Classification of Food -Drug Interface Products has been formed since year 2000. The main terms of reference of the Committee is to assist the FSQD and NPCB in classifying, in a consistent manner, an application from the industry which is not clearly defined as a food or drug product that is a FDI product. Other duties include advising the two divisions of the Ministry of Health in strengthening and updating the relevant regulations as well as to provide scientific input on these products. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 39 1.3.2 CLASSIFICATION OF FDI PRODUCTS The Committee for the Classification of Food -Drug Interface Products, comprising of members from FSQD and NPCB has established a system for the classification of FDI products. This classification is based on multiple criteria, as outlined below: a) Main criteria The ingredients of the product are the main criteria of this classification process: i) If the prod uct content close to 100% of active ingredients, e.g. amino acids & peptides, collagen, coral calcium, dietary fibre, enzymes, fatty acids, live microorganism, minerals, plant stanol/ sterol & esters, vitamins, etc, the product has to be regulated by NPCB. ii) Substances or ingredients used for therapeutic purposes shall not be added to food. For examples : gypsum fibrosum, pearl powder and gamat (stichopus spp.) . iii) # A product content close t o 100% of a herb or a mixture of herbs that are not traditionally used as food and possess medicinal values if shall be regulated by NPCB. Examples of such products are psyllium husk, pegaga tablet, and rooibos tea. iv) # Herbs and spices that are traditionally used in food preparation shall be regulated by FSQD e.g . black cumin (habbatus sauda), garlic, ginger, pegaga, traditional chinese raw herbs, turmeric. v) Products containing a mixture of food ingredients with active ingredients and/or herbs identified in point marked with # above shall be classified according to the 80:20 ratio general rule below, unless otherwise specified . - If a product contains more than 20% of the active ingredients or natural ingredients with pharmacological and/or therapeutic properties, such a product shall be regulated by NPCB. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 40 - If a product c ontains equal to or less than 20% of active ingredients or natural ingredients with pharmacological and/or therapeutic properties, the product shall be regulated by FSQD. - Notwithstanding this general rule, if a product contains specific active ingredient s which possess high pharmacological or therapeutic potencies, the product may be regulated by NPCB even if these active ingredients are present in less than 20% . vi) When there is greater uncertainty regarding the safety of a product, it shall be regulated b y NPCB. This is to enable closer monitoring of such products, so as to safeguard the interest of the consumer. vii) Notwithstanding the above points, the following ingredients do not follow the 80:20 ratio general rule mentioned above and shall be regulated by NPCB: - Plant sterols/ stanols and esters that are consumed 3.5g/day - Psyllium husk that are consumed 3.5g/day b) Other criteria The following may be used as additional criteria to assist in the classification of FDI products: i) Intended use and claims made by the product Eventually, if a product has been decided to be regulated by FSQD, no claims should be made, other than those permitted by the Food Regulations. ii) Dosage form - Any foods or combination of foods that are regulated under FSQD shall not be in the form of soft gel, capsule or tablet that is to be directly swallowed. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pha rmaceutical Control Bureau First Edition, January 2013 41 - Any product to be regulate d under NPCB shall not be in the conventional food form such as cake, muffins, biscuits, gummy, jelly, chocolate, premix beverages etc. iii) Unusual application - Products with unusual application for example spray may not be accepted by FSQD. - Products of coffee/ tea (coffea species/ camellia sinensis) containing herbs and a mixture of creamer and sugar are not allowed to be registered under category of natural product by NPCB. iv) Oils in pharmaceutical dosage form Oils that are not traditionally used as food or are in combination with edible oil for example evening primrose oil, garlic oil, fish oil, flaxseed oil and grapeseed oil in capsule or soft gel shall be regulated by NPC B. Notes: Applicant shall verify on FDI product classification with NPCB in order to determine whether the product shall be registered by the Authority or otherwise.

Studies comparing availability or establishing equivalence of similar products would be useful. B) BIOEQUIVALENCE (BE) STUDY Note: This requirement is applicable to gener ics (scheduled poison) only. With the increasing availability of generic products, a mechanism is required to ensure that such products are therapeutically equivalent to the innovators products and are clinically interchangeable. In practice, demonstrat ion of bioequivalence (BE) is generally the most appropriate method of substantiating therapeutic equivalence between medicinal products. A list of drug substances, which, when formulated in oral solid dosage forms, require BE data as a prerequisite for re gistration, has been established by the authority (please refer to BPFK website at http://www.bpfk.gov.my ). This list is updated based on the requirements. Bioequivalence (BE) Study Requirements for Generic Product in Immediate Release, Oral Solid Dosage Form Submitted as a Second Source Application In general, for a second source application of a generic product (immediate release, oral solid dosage form), BE study report from the actual manufacturing site must be submitted during the submission of application for registration. The base of this requirement is due to the difference in manufacturing site from the first source that may change the characteristic and specifications of a second source product. However, biowaiver can be considered, provided that Comparative Dissolution Profile (CPD) report against the registered first source product is submitted as a surrogate to bioequivalence study conducted for the second source product and all the following condition s shall be fulfilled: Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 151 a) Bioequivalence study conducted using the registered first source product has been evaluated by the NPCB and found satisfactory. b) The second source product is the same as registered first source product used in the bioequivalence stud y in terms of: i) Product formulation; ii) Equipment used in the manufacturing process; iii) Source and supplier of raw material; iv) Quality control and specifications of raw material; v) Manufacturing process of product and standard operating procedures; vi) Environmental con ditions during the manufacturing process of product; vii) Quality control and specifications of finished product. c) Comparative Dissolution Profile must be conducted in accordance to ASEAN Guidelines for the Conduct of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies including the calculation of similarity factor (f2) to prove the similarity of these two products. d) Process validation has been conducted on 3 pilot or commercial batches of the second source product and found satisfactory by the NPCB . This exemption is n ot applicable for any new submission of application for registration of a first source product. BE study must be conducted for this produ ct which is manufactured at the actual manufacturing site submitted for registration . (Reference: Circular Bil.(10)dlm.BPFK/PPP/07/18Jld.1 , 2 Jun 2011) Starting on 1st of January 2012, bioequivalence (BE) study is required for all application of registrations for generic products containing scheduled po ison in the form of immediate release, oral, solid dosage form whereas renewal of registered products, the effective date is on 1st January 2013. (Directive Arahan di Bawah Peraturan 29, March 2011 Bil (10) dlm BPFK/PPP/01/03 Jld 1 ) Sponsors or BE study centers are compulsory to notify the Authority pertaining to all BE studies which do not require Clinical Trial Import Licence (CTIL) or Clinical Trial Exemptions (CTX) and are going to be done at either local or overseas BE study centers for registered products or products to be registered in Malaysia (Directive Arahan di Bawah Peraturan 29, Peraturan -peraturan Kawalan Kosmetik Bil. 13 Tahun 2011 , 14 October 2011 , Bil (23) dlm BPFK/PPP/01/03 Jld 1 ). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 152 Effective 1st March 2013, biowaiver may be granted to generic immediate release oral solid dosage form products containing BCS Class I active ingredients listed in the Guidance On Biopharmaceuticals Classification System (BCS) - Based Biowaiver document. BCS Based biowaivers takes the three major factors that govern the rate and exten t of drug absorption from immediate -release solid dosage forms into accounts i.e. solubility and permeability of the drug substance/ API, and dissolution characteristics of the dosage form. This BCS approach provides an opportunity to waive in vivo pharmac okinetic bioequivalence testing for certain categories of immediate -release drug products. (Directive Arahan 1 Tahun 201 3, 14 October 2011 , 28 February 2013, Bil (101)dlm.BPFK/PPP/01/03 Jld 2 ). For more information on BE, please refer Bioequivalence (BE) . 2.2 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS For biologics, health supplements and natural products, please refer guidelines for the respective product category at : a) Appendix 3 : Guidelines on Registration of Biologics b) Appendix 4: Guideline on Registration of Health Supplements c) Appendix 5: Guideline on Registration of Natural Products Please refer as well on Appendix 11: Guideline on Filling the Online Application Form for Product Registration v ia Quest Syste m before submission of an application for product registration.Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 153 APPENDIX 3: GUIDELINES ON REGISTRATION OF BIOLOGICS 1.

Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active substance is made by or derived from a living organism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and may be produced by biotechnolog y methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormones, enzymes or antibodies. Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Biological products can also be defined as: \"a protein (including an tibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other than direct extraction from a native (non - engineered) biological source\". This corresponds to the new biotechnology view (that is, by elimination, it i s largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products). The term Biotechnology product and Biological product are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceuticals (by the broad biotechnology view). Note: Today, biologics have become inextricably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consensus is that a Biologic and Biopharmaceutical are interchangeable terminology, but a biologic might incorporate some other products (e.g. allergenics, somatic cells etc.). Biologics include a wide range of products such as: Vaccines; Blood products; Monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics); Recombinant proteins: - Insulins - Hormones - Erythropoetins and other hematopoietic factors - Cytokines : interferons, interleukins, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis factors. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 157 But does not include: Metabolites from microorganisms; e.g antibiotics and some hormones. Macromolecules produced by chemical synthesis; e.g peptides/oligo -nucleotides produc ed by chemical synthesis. Whole blood or cellular blood components. Note: This document is not intended to apply to the control of genetically -modified live organisms designed to be used directly in humans, e.g. live vaccines. 3.1.2 INTRODUCTION It is acknowledged that biological substances used in the practice of medicines make a vital contribution to health care. Nevertheless, because of their nature, biologicals demand special attention with regard to their regulations to assure quality, efficacy an d safety. Biologicals are inherently variable due to their biological nature, produced from biological materials, and often tested in biological test systems, themselves variable, a feature that has important consequences for the safety and efficacy of the resulting product. Each product must be evaluated on its own merits. A prerequisite for the use of biological is therefore to assure the consistency of quality and safety from lot - to-lot. Today, the biological field is one of enormous expansion and incr easing diversity, most especially in the area of new biotechnologies. The revolution of DNA -based and other cell technologies has opened up a new and exciting vista, and in many instances, traditional products are being replaced by equivalents derived by recombinant DNA technologies or other cutting -edge technologies. It is important to note that the demonstration that a product consistently possesses a desired characteristics of safety and efficacy will depend on a multifaceted approach on the part of man ufacturer and the regulatory authority - drawing on thorough characterization of starting materials, demonstration of consistency of production, and appropriate selection of lot release tests - all under the stringent and documented controls imposed by goo d manufacturing practices - as well as rigorous post marketing surveillance activities. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 158 3.2 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF BIOLOGICS Specific requirements for registration of biologic/ biopharmaceutical are described as follows: - Requirements f or Registration of Biologics (Vaccines and Biotechnology products); - Requirements for Registration of Blood Products. 3.2.1 REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF BIOLOGICS (VACCINES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS) a) VACCINES: i) DEFINITION OF VACCINE A vaccine contains an active component (the antigen). A vaccine is an immunogen, the administration of which is intended to stimulate the immune system to result in the prevention, amelioration or therapy of any disease or infection. Vaccines for human use includ e one or more of the following: a) microorganisms inactivated by chemical/ physical means that retain appropriate immunogenic properties; b) living microrganisms that have been selected for their attenuation whilst retaining immunogenic properties; c) antigen ex tracted from microorganisms, secreted by them or produced by recombinant DNA technology; or d) antigen produced by chemical synthesis in vitro . The antigens may be in their native state, truncated or modified following introduction of mutations, detoxifie d by chemical or physical means and/or aggregated, polymerized or conjugated to a carrier to increase immunogenicity. Antigens may be presented plain or in conjunction with an adjuvant, or in combination with other antigens, additives and other excipients.

Plasma -derived therapies and their recombinant analogs are unique among pharmaceuticals and biologics. Their production begins with a biological starting materi al, human plasma. Each therapy has a unique biochemical profile as a result of differences in production and processing methods that can lead to differing clinical responses and efficacy among patients. Hence, from the starting material, through manufac turing and final distribution to patients, the complexities of producing blood products places it in a unique class of biologics. Blood products are regulated as medicinal product. Blood products are inherently variable due to their biological nature, and the biological methods to test them. They are subjected to comprehensive assessment of the quality, efficacy and safety. Four (4) principal complementary approaches are adopted: Starting material: Assurance of the quality and safety of the plasma for fractionation. Manufacturing technique: Control of the fractionation and subsequent manufacturing procedures for isolation, purification, viral inactivation and/or removal steps. Good manufacturing practice (GMP): Strict adherence to GMP. Adoption of GMP as an essential tool of Quality Assurance System. Product Compliance: Standardization of biological methods needed in characterisation of in -process and finished products. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 168 Plasma for fractionation and blood products that are regulated by National Ph armaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) includes: Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated in Malaysia for use in Malaysia; Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated overseas for use in Malaysia; and Plasma products d erived from overseas -sourced plasma fractionated in Malaysia for use overseas. b) REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF BLOOD PRODUCTS 1.

A significant part of the quality of a finished pharmaceutical product is dependent on the quality of the Active Pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used for its formulation. Thus, a proper system of qualification of suppliers is necessary to ensure a constant sourcing of APIs of appropriate quality and to safeguard the public health interests. This will be done through standardized quality assessment and inspection procedures. 1.2. The National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) under the purview of the Ministry of Health Malaysia will introduce mandatory control of APIs as part of the requirements in the product registration application. This will be implemented prospectively according to a phased timeline established by the NPCB . 1.3. The implementation will begin with voluntary submission fo r New Chemical Entities in April 2011 and followed by; Phase 1 - New Chemical Entity (mandatory in Jan 2012) Phase 2 - Scheduled Poison, (to be determined) Phase 3 - Non-scheduled Poison (to be determined) 1.4. The procedure for control of API s established by the NPCB is based on the following principles: A general understanding of the production and qu ality control activities of the manufacturer; Assessment of API data and i nformation, including changes and variations, submitted by the product registration holder (PRH) / API manufacturer . These data should include the manufacturing process, material specifications and test data and results; Assessment of the manufacturing site (s) for consistency in production and quality control of raw materials, with specific emphasis on key raw materials and APIs during and after purification through compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP ); Random sampling and testing of APIs (post -marketing surveillance) ; Handling of complaints and recalls; and Monitoring of complaints from other agencies and countries. 1.5. This guideline is intended to provide guidance regarding the requirement s to be included for API s in the quality part of the produ ct dossier. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 313 2. DEFINITION 2.1 DEFINITION OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (API) Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when used so, becomes an active ingredient of that ph armaceutical dosage form. Such substances are intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and fun ction of the body (WHO Technical Report Series No.970,2012). 2.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (API) API classification can be divided into: Inorganic substance s; Organic substa nces (isolated from material s of animal or human origin) ; and Organic substances (synthetic or semi -synthetic or isolated from herbal sources or micro -organisms). 3. SCOPE 3.1. This Guideline encompasses the APIs of new products for registration. This is applic able to all pharmaceutical products (excluding traditional products , veterinary products, and health supplement products ) both locally manufactured and imported. 3.2. Biological active substances and immunological active substances are excluded from the scope of this Guideline . 3.3. APIs used in products for export only (FEO) are exempted from the requirement for submission of the Drug Master File (DMF) and Certification of Suitability (CEP) in the product application. 3.4. The DMF and CEP are only applicable for final APIs and not API intermediates . 3.5. Separate registration of the APIs is not a requirement for the purpose of product registration. However, the required technical documentation Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 314 pertaining to each API should be submitted with the new online product registrat ion application. 3.6. Assessment of an API will be performed once submission of an application for registration of a product using the said API is made by a Product Registration Holder . 4. PROCEDURE FOR SUBMISSION 4.1 HOW TO SUBMIT 4.1.1 The PR H of the produc t registration shall submit Part 2. S ACTD as part of product application . Where any information required as per ACTD is not available the DMF will be required. 4.1.2 The DMF may be submitted via an electronic copy (CD) or a hardcopy (optional) directly to the NPC B to maintain confidentiality of the contents. 4.1.3 The NPCB may accept a CEP issued by E uropean Directorate for the Quality of Medicine (EDQM) in lieu of the DMF of an API. 4.2 REQUIRED INFORMATION The API information can be submitted to National Pharmaceu tical Control Bureau (NPCB) in one of the following three options: Option 1: Drug Master File (DMF) procedure; or Option 2: Certificate of suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP); or Option 3: Full details of \"Part II S ACTD\" in the Produ ct Dossier The applicant should clearly indicate at the beginning of the API section (in the Product Dossier) how the information on the API for each API manufacturer is being submitted.

The information should confirm the identity and stability of the API by providing appropriate structure elucidation and stability studies ; and, Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 316 The control of the API manufacturing process as well as the ability to produce a n API with reproducible physical p roperties and impurity profiles should be dem onstrated. 4.2.3 Any additional information regarding the API shall be requested by the NPCB, as deemed necessary . 4.3 Other considerations In the spirit of harmonis ation of r egulatory activities and optimis ation of efficient assessment, The NPCB will take into consideration the evaluation of relevant APIs by the regulatory authorities of the reference countries (Australia, Japan, France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, and the United State of America ) and, other PIC/S countries and World Health Orga nization (WHO). 4.4 Processing Fee Not required as the API applica tion is already incorporated in the application for product registration . 5. DRUG MASTER FILE (DMF) 5.1. The Drug Master File (DMF) is a document that may be used to provide confidential detaile d information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. 5.2. The DMF submitted to the NPCB should contain the information as required under sections listed in Part 2.S ACT D. 5.3. Technical contents of a DMF are reviewed only in connection with the review of a new application for product registration 5.4. DMFs are generally created to allow an authorized party other than the holder of the DMF to refer the DMF without disclosing to any other party the contents of the file. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 317 5.5. The ICH M4Q Technical Guideline and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements (ACTR) provide details on the information to be included in the API sections of an application dossier. 5.6. Where the dru g substance and the drug product are manufactured by the same company, information on the production, quality control and stability of the drug substance may be submitted as part of the dossier for the drug product (ACTD) rather than in a separate DMF. How ever, the company is not precluded from submitting a DMF for the drug substance if it prefers to do so. 5.7 . The DMF is divided into two parts , namely the O pen (or PRH s) part and the C losed (or confidential) part. 5.8 The documents required for an applicat ion making a reference to a DMF are as follows: From the PRH : o Open part of the DMF from the PRH , as part of the submitted product dossier (t he open part contains most of the information in Part 2.S (ACTD) - i.e. sections S1, S2.1 and S3 to S7 ); S1 Gener al Information 1.1 Nomenclature 1.2 Structure 1.3 General Properties S2 Manufacture 2.1 Manufacture (s)/Site of Manufacture S3 Characterisation 3.1 Elucidation of Structure and other Characteristics 3.2 Impurities S4 Control of API/Drug Substanc e 4.1 Specification 4.2 Analytical Procedures 4.3 Validation of Analytical Procedures 4.4 Batch Analysis 4.5 Justification of Specification S5 Reference Standards or Materials S6 Container Closure System S7 Stability From the API Manufacturer: o The complete (open part and closed part) DMF from the API manufacturer . The closed part contains the confidential information in section Part 2.S.2. ACTD - i.e. section 2); Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 318 S2 Manufacture 2.1 Manufacture (s)/ Site of Manufacture 2.2 Description of Manufactu ring Process and Process Controls 2.3 Control of Materials 2.4 Controls of Critical Steps and intermediates 2.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation 2.6 Manufacturing Process Development o An original Letter of Access (see below). The Letter of Access autho rizes the NPCB to refer to the DMF, in support of the application for a drug product. Thus, the Letter of Access must state the following: The name of the drug product (product name, dosage form and product strength) to be registered; The local PRH responsible for finished product registration; and, A declaration that both the local PRH and the NPCB shall be notified of any change in the API specification or in the manufacturing process that will likely affect the products quality or safety. It is th e responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the complete DMF ( i.e. both the applican ts Open part and the API manufacturer's closed part ) is supplied to NPCB directly by the API manufacturer and that the applicant has access to the relevant informatio n in the DMF concerning the current manufacture of the API. 5.9. The API Manufacturer may submit the DMF via electronic copy (CD) or hardcopy (optional) directly to the NPCB to maintain confidentiality of the contents. The information contained in the re stricted part of the DMF will be regarded as confidential and will only be evaluated in support of the applications mentioned in the L etter of Access . The confidential information will not be disclosed to any third party without a written authorization fro m the API Manufacturer . 5.10. Upon receipt of the DMF, a BPFK DMF number will be assigned to the application for product registration. For future correspondences, the PRH and the API Manufacture should make a reference to this assigned BPFK DMF number. Should t here be deficiencies within the restricted part of the DMF; The NPCB will raise queries directly with the API Manufacturer . The PRH referencing a DMF is required to incl ude a copy of the API Manufacturers L etter of Access in the application. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 319 5.11. API Manufact urer is responsible to maintain and update the DMF. The PRH should file a variation once they are notified with the changes to the DMF. 5.12. API Manufacturer Obligations: Any change or addition, including a change in authorization related to specific PRH , shall be submitted to the NPCB in duplicate and adequately cross -referenced to previous submission(s). The reference should include the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s) affected. Should any change to a DMF is necessary, the API Manufactu rer shall notify each affected PRH who has referenced the DMF of the pertinent change. Such n otice should be provided well before making the change in order to permit the PRH to supplement or amend any affected application(s) as needed. 5.13. A DMF is not requi red for common inorg anic salts (for example, sodium chloride, and other common electrolytes) used and regarded as API in products such as injections and dialysis solutions, and simple organic compounds available commercially in high purity (for example, na tural occurring organic acids and their salts, including ascorbic acid and sodium citrate, and simple mono - and disaccharides such as glucose and sucrose). Although a DMF is not required for these active ingredients, evidence needs to be submitted by the f inished PRH that the substance is obtained from a reliable source and consistently comply with the applicable pha rmacopoeial specifications. Any non -pharmacopoeial specifications need to be assessed by the NPCB to determine their appropriateness and adequa cy to ensure the quality of the substance. 5.14. Where a DMF is submitted for a n API controlled according to a pharmacopoeia monograph, the DMF should include a discussion of the potential impurities most likely to arise during synthesis using the actual manufa cturing process described in the DMF together with evidence that these impurities are adequately controlled by the test procedures described in the pharmacopoeial monograph. Where particular impurities found in the substance are not listed in the monograph , a justification (including toxicological data, if appropriate) should be provided. Details on the principles for the control of impurities (e.g. reporting, identification and qualification) are outlined in the ICH Q3A, Q3B and Q3C guidelines. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 320 6. CERTIFI CATES OF SUITABILITY (CEP) 6.1. CEP stands for certification of suitability of European Pharmacopoeia monographs/ Certificate of Pharmacopoeia. 6.2. The CEP is a document that is used to demonstrate that the purity of a given substanc e produced by a given manufa cturer is suitably controlled by the relevant monograph(s) of the European Pharmacopoeia. By demonstrating grant a CEP for given API , the suppliers of the API can prove such suitability to their pharmaceutical industry clients and the NPCB. 6.3. The PRH shoul d include a copy of the most current CEP in the dossier, together with the following: A written assurance that no significant changes in the manufacturing method s or processing have taken place following the granting of the certificate or its last revisi on and A declaration from the API manufacturer that the local PRH and the NPCB shall be notified should there be any future change in the API specification s in the manufacturing process that is likely to affect the products quality or safety . Note: All such written statements must state the name of the drug product (product name, dosage form and pro duct strength) to be registered and the local PRH responsible for finished product registration . 6.4 If reference is made to a CEP, the PRH should submit a copy of the valid CEP, including all annexes, in lieu of a DMF. Along with the CEP, the applicant should supply the following information in the product dossier. 3.2.S.1.3 General properties - discussions on any ad ditional applicable physicochemical and other relevant API properties that are not controlled by the CEP and Ph.Eur. monograph, e.g. solubilities and polymorphs as per guidance in this section. 3.2.S.3.1 Elucidation of structure and other characterist ics - studies to identify polymorphs (exception: where the CEP specifies a polymorphic form) and particle size distribution, where applicable, as per guidance in this section. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 321 3.2.S.4.1 Specification - the specifications of the FPP manufacturer includ ing all tests and limits of the CEP and Ph.Eur. monograph and any additional tests and acceptance criteria that are not controlled in the CEP and Ph.Eur. monograph, such as polymorphs and/or particle size distribution. 3.2.S.4.2/ S.4.3 Analytical proc edures and validation - for any methods used by the FPP manufacturer in addition to those in the CEP and Ph.Eur. monograph. 3.2.S.4.4 Batch analysis - results from two batches of at least pilot scale, demonstrating compliance with Ph. Eur. monograph a nd including any additional tests/ limits listed on the CEP (e.g. residual solvents, additional impurity tests) or the product manufacturers API specifications. * In cases where the drug product manufacturer tests the CEP certified API according to speci fication other than Ph.Eur . (i.e. USP, JP, In -House etc .) data covering S 4.1 to S4 .5 should be submitted by the PRH . 3.2.S.5 Reference standards or materials - information on the FPP Manufacture rs reference standards. 3.2.S.6 Container closure s ystem - specifications including descriptions and identification of primary packaging components. Exception: where the CEP specifies a container closure system and the applicant declares to use the same container closure system. 3.2.S.7 Stability - exception: where the CEP specifies a re -test period that is the same as or of longer duration, and storage conditions which are the same or higher temperature and humidity as proposed by the applicant. In the case of sterile APIs, data on the sterilization process of the API, includ ing validation data, should be included in the PD. 6.5 The NPCB reserves the right to request for any additional information about the API when deemed appropriate. 6.6 . The PRHs responsibility to submit the latest CEP updates, with annexes, as soon as it is available from the API manufacturer. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 322 7. FULL DETAILS OF API INFORMATION IN THE PRODUCT DOSSIER APPLICATION 7.1. Information on the Active pharmaceutical ingredient sections (ACTD Part II S), including full details of chemistry, manufact uring process, quality controls during manufacturing and process validation for the API, should be submitted in the product dossier. 7.2. The ICH M4Q Technical Guideline and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements (ACTR) provide details on the information to be i ncluded in the API sections of an application dossier. 7.3. If drug product contains more than one API, the information within Part II S (ACTD) must be provided for each API. 7.4. Where the drug substance and the drug product are manufactured by the same company, information on the production, quality control and stability of the drug substance may be submitted as part of the dossier for the drug product (ACTD) rather than in a separate DMF. However, the company is not precluded from submitting a DMF for the drug substance if it prefers to do so. 8. STABILITY DATA OF API 8.1. Stability test data for an API should be provided , for at least 3 primary batches . These data should include: Batch details ( e.g., batch number, date of manufacture , batch size, use of batch ); The general test methodology ( e.g., duration of study, storage conditions of temperature and humidity, time points when samples were removed for analysis etc.); The analytical test methods ( e.g., assay method of quantitation, determination of degradation pro ducts, moisture etc); Validation of test methods; Results of tests; and, Conclusions. 8.2. In circumstances where an API retest period has not been established and complete real time stability data is not available at the time of submission, the minimum stabil ity data required are as follows: Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 323 At least 12 months of real time data and 6 months of accelerated data on at least three primary batches of the API ; The batches should be at least pilot scale -sized and manufactured by a method that simulates the fina l commercial process. * In view of this, the re -test date may be extended beyond the end of real time studies which can be extrapolated not more than 12 months covered by the real time data. 8.3. Where the API is sourced from multiple sites, stability data from each site should be provided. 8.4. The NPCB may request for additional stability data if deemed necessary for the evaluation of the application. 8.5. Stability data is not required where the CEP specifies a re -test period that is the same as or of longer durat ion than the re -test period proposed by the applicant . 9. SITE INSPECTION 9.1. Depending on the outcome of the evaluation of the API dossier, a risk -based approach will be used in the planning of inspections; the approach will take into account the typ e of APIs as well as the outcome, results and reports of inspections conducted by other regulatory authorities or competent organiz ations. 9.2. The NPCB shall plan and coordinate the pe rformance of inspections at the manufacturing site(s) of the APIs and that of t he ke y intermediate (if relevant) to assess compliance with the relevant sections of the relevant GMP Guidelines, and will compare the technical information on the manufacturing process given i n the API dossier shall be compared with the manufacturing proc ess actually carried out on the manufacturing site. 9.3. All such inspections shall be performed by inspectors deemed to possess sufficient qualifications and experience in order to perform such inspections, to be competent in areas such as production and qua lity control of pharmaceuticals, and have appropriate experience in the area of GMP. Such inspectors shall perform the inspections and report on its findings in accordance with established S tandard Operating Procedure s (SOPs) so as to ensure a standard har moniz ed approach. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 324 10. MAINTENANCE OF APPROVAL STATUS 10.1. Manufacturers of finished products should establish a mechanism by which manufacturers/ suppliers of an API shall provide information on any changes (i.e., variations) in manufacture and c ontrol that may have impact on the safety, purity and quality of the API. It is the PRH s responsibility to provide the NPCB with the appropriate documentation (referring to relevant parts of the dossier) to prove that any intended or implemented variation will not have an impact on the safety, purity and quality of the API that has been previously approved. For those APIs approved by the NPCB, an evaluation of such variations shall be performed with accordance to the ASEAN Variation Guidelines. 10.2. Random sa mples of APIs suppli ed to manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical products may be taken for independent testing if there is a need. Certificates of Analysis released by the API manufacturer as well as specifications for test methods shall be provided by the API manufacturer or the PRH to the NPCB for review upon request. In the event of failure to meet the established criteria for testing, the NPCB shall proceed to investigate and communicate this problem to the manufacturer concerned. 10.3. The NPCB may con duct a re -evaluation of the APIs at a 5 year interval. If, as a result of this re -evaluation, it is found that a n API and/or specif ied manufacturing site(s) no longer complies with the recom mended standards, such APIs and manufacturing sites will be remove d from the approved list. Prior notice to the PRH and API manufacturer shall be issued from the NPCB regarding such decision. 10.4. Re-evaluation may also be done in any situation deemed necessary, including the following : If any omissions by the manufacture r in the initial assessment procedure or during the follow -up activities is evident in relation to the requirements. This includes compliance with GMP. If any batch(s) of supplied APIs is considered not to be in compliance with the agreed specification of the API; If the CEP, or an API for which a CEP dossier was submitted, is cancelled or refused based on the assessment of the dossier for any other reason; and, Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 325 If in the opinion of the NPCB, changes made in the sourcing of key intermediates, route of sy nthesis, facility or other production, require that reassessment be made.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia - related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increa sed risk of treatment -emergent hyperglycemia -related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia -related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes ) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyp erglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when t he atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti -diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

For patients receiving haemodialysis, healthcare professionals may consider prompt haemodialysis following GBCA administration in order to enhance the contrast agents elimination. However, it is unknown if haemodialysis prevents NSF. Determine the renal function of patients by obtaining a medical history of conducting laboratory tests that measure renal function prior to using GBCA. The risk, if any, for developing NSF among patients with mi ld to moderate renal insufficiency or normal renal function is unknown. Post-marketing reports have identified the development of NSF following single and multiple administrations of GBCAs. - Exposure to gadolinium - based contrast agents (GBCAs) increases the risk for Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF ) in patients with: acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 30mL/min/1.73m\u00b2), or acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepato -renal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. - NSF is a d ebilitating and sometimes fatal disease affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs - Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnotic information is essential and not available with non -contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). - Screen all patients fo r renal dysfunction by obtaining a history and/ or laboratory tests. - When administering a GBCA, do not exceed the dose recommended in product labelling.

Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Cases have been reporte d that occurred within the first month of treatment, including some within the first week. The cumulative dose of the treatment is a risk factor for serious hepatotoxicity. Factors which may increase the risk of hepatitis are prolonged treatment with ketoconazole tablets, females over 50 years of age, previous treatment with griseofulvin, a history of liver disease, known drug intolerance and concurrent use of medication which compromises liver function. A period of one month should be allowed between ces sation of griseofulvin treatment and commencement treatment with ketoconazole tablets because of an apparent association between recent griseofulvin therapy and hepatic reactions to ketoconazole tablets. Monitor liver function in all patients receiving t reatment with ketoconazole tablets (see Monitoring of hepatic function). Patients should be instructed to promptly report to their physician signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatitis such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain or dark urine. In these patients, treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function should be conducted. Because of the risk for serious hepatotoxicity, [BRAND NAME] should be used onl y when the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks, taking into consideration the availability of other effective antifungal therapy. Assess liver function, prior to treatment to rule out acute or chronic liver disease, and monit or at frequent and regular intervals during treatment, and at the first signs or symptoms of possible hepatotoxicity.

When the liver function tests indicate liv er injury, the treatment should be stopped immediately. A risk and benefit evaluation should be made before oral ketoconazole is used in cases of non -life threatening diseases requiring long treatment periods. In patients with elevated liver enzymes, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment should not be started unless the expected benefit exceeds the risk of hepatic injury. In such cases, close monitoring of the liver enzymes is necessary.

Dose titration in elderly patients should be exercised with caution. For products containing Trimetazidine 35mg: The dose is one tablet of 35mg of trimetazidine twice daily during meals. The benefit of the treatment should be assessed after three months and trimetazidine should be discontinued if there is no treatment response. Specia l populations Patients with renal impairment : In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [30-60] ml/min), the recommended dose is 1 tablet of 35mg in the morning during breakfast. Elderly patients : Elderly patients may have increased trimetazidine exposure due to age -related decrease in renal function. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [30 -60] ml/min), the recommended dose is 1 tablet of 35mg in the morning during breakfast. Dose titration in elderly pat ients should be exercised with caution. b) At part of Contraindications : - Parkinson disease, parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless leg syndrome, and other related movement disorders - Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30ml/min). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 424 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) c) At part of Special warnings and precautions for use : Trimetazidine can cause or worsen parkinsonian symptoms (tremor, akinesia, hypertonia), which should be regularly investigated, especially in elderly patients. In doubtful cases, patients should be referred to a neur ologist for appropriate investigations. The occurrence of movement disorders such as parkinsonian symptoms, restless leg syndrome, tremors, gait instability should lead to definitive withdrawal of trimetazidine . These cases have a low incidence and are u sually reversible after treatment discontinuation. The majority of the patients recovered within 4 months after trimetazidine withdrawal. If parkinsonian symptoms persist more than 4 months after drug discontinuation, a neurologist opinion should be sought . Falls may occur, related to gait instability or hypotension, in particular in patients taking antihypertensive treatment. Caution should be exercised when prescribing trimetazidine to patients in whom an increased exposure is expected: - moderate rena l impairment, - elderly patients older than 75 years old . d) At part of Side effects : Nervous system disorders: Frequency not known: Parkinsonian symptoms (tremor, akinesia, hypertonia), gait instability, restless leg syndrome, other related movement disord ers, usually reversible after treatment discontinuation.

Clear identification of the medicine, by whom and where it was manufactured. Providing complete instructions on the use of the medic ine. Original packing will maintain the integrity of the pack therefore ensuring the stability of the product. Original packing will carry batch number and expiry date . Prevent mix -ups (or contamination) during repacking and dispensing. Facilitate recall o f products since the required information can only be found on the original pack . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 430 10.5 CRITERIA FOR IMPLEMENTATION O F PATIENT DISPENSING PACK The patient dispensing pack size should be based on the medication, intended use, recommended dosage and dosag e form sufficient for one mont h supply or per treatment for on e patients use. This requirement does not apply for blister or strip pack . Maximum permitted supply is one month but may be less depending on the intended use of the medication. The Product Reg istration Holder (PR H) is responsible to justify the proposed patient dispensing pack size based on these criteria as the dosing regimen for certain medication may equate to high numbers of tablets/ capsules. Justification should also address the definitio n of one month i.e. 28, 30 or 31 days. Blister or strip pack are strongly recommended for solid oral dosage forms (e.g. tablets and capsules) and bulk loose pac k for supply more than one month are not permitted unless justified by the PRH . Oral chemotherap eutics in tablet or capsule must be packed in blister to reduce personnel exposure and presumably risk which can minimise the toxic effect of the chemotherapeutics . 10.6 PRODUCTS EXEMPTED FROM THIS REQUIREMENTS The requirements do not apply to the f ollowing products: Injectables, eye, ear and nasal drops, suppositories and pessaries. Products for export only (FEO). Drug where the risk of issuing more than the amount required by the patient outweigh the benefits of the patient dispensing pack e.g. pr oducts containing substances with potential for abuse or cytotoxic agents where precise dosing are required. Drugs where the dosing needs to be tailored according to patien ts body weight e.g. drugs used in oncology, HIV etc . Medically critical products an d hospital packs for rare diseases with very low volumes where it is not viable to produce special packs for a single market. Products sold with devices with a fixed number of doses Situations where a patient dispensing pack is not appropriate will be considered on a case to case basis. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) First Edition, January 2013 Page | 431 10.7 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS F OR IMPLEMENTATION VARIATION APPLICATIONS Change in patient pack size with or without involving new pack type shall be submitted to Variation Section, Centre for Post Product Registration. Supporting documents required are: a. Justification for the new pack size and/or type ; b. Accelerated stability data (3 or 6 months) and stab ility report for new pack types; and c. Commitment to provide complete real time stability data and report when available. List of products with recommended pack sizes for oral liquid preparations and dermatological are as in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. For tablets and capsules in loose pack, the maximum packing size will depend on the highest dosage and frequency per patients treatment or one month supply. 10.8 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE Implementation of patient dispensing pack has been conducted in a phased manner to ensure smooth transition while ensuring no supply disruption to patients. This implementation i s effective since 1 March 2008 on a voluntary basis and mandated on 1 September 2008 . All products manufactured from 1 September 2008 regardless whether it is imported or locally manufactured will need to conform to the principles of this guide. 10.9 CONCLUSION Patient Dispensing Pack is convenient, safe and improves quality of dispensed medicines. It will increase efficiency in dispensing and improve safety by reducing the risk and possibility of erro r. It will also result in a reduction in drug waste and better use of resources.
