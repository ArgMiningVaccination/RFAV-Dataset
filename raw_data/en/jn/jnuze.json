The following are a few of the highlights; see other reports for further details. Christine Law has been examining a recently-described and controversial approach that uses an alternative to BOLD contrast, based on hypothesized changes in populations of spins with fast and slow diffusion characteristics. The advantage demonstrated by the author of the original study, Denis LeBihan, is more rapid response to neural changes because the approach does not require the intervening step of changes in brain oxygenation to generate an NMR signal. A disadvantage is substantial reduction in sen-sitivity. The study is controversial because other investigators KDYH\u0003QRW\u0003EHHQ\u0003DEOH\u0003WR\u0003UHSOLFDWH\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfQGLQJV\u0011\u0003&KULVWLQH\u0003KDV\u0003IRXQ G\u0003 a small effect, but no evidence that the new contrast mechanism is operable. Nevertheless, investigation is continuing. The real-time fMRI projects include collaborations with Sean Mackey (Director of the Stanford Pain Center, Anesthesiology), Allan Reiss (Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research, Psychiatry), Ian Gotlib, (Director of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Lab, Psychology) and Brian Knutson, Psychology. A paper published in PNAS documents that, like normal subjects, chronic pain subjects can learn to con-trol their perception of pain using biofeedback that is developed by the processing of brain activation in the pain network during the scan. Apparently this control ability persists for months after the scanning sessions have ended. We have begun experiments in the areas of depression, learning disorders and addiction, us-ing the same technology to see whether subjects can learn to regulate brain regions important for these disorders.

Thermal ablation is a particularly promising method for the minimally invasive treatment of cancer. MRI is an ideal guidance modality because it can measure tissue tem-perature during the procedure. We have been developing im-provements in the imaging methods for MR thermometry of heated and frozen tissue. We are developing methods to make MR thermometry less sensitive to tissue motion. In addition, we have been developing improved imaging methods of ultrashort T2 tissues with eddy current calibrations and novel RF pulses. Our goal has been to better image frozen tissues, but these meth-ods are also applicable to imaging ultrashort T2 tissues such as bone, tendons, and ligaments. We have also been focused on the post-ablation assessment of tissue.

Our long-term aim is to push the limits in CT performance and to aid in the development of new applications.

The approach presents many opportunities, and we have already demonstrated excellent spatial resolution and complete freedom from cone beam artifacts (which can plague conven-tional systems when they try to image a thick region in a single scan). IGCT also presents a number of problems in the image reconstruction step. One is an increased computational burden that arises from the fact that the IGCT data greatly oversamples the object.

In FY 2006, we welcomed over 3,300 registrants to 14 cours-es. Our symposia are developed to educate radiologists, tech-nologists and scientists about impending transitions to new and emerging technologies. The Department's distinguished faculty serve as course directors and speakers for each program, and guest faculty from leading academic institutions worldwide are invited to complement our roster of presenters. The success of our program can be attributed to the strategic focus of our efforts. We construct large courses which are tai-lored to serve the changing educational needs of our target. By bringing together the world experts on key topics, we are able to offer unique, high quality meetings. In 2006 we grew our pro-gram by introducing courses on PET/CT, Small Animal Imaging and the Treatment of Venous Disease. In addition, our creative new meeting formats and careful selection of hotels and tim-ing allow us to differentiate our program from competing CME efforts.Our International Symposium on Multidetector Row CT (MDCT), now in its eighth year, is one of our most successful programs.

System and safety support is provided to the researchers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day to ensure that research endeav-ors are successful, generate valuable data, and, above all, are safe for the researchers, the human subjects and the MR system and its components (Figure 1). Magnet safety is an on-going concern as the MR environment can be a potentially lethal set-ting without continuing education and persevering support. The research environment generates many new prototype designs in RF imaging coils; imaging accessories; monitoring and response devices such as button boxes, eye trackers, and electroencepha-logram (EEG) recorders; and sensory devices. Evaluation of these new devices is on-going to ensure that neither the image data, the safety of the human subject, nor the integrity of the MR system is compromised by the presence of these devices in the magnet room, in the bore of the magnet, or in the presence of an RF coil.

We continue to pursue this mission ten years later. Our clinical goal is to deliver 3D imaging advances as rapidly as possible following validation to the Stanford and worldwide healthcare communities. Our educational goal is to disseminate knowledge and duplicate our 3D services at other institutions by providing training for local and international physicians and technologists in the latest developments in 3D imaging.

Clark Center, a building dedicated to interdisciplinary sci-ence. We have processed over 38,000 examinations since our inception in 1996, with an average annual increase of 35% (see Figure 1). We continue to provide 3D services for nearly every clinical department at the Stanford Medical Center. The major-ity of our referrals come from vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology, urology, reconstructive surgery, orthopedics, and neurosurgery. Ninety percent of our referrals are from CT examinations, the remainder are from MRI studies. With rapid advances in CT and MRI scanning over the past ten years, our 3D examinations provide a larger range of coverage with better temporal and spatial resolution (see Images 1 and 2). Education: Both 3D labs continue to be attended by a rota- tion of Stanford Radiology fellows, residents, and medical stu-dents who acquire skills in 3D interpretation which will be use-ful in their future clinical practices. Our 3D imaging specialists also train Stanford researchers from engineering and medical departments in the latest methodology for acquiring 3D images and data for their research projects. In response to the external demand for 3D imaging training, the 3D lab has sponsored an increasing number of domestic and international visiting radi-ologists and technologists who have sought training through our 3D clinical fellowship program. This program provides an ad-ditional means for disseminating the imaging and management knowledge and skills we have acquired into medical communi-ties around the world, allowing Radiology departments to offer 3D imaging to clinicians and patients in mainstream settings. This past year, we hosted approximately 50 visiting fellows from a combination of local, national, and international hospi-tals and medical centers. Our international fellows came from New Zealand, Japan, Hong Kong, Colombia, Canada, Thailand, Image 6.

The RLC is comprised of three distinct spaces: a conference room, an ad-jacent breakout room and a \"hotel\" space for visiting faculty. The vision for our project was to create a unique educational learning center to be used to advance radiology education and foster changes in the nature of learning, teaching and learning environments through the intelligent use of technology. The RLC conference room is located at the entrance to Lucas II and serves as a show site for the department's achieve-ments. It is a desirable teaching space for faculty and an inspir- ing resource which will draw talented students to Stanford for their education. It will further serve as a hub for faculty and vis-iting scholars. The room was designed to support interactive, collabora- tive group learning. It is a technology-intensive learning space, with multiple projection and plasma displays and an audio-video routing system that allows the instructor to work with a num-ber of computer and video \"sources\" in a number of different FRQ\u00bfJXUDWLRQV\u0011\u0003,W\u0003LQFOXGHV\u0003WHFKQRORJLHV\u0003IRU\u0003UHPRWH\u0003FRQIHUHQF - ing, audience polling, and satellite TV reception.

This will vastly improve our ability to plan long-term chronic studies on animal species in an approved USDA and AALAC animal facility. As always, our goal is to diligently provide support to our animal subjects with the utmost respect, compassion and professional care, while complying with all government and university regulations and policies. All studies are carried out under IACUC approved ani-mal use protocols that are reviewed by the APLAC panel yearly. Protocols are very explicit in terms of detailed procedures and approved personnel; deviation from a protocol is not permitted. All personnel are required to attend appropriate seminars in the use of animal subjects given by the Department of Comparative Medicine as required by Stanford University. In addition to our technical support, we have instituted a rodent use-training pro-gram that all personnel working with rodents in the Lucas Center are required to successfully complete. We look to the future with hope that through quality bio- medical research the necessity for animal use will decrease with the increased use of computerized models or other non-living research systems. With this in mind, we realize the privilege we are granted and strive for continued excellence in all research taking place within the Department of Radiology. ,?7,904,5;(3 \u0003(504(3\u000346+,3\u0003*(9,\u0003-(*030;@ >,5+@\u0003)(<4.(9+5,9 \u0013\u00039\u0015=\u0015;\u0015\u0013\u00033(; .\u0013\u0003+0(5,\u0003/6>(9+\u0013\u00039\u0015=\u0015;\u0015\u0013\u00033(; day-long procedure.\u001b\u00183\\JHZ\u0003(UU\\HS\u00039LWVY[\u0003\u0019\u0017\u0017 )XUWKHU\u0003\u00c0XRUHVFHQW\u0003LPDJLQJ\u0003FDSDELOLWLHV\u0003DUH\u0003SURYLGHG\u0003E\\\u0003 WKH\u00030DXQD\u0003.HD\u0003&HOOYL]LR\u0003\u00bfEUH\u0010EDVHG\u0003\u00c0XRUHVFHQW\u0003PLFURVFRSH\u000f\u0003 allowing in vivo cellular imaging with minimal invasive sur-gery.

After the validation of the cyclotron and ancillary equipment, we made a tremendous effort to set up synthesis modules and analytical instrumentation for the radiochemistry within the Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS). We had to overcome several challenges during the installation process, but we achieved our goal to provide 18F-labeled PET radiotracers by early 2006, which included FDG, FHBG, FLT, and other novel compounds. Radiochemistry Research Laboratory The newly installed General Electric TRACERlab FX-FN modules #1 and #2 are typically used to carry out simple radiosynthetic methods to produce radiotracers such as FHBG and FLT, which are used in human clinical studies to monitor gene therapy and tumor proliferation, respectively. Another radiotracer, FAZA, can also be made in the FX-FN#1 and is designed to detect hypoxia using PET. In producing these radiotracers, we dedicate one of our new radiochemistry protocols to the quality control of human-use radiopharmaceuticals, while the rest are tested on D\u0003VPDOO\u0003VFDOH\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0003P&L \u0003LQ\u0003RQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfYH\u0003LQVWDOOHG\u000f\u0003VKLHOGHG\u0003fume hoods. Once the radiochemistry shows proof of concept, the new synthesis procedure is applied to the FX-FN#2 for automation and optimization of the chemistry.

Several analytical instruments (i.e., high performance liquid chromatography systems, dose calibration stations, gas chromatograph, radioTLC system, and bubble-test apparatus) and other instruments (i.e., Kugel-Rohr drying apparatus and Heidolph rotoevaporators) were installed to aid in our radiotracer quality control and organic chemistry efforts. Nine computer solutions that control the various analytical instruments and radiochemistry modules were mounted in the lab for ergonomic and organizational reasons. Figure 2.

We expected cognitive regulation to be linked to neural signal increases in prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions implicated in cognitive control and decreases in emotion processing regions, including the amygdala (limbic) and orbitofrontal cortex (paralimbic). Initial results suggest that SP were more emotionally reactive than HC to both social and physical threat stimuli as indexed by grater nega-tive emotion intensity ratings and neural responses in the brain regions associated with detection of emotion salience and emotion generation (i.e., di-vision of anterior cognitive regulation of physical threat, SP and HC did not differ on (a) degree of reduction in negative emotional intensity, and (b) distributed pattern of active brain regions implicated in top-down cognitive control. However, during cognitive regulation of critical face expressions, SP compared to HC demonstrat-ed enhanced cognitive control activity (e.g., dorsolateral, dorsomedial PFC) without elimination of emotion reactivity related brain (e.g., amygdala, affective division of anterior cingulate, ventromedial PFC). These results highlight that while social phobics can regulate non- social, physical threat stimuli in a manner similar to HC.

A block design (5 face trials, 3-seconds each) was used to present 30 direct and 30 averted eye gaze neutral face stimuli (half male, half female) twice, once under each of the two social perspectives. Initial results indicate that compared to healthy controls, social phobics demonstrated in response to averted eye gaze increased neural signal in brain regions associated with attending to facial details (right superior temporal gyrus) and assigning emotional salience (orbitofron-tal cortex), but decreased neural signal in a brain region associated with internal verbalization (left inferior frontal gyrus).

Recent evidence sug-gests that supraspinal mechanisms may play a role in the generation and maintenance of CRPS. Previous work has demonstrated volume differ-ences in chronic back pain patients. We used VBM (voxel-based mor-phometry) with high-resolution anatomical MRI images to investigate volume differences in the brain's gray matter between CRPS patients and pain-free subjects. With IRB approval, 12 healthy subjects and 9 patients who met IASP criteria for CRPS were recruited. High-resolution anatomical scans were collected on a 3T MRI scanner (T1, spin echo). SPM2 and MRIcro were used for skull stripping, normalization, segmentation, and detection of volume differences between the patients and healthy subjects. We implemented ANOV A statistics to detect volume changes between the two groups, and we then applied t-statistics to determine whether there were increases or decreases in the areas that showed a difference.V olume changes were found volume increases in CRPS patients in the bilateral thalamus and cer-ebellum while the insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex showed vol-ume decreases. The regions where we found volume differences have been all been previously implicated in the processing of pain. The thalamic and cerebellar volume increases might indicate that painful stimulation was repeatedly processed through these pathways and that this repetition might induce synaptic changes and gray matter volumes increases. The volume reductions in the insular cortex and frontal region might indi-cate that CPRS patients have a loss of inhibition to the rest of the pain processing circuits of the brain. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, 1.

It is not yet clear, however, how extraversion interacts with social phobia (SP), which is characterized by fear of self-focused evaluation in social situations, in shaping neural responses. To examine this relationship, we assessed extraversion, and gave a positive self-ref-erential processing task during fMRI to 16 individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for SP and 14 matched healthy controls (HC). Participants were presented with positive social trait adjectives. In the self-refer-ential condition, they decided whether a word was self-descriptive; in the orthographic condition, they indicated whether a word was upper-case. Behaviorally, SP endorsed fewer words (63%) than HC (81%; F(1,29)=5.52, p<.03); there was accuracy (SP=97% and HC=99%; p>.26). extraversion (p>.43). However, extraversion was positively associated with positive word endorsement in HC (r=.57, p<.03), but not in SP (p>.30). Neurally, within-group t-tests produced similar acti-vations in each group in a distributed network of regions implicated in self-referential (medial, dorsomedial, between-group contrast showed greater BOLD response self-referential processing in versus HC and right insula, as well as right amygdala (p<.005). Among these regions, extraversion was positively associated with BOLD response in medial PFC right amygdala (r=.56), and right p<.05 in SP only. In summary, extraversion differentiated the two groups because it was as-sociated with self-report in HC and neural response in SP. Furthermore, elevated extraversion in SP was related to exaggerated emotional re-activity during positive self-referential processing, as evidenced by correlative relationships with affective brain regions. Greater extraver-sion in some SP may be explained by a mechanism whereby enhanced neural response in affective regions is upregulated in response to dis-torted self-view.

We used structural MRI in a longitudinal design to examine two cohorts of adult P rats, never ex-posed to alcohol: Cohort A included 8 rats, 7 of which survived the en-tire study (578 days) and 4 MRI sessions; Cohort B included 9 rats, all of which survived the study (452 days) and 5 MRI sessions. Growth in whole brain volume reached maximal levels by about 450 days of age, whereas body weight continued its gain without asymptote. Growth was not uniform across brain structures measured. Over the initial 12 months of the study, corpus callosum area expanded 36%, cerebellum 17%, and hippocampus 10%, whereas ven-tricle size was unchanged. Factors affecting growth rate estimates in-cluded litter effects, MR image sig-nal-to-noise ratio, and measurement error. Unlike longitudinal human reports of regional volume declines in aging brain tissue, several brain structures in adult rats continued growing, and some growth patterns were litter-dependent.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in 33 medication-free, bipolar (12 type I, 21 type II) outpatients and 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Differences in gray mat-ter density between groups were calculated with Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM5). Bipolar subjects exhibited decreased gray matter density in the right dorsal lateral perfrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral subgenual prefrontal cortex (SGPFC). Bipolar subjects exhibited increased gray matter density in the right inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior and right middle temporal gyri, the left anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal cortex, and regions of the parietal cortex. These data suggest that bipolar subjects have altered gray mat- ter density in anterior paralimbic basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that have been implicated in emotional processing 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, (Brambilla et al 2005; Drevets et al 2000; Soares and Mann 1997).

The an-terior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in attentional control, but the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying this process is poorly understood. We examined the activation and connectivity of the ACC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with fMRI-constrained dipole modeling of event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from subjects who performed auditory and visual oddball at-tention tasks. Although attention-related responses in the ACC were similar in the two modalities, effective connectivity analyses showed PRGDOLW\\\u0010VSHFL\u00bfF\u0003HIIHFWV\u0003ZLWK\u0003LQFUHDVHG\u0003$&&\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFHV\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003+H VFKO\u0003 and superior temporal gyri during auditory task and on the striate cortex during visual task. Dipole modeling of ERPs based on source locations determined from fMRI activations showed that the ACC was the major generator of N2b-P3a attention-related components in both modalities, and that primary sensory regions generated a small mismatch signal about 50 msec prior to feedback from the ACC and a large signal 60 msec after feedback from the ACC. Taken together, these results pro-vide converging neuroimaging and electrophysiological evidence for top-down attentional by the ACC. 2XU\u0003\u00bfQGLQJV\u0003VXJJHVW\u0003D\u0003PRGHO\u0003RI\u0003DWWHQWLRQDO\u0003FRQWURO\u0003EDVHG\u0003RQ\u0003G\\Q DPLF\u0003 bottom-up and top-down interactions between the ACC and primary sensory regions. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, J Cogn a debilitating neu- ropathic pain disorder characterized by severe burning pain, abnormal sweating, hair growth, nail growth, swelling, pathological changes in bone, and extreme sensitivity to touch. 1 McNeil and Rainwater (1998) 2 have developed the Fear of Pain Questionnaire(FPQ) that measures fears of pain.

This work proposes a simple method to accomplish this task. The algorithm optimizes the excitation k- space trajectory for variable-density spirals by ap-proximating the trajectory by concentric circles. Because a circle is radially symmetric, its Fourier transform is also radially symmetric and can be expressed one-dimensionally as a Hankel trans-form.

The roles of imaging are targetting, monitoring, and post-therapy evaluation. It has been shown that contrast enhanced imag-ing provides a beautiful depic-tion of the vascular damage in the cryolesion. The purpose of this work was to evaluate previously frozen prostate tis-sue with dynamic contrast en-hanced imaging and 3D con-trast enhanced imaging. Methods: Three dogs were imaged with a phased array coil setup including an endorectal coil and an an-terior surface coil in a 0.5T GE Signal MRI scanner. Two MR-compatible cryoprobes (Oncura, Israel) were placed through the anterior abdomi-nal wall to locations on either side of the prostate. In each dog, one cryoprobe was fro-zen only once, while the other completed two freeze-thaw cycles. T1-weighted FSE images were obtained at the height of each freeze to delin-eate the iceball sizes. After complete thaw to normal body temperature, dynamic 2D SPGR images (1.9 s/image) were acquired and repeated during the injection of a gadolinium contrast agent. CE 3D SPGR imag-es were immediately acquired. The dogs were euthanatized and sliced prostate samples were incubated in a 1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution. Results: In all experiments, the normal prostate tissue enhanced. In the core of the cryolesion, the tissue did not enhance. An example set of images is shown in Figure 1. In all three experiments, there was a rim of hyperenhancement. Plots of the signal intensity on the dynamic contrast enhanced images in two exper- iments are provided in Figure 2. By comparison with TTC stained sections, the rim ap-pears to lie within the normal pink staining tissue. The bor-der of the hyperenhancing rim seemed to correspond well to the border between the hem-orrhagic core of the cryole-sion and the normal pink staining tissue on TTC. The size of the hyperenhancing rim varied in thickness from one experiment to another, varied in thickness from one lesion to another in the same experiment, and even varied in thickness within the same cryolesion. These variations can be seen in the images shown in Figure 3. The time course of enhancement on the rims were also variable, as shown in Figure 2. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that the hyperintense rim seen on dy-namic contrast enhanced MRI following prostate cryoabla-tion may be within the normal staining pink area on TTC stained sections. Differences in the size and enhancement curves of the hyperenhancing rim may be due to differences in the underlying tissue structure, such as the presence of FKURQLF\u0003SURVWDWLWLV\u000f\u0003LQWHUVWLWLDO\u0003\u00bfEURVLV\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003F\\VWLF\u0003K\\SHUSODV LD\u0003WKDW\u0003DUH\u0003 scattered throughout the gland in the old dogs that were studied. . 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, 1. Onik G, Technol Cancer Res frequency (PRF) shift with temperature to noninvasively monitor temperature during ul-trasound thermal ablation of the prostate. Previously we developed a referenceless thermometry for decreased motion sensitivity. Here, we present an improvement to the method that allows temperature estima-tion at optimized resolution (1.7-1.9 mm) and anatomic imaging at high resolution, all in the same acquisition. The method is demonstrated dur-ing in vivo canine prostate ablation. Referenceless thermometry measures a temperature change by es- timating the background phase from a region outside the heating area, thereby eliminating the need of a baseline image. In the presence of periprostatic fat, three echoes need to be acquired to automatically de-termine water and fat regions which can have a constant phase offset. In this project, we acquire the three echoes with different k-space cov-erage. The symmetric, low resolution data is used for temperature; the asymmetric, high resolution data is reconstructed by zeropadding for anatomical images. Images were acquired during canine prostate abla-tion using a transurethral ultrasound transducer on a 0.5T interventional scanner. To demonstrate the robustness to tissue motion, pressure was applied to the animal's abdomen before heating started. The referenceless method provided accurate temperature maps of the heating distribution during prostate ablation and was not affected by tissue motion. The high resolution magnitude images clearly depicted the anatomy and were used to overlay the low resolution temperature in-formation. Collecting the three echoes in a single acquisition decreased reduced the imaging time per temperature frame by 50%.The new pulse sequence allows for temperature monitoring during in vivo thermal ablation of the prostate with better temporal resolution, optimized temperature resolution and good visualization of underlying anatomical structures. Temperature images acquired without heating and reconstructed with baseline subtraction and the referenceless method. When tissue motion occurs (b), severe errors render baseline subtraction useless. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, Proceedings of 14th ISMRM, Seattle, Washington, 2006, :LX\\LUJL : Eddy current compensation is important for a num- ber of applications in magnetic resonance imaging.

A pulse sequence was designed to measure the system's eddy current response and use this to correct the eddy cur-rent induced artifacts for an arbitrary pulse sequence using an impulse-response formalism. Herein, this pulse sequence was modeled with Bloch simulation to characterize the sensitivity and bandwidth of mea-sured time constants ( T). Methods: current nulling gradient, and 3) 3-D phase encoding. In order to measure phase shifts that arise from short T eddy currents the pulse sequence was designed to acquire data (DAQ) for 62ms immediately after a gradient slew. Simulation: Simulated eddy current induced mono-exponential gradients were generated with 0.01ms< T<200ms and peak eddy current gradient strengths of 0.1Gmax/ T. Bloch simulation was used to simu- late the signal response (time step=8\u00b5s, T1=250ms, T2=25ms) over a broad range of T.Results: The pulse sequence with the dummy gradients doesn't stimulate and is therefore insensitive to long T eddy current effects, but is sensitive (phase accumulation > P) to 25\u00b5s< T<25ms. The simulation also demonstrates that without the dummy gradients long time constant (T>25ms) eddy currents generate measurable phase accumulation dur- ing the 100ms. Conclusions: The Bloch simulation demonstrates that the pulse sequence is maximally sensitive to short T of ~5ms, but with good sen- sitivity to 25\u00b5s< T<25ms. The fact that DAQ begins immediately after a gradient slew, combined with the high SNR of the sequence and the fact that short T effects are not sensitive to T2 decay combine to make measurement of short T effects possible. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, 1.

We have begun to develop MR sequences for imaging the sodium concentration of articular cartilage in-vivo. Methods: A 2D GRE sequence was adapted excitation of the Na+ 3T). A birdcage transmit/receive quadrature head coil tuned to the resonant frequency of sodium was employed for excitation and signal readout. The expected concentration of Na+ in healthy articular cartilage is approximately 260mM, while that in severely degenerated cartilage is approximately 40mM [4]. A set of NaCl phantoms with concentrations ranging from 50 mM to 500 mM were made for initial testing and calibration of the sequence. Initial results are shown in Figure 1.This image was obtained with a scan time under 1 minute and a slice thickness of 20mm. Results and Discussion: In Figure 1 we show that we can image and distin-guish sodium concentrations of 500mM to 100mM (with 100mM steps), while in order to view the lowest concentration on 50mM we would require a slightly longer scan time. With this we have validated our ability to image sodium at 3T in concen-trations similar to the ones expected in-vivo in human cartilage. Sodium imaging is particularly challenging given the low resolution and SNR due to low gyromag- netic ratio, the short T2, and the relatively low abundance of sodium in-vivo.

Multi-Echo IDEAL Water-Fat Separation for is a routine clinical proce-dure that has very high sensitivity for detec-tion and characterization of breast tumors [1]. Clinical outcomes are likely to improve with increased frame rates as well as higher spatial resolution. Bilateral imaging (of both breasts) normally requires more than twice the scan time, as the bilateral volume includes both breasts and the space between them. We have developed a simple, yet important method of eliminating the need to encode the volume be-tween breasts, while maintaining the high SNR achieved from encoding the bilateral volumes simultaneously. This typically results in a 20-30% reduction in scan time, and equivalent increase in frame rates. Methods and Results: Bilateral volumes are excited in a time-interleaved fashion, us-ing a dual-band spectral spatial pulse which allows independent shimming of two volumes [2]. The pulse also allows independent phase modulation of volumes. When the phase is lin-early modulated with phase-encode number in the left/right direction, the slab will appear shifted after 3D imaging, an extension of phase-offset multi-planar imaging [3]. By choosing the linear modulation ap-propriately for each slab, the two slabs are VKLIWHG\u0003WRJHWKHU\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfHOG\u0010RI\u0010YLHZ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003slab direction is reduced to include only the slab volumes. During reconstruction, slices can be labeled with the correct location, since the shift is known, or blank slices could be inserted between the slabs.

Discussion: Phase-modulated slab-shift- ing is a simple, yet useful technique for many applications where multiple volumes are im-aged simultaneously. It is compatible with dif-ferent excitation schemes such as spin echo, gradient echo, spoiled gradient echo and steady state free precession, as well as acceleration schemes such as partial Fourier imaging and parallel imaging. We are already combining several of these techniques to further increase the frame rate of DCE breast imaging.By phase-modulating the excitation, the imaged slabs shifted\" together so that the number of phase-encoding steps can be reduced 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, This work was funded by NIH 2P41-RR009784 and NIH 5R01CA066785 ;PTL\u0003*VUZ[HU[\u0003:LUZP[P]P[`\u0003VM\u0003,KK`\u0003*\\YYLU[\u0003*OHYHJ[LYPaPUN\u00037\\SZL\u0003 :LX\\LUJL +(50,3\u0003)\u0015\u0003,550:\u0013\u00034(9*<:\u0003;\u0015\u0003(33,@\u0013\u0003)90(5\u0003(\u0015\u0003/(9.9,(=,:\u0013\u0003569),9;\u00031\u0015\u00037,3*\u0003\u0014\u0003+,7(9;4,5;\u00036-\u00039(+0636.@ Introduction: Eddy current compensation is important for a number of applications in magnetic resonance imaging.

A pulse sequence was designed to measure the system's eddy current response and use this to correct the eddy current induced artifacts for an arbitrary pulse sequence using an impulse-response for-malism. Herein, this pulse sequence was modeled with Bloch simu-lation to characterize the sensitivity and bandwidth of measured time ( T). \u0003\u0003\u0003\u00030HWKRGV \u00033XOVH\u00036HTXHQFH \u0003$\u0003 L\u00bfHG\u0003 to support: 1) eddy current inducing test gradients, 2) a long T eddy cur- rent nulling gradient, and 3) 3-D phase encoding. In order to measure phase shifts that arise from short T eddy currents the pulse sequence was designed to acquire data (DAQ) for 62ms immediately after a gradient slew. Simulation: Simulated eddy current induced mono-exponential gradients were generated with 0.01ms< T<200ms and peak eddy current gradient strengths of 0.1Gmax/ T. Bloch simulation was used to simulate the signal response (time step=8\u00b5s, T1=250ms, T2=25ms) over a broad range of T. Results: The pulse sequence with the dummy gradients doesn't stimu-late and is therefore insensitive to long T eddy current effects, but is sensitive (phase accumulation > P) to 25\u00b5s< T<25ms. The simulation also demonstrates that without the dummy gradients long time constant (T>25ms) eddy currents generate measurable phase accumulation dur- ing the 100ms. Conclusions: The Bloch simulation demonstrates that the pulse se-quence is maximally sensitive to short T of ~5ms, but with good sen- sitivity to 25\u00b5s< T<25ms. The fact that DAQ begins immediately after a gradient slew, combined with the high SNR of the sequence and the fact that short T effects are not sensitive to T2 decay combine to make measurement of short T effects possible. .9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, This work was supported by the NIH (T32 CA09695 to DBE), the Center of Advanced MR Technology at Stanford (P41 provides excellent contrast and signal characteristics for angiography at higher \u00bfHOG\u0003VWUHQJWKV\u0003 \u0016\u0011\u00137\u0003RU\u0003JUHDWHU \u000f\u0003EXW\u0003VXI - fers from sensitivity to off-resonance ef-fects as well as bright fat signal.

Little attention has been paid to one type of artifact often encoun-tered in SSFP imaging - undesired steady-state excitation outside the selected slice. In practice such un-desired excitation often leads to spurious imaging of objects outside the selected slice or through-slice aliasing. The goal of this project is to suppress off-slice excitation in SSFP imaging via designing RF pulses. To suppress off-slice excitation, it is desirable to have a RF pulse which only excites the spins inside the selected slice. Therefore we want a RF pulse with very small stopband ripple compared with stan-dard excitation pulses.

Recent studies (Gilad, Int. J. Cancer, 2005) indicate that while conventional DCE-MRI provides data on the permeability of a tu-mor, BOLD contrast reports on the tumor's vascular maturity. Thus, BOLD contrast can differentiate the healthy vessels that respond to a vasoreactive stimulus and those tu-mor vessels that do not.

Methods: The designed pulse sequence selectively saturates a cyl- inder encompassing the heart while exciting breast glandular tissue. The BOLD contrast stimulus used for this study consisted of three one-min-ute blocks of pure oxygen interleaved with room air for a total of seven minutes. This GRE-2D spiral sequence, was tested on the left breasts of two healthy volunteers at 1.5T with the jittered stimulus. 5HVXOWV \u00036DWXUDWLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003VLJQDO\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003KHDUW\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQWO\\\u0003LPSU RYHG\u0003the measured BOLD contrast. ,Q\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfJXUH\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003OHIW\u0003LPDJH\u0003LV\u0003the BOLD signal when the heart was not saturated and the right image is the BOLD signal with heart saturation. The red map-ping indicates that the jittered oxygen stimulus correlated with an increase in deoxyhemoglobin in healthy breast vasculature. Conclusion: The method presented in this abstract al-lows for greater exploration of BOLD contrast in breast tissue. Saturation of signal from the heart reduces motion artifacts, enabling robust BOLD imaging. Breathing of pure oxygen is also ad-vantageous because it does not involve stimulus-correlated motion. With an effective imaging method now in place, future studies will fo-cus on measuring BOLD contrast in tumors. )LJXUH\u0003\u0014\u0011\u00037KH\u0003OHIW\u0003LPDJH\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003%2/'\u0003FRQWUDVW\u0003LPDJH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003KHD UW\u0003VDWXUDWLRQ\u0011\u00037KH\u0003 ULJKW\u0003LPDJH\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003%2/'\u0003FRQWUDVW\u0003ZLWK\u0003KHDUW\u0003VDWXUDWLRQ\u0011\u0011\u0003 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, )RU\u0003PRUH\u0003LQIRUPDWLRQ\u000f\u0003SOHDVH\u0003UHIHU\u0003WR\u0003,6050\u0003)RXUWHHQWK\u00036FLHQWL\u00bf F\u00030HHWLQJ\u0003 Program, $OWKRXJK\u0003SUH\u0010HFODPSVLD\u0003 3( \u0003ZDV\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003GHVFULEHG\u0003PRUH\u0003WKDQ\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0013\u0003 years ago, both the cause of and a cure for this complicated and life threatening disease evade researchers and medical caregivers to this day. In the U.S., PE occurs in roughly 10% of pregnancies and is re-sponsible for at least 20% of maternal deaths and 15% of premature births in the U.S. Several lines of evidence point towards poor pla-cental implantation and subsequent malformation and dysfunction as a root cause of this disease.

This study of the relaxation parameters of the post partum human placenta was undertaken on seven different singleton pregnancies Placentas were collected and their T1 and T2 relaxation times calculated: two from healthy pregnancies, three from pregnancies exhibiting mild PE, and two from pregnancies exhibiting severe PE. There were no differences in the T2 times which could be linked to the pathology of PE. In contrast, average T1 times were more than two-fold higher in placentas from two severe PE pregnancies versus two normal pregnancies (averaging 1693 ms vs. 764 ms, respectively). Including the mild cases of PE, T1s do appear to correlate with the severity of PE in this small and unmatched data set.

Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI breast imaging has shown great promise in discriminating benign and malignant breast lesions [1]. It requires fat suppression and high spatial and tem-poral resolution for the accurate mea-surement of dynamic enhancement [2]. 3D spiral combined with bilateral dual-band water-selective spectral-spatial ex-citation has been proposed to suppress fat robustly while obtaining high spatiotem-poral resolution [3]. A further increase of temporal resolution can be achieved with parallel imaging.

This system would improve treatment of abdominal cancers, like metastatic colorectal cancer. Resection of these cancers increases 5-year survival from 8% to 30-35%, but only 20% of patients are suitable for resection. For 80% of patients, noninvasive treatment is needed. We have demonstrated that current imaging CMUTs can used in high power and continuous wave mode necessary for focused ultra-sound ablation. From these successful results, we have designed and GHYHORSHG\u0003D\u0003QHZ\u0003JHQHUDWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003&087V\u0003VSHFL\u00bfFDOO\\\u0003IRU\u0003XOWUDVRXQG\u0003 DEOD- tion. Piston CMUTs are ideal for high pressure, CW output. Using two SOI bondings, a thick silicon mass is created at the membrane center to independently control the membrane mass and elasticity. Using an axisymmetric model in ANSYS, we optimized the output pressure and frequency responses to 1Mpa and 2MHz, ideal for noninvasive surger-ies. The best design has a thin 1 micron membrane with 4.5 micron thick piston. When piston widths are 75-80% of the total membrane width and the gap is 0.3 microns, the collapse voltage is optimum (100-\u0014\u0018\u00139 \u0003IRU\u0003WKH\u0003GHVLUHG\u0003\u001403D\u0003RXWSXW\u0003SUHVVXUH\u0011 These membranes are patterned into a 4 cm diameter, 16-element, annular array. Using Matlab, the power gain was calculated to be 36 at 4 cm in liver. Using the Pennes Bioheat Equation and the Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43 degrees, the lesion size was calculated to be 0.5 cm in diameter in the focal plane at 30 seconds. Such a lesion size and design is optimum for ablation and detection under the resolution of our current MRI temperature maps. We are currently fabricating and testing these newly optimized devices. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, S.H.

Recently, we have developed a scatter correction algorithm that provides accu-rate scatter correction without additional patient exposure. A calibration sheet (pri-mary modulator) with a checkerboard pat-tern of attenuating materials is inserted between the x-ray source and the object, so that the primary distribution of the pro-jection image is partially modulated by a high-frequency function in the spatial do-main. With the assumption that the scatter is very insensitive to the x-ray source intensity spatial variation, low-frequency behavior still dominates in the scatter distribution.

In this work, a physical primary modulator with the pattern suggested in the previous study is built using aluminum, and experi-ments are carried out on our bench-top CBCT system with the insertion of the modulator. A standard evaluation phantom, Catphan 600 is used in our study. Scatter correction results us- ing the primary modulator are compared with those without scatter correction and with scatter inherently suppressed using the slot-scan geometry. The comparisons show that the primary modulation ap-proach reduces the relative error of the reconstructed image around the central region of interest from 31.80% to 2.30%.

In this study we have compared the results from only selecting the input frames acquired closest in time to the desired cardiac phase (nearest neighbor) and interpolation in the temporal dimension using a Gaussian kernel. Methods: Temporal interpolation of projection data was implemented using near-est neighbor or Gaussian interpolation. An in-vitro experiment was performed using a phantom with a tungsten bead moving along a trajectory similar to longitudinal cardiac motion. Projection data were acquired during four ECG synchronized sweeps with the C-arm. 165 projections were obtained during each 6 s sweep. Using the same acquisition protocol, image data were also acquired using an in-vivo porcine model. Results: Point spread functions and modulation transfer functions (MFTs) calculated based on the in-vitro ex- periment showed only a minor drop in spa-tial frequency response with the Gaussian interpolation compared to nearest neighbor. A slight improvement the noise level was obtained using Gaussian interpolation. In the porcine model, Gaussian interpolation result-ed in slightly reduced noise and streak arti-facts, but at the expense of some blurring. Conclusion: Interpolation in the tem- poral dimension can potentially improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the resulting images, by incorporation data from multiple sweeps.

This task requires a fast, low-dose imaging system that pro-vides improved detection compared with radiography, but lower dose and faster scanning than clinical CT. One such ap-proach is to reconstruct iteratively from sparse angularly sampled projection data; another is to reconstruct iteratively from limited-angle projection data. Materials and Methods: We propose a new reconstruction technique for sparse angularly sampled projections using the level set method. Sparse sampling not only provides faster acquisition but also delivers lower dose to the patients.

Introduction: This reconstruc-tion method without gridding. Within this investigation, a new method is developed for correct-ing artifacts introduced by rho error. Method and Materials: The IGCT system is composed of many equally spaced fan beam.

Because of slight difference between IGCT system and fan beam system, ringing artifacts are introduced. A new method has been developed to remove these artifacts. This correction uses a pre-den- sity weighting for IGCT system, and this pre-density weighting is calculated from matrix inversion between fan beam reconstruction image and IGCT reconstruction image. To verify the performance of the reconstruction algorithm, data was simulated using 4 detec-tor IGCT system geometry. Result:Simulations using the IGCT geometry show high fre- quency artifacts caused by rho error. These artifacts are corrected when the proposed pre-density weighting is used. Conclusion: A 2D direct IGCT reconstruction is performed by us- ing pre-density weighting. This method can be applied to isotropic resolution demand a fast 3D reconstruc-tion algorithm. IGCT employs a large array of focal spots op-posite a detector array that shares the same axial extent as the source but is much smaller in the transverse direction.

The method is slow due to this and the need to process so many projections. The purpose of this work is to evaluate a very fast algorithm based on Defrise's Fourier Rebinning (FORE) algorithm for PET. A 3D reconstruc-tion algorithm was developed based on FORE. For compari-son, a Feldkamp-like algorithm was developed that generates an average of Feldkamp reconstructions from each source row. Projection data for a numerical torso phantom and a numerical \"Defrise\" phantom were simu-lated under the IGCT geometry. To evaluate the FORE algorithm on a real data set, a prototype IGCT system was assembled involving a 100x100 scanned-anode source array and a 48x48 photon-counting detector array mounted on a C-arm system (NovaRay, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). An anthropomorphic phantom containing a real porcine heart was scanned in a step-and-shoot mode with the C-arm in a hori-zontal orientation. The FORE algorithm averaged 30 sec/slice while Feldkamp averaged 30 min/slice. Like Feldkamp, FORE suffers from cone-beam blurring in z, however it does not suffer from cone-beam streaking artifacts. FORE proved to be both fast and reasonably accurate. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, S. R. Mazin, N. J.

We study the effect of the smaller pixels on the noise in the reconstructed images. The size of the detector pixel de-termines the amount of blur-ring in the x-ray projections before sampling. While the projections themselves are blurred, the noise in the pro-jections remains uncorrelat-ed regardless of the detector pixel size (equivalently, that there is the same amount of noise for every spatial frequency). This implies that to achieve a given resolution in the reconstructed image, a system with less detector blurring (smaller pixels) will lead to lower noise because there will be less need to undo the blurring at high fre-quencies. The fundamental observation we make is that even if two photon noise limited CT detectors can achieve the same resolution, the higher resolution detector will have the same or less noise for all fre-quencies of the reconstructed image.

Materials and Methods: We developed a computer aided detection algorithm that uses intensity thresholding and voxel clustering of PET data to identify foci of high glucose activ-ity. This 3D algorithm currently detects tumor foci as well as physiological activity in normal structures. For our pilot evaluation, clusters with volumes greater than 1.0 cm3 with intensities greater than liver were considered abnormal. We applied the algorithm to 10 abnormal clini-cal PET/CT datasets and compared the output of the algorithm with the number of abnormal foci reported on the primarily visual clinical readings (130 total lesions, 2-32 lesions/study). The radiologist was provided with a graphical user interface for visual-izing CT images with clusters (potential lesions) overlayed in color, a list of clusters, sorted in decreasing order of score, as well as statistics (mean, max and average intensity) for each cluster. The radiologist can examine these clusters by simply scrolling back and forth through the fused PET/CT slices, as well as by using a volumetric rendering technique. Results: In total, the CAD program detected 91 of 130 lesions for a mean sensitivity of 70% (range 50-100%, stdev 14.6%).

Our initial results are encouraging having a knowledge-based algorithm that allows an accu- rate automated interpolation of centerlines thorough FPA occlusions up to a length of 75 mm. This may substantially accelerate the creation of CPRs in patients with PAOD in the future. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, Occlusions in Peripheral CTA\" 29th Annual Course of the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Figure shows comparison of a manual and automated centerline interpolation through OHIW\u0003)3$\u0003RFFOXVLRQ\u0011\u00031RWH\u0003WKH\u0003QRQ\u0010RSDFL\u00bfHG\u0003RF - cluded artery (outlined by the course of virtual gauging tics) with its surrounding perivascu-lar fat plane.

More recently, 3D-ro, based on a 3D reconstruction of the vasculature from a prior CT angiogram (CTA) scan or from an interventional C-arm CT scan, has become popular. Both techniques may be limited by streak artifacts in the presence of indwellingmetal, and sensitivity to motion during ac - quisition. Alternatively, we have developed a new technique, called RoRo, based on a single rotational angiographic acquisition (DSA) of any length and angular increment. Materials and Methods: Acquired projections are displayed as a \"rotatable roadmap\" linked to the current C-arm position, allowing for an interactive and intuitive selection of the best available working view. 7KH\u0003VHOHFWHG\u0003SURMHFWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003VXEWUDFWHG\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003OLYH\u0003\u00c0XRURVFRSLF \u0003LPDJHV\u000f\u0003 thus displaying any medical device within the context of the vascula - ture. We integrated RoRo into a Siemens Axiom Artis dBA C-arm sys - tem and used it in clinical cases. Results: For a patient that presented with a cerebral aneurysm, a total of 128 projections (.3mm pixel size; 1k matrix) were acquired in a 5s rotational DSA run, using 21ml of iodine.

By comparison, the same projections were reconstructed into a 256x256x227 volume of .7mm voxel size for 3D-ro.

Instead, a short acquisition for RoRo was per- formed over a range of 82 degrees (55 projec-tions), which was available within 30s and then used to embolize the tumor. Conclusions: RoRo appears to be a simple yet powerful navigation technique that can provide guidance where 3D reconstructions are not fea-sible, and has the potential to show smaller vessels in a fraction of 3D-ro's processing time. This gap is increasing, as updated systems, allowing 2D acquisitions at .15mm pixel size in a 2k matrix are becoming available. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, Siemens Medical Solutions, inc.A patient undergoing treatment for a cerebral aneurysm with RoRo being used \u0003),(<30,<1\u0013\u0003:(5+@\u00035(7,3\u0018\u0003-\u0003\u00189(+0636.@\u0013\u00032,3,*;90*(3\u0003,5.05,,905. Purpose: detect polyps in CT Colonography (CTC), it is too local a surface descriptor and, therefore, highly affected by noise. We de-veloped a computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm curvature tensors (CTNs) to re-duce these effects and improve detection of polyps (Polyp-CAD) and folds (Fold-CAD). Materials and Methods: CTNs were computed at each vertex of a mesh repre-sentation of the colon surface. The CTN is a matrix whose eigenvalues and were then diffused on the mesh using a Gaussian kernel of gradually increasing size, starting at 0.25 mm and increasing by 10% each time. The polyp-CAD algo-rithm clustered the connected peak <= 0), vertices (K1 <=0, K2 >= 0). The score assigned to each peak cluster was a product of the maximum K2 and the area-weighted integral of the Gaussian cur-vatures (=K1*K2), both computed over the cluster vertices. The score assigned to saddle clusters were a function of the patch area, K1 and the surface deviation of the surface points from a plane. The polyp-CAD algorithm was evaluated on 31 multi-detector row CTC datasets. There were 169 lesions in total: 60 ([0,5) mm), 85 ([5,10) mm) and 24 ((>= 10 mm) range.

The fold-CAD algorithm was evaluated on a segment of a patient colon with 36 salient folds. An experienced radiologist manually inspected the results and labeled them as true positives (TPs) or FPs. Folds that were missed by the algo-rithm were also marked. Results: At a FP rate of 20 per dataset, the sensitivity of polyp-CAD was found to be 82% (all sizes), 65% ([0,5) mm), 89% ([5,10) mm) and 100% (>= 10 mm). At the same FP rate, the sensitivity of the SNO method was found to be 38% (all sizes), 16% ([0,5) mm), 41% ([5,10) mm), 79% (>= 10 mm). For fold-CAD, the sensitivity was found to be 90% at a FP rate of 1 and 100% at a FP rate of 9 per dataset. No salient folds were missed. Conclusions: When further optimized, CAD of polyps may lead to greater use of CTC and aid the radiologist in diagnosis. Fold detection could help reduce FPs in CAD, and could also be used in registration of supine and prone datasets of the same patient. Example results on segments of patient colons.

Purpose: To build a statistical model for error and evaluate the performance of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method for reconstructing miss-ing vascular centerlines, using a database of centerlines from other patients. Materials and Methods: A database was constructed consisting of centerlines of femoropopliteal arteries from CT Angiography (CTA) scans of 30 subjects without peripheral arterial occlusive disease. A leave-one-out cross validation of a PCA based algorithm was per-formed on the database by simulating occlusions of various lengths and reconstructing them using the algorithm. Point-wise maximum depar-ture (MD) for each case was used as the error metric. Regression analy-sis was performed on MD with the length and location of the occlusion, age and sex of the subject, and estimation error in the neighborhood of the occlusion (NE).

To test the algorithm, we performed a preliminary test with a total 20 chest CT scans which contains 10,389 slices and 330 lung nodules as determined by a consensus panel of radiologists (1.5-18 mm; mean 4.1 mm). Figure 1 shows the nodules distributions among the 20 chest CT scans. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the overall sensitivity for nodule detec-tion with this algorithm was 90.3% (298 for all nodules (1.5-18mm). For nodules 3mm and larger, the sensitivity was 94.0% (204 of 217 nodules). For nodules 3mm-6mm, the sensitivity was 93.3% (154 of 165 nodules). For nodules 6mm and larger, the sensi-tivity was 96.2% (50 of 52 nodules). The algorithm has some valuable properties: (1) it is not sensitive to nodule size; and (2) it is not sensitive to nodule locations (isolated, jux-tapleural, and juxtavascular). Our future work will focus on decreasing the false positives. 3\\UN\u00035VK\\SL\u0003+L[LJ[PVU\u0003I`\u0003(UHS`aPUN\u0003=V_LS\u0014IHZLK\u0003,_WHUKPUN\u00037YVJLZ Z 10(5;(6\u00037<\u0013\u0003.,6--\u00039<)05\u0013\u0003+(=0+\u0003:\u0015\u00037(02\u0003\u0014\u0003+,7(9;4,5;\u00036-\u00039(+0636.@ Figure 1: Nodule distribution among the 20 chest CT scans 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, This work was supported by NIH grant number R01 CA109089 and the Richard M.

The ability to replicate this x-ray-based randomized clinical trial allows us to extend our studies to evaluate the effectiveness of CT screening for lung cancer using our mathematical model of lung cancer progression. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, NIH R01 CA105366 :[VJOHZ[PJ\u00034VKLSZ\u0003MVY\u0003[OL\u0003:[HNL\u00037YVNYLZZPVU\u0003VM\u0003)YLHZ[\u0003*HUJLY \u0003 Breast cancer is generally staged as local, regional or distant disease. The probability that a primary breast tumor is associated with an advanced disease stage increases with the tumor's volume at symptomatic detection. It is possible that detecting the tumor at a smaller size, in particular by screening, could result in a less advanced disease stage and improve the patient's prognosis. To quantify the KHDOWK\u0003EHQH\u00bfW\u0003RI\u0003EUHDVW\u0003FDQFHU\u0003VFUHHQLQJ\u0003programs with mammography and MRI, we model the natural progression of can-cer from less to more advanced stages; in particular, we develop analyze mathemat-ical models of tumor progression in terms of tumor growth and stage transitions. We have fully explored two alter- native stochastic models for the natural history of breast cancer stage progression. Both models are based on clinically and biologically UHDVRQDEOH\u0003DVVXPSWLRQV\u0003DQG\u0003SURYLGH\u0003FRPSDUDEOH\u0003\u00bfW\u0003WR\u0003GDWD\u0003REWDLQ HG\u0003 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results database on tu-mor size and stage (local, regional, distant) at symptomatic detection. Interestingly, the models produce different predictions. For example, the models predict different distributions of tumor sizes at stage transi-tions. They also differ by stage at symptomatic detection for a given tumor volume doubling time. Model I predicts 83% of tumors (unde-tected) progress to distant stages by the time tumor reaches a diameter of 10 cm whereas Model II predicts that only 18% of tumors progress to distant disease when tumor is 10 cm in diameter. Furthermore, Model I predicts that slower growing tu-mors are more likely to be detected in ad-vanced stages, whereas Model II predicts that faster growing tumors are more likely to be detected in advanced stages.

We have been able to better solubilize small particulate gadolinium oxide (SPGO), prevent particle aggrega-tion, and has a gadolinium oxide electron diffraction pattern consistent with that of published X-ray powder diffrac- (XPD) diffraction angles and intensities similar, but not identical, to that of published Gd2O3 diffraction patterns.

There have been few published reports on the development of contrast agents optimized for pho-toacoustic imaging. We hypothesized that absorbing dye-labeled protein nanospheres would respond to laser stimulation by thermoelastically gen-erated sound production. And further-more that manipulation of laser puls-ing and nanosphere physico-chemical composition could lead to control over nanosphere oscillation and frequency of detection. The primary goals of this study are to demonstrate the util-ity of labeled protein nanospheres for improved photoacoustic signal gen-eration. Towards this aim we are exploring the enhancement in signal amplitude gained by laser-driven protein nanosphere oscillation vs. that of the precursor material for nanosphere synthesis, i.e., photoacousti-cally active \"monomers,\" using a phantom vessel and either ultrasound or laser stimulation. The photoacoustic contrast agent (PACA) used LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SUHVHQW\u0003VWXGLHV\u000f\u0003\u00bfWF\u0010ODEHOHG\u0003QDQRVSKHUHV\u0003VXVSHQGHG\u0003LQ\u0003DT XHRXV\u0003 solution, were synthesized using sonochemical methods. We report the development of stable, unimodal distribution of PACA 650 nanometers in diameter capable of emitting sizable echoes in response to ultrasound stimulation and an even greater increase in signal-to-background in response to laser stimulation. The increase in PA signal amplitude is in part due to the low density and great compressibility of the protein nanospheres subsequent to gas and/or low density liquid incorporation. The great elasticity and strong re- storing forces of the nanosphere shell likely results in a sizable relative ex-pansion ratio and subsequent large amplitude of response to increasing driving pressure. The size range at which we are able to achieve mono-disperse distribution also makes ex-travasation of nanospheres for imag-ing of tumor vasculature more likely and improves the chances of receptor targeted imaging. We are currently making smaller nanospheres (< 100 nm) with the aim of improving sig- naling characteristics. 9,-,9,5*,:\u0016-<5+05.\u0003:6<9*, McDonald MA, Jankovic L, Guccione S, Li KCP.

All subsequent positioning cal-culations therefore, were performed on the data after an intra-PSAPD COM calculation. A maximum likelihood approach was taken to predict the position and incident angle of an event with interactions in two or more PSAPDs due to the relatively low intrinsic energy (12%) and spa-tial (~2mm) resolution of this system as compared to cameras that uti-lize the Klein-Nishina formula for determining photon scattering angle probability. Multiple interactions that occur in only one PSAPD are not individually resolvable by the detector and look the same as a photo-electric interaction. The maximal probability in (location, angle) space was calculated from the product of the probabilities of the COM lo-cation and interaction locations and energies. These probabilities were calculated by constructing the probability density function (PDF) of the COM of an event and the PDF of the interaction locations and ener-gies for each training incident location and angle using Bayes' equation. Using this formalism, we have developed a means to predict interac-tion location and incident angle for realistic data from our small animal PET detector that is capable of measuring depth of interaction. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we were able to predict incident angle to within +/- twelve degrees FWHM. This information will provide a means to reject non-true coincidences that fall outside of our incident angle resolution, beyond implementing energy and time windowing for scatter and random rejection.

We are studying a new crystal array that uses light multiplexing to read two layers of LSO crystals using a single PSAPD detector to reduce by a factor of two the number of PSAPDs in the system. The crystal consists of a dual-layer LSO sheet crystal (2x8x9 mm3) with slots on either side forming crystal pixels (1x1x3 mm3) in two effective layers that are offset by a half crystal pixel width with respect to each other in both directions.

All existing QDs, however, require excitation from external illumination sources. We developed a new set of QDs that emit long wavelength (from red to infrared wavelength) light without external illumination, WKXV\u0003HOLPLQDWLQJ\u0003SKRWR\u0003EOHDFKLQJ\u0003DQG\u0003KLJK\u0003\u00c0XRUHVFHQW\u0003EDFNJURXQG \u0011\u0003 Methods: We coupled QDs that bioluminescent sig- nal between 605 and 800nm to a mutant of the bioluminescent protein Renilla luciferase (Rluc8) which produces light in the presence of sub-strate coelenterazine. This method is based on the principle of biolumi-nescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which is an energy trans-fer phenomenon between Rluc8 as the donor and QDs as the acceptor. We examined the possibility of multiplex bioluminescence imaging in vitro and in the living mouse.5HVXOWV \u0003\u00037KH\u0003HI\u00bfFLHQFLHV\u000f\u0003GHWHUPLQHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003UDWLR\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003LQWHJ UDWHG\u0003 BRET emission to the Luc8 each conjugate could be selectively distinguished from the emissions of other conjugates.

The mice were imaged every day in a CCD camera after D-Luciferin injections. Results: In vitro analysis revealed that although spliced products as seen from the RT-PCR were visible as early as 24hrs after trans-fection, detectable differences in splicing-dependant luciferase activity were seen only at 48hrs, with the peak at 72hrs. The animal experiments substantiated the in vitro data. A 9.5\u00b11.9 fold difference was observed between tumors with and without the p53 mRNA 24hrs following the tumor implant (72hrs after transfection). &RQFOXVLRQ - bozyme-mediated trans-splicing activity in living animals.
