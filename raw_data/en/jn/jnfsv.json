It not only helps fight diseases but also actively promotes the overall health of the mind and body. Covid-19 pandemic has thrust the world into a state of crisis, stress, and loss of lives. Due to the constant rise in these numbers, there has been a massive realization about the importance of building immunity to prevent viral diseases. While medical and laboratory experts are working at a permanent treatment for the virus, many healthcare professionals are urging the nation to adopt Ayurveda. Immunity in Ayurveda is called the Bala or Vyadhi Kshamatva which is derived from a combination of two words meaning disease and resistance. It is an in-built resistance power of an individual that fights various illnesses and keeps the body healthy. This power is different in each individual and can change due to alterations in diet, lifestyle, and various health conditions.With the support extended to AYUSH Ministry by the honourable Prime Minister of India, several initiatives have been taken to utilize the vast potential of Ayurveda in this pandemic. This is causing a surge in demand for Ayurvedic medicines especially for boosting immunity. Dr. Vaidya's New Age Ayurveda being an active member of the Ayurveda sector has listed some measures to maintain health in the pandemic. Some of them are as under. Dr. Vaidyas, with decades of experience, has been manufacturing high-quality ayurvedic medications with the aim to spread awareness about the goodness of Ayurveda in the most convenient form. One of such formulations is Dr. Vaidya's Imunoherb which is a specially designed Ayurvedic immunity booster to build the resistance to viral infections. It is a combination of premium herbs like Amla, Giloy, and Neem that protects the body from frequent infections, cold, cough, and fever. According to Ayurveda, Amla is known to balance all three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. This Rasayana or rejuvenating herb is frequently used to enhance immunity and strengthen body resistance against harmful microbes. It is one of the best sources of Vitamin C which is a natural antioxidant and protects the body from the harmful effects of free radicals. It also contains many active phytochemicals such as gallic acid, ellagic acid. Amla is also reported to possess free antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agent. Its constituents like -D-glucan stimulate the production of the B and T-cells of the immune system. It possesses antimicrobial, anti-stress, adaptogenic, and restorative properties which help in relieving stress, strengthening the respiratory system, and fighting off various illnesses. Neem present in Imunoherb is packed with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antifungal compounds which help in preserving the strength of the immune system. It cools down the body, helps clear toxins and impurities from the blood, and ultimately builds the immune system. It enhances the immune response by increasing the number of IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibodies which help the body fight off external harmful microbes. Thus through the action of these powerful herbs, Dr. Vaidya's Imunoherb Capsule exerts a multifaceted immunomodulatory action on the body.
