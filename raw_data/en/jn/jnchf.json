Told me I wouldn't die from the vaccine, and there was no way of knowing if the booster would do that again, as he watched me cry. He tested me for the usual products they have in the vaccine, told me I wasn't allergic sent me on my way... I guess what I'm saying is be ready for them to be closed minded too. I'm not sure in your country if boosters will be mandatory but in mine, allergist are the key out of this, but heck - we won't die . I know this point has been made clear many times, but I'd like to reiterate. Please add your experience to VAERS and update it as new information becomes available. I had a VAERS entry that was sitting in space for months. When my doctor provided a possible diagnosis, I asked that it be added to my VAERS report. Within days following the update, the CDC asked me for my providers info to follow up. They said that they are \"tracking\" cases similar to mine (CNS Demyelination). It wasn't enough that I had listed head pressure, brain fog, nausea etc. Perhaps nothing will come of this but the more people that report these events, the more likely something will be done about it. I understand that the largest battle is getting a doctor to first entertain that your symptoms are vaccine related. I believe that each and every one of you has desperately tried to find help. Keep looking for the right doctor because it adds credibility to your VAERS entry. Best wishes to all.

I am poor in both math and science. My highest level of education is an associate degree. Why, then, can I put two-and-two together - and a medical doctor cannot? I've found more answers on this forum and through my own research than in the medical community. That has been the biggest eye-opener in my life: That I am treating my symptoms more effectively than someone who has spent decades in the medical field. I am saddened to read of experiences like yours and [@sickofthis](https://vestibular.org/participant/sickofthis/). We deserve so much better. I am continually shocked by the lack of empathy, understanding, support, and effort on providers' behalf to help us. [@windsor](https://vestibular.org/participant/windsor/) Oct 31st was my second dose and my symptoms started about 3 weeks later with the exception of heart issues which was a few days after. [@rainyday](https://vestibular.org/participant/rainyday/) I very much agree with you - and am in the same boat At first, you just find another reason but then it hits you. And it's hard to find people around you that understand. It's bad enough you feel like you are going crazy from these tempermental side-effects - there is a lack of support from both doctors and close ones. Anyways that's been some of the other struggles I've dealt with other then trying to survive/live. I am glad that we can chat here and connect. I am not sure if you came to the same conclusions? 1: possibly Ace2 antibodies - like long haulers; 2: the medication does exist that would make us feel better and avoid inflammation damage, even if the simplest; steroids. But that inability of the medical community to be so risk averse makes it we don't have access to those proper treatments. Some conditions are based off of a list of symptoms then a positive test (because they don't exist yet) but that isn't still good enough. For myself I've turned to vitamins, some which I really think help. It's all I've got at this time. My brain and over the counter stuff. I am very sorry you also have these symptoms. Have you found improvement with anything? Do you feel this will most likely go away in time? (For myself, I think so more likely then not - while it still feels like forever from now) Does anyone have tenderness on their sternum and lower bones of rib cage? [Justagirl14!!](https://vestibular.org/participant/cantfindausername776/)and [Justagirl14!!](https://vestibular.org/participant/cantfindausername776/)reacted Hi everyone ! Any thoughts on this? [https://www.autoimmuneregistry.org/long-covid-announcement] Are you aware? Thanks for sharing. I think this is great. The article says that long COVID was added to support further research and understanding of the disease. Some doctors do not accept long COVID as a real disease and this will help sufferers gain acknowledgment and receive help. I also think this is a step towards understanding more about our immune system in general and could shed light on vaccine side effects that are similar to long COVID. Inspired by your experiment and theory, got tested for antibodies too, blood serum. Results came back quickly, cost 20 \u20ac . Got my second pfizer jab in the beginning of July, was expecting to see similar numbers that tennyson reported.. Mine is 1548.7, threshold is below 50 .. So yeah, still a long way to go until I get there. Lets say if half life is approx 50 - 60 days, that puts me somewhere in early autumn, late summer? At least now, I know how long in theory (if the hypotheses is correct) my ailments could last..

It's just a theory so not sure it'll hold out. And I expect there will be some threshold when it magically starts feeling better, hopefully above that 50 threshold. I actually have been feeling pretty good for a few days. So let's see if this holds. Does anyone have tenderness on their sternum and lower bones of rib cage? Yes I did. It was one of my original symptoms along with chest palpitations and weird blood pressure issues. I told my cardiologist about it but it didn't show up on the X-ray. I had a dedicated ultrasound for it and it also showed nothing. But it was a chest pain that hurt when I inhaled deeply or coughed. It magically disappeared one day, roughly between weeks 6-8.

Had a MRI and CT scan and everything is fine. I have been taking some NAC which has lessened the pain. [@trev](https://vestibular.org/participant/trev/) Yah I think it was pleurisy.. I have headaches that seem like they are behind my eyes, and I still have ear pressure and ear aches. Inspired by your experiment and theory, got tested for antibodies too, blood serum.

I had J&J and then Moderna - so I suspect my overall antibodies were less than someone who had two mRNA vaccines, for example. Moderna is the stronger of two, so I think people who had two of those likely had the most antibodies. both were BioNtech/Pfizer jabs, with 30 "}
