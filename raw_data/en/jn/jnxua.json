In Switzerland alone, more than 1 million people suffer from allergic rhinitis. Anti-allergic medications are commonly prescribed, but they often involve side effects. Medical acupuncture, on the other hand, is a safe and effective complementary therapy that can relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis as has been shown in recent scientific studies. What is allergic rhinitis and what are its symptoms? Allergic rhinitis is a condition that affects the nose and sinuses. It is caused by an allergic reaction to certain substances, such as pollen, dust mites, animal dander and mold. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis can vary from person to person, but generally include runny (rhinorrhea) or stuffy nose, sneezing, itching or tearing, postnasal drip, sinus pressure, fatigue, headache, etc. These symptoms are very bothersome and interfere with daily activities, leading in some cases to other health problems, such as sinus infections, otitis, and asthma. Many people with allergic rhinitis resort to medications to relieve symptoms, but these can have side effects, such as drowsiness, dry mouth and headaches. Is there a natural remedy to relieve rhinitis symptoms? Acupuncture is a safe and effective complementary therapy that can relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis without significant side effects. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the body. The needles stimulate the body's natural healing mechanisms, help restore balance and promote health. Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine and has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of disease conditions, including allergies. In recent years, acupuncture has gained increasing recognition in Western medicine as a safe and effective treatment for allergies. New study highlights benefits of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis A new meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Medical Research evaluated the results of 30 studies from Germany, Australia, South Korea, Sweden and China with a total of 4413 patients. The study found that medical acupuncture controls the rise in IgE antibodies, known to be the cause of allergic rhinitis. The effect was demonstrated in a blinded study comparing real acupuncture with Sham acupuncture, in which \"fake\" acupuncture points were used about 10-15 millimeters from the real ones. The study also found that treatment duration of 8 or more weeks provided the best results. Medical acupuncture can also be used in combination with classical drugs when these do not give sufficient results. According to the available data from the various studies in the literature, the best therapeutic effects are obtained with the combination of conventional medicine and medical acupuncture. One of the advantages of medical acupuncture is that it is essentially free of side effects. According to international studies, about 18% of patients with allergic rhinitis already use medical acupuncture as therapy. However, most general practitioners and specialists continue to prescribe common allergy medications, despite the potential side effects. If you suffer from allergic rhinitis, acupuncture may be a good treatment option for you. Allergic rhinitis is a widespread and debilitating condition that affects more than one billion people worldwide. Traditional medical treatments can provide relief, but they often involve unwanted side effects. Fortunately, medical acupuncture has been extensively studied and shown to be a safe and effective alternative for managing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
