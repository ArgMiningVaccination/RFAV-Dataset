SHRC has received the US Patent and CE as well as ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485 certification for this technology. Pioneered by Wg Cdr (Retd) Dr Vasishta, SHRC was founded in 2006 and claims to be the first in the world to use SPMF therapy in the treatment of cancer. Based on MRI technology, the therapy is delivered by the AKTIS SOMA device invented by Dr Vasishta, which resembles an MRI machine but, unlike one, allows for a lot more breathing space for the patient without making him or her claustrophobic. SPMF produces highly complex sequentially programmed magnetic fields, which are computer controlled and can be precisely focused on the cancerous tissues with the help of laser guides. \"The only available mode of treatment today anywhere in the world is surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. We have treated GBM (glioblastoma multiforme), a very common form of brain tumour with very little or no chance of survival, very successfully and patients have gone back to their normal routine,\" Dr Vasishta told BusinessLine . The patients are evaluated using MRI and the Karnofsky performance score, which are considered gold standards for evaluating the efficacy of a therapy.No side-effects SPMF therapy is performed for one hour every day for 28 consecutive days as an outpatient treatment and costs 1.5 lakh. The treatment is non-invasive, has no side-effects and asks for no dietary restrictions. BusinessLine met several cancer patients including Sashidhar (27), Vani (46) and Rohan Ganesh (16), who were cured with SPMF. \"I was just six years old when the doctor said I had just six months to live as I was diagnosed with brain stem glioma (malignant brain tumour). After SPMF therapy, I went back to school the same year and followed up every year with the treatment, which progressively reduced the size of my tumour until it vanished,\" said Ganesh. Dr Vasishta has also used SPMF to treat 7,000 osteoarthritis patients. A leading oncologist said on condition of anonymity said SPMF is not a scientifically proven therapy backed by evidence based medicine. While there are many indigenous, alternative cancer cure hospitals in the country, they cannot identify the active ingredient in their medicine that cures cancer, and neither can they say why it is working, "}
