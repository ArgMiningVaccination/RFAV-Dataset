It also emphasizes treating the whole person rather than just the disease, and fostering an active partnership between the physician and patient in both prevention and treatment. Most of the Weil Foundation's grants have been awarded to medical schools, teaching hospitals and residency programs, and it's the latter that has made the biggest positive impact, said James Dalen, M.D., the Foundation's executive director. \"If you want to change how medicine is practiced, you have to change the experience of being a resident,\" he said. \" With support from the Weil Foundation, we now have Integrative Medicine in Residency programs in family medicine, pediatrics, and most recently in obstetrics/gynecology. In that three or four year residency period, you can really influence the way that physician will practice medicine for the rest of his or her career.\" The Weil Foundation board reviews grant applications on a regular basis, and awards about $500,000 annually. The Foundation receives most of its funding from licensing arrangements between Weil Lifestyle, a company based in Tempe, Ariz., and product manufacturers, including Origins Natural Resources Inc. Dr. Weil donates all of his after-tax profits from royalties from sales of these licensed products directly to the Weil Foundation. \"We also receive donations directly from individuals and corporations to the Weil Foundation, and I hope that this can become a more significant percentage of its overall funding in the future,\" said Dr. Weil. \"Anyone who is interested in reforming American medicine to focus on creating and maintaining health - rather than on managing disease - should consider donating to the Foundation to further its important work.\" For more information, visit the [Weil Foundation's website](https://www.facebook.com/WeilFoundation?fref=nf).
