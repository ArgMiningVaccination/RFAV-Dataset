Other chancers offering trying to make money on an online marketplace promised to boost immunity against the disease through meditation. Experts today criticised the 'snake oil' products for misleading customers, and called for the online marketplace selling it to be 'more careful'. MailOnline found one Fiverr user was charging \u00a3114.83 for a 'vaccine reversal herb oil recipe'. Korelvabbah, the Kenyan seller offering the service, promises buyers it would 'enable you to reverse vaccine before it kicks in'. He said his recipe - listed with a cobbled-together advertising poster - would help in the 'case of emergency'. The oil is meant to be rubbed into the injection site 'until it pops and produces pus', according to the seller's FAQs. Internet witchdoctors are selling bogus Covid vaccine 'reversal' oils (pictured) for nearly \u00a3120, with instructions telling buyers to rub the ointments into the injection site 'until it pops up and produces pus' The \u00a3114.83 recipe - listed with a child-like attempt of an advertising poster - is supposed to help in the 'case of emergency' Korelvabbah, who also offers 'spiritual and healing counselling', Swahili translations and wildlife photography, encourages buyers to give the treatment to their children and the elderly. Fiverr profits from every sale, with the online marketplace adding a \u00a35.69 service fee on top of the recipe. It is not clear how many have been sold. Experts today criticised the recipe, saying it was obviously a hoax and may even be dangerous. No ingredients are listed. They claimed it was unclear how it would even work, questioning what the purpose of reversing the effects of a life-saving vaccine would be. Vaccines currently deployed for use in Britain \u2014 made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca \u2014 have repeatedly been proven to be safe. Multiple trials and real-world data have shown the jabs dramatically cut the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying with Covid. If Britain's lockdown is to be relaxed as planned over the coming months, the roll-out must continue to go smoothly. Korelvabbah, the Kenyan seller offering the bogus product, promises buyers it will 'enable you to reverse vaccine before it kicks in' Around 28.3million Britons have already had their first dose \u2014 but health bosses are concerned about low uptake in BAME groups and carers. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said Fiverr have to be more careful in what it allows to be listed on its site. He said: 'It's basically snake oil. 'The seller offers no idea of what it is or what it does, and you have to ask the question of why you would want it? 'If you're feeling a bit under the weather after the vaccine \u2014 which is perfectly normal \u2014 no ointment is going to lessen those symptoms. '[Fiverr] has to be a bit more careful about what it's listing on its site.' Fiverr has now taken the listing down after being approached by MailOnline. A spokesperson said: 'We do not allow services that are meant to provide any medical treatment, advice, or supply. 'We also do not allow services that are related to misinformation around Covid or creating content regarding any medical issue that may be used for spreading misleading information.' It is not the first time the Israel-based Fiverr marketplace has come under fire for selling bogus medical products. Last year MailOnline revealed face cures for Covid with 'healing energy' were being sold for up to \u00a380 on the site. And voodoo specialists offering supposed cures for alcoholism on the site costing \u00a3520 were slammed by addiction experts for exploiting vulnerable patients. WHY ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT VACCINES? SIDE EFFECTS One reason some people are fearful of having a vaccine is the risk of side effects. Side effects are normal because the vaccines trigger the immune system, which is how they work, and the immune system is usually what causes symptoms of illness. Things like fever, aches, headache and tiredness are all normal signs that the immune system is reacting to something and are often caused jabs but are not serious. They tend to clear up by themselves within days, and can be controlled with drugs like paracetamol and ibuprofen. A tiny proportion of people suffer more severe side effects, such as going into shock or having a severe allergic reaction, but this is extremely rare and usually only happens in people with a history of bad reactions. Everybody who receives a jab on the NHS is monitored for at least 15 minutes to make sure they don't have a bad reaction, and vaccination teams have treatments on hand to help if this happens. FERTILITY Part of the reason for young women being concerned is understood to be myths about the vaccine affecting fertility or the health of unborn babies. Although vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women, this is only because they have not been trialled on them specifically - the same reason children are not eligible for the jabs. There is no evidence to suggest the vaccine would be capable of harming an unborn child - and certainly not any more than the real coronavirus - but it is not being given to pregnant women out of caution. And on long-term effects on fertility, Professor Van-Tam said no vaccine has ever led to infertility and there was no reason the Covid ones would do so. ONLINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES Online conspiracy theories also claim that jabs have tracking microchips in them, contain animal products or use cells from human flesh - none of which are true. Experts have called for spreading lies about vaccines online to be criminalised, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it 'total nonsense'.
