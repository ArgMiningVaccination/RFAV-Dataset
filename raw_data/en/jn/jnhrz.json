And there is a greater need to improve our immune system. Concerns regarding immunity have become more important, given the periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), and now the coronavirus pandemic. How does your immune system prevent intruders? The immune system has two types of responses: innate and adaptive. A body's natural barriers against disease-causing intruders, such as skin, nasal hair, and stomach acid are part of the innate immune system. Adaptive immunity develops over a lifespan of contact with pathogens and vaccines, preparations which help the immune system to differentiate friend from foe. Vaccination safely teaches the adaptive immune system to repel a wide range of diseases. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus and we may not see one for 12 months or longer. (Source: World Economic Forum) So, for now, our immune systems must adapt unaided to this potentially deadly threat. Nutrition and immunity The lack of enough nutrition can lead to a rise in lifestyle-related diseases as well as lower immunity levels. Adequate nutrition is an important way to help reduce the risk and impact of virus infections as well as to build a more resilient immune system over the long term. Focusing on nutrient-rich foods and a well-balanced diet is the best way to obtain desired nutrients.
