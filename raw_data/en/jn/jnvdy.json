To celebrate some of our outstanding residents and fellows, we're highlighting each [Graduate Medical Education (GME) committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about the House Staff Association (HSA), led by co-presidents Lane Lagattuta, DO (PGY-3, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) and Nicholas Skertich, MD (PGY-3 General Surgery). The HSA is responsible for representing Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) resident physicians in matters relating to: Lagattuta: This is a unique opportunity to represent and advocate for my fellow residents. We are given the chance to work closely with RUMC leadership on various tasks including improving resident wellness, which is also a very rare opportunity for most residents. Skertich: Being involved in the HSA is an incredible opportunity to advocate for your peers and implement positive change to our training experience. All house staff, both residents and fellows, are considered members. The HSA's executive board is made up of two co-presidents, a vice president, secretary, treasurer, patient safety/quality improvement chair and wellness chair. Our main mission as house staff co-presidents is to represent and advocate for our peers. During the COVID-19 pandemic we are particularly focused on resident wellness and finding ways for us to connect with each other despite the social limitations imposed by the pandemic. To that end, we have recently started a bimonthly house staff newsletter instead of hosting meetings. This accommodates all house staff schedules so that more residents and fellows can stay informed and participate. Residency and fellowship can obviously be a very stressful time, pandemic aside, so we have also converted our social chairs to wellness chairs in hopes of focusing on improving house staff wellness. We have also worked with RUMC leadership all year to ensure wellness center resources are available to all house staff. Despite our country's nearly year-long battle with COVID-19, which has significantly affected resident and fellow training, our house staff have shown incredible resilience. When training has been affected, house staff been flexible and have carried on with overwhelmingly positive attitudes. We hope this committee continues to grow and pushes for the best resident and fellow experience possible, from improving resident resources and workspaces, to fostering an excellent educational experience. We also want to be at the forefront in promoting and supporting resident wellness. Danesha Lewis, MS, is a medical student education coordinator at Rush Medical College and a PhD student at the College of Health Sciences. As a part of the [Health Sciences PhD program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-health-sciences/academic-programs/doctor-philosophy-health-sciences), Lewis's area of research encompasses health disparities and mistrust in the health care system among the African American community. Through her studies, Lewis hopes to increase medication adherence and overall wellness in African American patients battling cardiovascular illnesses. Lewis first came to Rush in 2013 as a temporary employee after completing her Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences at Northern Illinois University. She left briefly to pursue a Master's in Health Administration and later returned to Rush for her second [master's degree in Biotechnology](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/academic-programs/biotechnology-masters-degree-program), which she completed in 2018. She was then hired for her current role in the medical college and decided to continue to further her higher education journey simultaneously in the PhD program. Lewis chose Rush University to complete her PhD because of the breadth of research the College of Health Sciences program allowed her to pursue. As someone who loves having options in life, Lewis stated that having the choice of laboratory or community research was one of the key aspects of the program that appealed to her. \"I love that it is a health science degree formulated for a working professional,\" she said. \"The program is flexible and operates on your own time.\" Lewis's experiences as a Rush graduate student have allowed her to help other graduate-level students like her to the best of her abilities. In her current position at Rush Medical College, she coordinates the curriculum for first- and second-year medical students. She also acts as a liaison between faculty and students. \"Rush was a steppingstone for my career,\" she said. \"The support I received helped me create the habits I needed for success. No matter what field my classmates planned on going into, whether it was graduate or professional school or going into the industry, we all had opportunities to do research and engage with others.\" Lewis attributes her success at Rush to developing good time management and consistent schedules. As COVID-19 continues to impact hospitals across the country, she states that making room for downtime is a vital part of staying healthy during this difficult period. \"The pandemic gave me direction in my area of research,\" she said. \"I'm studying the community's hesitancy towards COVID-19 and the vaccine as the situation progresses, and I'm hoping to alleviate stress about the disease whenever I can.\" Lewis has also participated in many extracurriculars at Rush, including the COVID-19 Journal Club, Graduate Student Council and Governors Breakfast. She was also a manager of the commencement choir. She is also a founder of the [Minority White Coat Foundation](https://www.mwcfoundation.org/), which works to increase the number of minorities in various health care disciplines around the United States through mentorship, scholarships, guidance, and seminars. This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever House Staff Appreciation Week. To celebrate our house staff, we're highlighting the work of each [Graduate Medical Education committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about the Diversity, Inclusion and Equity (DEI) committee featuring a Q&A with co-president Bianca Williams, MD, MBA (PGY-3, Pediatrics). Bianca Williams: Our mission is to create a more prosperous healing and working environment through the championing of the diverse communities we serve and hope to reflect. Our goal is to facilitate the purposeful creation and maintenance of a more diverse, equitable and inclusive Rush University Medical Center. BW: There is an apparent lack of female physicians and physicians of color within our nation. This is mainly due to the fact that many groups were \"unauthorized\" to achieve medical training in decades past. Now that no one should be discriminated against based on their innate being, it is our job to recruit and retain diverse staff as to not backtrack efforts to create more diverse workspaces, but to move forward. BW: Our members range in level of training from medical students to attending faculty. We are aided by administrators from many different offices across Rush. Active membership has been between 50-70 members over my tenure. BW: We are most proud of the house staff recruiting effort our team executed during the last two seasons. We were able to recruit not only in Chicago, but also at other major city conferences before the pandemic hit. I believe Rush University will see the effects of our work for many years to come. We have also been working closely with the Graduate Medical Education office to fine-tune and build on our efforts. Other initiatives include multicultural programming and pursuit of research funding to specifically address how our patients and physicians are affected by health care inequities and socioeconomic struggles. BW: We are in the \"paying it forward\" stage. We hope excited medical students, resident house staff and attendings will join our cause and bring their ideas to the table. This week, Rush University is proud to host its first ever Residency Appreciation Week. To highlight the great work our trainees do across the institution, we're highlighting each [Graduate Medical Education house staff committee](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/house-staff-committees). Here's everything you need to know about RES-CORE from Nithin Pusapati, MD (PGY-2, Internal Medicine) and Vishal Jani, DO (PGY-3, Emergency Medicine). The Resident Committee on the Rush Environment, also known as RES-CORE, is a house staff-led committee that collects and adjudicates instances of mistreatment that occur within the Rush learning environment. We discuss cases during monthly meetings to discuss appropriate approaches to reports we receive. There is also a medical school equivalent of our committee called SCORE - the Student Committee on the Rush Medical College Environment. Rush is deeply committed to maintaining a positive learning environment at all levels of medical education and training. Jani: I was looking for a way to get involved outside my residency training program and wanted to find a committee that focused making tangible changes by working with representatives from other programs at an institutional level. RES-CORE was formed during my PGY-1 year, and it appeared to be a good way to achieve this. As I attended meetings, I appreciated the impact RES-CORE's efforts had on those residents/fellows whose cases we addressed. We have 25 resident and fellow members. We continuously monitor an [online portal](https://rush.medhub.com/index.mh) for reports submitted to resolve any on-going issues. The presence of RES-CORE has an impact at the individual level by addressing specific concerns of house staff as well as being part of institutional change. As a committee, we hope to continue to diversify our membership by attracting membership from more programs. Also, we strive to continuously increase awareness among house staff that we are available should they have any concerns that we can address. Rush University Graduate Medical Education and the Rush Medical College Alumni Association are pleased to announce House Staff Appreciation Week on Feb. 22-26, 2021. Our yearlong battle against the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially difficult for our graduate medical education programs. Despite these ongoing challenges, our residents and fellows have shown incredible resilience and have always put our patients and community first. Our trainees have not only staffed COVID-19 floors and ICUs, but many have volunteered to do so. When training has been affected, house staff have been flexible and have carried on with overwhelmingly positive attitudes. To celebrate our trainees throughout the week, house staff committees and wellness stories will be highlighted on social media. In addition, meals will be provided to residents and fellows in the house staff lounge (482 Atrium Building) throughout the week on a first come, first serve basis: The week will culminate with Thank a Resident/Fellow Day on Friday, Feb. 26. Trainees can stop by the GME office (403 Armour Academic Center) to pick up Rush swag and popcorn from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. \"We are incredibly grateful for our trainees and couldn't have gotten through COVID without them,\" said Mashonda Daniels, director of graduate medical education. \"You all are the true superheroes, and we hope this week exemplifies our gratitude for your hard work, dedication, and persistence as health care professionals during such difficult times.\" To see social media highlights throughout the week, follow #RushGMEAppreciationWeek, as well as Rush GME ( *The photo of residents from the Department of Emergency Medicine was taking during a retreat before the COVID-19 pandemic. For better or worse, many people are watching more TV as a way to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. One medical residency program found a healthy use for TV: inspiration for recruitment season. The pandemic has limited residency and medical school student recruitment to video meetings, so medical schools and academic health centers across the country have had to find creative approaches. That includes the [neurology residency program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/residency-programs/neurology-residency) at Rush University. Neurology at Rush knew it needed a novel way to connect with potential residents. The program created two videos to set itself apart and give students a better sense of its culture: one that gives a [tour of the facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vyS_qmevTM) in a style similar to the TV series Billy on the Street and a [parody video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1eisD23Kj9fvpfVdjT8XTz7sC4-hOO4/view) of the TV show The Office. \"We have an excellent residency program, but we needed a way to showcase who we are better than a standard day-in-the-life video would,\" says [Rebecca O'Dwyer, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/rebecca-odwyer-md), director of the neurology residency program at Rush. \"Our video showed we can have fun together and enjoy our work. \"It also was a good filter \u2014 some candidates might not get the humor, so that person might not be high on our list. We thought our videos helped paint the picture of our program and culture for everyone.\" Though a virtual recruitment season was not unexpected, it left residency programs and medical students wondering how exactly the 2021 Match season would play out. \"You can learn a lot by meeting with somebody in person that you wouldn't learn on a Zoom meeting,\" says [Joy Sclamberg, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/joy-s-sclamberg-md), senior associate dean of [Graduate Medical Education at Rush University](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education). \"That made it tough for the faculty member doing the interview as well as the student.\" Sclamberg says one of the biggest indicators of whether a medical student will be a good fit within a program's culture is how well they get along with the residents currently in the program. Through video, it can be difficult for residents and prospective residents to interact as much as they would like. \"On Zoom, it's hard to take someone aside and talk to them one-on-one,\" says Michael Williams, MD, a third-year resident in Rush's [general surgery program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training/graduate-medical-education/residency-programs/general-surgery-residency), who helped with recruiting. \"And in a large video meeting, some people may not be as willing to speak up.\" Finding a way to have meaningful interactions with current residents is essential for medical students, who are trying to figure out if a program and city \u2014 sometimes one that a student has never been to before \u2014 is right for them. \"Getting a feel for different programs was tough,\" says Aretha Boakye-Donkor, a fourth-year medical student at Rush who will be specializing in internal medicine-pediatrics as a resident later this year. \"If you ask current residents, they'll tell you that it was the gut feeling they had when they went to a location on interview day. We had to trust that it will all work out.\" And for Boakye-Donkor, who is Black, the potential racial implications of a virtual recruitment season were a concern as she went through the process. \"I was worried about the biases that exist. Are those going to be compounded in a virtual setting?\" Boakye-Donkor says. \"Without the advantage of body language, it's so hard to tell over video how someone is perceiving you. You just have to trust the process.\" Rush started the new recruitment season with a virtual residency fair in September. The various residency programs worked with the marketing department at Rush to create virtual tours and other videos that would give students a sense of what the program and facilities are like. Prior to COVID, a key part of the recruitment process was a social event the day before an interview when faculty, current residents and prospective residents are able to engage with one another in a more natural way. That, of course, was another virtual event this year, with people breaking into smaller groups to allow people to become more familiar with one another. \"Though challenging, we were able to get across to students the sense of camaraderie that residents at Rush have,\" Williams said. \"How the people and place make you feel is so important, and we were able to show what it's like to be at Rush as best we could.\" Medical colleges across the country were facing many of the same barriers for various events, including the Second Look Day in the spring when students make a usually crucial follow-up visit to a school. \"That's the day they often meet their future classmates, their future roommates, and realize they definitely want to come here,\" says Alyssa Cannataro, MEd, assistant director of admissions and recruitment at Rush Medical College. Cannataro and her colleagues not only overcame the challenge of not having an in-person Second Look Day but they took the experience to another level, holding an entire month for Second Look experiences. Throughout April 2020, they held events that included wellness challenges through social media. Students shared photos and thoughts about topics such as yoga, meditation and clean eating. \"It was a huge hit,\" Cannataro says. \"The students were excited and engaged. If COVID disappeared tomorrow, we would of course go back to having an in-person Second Look Day, but you can bet we would definitely incorporate some of these successful ideas we used virtually.\" There was one massive benefit for both prospective medical students and residents: cost savings. In a normal year, the cost of travel for in-person and follow-up meetings is significant. Virtual meetings have also helped students save precious time that they need to devote to their current education. And with travel logistics not a concern this year, students are considering programs they may not have put on their list. That has broadened the applicant pool for medical schools and residency programs. \"Every info session we do with potential students can now include several of our current medical students,\" Cannataro says. \"If I was traveling to, say, California, I couldn't bring five medical students with me to talk to pre-med students. We can now reach more pre-med students who get to talk to more current students, and that helps both sides.\" There is still a lot to figure out for medical schools, residency programs and students alike in this virtual environment, but there is a general sense of encouragement as they look ahead. \"We're learning and we'll do better next year, because this is the reality we'll still be looking at,\" Sclamberg says. \"Some of these virtual components may be the way of the future. It can be a lot easier to do some of these things over Zoom. We don't have all the answers yet.\" Until the dust settles, programs and students are doing their best to connect in meaningful ways. \"Selecting a residency program is a huge decision for students. It can change the trajectory of their career,\" says O'Dwyer, who sees more Office TV show parodies \u2014 or other creative tactics \u2014 continuing as a recruitment tool for her program. \"All we can do is our best to make the process more personalized so they can get a sense of who we are. That's what we're all striving for: placing students in a place that feels like home.\" [Susan Chubinskaya, Ph.D.,](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/susan-chubinskaya-phd) Vice-Provost, Faculty Affairs and Professor, Osteoarthritis Research, Department of Pediatrics, Rush University Medical Center, was inducted into the [American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE)](https://aimbe.org/) College of Fellows.

Life events have provided Kellye Walters-Warren with more than enough food for thought. Now her focus is on food for health. Walters-Warren recently started work on her [master's in clinical nutrition at Rush University](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-health-sciences/academic-programs/master-science-clinical-nutrition) after raising three children, caregiving for her mom and witnessing how poor nutrition led to health disparities in the underserved community she grew up in. She talked to us about her nontraditional path to health care and the events that sparked her passion for nutrition. Kellye Walters-Warren: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago in the South Shore community. I went to college right after high school, but it just wasn't working for me at the time. So I left college after two years and started focusing on raising my family \u2014 I have three children. During that time, I did earn my associate degree in biological sciences from Triton College in River Grove, though it did take quite a few years to finish. I finished in 2018. When my three kids were nearly out of the nest \u2014 my youngest was in high school \u2014 I decided to focus more of my attention on school and get my bachelor's degree. I always wanted to enter the health care field, so in 2018 I started work on my [bachelor's in health sciences](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-health-sciences/academic-programs/bachelor-science-bs-health-sciences) at Rush. I was working in retail at the same time and some of my focus was still on my kids, but I just had to finish. I wanted my kids to see me accomplish something. I wanted them to realize that you're never too old to pursue what you really want to do. I eventually finished the program and stayed at Rush in 2020 to pursue a master's degree in clinical nutrition. KWW: I grew up in a single-parent home with my mom. Our maternal grandmother also helped raise us. I grew up knowing education was important. My mom wanted us to have better opportunities than she did; she only had a high school education. My mom encouraged us to go to college even though she didn't understand much about higher education. Maybe the people in the community I grew up in can look at what I have accomplished and think, \"If she can do it, then I can do it also.\" It has not been an easy journey, but I promised myself after I left college years ago that I would keep pushing forward and never give up on myself. KWW: I always had a real love of health care, and learning about health and how to be healthy. And being a caregiver for family members was definitely a factor. My mom was especially a driving force. She had high blood pressure and heart disease, and eventually died of cancer. I realized that was where my passion really was: helping people. During my time in the bachelor's program at Rush there was always something about nutrition that drew me in \u2014 the realization that nutrition is the basis of health, how to be healthy and how to maintain health. Coming from an underserved community, I thought of all the people who would benefit from knowing that nutrition is the basis of health. What you eat and don't eat plays such a huge role in diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure, and comorbidities. That really hits home when you see that these are the people who are most likely to succumb to COVID. I asked myself, \"What can I do to help?\" All of that was proof enough that clinical nutrition was the direction I wanted to go in. KWW: When I was in the bachelor's program, I was able to sit down and talk to some of the people in clinical nutrition, like [Dr. Sarah Peterson](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/sarah-peterson-rd-phd-cnsc-ldn), and I shadowed [Dr. Sandra Gomez-Perez](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/sandra-l-gomez-perez-phd-rd-ldn), a clinical nutrition faculty member who focuses on research. There's also a community on the West Side near Rush that is underserved and in need of caring health care providers. I really felt like this is where I needed to be. And I like being at Rush overall. I'm not the average student, having waited to go back to school until I raised my kids. I've never felt like my age has been a factor here, though. The students and faculty don't treat me any differently because I'm older. It's very welcoming. Faculty members in the BSHS program from day one were so very helpful in molding the direction I decided to take. They saw so much potential in my abilities and helped me on my journey to realize my strengths and where in the health care environment I would have the biggest impact. [Dr. Brinda Bradaric](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/brinda-bradaric-phd) was the first to introduce me to the Clinical Nutrition program, along with Dr. Peterson. Dina Batlivala Tresselt in admissions encouraged me endlessly. [Kenya M. Johnson](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/kenya-mcguire-johnson-pt-ma) was helpful in keeping me grounded and always reminded me to never give up. [Mary Jo Guglielmo](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/mary-jo-guglielmo-mph) was supportive and helped mentor me during the entire BSHS program, and continues to mentor me today. I am so thankful for their guidance. I also work at Rush, so there was a convenience factor of staying here. I'm a program assistant for the bachelor's in health sciences program. I work with the program directors to help keep things running smoothly. KWW: In the fall, I'll get started on my thesis project. It will probably focus on something related to how gut health plays a role in obesity \u2014 how the microbiome plays a role in those who are obese and those who aren't. Obesity is just such a big problem. I mean, it's a big problem everywhere, but it is especially so in underserved communities for so many reasons. KWW: I would tell people to never give up. Ask for help if you need help \u2014 that's part of learning how to be a grown-up. Don't give up on yourself just because you need help. To have a job is one thing, but to have a career is something else. It opens up so many more doors. You really have to want to love what you do. And don't let anyone tell you that you can't do what you want to do. History of online excellence helps the College of Nursing meet the sudden demand for distance learning due to COVID-19. Rush University's College of Nursing ranked No. 1 for the second straight year in U.S. News & World Report's Best Online Graduate Nursing Programs list. The [College of Nursing](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing), which was tied for the top spot on a list that took into account the 194 schools eligible in U.S. News' 2021 edition, had a top-quality online learning foundation to draw from as distance learning became more of a requirement than an option for many students during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"As our programs shifted to full or hybrid format this year because of the pandemic, we capitalized on many years of experience developing top-ranked distance learning programs,\" says [Christine M. Kennedy, PhD, RN, FAAN](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/about-college-nursing/office-dean), dean of the College of Nursing. \"U.S. News' online rankings reflect the deep expertise our faculty and staff have in preparing top practitioners and leaders in nursing, providing the highest quality educational experience. I couldn't be prouder to be ranked No. 1 again.\" Two straight No. 1 rankings for the College of Nursing is the culmination of a steady climb for the school since it ranked No. 13 in 2015. This marks the third straight year it has ranked in the top five. The College of Nursing ranks in the top four in three of U.S. News' specialty rankings this year: Distance learning plays a key role in helping to solve the U.S.'s nursing shortage, which has been magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through 2026, 203,700 new nurses are needed each year to fill newly created positions and replace retiring nurses, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Advanced practice nurses can increase accessibility to high quality and cost-effective care. This is particularly true for underserved populations. The College of Nursing has a renown research, clinical practice and teaching reputation in demonstrating and developing equity and inclusion models of care in those populations. \"Providing distant education access to students who may not have been able to attend nursing school otherwise is critical, especially right now during the global pandemic,\" Kennedy says. \"Our students have access to the same clinical experts who advise and teach on-campus students no matter which format they attend.\" Many nursing programs have had to turn to distance learning this past year, but an online program must have been founded before the 2019-2020 academic year to be eligible for U.S. News' 2021 rankings. The rankings are calculated by U.S. News based on the following categories: Nursing programs at Rush are offered from the master's through the doctoral (DNP and PhD) levels. The following are the college's [degree options](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training) available online: The College of Nursing has a [national reputation](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/news/rush-university-strong-performer-2021-us-news-rankings) for excellence, consistently ranking among the top nursing schools in the nation. Nine residential programs ranked in the top 10 last year, and the 2022 rankings will be released in March 2021. The College of Nursing's heritage dates back to 1885, when its first antecedent, the St. Luke's Hospital Training School of Nursing, opened to offer diploma education to nurses. Today, well over 7,000 baccalaureate, master's and doctoral students have graduated from the College of Nursing. Having trouble keeping up with all of the COVID-19 information in your news feed? Join the Club. Shortly after the pandemic began, students across Rush University came together to start the [Rush University COVID-19 Journal Club](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/covid-19-science/covid-19-rush-journal-club) to sift through the staggering amount of news and research about the virus. Their work is making the science more accessible not only to health care workers but also the general public. The group now has more than 70 members across the University's four colleges, including third-year Rush Medical College students Bijan Zarrabi and Morgan Sturgis, who recently talked about the initiative's work and how it began. Tell us about the COVID Journal Club. Bijan Zarrabi: On our webpage and [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/rmc_covidjournal) we create summaries of research articles and topics that show up in the news to discuss the study design, findings and limitations of each research article. That includes topics such as drugs used to treat COVID and the vaccine trials. Our audience tends toward medical professionals and students, but we're slowly gaining a following from the general public, especially on the Instagram page that Morgan is running. Morgan Sturgis: On our Instagram page, we make the information a bit more digestible and user friendly, and that has allowed us to reach an even broader audience. So instead of just practicing physicians, now we're reaching the general public. We're reaching people like our parents and grandparents who want to know about these hot topics. How did the idea begin? BZ: It started around April when Dr. Beth Hall, a recent Rush Medical College graduate, and I were recruited by [Dr. Elizabeth Baker](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/elizabeth-baker-md), senior associate dean of the college, and Scott Thompson, director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center and our faculty adviser, to organize a group of students who expressed interest in participating in research efforts related to COVID-19. We saw that there were thousands of articles being published on COVID-19, so it's nearly impossible to read every single paper thoroughly. The alternative is reading only the abstracts of those papers. But if you do that, you're not truly able to understand the clinical implications or limitations of each paper. So we decided to create the Journal Club so that we can help people stay up-to-date on the news literature in time-efficient way. What motivated you to get involved? MS: This has just been such a stressful and really unique time for everyone. As medical students, we have seen a lot of our upperclassmen, as well as the physicians who are training us, at the frontline as health care providers for people who have COVID-19. This Journal Club has been a really meaningful way for us to contribute. While we can't be there at the frontline, we can still contribute something positive to the field that we're so passionate about. Do you have a particular interest in infectious disease? MS: ID (infectious disease) has a special place in my heart. My most influential premedical mentor was a man named Dr. Wayne Campbell, who has since passed away. But he was a really well-known ID doctor on the East Coast, and he had this contagious \u2014 pun very much intended \u2014 passion that sparked my interest in ID and really solidified my pursuit of a medicine as a career. At the end of the day, I think ID has a place in any field of medicine, but I definitely have an interest in it and love learning about it. ID is not something that discriminates. It impacts every single person across the world. And I think you can just have a really broad impact in medicine once you understand it. What have been your biggest takeaways from sorting through all the research as part of the COVID-19 Journal Club? MS: Especially at the very beginning, the recommendations and the protocols surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic were just constantly evolving and, quite frankly, really confusing. So I think one of my biggest takeaways has been how essential clear communication and patient education are. The Journal Club has reminded me how important these two pillars of medicine are. We get to cater to this really diverse audience that has changed throughout the course of the Journal Club. And one thing we've been able to do through that is provide an opportunity for people outside of the medical community to ask the questions that are heavy on their minds and hearts. They can ask for a breakdown of some drug they had never heard of but is common in our vocabulary as people in the medical field. BZ: I completely agree. One of my other big takeaways is realizing the power that a small group of students has in being able to come together and generate something so unique but also really useful. I feel like students at Rush are really eager to help others while also educating themselves. Also, the people involved, like Morgan and [our leadership](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/covid-19-science/covid-19-rush-journal-club/covid-19-rush-journal-club-leadership), have been so great at what they do, so it inspires you and pushes you to be better and work harder. What do you hope people will take away from your work? BZ: I hope people learn the importance of keeping themselves informed through credible research and the importance of reading those articles critically. As Morgan said, there is so much information coming at us about COVID-19. It's like trying to drink water from a fire hose. We're trying to improve the clarity of the information we're receiving. Seems like you all work well as a group. What has that experience been like? BZ: People are so good at stepping up and are so excited to work on this project. The leadership has been so versatile in terms of taking on different responsibilities. We wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for the group's leaders. MS: When you start something from the ground up, leadership is so essential. It sets the tone. We have such a great leadership board, from first-year medical students to current physicians. We really have a broad spectrum of experience, but there's a common interest in advocacy, research, education and lifelong learning that really brought us together. "}
