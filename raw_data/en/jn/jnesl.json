This year, having a robust immune system is more important than ever. We all know that a balanced diet and a good night's sleep are essential for staying healthy. But what else can we do? Consider getting regularly scheduled massages. Five ways massage can improve your immune system - Massage is known for promoting increased circulation and lymphatic flow, which helps move healthy nutrients throughout your body and to filter metabolic waste. - Studies show that massage can increase the level of lymphocytes, which are the cells that help the immune system fight off harmful substances in the body. - Stress has been shown to be a significant immunosuppressor. Massage is one of the best ways to reduce stress by reducing the level of cortisol, a stress hormone. - According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, pain has measurable negative effects on immunity. Massage has an enormous impact on decreasing pain, which will make it easier for your body to fight off an illness. - Massage is great for mental health. Your mind is a direct link to your body and a healthy mind promotes a healthy body.
