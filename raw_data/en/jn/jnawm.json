Version: 1.0 Page 4 of 34 Executive Summary Immunization with safe and efficacious COVID -19 vaccines is a critical component of the Capital Area strategy to reduce COVID -19-related illness, hospitalization, and death and to help restore economic and social functions within our community . Vaccine -induced herd immunity will be achieved b y public, private, and community organizations working together - as one - using science, research, and data to promote evidence -based decisions and the sharing of fact ual information regarding vaccines and vaccination . Working together, we can reduce the burden to our health system and keep our families, friends, and community safe. This plan is a product of valuable contributions from community partners who provide a voice for those whom they represent and serve. Together, these partners answered a called to action from Austin Public Health to come together as the Austin /Travis County COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Partner Coalition (Vaccine Distribution Coalition) to create guiding principles to help structure a Capital Area Vaccine Distribution Plan th at represents the core Austin values of equity, inclusion, and transparency . These guiding principles (see Figure 1), as reflected throughout the document, support decision making on vaccine allocation and distribution . Figure 1: Vaccine Distribution Coalition Guiding Principles From these guiding principles we can focus on the overarching goal for vaccination : To maximize the health of the community through vaccination and to eliminate COVID -19 by focusing on th ose who are disproportionally impacted by the disease - our communities of color, our low income residents, and the older adults in our community . To reach this goal, the Capital Area Community Vaccination Strategy has four objectives (see Figure 2) : A. Secure the health infrastructure B. Prevent severe disease and death C. Protect our essential workers D. Prevent community transmission For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 5 of 34 These objectives support and align with both the Guiding Principles created by the Austin Vaccine Distribution Coalition and by guidance developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Figure 2: Capital Area Community Vaccination Strategy This document serves as an iterative plan to allow the Capital Area and its partners to illustrate how the goal and objectives described above will be achieved . Specific topics related to COVID -19 vaccination program plannin g and implementation are presen ted in this plan . The document is organized based on a template provided by the CDC to state health departments. While this document is meant to inform, it is also designed to clearly highlight vaccine allocation and distribution areas of responsibility - whether this be at the local level or whether it be the responsibility of DSHS or the CDC. This document expresses the input and view of members of the Vaccine Distribution Coalition and reflects the desire of Austin Public Health to meet its obligatio ns under local, state, and federal rules and regulations. As this pandemic continues to unfold, so too will the contents of this document be revised on an ongoing basis to reflect new information, new guidance, and new science related to vaccine allocatio n and distribution.

Version: 1.0 Page 6 of 34 Section 1: COVID -19 Vaccination Preparedness Planning A. Describe your early COVID -19 vaccination program planning activities, including lessons learned and improvements made from the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign, seasonal influenza campaigns, and other responses to identify gaps in preparedness In 2009, H1N1 swept the nation and tested the pandemic response throughout the United States . This pandemic was one of the first mass vaccination events in the United States. Provide rs were tasked with vaccinating approximately 30% of the population nationally with a single dose of vaccine. Ten years later, a new mass vaccination challenge has emerged which will require vaccinating approximately 70% of the population with two doses of a vaccine. This daunting task will require learning from H1N1 and doubling the efforts for vaccination and understanding the size of the task that is ahead. Many lessons were learned throughout the country and compiled succinctly within the National Acade my of Medicine . Within their framework, the United States has key lessons learned from p rior Mass Vaccination Events: Leverage relationships with professional medical societies and other key downstream stakeholders from the outset. When cost, insurance, and other policies create barriers, consider the of rationing at the state, local, and practice levels. Develop effective systems for tracking distribution. Ensure that ancillary supply distribution is timely and appropriate. \"Under promise an d over deliver\" in planning and communication efforts. Ensure up -to-date information on vaccine production, inventory, and projections via stronger and more formal partnerships between federal entities and vaccine producers. Plan for a range of vaccine s upply scenarios. Continue to use the Vaccines for Children program infrastructure as a basis for emergency vaccination distribution programs; consider something similar for adults. Deploy limited vaccine supplies equitably and transparently using preestablished, evidence - based criteria to prioritize allocation. Promote global regulatory harmonization and standardization in vaccine development to improve speed, flexibility, and effic iency. Use consistent, respectful, accurate communication to earn, secure, and maintain trust. These lessons learned were reflected in the experience during H1N1 at the local level : Vaccine trickled in during the first few months Ancillary supplies for v accines were provided as part of the vaccine package but often did not arrive on time, were incomplete, or contained inadequate types of supplies Local jurisdictions lacked awareness on quantity providers were receiving Public Health was seen as the knowle dge point for quantity of vaccine in the community and providers reached out when they did not receive vaccine First experience of retail pharmacies administering vaccines on a national scale Vaccine misinformation was d eveloped quickly For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 7 of 34 Utilization of the Incident Command System (ICS) and inventory management at clinic sites are critical areas Only one dose was required with H1N1 , which was challenging. Adopting this to a two -dose regimen for COVID -19 while increasing the portion of the p opulation requiring vaccination will add subst antial complexity to public health interventions and follow -up Appointment -based clinics work well Drive -thru clinics are a best practice and work efficiently for immunizing adults , but they present logistical and operational challenges While prioritization was required at firs t to manage limited supply, vaccine providers pivoted to extending to larger populations w hen more vaccine was available in later phases . This allowed for more flexibility in administration , for example vaccinat ing entire families at point of care instead of the one family member that met the prioritization criteria. The lessons learned from H1N1 vaccination are applied in daily and seasonal operations within the local health department. Each October, Austin Public Health supports Boo the Flu vaccination clinics and implement s ICS and inventory management to ensure that we can provide efficient mass vaccination services and track vaccination and documentation. Man y of the lessons learned during the initial distribution of COVID -19 Vaccine are similar to challenges faced at the beginning of the response related to COVID -19 Testing. When Austin/Travis County implemented testing in the county , the goal was to serve th e most people in the fastest way possible . In order to meet that goal, we created a drive- thru testing site. This model was implemented based on years of point of distribution exercising for situations such as bioterrorism attacks. The drive -thru also allowed Austin Public Health to exercise our cold -chain storage methods during specimen preservation . However, we were quickly met with the challenge that a drive- thru does not always meet the needs of the entire community as there are many with mobility challenge s and other barriers that prevent access to testing through a drive -thru operation . The response had to pivot quickly to serve people in their community in order to remove barriers to access , opening several community test sites. These lesson s are in t he forefront of vaccine distribution planning in order to provide vaccines to the communities that have been disproportionately affected. B. Include the number/dates of and qualitative information on planned workshops or tabletop, functional, or full -scale exercises that will be held prior to COVID -19 vaccine availability. Explain how continuous quality improvement occurs/will occur during the exercises and implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Austin Public Health (APH) has been working on cold -chain management exercises since 2018. The process has been facilitated through multiple tabletop exercises engaging various stakeholders . These exercises have highlight ed the importance of attention to detail when planning for the medical model for vaccine distribution in the event of mass vaccination . In direct response to the COVID -19 Vaccine and to understand how A PH will distribute th e COVID -19 Vaccine to Austin/Travis County , APH has hosted multiple vaccine -related exercises. A virtual tabletop exercise was held on June 24, 2020 to understand processes for receiving vaccines and details for different operational pieces including admin istration, logistics, and operations at a local distribution site and point of distribution . Two COVID -19 Vaccination full-scale exercises were held in October and For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 8 of 34 November . On October 24, 2020, a walk -up flu clinic was held at Southeast Library, 5803 Nuck ols Crossing Rd, Austin, TX 78744, from 8am to 12pm . This clinic provided 200 vaccines to the public in a walk -up setting that utilized a current neighborhood COVID -19 test site footprint to understand how the current City of Austin run neighborhood COVID -19 test sites will be utilized for COVID -19 vaccines, the resources needed, and the throughput to provide efficient vaccinations. The clinic was able to vaccinate 200 people in 2 hours . The throughput from this event allowed us to understand and anticipate the time to be able to vaccinate for COVID -19. Lessons learned to improve for the second exercise included personal protective equipment recommendations and increased training on vaccin e logistics . The first event also highlighted the current expertise that has been developed through the COVID -19 vaccinations for the incident management teams at the neighborhood testing sites. On November 7, 2020, a drive - through flu clinic was hosted at Travis County Exposition Center, 7311 Decker Ln, Austin, TX 78724 , from 9am -2pm. This clinic utilized scheduled appointments via the APH I mmunization program hotline and same day appointments. A total of 600 flu vaccines were available and 428 were admini stered to ages 6 months and up . Changes implemented for this exercise included a change to the documentation to make it easier for clients to fill out and enhanced training for exercise participants including incorporating vaccine logistics more fully into the logistics section. Lessons learned from this exercise included the burden of data entry and ensuring we have appropriate staff to meet the 24 hour turnaround for the COVID -19 vaccine, resources needed to be prepared for vehicle issues, and media/commu nication needs for flow in and out of any location that may be utilized . On December 14, 2020, APH performed a combin ation tabletop and functional exercise s to assess direct logistics of the ultra- cold vaccine in a local distribution site and how APH will distribute any vaccines it receives to points of distribution for the community. In January 202 1, APH will host a pilot virtual tabletop exercise to understand the needs of the community and how to focus vaccination efforts . This t abletop will be refined and improved and eventually available for anyone who would like to host a tabletop to discuss difficult questions around vaccine distribution. The knowledge gained from the recent exercises continues to build upon the institutional knowledge from H1N1 as APH and community partners work on building a vaccination program to meet the needs of the community. Section 2: COVID -19 Organizational Structure and Partner Involvement A. Describe your organizationa l structure. The COVID -19 response for Austin/Travis County has been guided by unified incident command of both the City of Austin and Travis County. The Travis County Health Authority and the Austin Public Health Director serve as members of the unified incident comman d. The response is complex and has expanded to meet the needs of the community since the initial Stay Home , Work Safe orders were put in place on March 21, 2020. The response includes a Public Health and Medical Operations Branch and a parallel Social Services Branch that direc ts all public health response and medical field operations . A Vaccine Task Force and a n Epidemiological Response Task Force are housed with the Public Health and Medical Operations Branch. The Epidemiological Response Task Force provides data for decision making for all For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 9 of 34 operations. The Social Services Branch includes multiple taskforces to ensure that operations address the needs of the highest risk and most vulnerable populations to COVID -19. Additionally, the emergency response organizational structure includes an equity officer as part of the Incident Command Staff. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble an internal COVID -19 Vaccination Program planning and coordination team that includes persons with a wide array of expertise as well as backup representatives to ensure coverage. The COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force includes public health emergency response planners, epidemiologist s, emergency response nurse s, public health nurses, public health executives, health equity experts, physicians, immunizations management experts, public informa tion officers, and data systems managers . This team has developed localized playbooks, practiced live public points of distribution exercises to test workforce capacity and available point of distribution (POD) sites , held table top exercises to inform p riority population needs, tested existing and launched new data information systems, produced public messaging, and developed partner engagement systems . The team has multiple feedback loops to inform varying planning levels including larger community -wide plans as well as department vaccine clinic site specific plans. The Task Force has built in staff redundancies for each position . C. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble a broader committee of key internal leaders and external partners to assist with implementing the program, reaching critical populations, and developing crisis and risk communication messaging. The Vaccine Task Force launch ed a Vaccine Distribution Coalition with health care system and community partners to inform COVID -19 vaccine program planning and distribution within Austin and Travis County and the Central Texas Region . Local jurisdiction coalitions have been identified at the federal level as a best practice and are key to successful rapid vaccine distribution planning. The focus of the Vaccine Distribution Coalition includes : Identifying Priority Populations Vaccine Distribution Channels Vaccine Management Community Messaging/Engagement The coalition informs community -wide plans and strategies to reach the desired level of COVID -19 vaccination coverage for our community . Additionally , the coalition empowers a partner network with the larger community to promote vaccine and specifically engage high risk, hard to reach, disproportionately affected populations to inform decision making, reduce barriers to vaccine access, and provide support for on -going protection from COVID -19 infection. D. Identify and list m embers and relevant expertise of the internal team and the internal/external committee. The Vaccine Distribution coalition is made up of over 100 representing organizations throughout Travis County and the surrounding Central Texas community . The co alition membership can be divided into 3 main types: For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020.

Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate efforts between state, local, and territorial authorities. Austin Public Health participates and/or coordinates the following: o Weekly Texas Department of State Hea lth Services COVID -19 vaccine update webinars o Weekly regional calls with the Public Health Region 7 Regional Public Health Medical Operations Center, which includes surrounding local health departments o Local, regional, and state authorities are invited to participate in the V accine Distribution Coalition F. Describe how your jurisdiction will engage and coordinate efforts with leadership from tribal communities, tribal health organizations, and urban Indi an organizations . Travis County does not have any official tribal communities, tribal health organizations, or urban Indian organizations ; however , we recognize that there may be members of tribal communities within the community and will work to ensure va ccination needs , engagement, and communicatio n reach these individual s. G. List key partners for critical populations that you plan to engage and briefly describe how you plan to engage them, including but not limited to: i. Pharmacies ii. Correctional facilities/v endors iii. Homeless shelters iv. Community -based organizations The Austin/Travis County COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Partner Coalition includes partners from each of these key areas . Additionally, direct outreach to each of the critical population groups is ongoing. This includes priority population specific stakeholder meetings, conference calls, and working with each of these groups to identify appropriate methods to engage and co mmunicate with the critical populations. Key engagement activities include meeting with the l ong-term care task force to discuss plans to ensure access to vaccine providers for onsite distribution; meeting with Austin Latinx Coalition members to identify vaccine barriers and inform culturally and linguistically appropriate messages ; outreach to public safety, A ustin -Bergstrom International Airport , Cap Metro to determine best approaches for For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 11 of 34 vaccine distribution among their workforce ; and engaging construct ion, health care, education, childcare, behavioral health sectors to develop and communicate decisions on priority population phased vaccine distribution criteria for essential workers and high risk groups . Additionally, congregate settings such as homeles s shelters and correctional facilities are key concerns due to the high risk of infection among the resident population and the staff . APH provides regular outreach to providers that serve these populations, site managers and staff, and advocacy groups to identify and inform appropriate vaccine distribution and education strategies . Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID -19 Vaccination Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction will structure the COVID -19 Vacc ination Program around the three phases of vaccine administration. A critical planning assumption is that, due to the ever -evolving situation with vaccine supply level and types of vaccines available , all providers need to be flexible in their approach to vaccination . However, they must also remain as specific as possible to attempt to reduce confusion and will need to accommodat e and plan for the multiple vaccine supply scenarios that may occur. Austin Public Health will follow and utilize guidance that c omes from the CDC, ACIP, and DSHS Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel ( EVAP ) to ensure proper vaccine allocation . This guidance in coordination with demographic and epidemiological data specific to the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19 in Austin/Travis County will drive how vaccines are administered during the three allocation phases defined by the CDC. A change in epidemiological data or guidance may adjust distribution plans at any time. The allocation phases are defined by the limiting factor in the process, the supply of vaccine available. Vaccine supply will be limited in the early phase (Phase 1) of the vaccine distribution program. The supply is expected to increase and change quickly in the early months of 2021 , allowing vaccination efforts to expand and more providers to receive the vaccine for distribution . All aspects of the vaccination program in Austin/Travis County an d the Capital Area should focus on maximizing vaccine a cceptance and public health protection while minimizing waste and inefficiency. The three allocation phases are defined by the CDC as : Phase 1: Potentially Limited Supply of COVID -19 Vaccines Available Phase 2: Large Number Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand Phase 3: Sufficient Supply of Vaccine Doses for Entire Population For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 12 of 34 Figure 3: CDC COVID- 19 Vaccination Program Phases Phase 1: Potentially Limited Supply of COVID -19 Vaccine Doses Available During Phase 1 the key considerations for planning are : COVID -19 vaccine supply may be limited COVID -19 vaccine administration efforts must concentrate on the initial populations of focus to achieve vaccination coverage in those groups Inventory, distribution, and any repositioning of vaccine will be closely monitored through reporting to ensure end -to-end visibility of vaccine doses. The vaccination program will focus on critical populations defined by CDC and DSHS guidance with the goal of prote cting the healthcare infrastructure within the Capital Area. Vaccine supply within Phase 1 may not be able to reach all the defined critical populations . Vaccination sites may be limited to closed points of distribution and smaller population specific clinics in order to provide the vaccine to those that meet the defined criteria and guidance. Phase 2: Large Number of Doses Available As the supply of ava ilable vaccine increases into 2021 , distribution will expand, increasing access to vaccination services for individuals within Phase 1 . When larger quantities of vaccine become available, there will be two simultaneous objectives: Provide equitable access to COVID -19 vaccination for all critical populations to achieve high COVID -19 vaccination coverage in these populations in the jurisdiction. Ensure high uptake in specific population s, particularly in groups that are higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID -19.

Version: 1.0 Page 13 of 34 During this time many considerations will be needed in a balance to communicate, serve the population, as well as follow guidance from DSHS and CDC. Providers will need to continue to vaccinate those within Phase 1. During this time, the sup ply will need to be reviewed to ensure that we are meeting demand and able to connect services for critical populations. The additional doses will permit an increase in vaccination providers and locations as well as a need for clear, concise, and timely me ssaging related to vaccination sites and availability. APH will support DSHS outreach and supplement messaging developed in coordination with critical populations. Ongoing outreach to high risk populations will be needed . Austin Public Health will work to understand gaps in the community where access to the vaccine may be limited and serve as a safety net provider for those who are uninsured or underinsured who meet current vaccination guidelines . Meeting the needs of these communities may require adapting neighborhood test sites to serve as vaccination sites as well as communicating about the use of all vaccine providers in the community . Phase 3: Sufficient Supply of Vaccine Doses for Entire Population Ultimately COVID -19 vaccines will be widely available to all residents of the capital area. There will be a sufficient supply that may exceed demand and a broad administration network in place for increased access. At the end of Phase 3, the demand for the COVID -19 vaccine will be low er due to the p lanning assumption that most of the local population will have already been vaccinated. Austin Public Health will consider: Adopting current vaccination service models for non -COVID -19 vaccines in Travis County Monitoring COVID -19 vaccine uptake and cover age in critical populations and enhancing strategies to reach populations with low vaccination uptake or coverage Mon itoring supply and assisting in vaccine movement to minimize wastage Communicating the need for boosters or annual vaccines , if applicable As more vaccine becomes available and data from the community vaccination efforts increase, it will be possible to utilize data- driven methods to improve access to vaccine providers. During this phase, if the vaccine provider network is not robust enough t o meet the needs of the community , a general public mass vaccination point of distribution may be considered in conjunction with other points of distribution to specific populations. Section 4: Critical Populations Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to: 1) identify, 2) estimate numbers of, and 3) locate (e.g., via mapping) critical populations. Critical populations group may include: a. Health care personnel b. Other essential workers c. Long -term care facility residents (e.g. nursing homes and assisted living facility residents) d.

People who are incarcerated/detained in correctional facilities i. People are experiencing homelessness/living in shelters j. People attending colleges/universities k. People living and working in other congregate settings l. People living in rural communities m. People with disabilities n. People who are under -or uninsured B. Describe how your jurisdiction will define and estimate numbers of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce, which will vary by jurisdiction. C. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine additional subset groups of critical populations if there is insufficient vaccine supply. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs) and communication methods for organizations, employers, or communities (as appropriate) within the critical population groups. E. Describe how your jurisdiction will define and estimate numbers of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce, which will vary by jurisdiction. F. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine additional subset groups of critical populations if there is insufficient vaccine supply. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs) and communication methods for organizations, employers, or communities (as appropriate) within the critic al population groups Austin Public Health uses principles, criteria, and frameworks from the CDC, the National Academy of Medicine, the DSHS Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel (EVAP) , and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to develop a va ccine allocation framework for the Capital Area. In addition, Austin Public Health has launched the Austin /Travis County COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Partner Coalition , a combination of community partners and representatives from local health care systems , community organizations and advocacy groups , and other possible vaccine providers , to assist APH in developing plans and strategies so that we can reach the desired level of COVID -19 vaccination coverage for our community. Local jurisdiction coali tions have been identified at the federal level as a best practice and are key to successful rapid vaccine distribution planning. Understanding the population within Travis County takes more than numbers and data as people are not static. In order to defin e populations and understand where a vaccine will be applied to reduce the morbidity and mortality it is important to quantify our populations and locate areas where vaccines can be introduced using a low barrier, equitab le manner. This framework will outline prioritization and allocation guidance and identify critical populations recommended for vaccine in each phase of the COVID -19 vaccination response. The National Academy of Medicine Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine (Figure 4) approaches vaccination in four phases with equity as a critical crosscutting consideration.

Version: 1.0 Page 0 of 34 Figure 4: National Academy of Medicine Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine Austin Public Health awaits final guidance from the ACIP and the DSHS EVAP to identify specific groups who will be recommended for vaccination in each phase . The Vaccine Distribution Coalition developed guiding principles for distribution of the vaccine a nd allocation guidance within the Austin Metropolitan Area. These guiding principles are: Vaccine prioritization should consider those who cannot stay at home, who cannot socially distance in the workplace, and who may face exposure in the workplace (e.g., workers who have externally facing jobs) Vulnerability to exposure should consider o How likely it is that someone will be exposed; and o If exposed, how likely is it that this person will become seriously ill Each priority population may be further prioritiz ed into tiers Outreach strategies should include consistent messaging, trusted community leaders, combat misinformation, and emphasize vaccine safety Federal and state government decisions will be reflected in these guiding principle s The Vaccine Distribut ion Coalition's guiding principles are supplemental to those developed by the EVAP for Texas . Dependent on directive, the Coalition's recommendations cannot supersede allocation guidance recommended by the state. On November 23 rd, the governor announced the Texas guiding principles. Texas will initially allocate COVID -19 vaccines based on the following criteria: For Official Use Only Draft Document for Review Do Not Release without Written Permission from Austin Public Health If received by media, Contact: HSEMPIO@Austintexas.gov Capital Area COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution Plan Distributed to Vaccine Coalition D ecember 19, 2020. Version: 1.0 Page 1 of 34 Protecting health care workers wh o fill a critical role in caring for and preserving the lives of COVID -19 patients and maintaining the health care infrastructure for all who need it. Protecting frontline workers who are at greater risk of contracting COVID -19 due to the nature of their w ork providing critical services and preserving the economy. Protecting vulnerable populations who are at greater risk of severe disease and death if they contract COVID -19. Mitigating health inequities due to factors such as demographics, poverty, insuranc e status and geography. Data- driven allocations using the best available scientific evidence and epidemiology at the time, allowing for flexibility for local conditions. Geographic diversity through a balanced approach that considers access in urban and ru ral communities and in affected ZIP codes. Transparency through sharing allocations with the public and seeking public feedback. Protecting healthcare workers who fill a critical role At this time the DSHS EVAP, in consultation with initial ACIP guidelines and their guiding principles , have identified priorities for Phase 1. Phase 1 has been stratified into Phase 1a and Phase 1b, with each phase also having tiers. The DSHS EVAP has only released their healthcare worker definition for Phase 1a at the time of this version.

Version: 1.0 Page 2 of 34 Public health and emergency response staff directly involved in administration of COVID -19 testing and vaccinations Last responders who provide mort uary or death services to decedents with COVID -19. Includes: o Embalmers and funeral home workers who have direct contact with decedents o Medical examiners and other medical certifiers who have direct contact with decedents School nurses who provide health ca re to students and teachers Early v accine supply within Phase 1 may not be able to reach all the defined Phase 1 critical populations . Further prioritization within critical populations will be required when there is insufficient vaccine supply to vaccina te an entire population. For example, critical infrastructure workforce staff that have regular, direct contact with the public may be prioritized over staff members who do not often come in contact with the public. Organizations, such as hospitals and oth er vaccine providers that will be responsible for vaccinating their own staff, will be responsible for developing their own prioritization system within their workforce. However, these systems must be consistent with state and federal guidance. The United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and H ealth Administration has shared information on classifying workers at risk (low to very high based on position within an org anization) for exposure to SARS -COV -2. This list may help with tiering within phases during periods of low vaccine supply to ensure the vaccine is distributed to those at highest risk for exposure to SARS -COV -2. Throughout Phase 1 and subsequent phases, Austin Public Health will continue to work with community partners to address the issue of health equity , communicate safety, and overcome barriers . Austin Public Health is committed to identifying disadvantaged populations that have been disproportionately affected by COVID -19. The data compiled by Austin Public Health throughout the COVID -19 pandemic and the CDC demonstrates that minority racial and ethnic groups, including American Indians and Alaskan Natives, Black Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos, have experienced higher rates of COVID -19 infection, hospitalization, and death in comparison to Non -Hispanic Whites. As well, the homeless population, prisoners, people with disabilities, and peopl e who are uninsured may have limited ac cess to vaccination services or face an increased risk of acquiring COVID -19.The disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on Travis County's communitie s of color and vulnerable populations will be a principal consideration in Austin Public Health's vaccine distribution efforts. Austin Public Health has developed population estimates for specific groups, including healthcare personnel, critical infrastructure workers, and other groups that face an increased risk of acquiring COVID -19 or suffering severe illness. These estimates are collected in Appendix A. These estimates were obtained using a variety of sources including the United States Census Bureau, the Texas Health Professions Resource Center, local non -profits and community organizations, and Travis County data When available, data was collected from publicly available and readily accessible data sources. The intent is to increase transparency and reveal the lack of bias inherent in the data used by Austin Public Health in describing these populations. As further guidance is received from the CDC and ACIP, additional populations a nd subpopulations may be identified. Austin Public Health will continue to reevaluate the available data to provide the most representative estimation of these critical populations. Utilizing these data, in coordination with existing vaccination provider infrastructure, will allow APH to potentially identify barriers to access and provide timely intervention.

Version: 1.0 Page 3 of 34 Although Austin Public Health has been proactive in our consideration of vaccine distribution and prioritization, it is unknown to what extent state o r federal guidelines may predetermine vaccine allocation priorities throughout the entire vaccine program . For that reason, the preliminary guid elines discussed within this document are subject to change . Section 5: COVID -19 Provider Recruitment and Enrollment A. Describe how your jurisdiction is currently recruiting or will recruit and enroll COVID -19 vaccination providers and the types of settings to be utilized in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program for each of the previously described phases of vaccine availability, including the process to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine. Austin Public Health is tasked with encouraging and facilitating recruitment of COVID -19 vaccinatio n providers within Travis County. The initial information sharing to providers was released by DSHS. Texas DSHS controls all processes for enrollment including verification of credentials and licenses . Austin Public Health communicates enrollment informati on, provides enrollment status updates, and shares enrollment experience and best practices through routine Vaccine for Children channels, the vaccine distribution c oalition , healthcare coalition, the long- term care task force, and Travis County Medical Society. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine the provider types and settings that will administer the first available COVID -19 vaccine doses to the critical population groups listed in Section 4. This is outside our jurisdiction and is controlled at the DSHS level. Austin Public Health will work to link the critical population groups to providers as vaccines become available. Austin Public Health is enrolled as a provider, but it is unknown when vaccines will be allocated. Upon allocation, Austin Public Health will actively work to inoculate critical populations in accordance with guidance . C. Describe how provider enrollment data will be collected and compiled to be reported electronically to CDC twice weekly, using a CDC -provided CSV or Java script template via a SAMS -authenticated mechanism. This is outside our jurisdiction and is controlled at the DSHS level. D. Describe the process your jurisdiction will use to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine. This is outside our jurisdiction and is controlled at the DSHS level. E. Describe how your jurisdiction will provide and track training for enrolled providers and list training topics. This is outside our jurisdiction and is controlled at the DSHS level. Austin Public Health will collect training certificates of all our internal registered providers. We will also track training of any of our nurses as they complete designated training for administration for the COVID -19 vaccin ation.

Describe how your jurisdiction will approve planned redistribution of COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., health systems or commercial partners with depots, smaller vaccination providers needing less than the minimum order requirement). This is outside our jur isdiction and is controlled by DSHS. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure there is equitable access to CO VID-19 vaccination services throughout all areas within your jurisdiction. Austin Public Health will utilize enrolled provider information shar ed by DSHS to map providers throughout Travis County in order to ensure adequate coverage for the entire county. H. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to recruit and enroll pharmacies not served directly by CDC and their role in your COVID -19 Vaccination P rogram plans. DSHS provided outreach to many pharmacies. Austin Public Health coordinated with various partners for outreach throughout the community to enroll pharmacies not already enrolled in the federal program . These pharmacies , as private providers, may distribute vaccines and some are offering services to assist in pop -up vaccination clinics. Section 6: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Capacity Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction has or will estimate vaccine administration capacity based on hypothetical planning scenarios provided previously. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will use this information to inform provider recruitment plans. At the local level, dose and provider estimates for Travis County have been calculated to understand potential quantity of doses required to achieve herd immunity. Estimates indicate a minimum of 67% of the population will need to achieve immunity against COVID -19 through exposure and /or vaccination to curb person to person tran smission of the disease. At this time, specific data on the basic reproduction number (R0) is only an estimate; as such it is safe to assume vaccine coverage will need to reach 67% within the Capital Area for herd immunity to be achieved. Data from the 20 09/10 H1N1 response was used to calculate COVID -19 vaccine administration estimates. In 2009/2010, 30% of the population in Travis County was vaccinated and 358,395 doses of monovalent vaccine were distributed in Travis County over a 6 -month period. Privat e providers accounted for 326,095 of these doses and Austin -Travis County Health and Humans Services Department, now Austin Public Health, accounted for 32,300 of these doses. In 2020, the population of Travis County is approximately 1.273 million people, 14.8% of who are uninsured (approximately 188,545) and 1.085 million who are insured. In order to achieve a 67% herd immunity with 2 doses, 1.707 million doses will need to be distributed in Travis County (see Figure 5) . To match COVID -19 vaccine administration to the vaccine administration percentages during H1N1, private providers will need to account for 1.454 million doses distributed and Austin Public Health may need to account 252,650 doses, primarily for those without health insurance who do not have a medical home. When compared to a decade ago, vaccine coverage for COVID -19 will be twice that for H1N1 and will need to account for two doses of the vaccine, not one.

Version: 1.0 Page 0 of 34 Figure 5: Estimated doses of COVID -19 vaccine for Travis County based on U S Census Bureau population estimates and a 67% herd immunity rate to disrupt person- to-person transmission of the virus Within Travis County, those with insurance will likely have a medical home, but the 14% of the population who are uninsured will not. It is estimated that there may be up to 1,000 providers (MD, NP, and PA) and 93 pharmacies who are may provide vaccination. At the time of the current version of this document (December 18, 2020), Travis County has 321 organizations enrolled as vaccine p roviders. Surveys completed by Sendero Health Plans, also note that a majority of members who responded to a survey about COVID -19 vaccination preferences prefer to receive the vaccination from their primary care provider. However, based on provider enrol lment numbers, it is imperative that a flexible approach be adopted to encourage individuals to obtain the vaccine from any available source - whether it be their physicians, a pharmacy, or another provider outlet. Providers should be encouraged to vaccin ate those beyond their normal clientele. Austin Public Health continues to communicate about the need for practices to enroll as a provider as well as having large companies and organizations link with vaccine providers to create closed points of distribut ion to remove the burden from primary care providers and public health. Public Health will work to ensure that they meet the needs of those without insurance; however, it cannot be the main source of vaccinations for the entire population.

Describe your jurisdiction's COVID -19 vaccination communication plan, including key audiences, communication channels, and partner activation for each of the three phases of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. The APH vaccination communicat ion plan recommends that APH leverage its ongoing COVID -19 communications to incorporate vaccination messaging and information. We also plan on focusing on those who are at increased risk for severe disease and partnering with community groups , the vaccine distribution coalition , and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Social Services Branch to lead partner activation and engage with groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Communications will follow a phased approach that mimics the three phas es of vaccine distribution outlined by the C DC. Phase 1: Campaign messaging will focus on 1) setting expectations as initial supply of the COVID - 19 vaccine will be limited and 2) continued precautions as social distancing, masking, and hygiene will still be needed in the community. Phase 2: Campaign messaging will focus on 1) patient education such as safety standards, dose requirements, and immune response and 2) operational details including provider locations and vaccine availability. Phase 3 : Campaign messaging will continue to focus on 1) patient education and 2) operational details to emphasize vaccine safety and dose requirements, as well as 3) metrics for h ope to guide a return to normalcy through vaccine acceptance and herd immunity. Key audiences are as follows: APH clients, business owners, city and county elected officials, communities of color, community partners and organizations, healthcare providers, municipal staff, schools and childcare, social service agencies, vulnerable and critical populations identified by the CDC and DSHS, and the general public. Relationshi ps with local and community media will be emphasized to reach the key audiences. Comm unication channels are as follows: media, social media, community newsletters, employee emails and/or memorandums, print materials, web content, 311 scripts, stakeholder/partner emails, and virtual meetings.

The registry is secure and confidential, and safely consolidates and stores immunization records from multiple sources in one centralized system. Only doctors, schools, child -care centers, public health departments , and other authorized healthcare organizations may directly access ImmTrac 2. Immunization records are NOT available to view online by the gene ral public, including parents or legal guardians. During a publicly declared disaster, providers must provide the data for any antiviral, immunization, or other medication (AIM) to DSHS within 30 days. Once administered each dose of a COVID -19 vaccine must be reported within 24 hours of administration. The registry will track adverse reactions to an AIM administered during the disaster. All COVID -19 immunization records of people who have not consented to be included within the registry will be removed after 5 years.
