[Contact us](/contact) today to schedule an appointment with one of our [holistic therapists.](https://jenny-walters-neae.squarespace.com/home) We have therapists who are trained in helping people with eating disorders. What is an eating disorder? To put it in simple terms, an eating disorder exists when someone experiences an intense preoccupation with food, exercise, and control. This may result in significant mental, physical, and emotional strain and distress. And often emotional stress and trauma can lead to an eating disorder. Additionally, it's also vital that we explore some of the different types of eating disorders. And some of the patterns they show: [Bulimia Nervosa](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615): a pattern of inducing vomiting after eating. This often follows a meal or consuming a large amount of food very fast. [Anorexia Nervosa](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591): an avoidance and preoccupation with restricting food to avoid gaining weight. Or, to lose more weight. Orthorexia Nervosa: a preoccupation with eating only foods categorized as healthy or \"clean.\" For example, this could be like avoiding specific food groups. This could be due to a belief that they are \"bad,\" processed, or high in carbohydrates. Binge Eating Disorder: The consumption of large amounts of food and a feeling of not being able to stop eating. What's the difference between an eating disorder and disordered eating? As with many mental health topics, this question requires a nuanced approach and answer. To put it in simple terms, an eating disorder can interfere with a person's ability to take part in daily tasks. In other cases, disordered eating can exist. Sometimes, it does so in a quiet way. This is because eating habits and patterns don't have a strong impact on one's ability or desire to socialize, eat consistent meals, etc. So for example, someone with disordered eating may restrict their diet. Or, mindlessly eat between meals. On the other hand, someone with an eating disorder such as [Anorexia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591) or [Bulimia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615) may avoid attending dinner with friends or co-workers. They may do this because they're fearful of eating with others. And, not being able to exercise the same level of control, restriction, or binging, they would in private. How we support individuals navigating eating disorders and body image concerns - Some forms of eating disorder treatment have eating behaviors as the main focus.
