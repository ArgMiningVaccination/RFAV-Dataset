What is Acupuncture Therapy? Acupuncture therapy is a type of alternative medicine that involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the body to promote healing, relieve pain, and improve overall health. This ancient practice originated in China over 2,000 years ago and has since spread to other parts of the world, including the West. Acupuncture therapy is based on the concept of qi, or vital energy, which flows through the body along meridians or pathways. When these pathways become blocked or disrupted, it can result in pain, illness, and other health problems. Acupuncture therapy is believed to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by restoring balance to the flow of qi. It can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including chronic pain, headaches, anxiety, and depression, among others. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner will assess the patient's condition and insert needles into specific points on the body, leaving them in place for a period of time. The number and frequency of treatments needed will depend on the individual patient and their specific health concerns.
