Chronic low back pain is one of the most frequently experienced neuromuscular ailments in all communities. In Europe and America, 80% of adults experience significant back pain during their lifetime [ [2](#B2-medicines-02-00287), [3](#B3-medicines-02-00287)]. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of affected adults develop symptoms of chronic lower back pain [ [4](#B4-medicines-02-00287)]. There are many causes of LBP some of which have definite pathology, like spinal injuries, infection, degenerative arthritis and tumors. Others have obscure pathology not revealed even after long clinical courses. Presumably early or preclinical stages of pathological changes might remain obscure even after standard clinical investigations [ [5](#B5-medicines-02-00287), [6](#B6-medicines-02-00287), [7](#B7-medicines-02-00287)]. [13](#B13-medicines-02-00287)]. Probably because of this background, studies on LBP in the last decades have excluded cases of worker's compensations [ [14](#B14-medicines-02-00287)]. [8](#B8-medicines-02-00287)]. This could be the commonest cases of Back Pain 3.1. Acupuncture [25](#B25-medicines-02-00287)]. [26](#B26-medicines-02-00287)]. Electrical stimulation for control of pain is often employed, which later develop as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) [ [26](#B26-medicines-02-00287)]. Since the endorsement of acupuncture treatment as an effective option for pain control in the US, acupuncture has become popular [ [27](#B27-medicines-02-00287)]. [28](#B28-medicines-02-00287)]. Lehmann, et al., conducted a trial to assess the efficacy of TENS and electro-acupuncture (EAP) in the rehabilitation of chronic back pain patients of the fifty-four patients treated in a three-week inpatient rehabilitation program. The EAP group consistently demonstrated greater improvement on the outcome measures than the other treatment groups [ [29](#B29-medicines-02-00287)]. [30](#B30-medicines-02-00287)]. The evidence suggested that acupuncture is more useful for pain relief and functional improvement when used in conjunction with other conventional therapies than either conventional therapies or acupuncture alone. The overall observation was that acupuncture may be useful as either a unique therapy for chronic LBP or an adjunct therapy to other conventional treatments. [31](#B31-medicines-02-00287), [32](#B32-medicines-02-00287), [33](#B33-medicines-02-00287)]. Recent studies using functional MRI indicated that specific regions of the brain could be activated during procedures of acupuncture [ [34](#B34-medicines-02-00287)]. Acupuncture has been the most popular form of complementary, alternative treatment in modern hospitals and clinics, especially among pain teams [ [35](#B35-medicines-02-00287)] and expectedly, will become more accepted in the following days. [33](#B33-medicines-02-00287)]. 3.2. Manipulative Treatment - - Uncomplicated low back pain (lumbago) - - Sciatica without neurological deficit - - Uncomplicated chronic low back pain - - Post-surgical chronic low back pain - - Intervertebral disc degeneration - - Posterior facet syndrome - - Sacroiliac syndrome - - Sacroiliac strain - - Piriformis syndrome - - Psoas syndrome - - Spondylolisthesis Grade 1,2 [36](#B36-medicines-02-00287)]. His conclusion, that chronic pain was less responsive than acute pain, is not surprising. He did, however, claim that 71% of patients classified as having uncomplicated chronic LBP showed improvement of their symptoms. Similarly, Riches claimed that 86% of patients diagnosed as having chronic back strain improved following manipulation [ [37](#B37-medicines-02-00287)]. [36](#B36-medicines-02-00287), [37](#B37-medicines-02-00287), [38](#B38-medicines-02-00287)]. [39](#B39-medicines-02-00287)], although his expectation has never been confirmed with modern imaging techniques. On the other hand, Kirkaldy-Willis and Cassidy were unimpressed with the results of manipulation in patients with demonstrable nucleus pulposis herniation [ [40](#B40-medicines-02-00287)]. [41](#B41-medicines-02-00287)]. Experts on manipulation place a great deal of emphasis on the analysis of sacroiliac motion and position and choose their manipulation technique according to these findings. They believed that manipulation is the most effective method of treatment for sacroiliac syndrome [ [42](#B42-medicines-02-00287)]. [43](#B43-medicines-02-00287)]. These experts made it quite clear that no claim should be made on any structural correction. Instead, they speculated that in most cases, the spondylolisthesis could be an incidental finding. 3.3. Natural Healing [44](#B44-medicines-02-00287), [45](#B45-medicines-02-00287), [46](#B46-medicines-02-00287)]. [47](#B47-medicines-02-00287)]. When the contents of the chained physical activities are analyzed, three major components become obvious. 3.3.1. Stretching 3.3.2. Respiratory Control [48](#B48-medicines-02-00287)]. 3.3.3. Meditation [49](#B49-medicines-02-00287)]. [50](#B50-medicines-02-00287)]. 3.3.4. Anatomical and Physiological Basis of Stretching in Relation to Pain Control [51](#B51-medicines-02-00287)]. The network of soft tissues allows the free gliding of adjacent structures, as well as helping the transfer of forces between them. Neurologically, the stimulation of the proprioceptive receptors initiate coordinating messages to the joints and muscles involved. Mechanically, the interconnections between the separate muscles and muscle groups help to maintain an ideal sharing of loading and stretching activities. On the cardio-vascular side, it has been a well-established fact that limb muscle contractions constitute a \"second cardiac pump\" [ [52](#B52-medicines-02-00287)]. [8](#B8-medicines-02-00287)]. New explanatory models for the generation of low back pain are now recognized: from Panjabi's proposal that repetitive stress in spinal ligaments and facet joint capsules could induce dysfunction of muscle control which may lead to chronic pain and neural inflammation [ [4](#B4-medicines-02-00287)], to pain-related fear inducing a cycle of decreased movement, connective tissue remodeling of lumbar fascial tissues, leading to more inflammation, nervous system sensitization, and more pain. Mechanical stimulation, such as physical therapy, massage, chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture, or by changing specific movement patterns (e.g., movement therapies, yoga), and most notably stretching, may help to reverse the abnormalities. [53](#B53-medicines-02-00287)]. Patients should realize that myofascial release can be self-administered through repetitive slow stretching activities. 4.
