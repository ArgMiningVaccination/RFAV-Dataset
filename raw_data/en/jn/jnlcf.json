Never before have we been so focused on directly advancing human health. From larger, community-based research programs to microbiological investigations, we have an energized, dedicated research community. As you'll read in these pages, our investigators are passionate about their work, bringing vital insight to their study designs and health discoveries. This energy is properly guided by the UNM Health Sciences Center's Vision 2020, which establishes clear educational, clinical and research goals for the next decade. Adopted in 2010, Vision 2020 is the template for the first academ-ic health center strategic plan that focuses on improving a state population's health and health equity as a measure of the institution's success. Accordingly, all HSC colleges, schools, departments and programs have incorporated mea-sures to improve the health of New Mexico into their annual performance. Vision 2020 is an ambitious and worthy pursuit, to which no other academic health center has committed. We are using evidencebased interventions and evidence-informed policy to build on successful programs and pilots, while aligning existing resources to address community health priorities. The HSC research enterprise is a significant player in our Vision 2020 strategy. Four years into our strategic plan, we are engaging whole communities in developing their own health solutions through our well-established statewide clinical research programs. The Health Sciences Center's research enterprise will continue dissecting the most prevalent diseases in our time, from cancer to diabetes, through team science, institutional collaborations and funding partnerships that sharpen our focus on improving the health of New Mexicans and populations throughout the world.2 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 3 Richard Larson, MD, PhD From the executive v ice c hancellor and v ice c hancellor F or r esearch The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is thriving in an increas- ingly challenging biomedical research landscape, having attracted a record $149.8 million in extramural funding for Fiscal Year 2013. Our faculty and staff tirelessly pursue scientific advances to improve New Mexicans' lives in line with our Vision 2020 strategic plan. They collaborate across disciplines to carry out participatory, clinical and basic research, while benefiting from strong state - wide community partnerships. The Clinical and Translational Science Center remains central to the HSC research effort. Since opening in 2010, the center has sped the dissemination of research into clinical practice, directly accounting for more than $73 million of new ex-tramural funding (including more than $26 million in grants resulting from $2.8 million in pilot funding). Thanks to this success, the CTSC has supported more than 100 clinical trials for the treatment of asthma, diabetes, obesity, brain trauma, stroke, cystic fibrosis and other diseases. It also leads regional scientific consortia and recently won a $20.2 million grant to build biomedical research throughout the Mountain West. The CTSC's Community Engagement Research Core has supported more than 30 community-based research projects, including a recent programmatic grant in southern New Mexico to examine best practices for rural clinics. The UNM Cancer Center is New Mexico's only National Cancer Institute-desig- nated facility, with 90 board-certified oncology physicians and 126 cancer re - searchers who are recognized for their work in women's cancers, leukemia and radioisotopes. The the Cancer Center also has a significant economic impact and has been involved in several new patents and biotech startup companies related to cancer care. Other new research centers, programs and laboratories have fostered a nurturing environment for HSC investigators. I invite you to continue reading about the im-portant questions we're asking and the solutions our scientists are formulating.4 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Nancy Ridenour, PhD, RN, APRN, BC, FAAN From the dean o F the c ollege o F n ursing The College of Nursing's research and service grants and contracts continued to grow during the past fiscal year. The College historically has focused its re - search and service projects on promoting health and preventing disease, while helping patients and families manage illnesses. Much of our work has been community based, centered on improving health outcomes for vulnerable pop - ulations and reducing health disparities. The College also leads in health policy research, analysis and advocacy to create interdisciplinary solutions to urgent health care and health policy problems. While these priorities continue to be the cornerstone of our research, we are building on our strengths to develop our capacity in new areas, such as dissem-ination and implementation science. The College is working in interdisciplinary research teams to promote the adoption of evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines and develop new partnerships with industry, regional and national organizations and government. This model of collaborative research and ser - vice will grow in coming years as we work with our colleagues and partners to address important New Mexico health priorities. The College also leverages its expertise in focusing on research that includes outcomes relevant to patients. This translational approach - developing and delivering health solutions directly to patients and communities - better posi-tions the College to respond to the growing national emphasis on patient-cen-tered outcomes research.4 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 5 Lynda S. Welage, PharmD, FCCP From the dean o F the c ollege o F Pharmacy The UNM College of Pharmacy takes pride in the breadth of its research and its funding success. College faculty members have an excellent track record in securing extramural research funding in toxicology, pharmacology, pharma-ceutical sciences, clinical sciences, pharmaceutical care and outcomes research. The College's environmental health and radiopharmaceutical development programs have long garnered national recognition, and the College's clinical research initiative is experiencing rapid growth. Despite the federal budget sequestration, research grants and contracts awarded to faculty members this year exceeded $5.6 million - an impressive 64 percent increase in extramural funding over the previous year. Moreover, in its most recent annual research performance rankings, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ranked UNM 27th in total funding and 30th in NIH funding among 129 US colleges of pharmacy. Given the challenging funding environment, the College recognizes that inter-disciplinary scientific collaborations are integral to securing increased federal funding. It has devoted significant resources to supporting team sci-ence collaborations while cultivating areas of excellence. The College launched its \"Request-for-Proposals Intramural Pilot Funding Initiative\" to stimulate the formation of interdisciplinary teams and increase success rates for extramural applications, large-scale NIH programmatic grant awards and other high-im-pact outcomes. The College also continues to facilitate research mentorship by providing research and grant writing workshops to new and junior faculty. The College recognizes the importance of translational research, which spans the continuum from bench research involving drug target identification and drug discovery to clinical research, health outcomes and policy research. This positions it at the forefront of interdisciplinary translational research, poised to expand its research efforts. 6 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Thomas Williams, MD From the executive v ice dean o F the s chool o F m edicine The UNM School of Medicine has been exploring ways to improve human health through biomedical research since its founding nearly 50 years ago. Faculty members conduct a broad range of research, from cell- and ani-mal-based laboratory studies to patient-oriented, community engaged clinical investigations. The research interests of the school's 950 faculty members are closely aligned with the Health Sciences Center's six signature programs: brain and behavioral illness, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, child health, environmen-tal health services and infectious diseases and immunity. Our scientists also focus on population health, comparative effectiveness research, advanced microscopy, molecular screening for drugs, the neurosci-ences, immunology and cell biology. This research, conducted by interdisci-plinary teams, has substantially improved health in New Mexico and through-out the world. The faculty regularly collaborate with our major centers, UNM's Clinical and Translational Science Center and the Cancer Center, as well as our programs in spatiotemporal modeling, human papillomavirus research, the statewide ECHO Program, numerous neurosciences programs and many others. This flexible, focused approach addresses New Mexico's unique multicultural health needs while making significant contributions to improving global human health. The School of Medicine is thus well-positioned to compete for and conduct biomedical research studies to improve the health and quality of life for all.6 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 7 Principal Investigator Annette Crisanti, PhD, Research Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry Grant Name Patient-Centered Trauma Treatment for PTSD and Substance Abuse: Is it an Effective Treatment Option? Grantor Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) When Alex Romero, a recovering heroin addict, came to the Inside Out peer treat - ment program in Espa\u00f1ola two years ago, it was so beneficial that he became a peer specialist to help others. Success stories like his encourage UNM psychiatric epidemiologist Annette Crisanti, who is studying the benefits of using peers in mental health clinical settings. \"It's therapeutic to have a peer work with you - someone who really knows what you've been through, \" says Crisanti, who is testing whether peers can deliver \"Seeking Safe - ty, \" an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy model, to combat trauma and substance abuse. Crisanti is partnering with The Life Link, a Santa Fe non-profit that provides thera- pists for the control group, and Inside Out, which recruits participants and peers. Effective treatment is badly needed in Rio Arriba County, which has one of the high-est drug-induced death rates in the nation - 62 per 100,000 people - and a shortage of mental health providers. Kathy Sutherland-Bruaw founded Inside Out because she grew frustrated seeing people fall through the cracks. \"Based on my own life experiences, I wanted to bring much-needed resources to this community, \" she says. \"My hope is that people who are addicted to drugs can learn how to cope. \" For Romero, being a peer counselor is an opportunity to change the future. \"Addic - tion and trauma can be intergenerational, and this is a great opportunity to break the chain, \" he says. \"I am so glad we can offer this program free to our community. \" can Peer s deliver treatment For addiction and t rauma? 8 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER When Donna Seagrave was diagnosed with multiple scle - rosis more than two decades ago, there were no approved disease-modifying drugs for the condition. \"I experienced my first episode in 1991 - numbness in my right leg, \" she says, \"but I wasn't diagnosed until a year later when the right side of my body went to mush. \" Seagrave, who recently started a new medication that enabled her to walk for the first time in 15 years, believes in the value of research. \"Research is the thing that's going to help us stop MS in its tracks, \" she says. \"There used to be no hope for people with this disease. There are now 10 drugs that can treat it. \" She is participating in a study led by Dr. Corey Ford, who has been studying and treating the disease for more than two decades. Ford says MS patients develop brain lesions that can cause memory loss, weakness or vision problems. \"Usually, MS begins with 'attacks' of a symptom, \" he says. \"Then, over weeks or months, it gets better. If they don't recover completely, they may be left with a disability that could accumulate over time. \" New neuroimaging technologies like magnetoencepha- lography (MEG) have greatly enhanced researchers' ability to understand how MS affects the brain. \"MEG shows both where the brain is activated and the timing while a per - son is performing a specific task, \" Ford says. \"It will help us answer many questions, like, 'When did some part of the brain turn on? When did it communicate? Is it slow? Is it abnormal? Is it improving?'\" Regaining the ability to walk has given Seagrave renewed optimism. \"It was very exciting for me, \" she says. \"I always thought MS was a downhill trajectory. Instead, I'm improv - ing. I think I'll really have a future. \" Principal Investigator Corey C.

The MEG shows, in real time, which parts of the brain respond to various tasks. Yellow indicates greater activity, for longer periods of time. The brain responds in the same way to simple tasks for people with and without MS (1). When presented with a complex task, the brains of healthy people respond normally (1); however, people with MS require more brain activity for longer amounts of time (2).how d oes mul ti P le s clerosis aFF ect the Brain?

That's why Jim Liu and his research team are looking for ways to expand the three-hour window after a stroke's onset to administer the most effective treatment to protect brain tissue. \"Stroke activates a molecular process that degrades the blood vessel - what we call the blood-brain barrier, \" Liu explains. An FDA-approved drug called tissue plasmino - gen activator (tPA) counteracts ischemic stroke by dissolving the clot that caused the attack, so blood can resume flowing into the brain. However, if a patient gets to the hospital after three hours, tPA can't be used, be - cause it may cause the blood vessel to become leaky and hemorrhage, Liu says. So while tPA is very effective in preventing permanent damage, the majority of patients don't get to the hospital in time to receive it. The window for tPA effectiveness is more variable under some circumstances, Liu says. Some patients could safely receive the drug up to six hours after a stroke, but doctors err on the side of caution because there is currently no way to know the actual progression of blood vessel damage. Liu and his team are developing a kit that can be used by any hospital to immediate - ly evaluate vessel health. Expanding the number of patients treated with tPA could dramatically alter the impact of stroke - the fourth leading cause of death and a major cause of adult disability. \"This project is derived from a network of expertise, \" Liu says. \"We are now transforming this knowledge into something tangible and clinically useful that can touch peoples' lives. \" can w e ex Pand the w indow oF oPP ortunity For treating stroke Patients?

Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecologic cancer, often spreading throughout the body before being diagnosed. Moreover, 70 to 80 percent of women who undergo surgery and chemotherapy will experience a recurrence within a year. HSC researchers Angela Wandinger-Ness and Laurie Hudson have discovered a potential therapy for ovar - ian cancer in the form of ketorolac, a commonly used anti-inflammatory drug with chemical properties similar to aspirin or ibuprofen. They study GTPases, enzymes that act like switches to turn cellular activity on and off. \"Sometimes the switch can go awry, turning on or off inappropriately, and result in disease, \" explains Wandinger-Ness. \"With ovarian can-cer, the switch is always on. \" In the lab, she says, ketoro - lac acts as a monkey wrench, gumming up the switch and hindering the spread of ovarian cancer. They are now working with gynecologic oncologist Dr. Carolyn Muller on a preliminary trial testing the drug's effects in ovarian cancer patients. \"The beauty of ketoro - lac is that its indication is post-operative pain manage - ment, \" says Muller, who administers the drug to women who have just undergone ovarian tumor surgery. \"So, while giving the drug for its intended purpose, we have the ability to see how it's distributed and its effects. \" The team hopes this study will soon lead to a new clinical trial to delay or stop the recurrence of ovarian cancer. \"This project is a result of the highly collabora-tive environment at UNM, \" Hudson says. The study's suc - cesses so far include the development of new research paradigms that might lead to cures for other diseases, she says. \"The richness of the ideas and the ability to problem-solve in a different way has been so rewarding. \"A grant to study genetic links between generationsof Alzheimer's sufferers Principal Investigators Laurie Hudson, PhD, Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy; Angela Wandinger-Ness, PhD, Professor of Pathology, School of Medicine Grant Name Inhibition of Small GTPases as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Ovarian Cancer Grantors Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, Department of Defense Cells on a chip.

Finding better treatments requires a deeper un-derstanding of what goes wrong in leukemia cells, then using that information to design precision therapies. \"The human genome is complicated - even more so in leu- kemia cells than normal cells, \" explains molecular geneticist Scott Ness. \"That's what we're trying to understand. \" Ness and his team are studying human genes in much greater detail than ever before. They're learning more about how genes produce intermediate molecules called RNAs, which through a complicated process called alter-native RNA splicing, can cause dangerous mutations. \"Leukemias have more alternative RNA splicing and make many more types of RNA than normal cells, \" Ness says. \"We're trying to understand what goes wrong with this process and how this alternative splicing is import - ant to the disease process. \" This is an ambitious project, with a large team of inves- tigators performing genome sequencing and advanced data analysis. \"This alternative splicing could just be a side effect of being a leukemia cell, \" Ness says, \"or it could be a fundamental part of what makes a leukemia cell bad. \" If it isn't just a side effect, there might be potential benefits for leukemia patients, Ness says. Cancer could be caught sooner, and new drugs could be developed that target this process before it spins out of control. Principal Investigator Scott A.

Dr. Arup Das asks him to look up, then down and asks how his eye is doing. Then, as Gonzales reclines on a bed, Das leans over with a syringe and care - fully delivers an injection directly into his right eye. Diagnosed with diabetes in 1995, Gonzales moved to Albuquerque from Roswell a year ago to be close to Das for regular treatments. He couldn't have placed himself in better hands. Chief ophthalmologist Das and basic scientist Paul McGuire are partnering to find a cure for blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy, which threatens the 19.7 million Americans (and 150,000 New Mexicans) living with diabetes. Ten to 15 years after a diabetes diagnosis, patients devel- op retinopathy, which causes blood vessels to leak into the light-sensitive central rear portion of the eye, called the macula. This causes macular edema (swelling) and gradual vision loss. Current treatment options include injections or laser therapy. Gonzales has received both within the past year. \"The results are tremendous, \" he says. \"My right eye couldn't see anything, and now I can see about 10 feet in front of me. \" The injectable drug targets VEGF, one of several mole - cules in the eye that contributes to this leakage. \"VEGF has been extensively studied, but isn't the optimal target for treatment, \" Das explains. \"The effect of these drugs is transient. Some patients you have to inject for months, years even. If you stop injections, leakage may come back. Many don't respond to treatment at all and the edema remains persistent. \" McGuire says he and Das have found great advantages in their partnership of 15 years. \"Das brings the clinical view, \" he says. \"I bring in basic science. Together, we move forward more quickly. \" The pair discovered other molecules play a prominent role in diabetic retinopathy, one of which is CCL-2, which attracts white blood cells that infiltrate the retina. is there a wa y to reverse vision loss in dia Betes?

One way to tackle this problem is through telemedicine, which Das and colleagues have begun using to ex - pand retinopathy screening and treatment for patients throughout the state. Meanwhile, Das sees a pressing need for new drug interventions. \"I get frustrated, \" he says. \"I keep injecting patients. Some respond and some don't. I'm looking forward to a day when there is a drug that's effective that everyone will respond to, and I can see patients get better again. \" While Das and McGuire seek new treatments, Das offers some wise advice: \"The most important way to prevent blindness is through diet and controlling blood sugar, blood pressure and blood cholesterol. If a patient doesn't control their diabetes, treatments will be ineffective. \" Gonzales agrees. \"If you're diagnosed with diabetes, get on a strict diet immediately, \" he says. \"I never did that. I thought meds would take care of my diabetes, but here I am. Now I'm taking care of myself and eating well, and my eyes are improving. \" (Left) In diabetes, the blood vessels in the retina leak resulting in edema of the macula, and causing distortion and central vision loss. (Inset) New vessels in the retina lead to hemorrhage in the eye that results in floaters and severe vision loss.

Imagine doing this three days a week . . . for the rest of your life. Chronic kidney disease, a near certainty for people with untreated diabetes, commits sufferers to a lifetime of dialysis. At Zuni Pueblo, where kidney disease is a serious health challenge, Raj Shah has spent the last 16 years help - ing people avoid that fate through community-based prevention in collaboration with the Zuni tribal admin-istration, Indian Health Services and other Zuni health programs. Now, he is training health representatives to monitor diabetes and kidney disease patients in their homes and promote healthier dietary and lifestyle choices. \"These representatives are Zuni, understand the cul-ture, and speak the language, \" Shah says. \"Participants will choose their own treatment options and the repre - sentatives will help them achieve their goals. \" Zunis are 18.5 times more likely to develop chronic kidney disease than Caucasians and 5.3 times more likely than other Native Americans. Once Zunis develop kidney disease, they reach the point of needing dialysis much faster. And dialysis is the only option - it's against traditional beliefs to receive a kidney transplant. Eileen Lois Tzunie joined Shah's program four years ago when she was diagnosed with diabetes. \"I learned not to eat junk food and sweets, \" she says. \"I also exercise as much as possible and take my medication. Right now, I'm doing good. \" While there is no absolute solution to avoid dialysis, Shah says, if you do everything possible to be healthy, you will likely be able to live a longer, happier life. \"am a vision to help all human beings!\")A grant to study genetic links between generationsof Alzheimer's sufferers Principal Investigator Vallabh (Raj) Shah, PhD, FASN, Professor and Senior Fellow, NM-CARES-HD, Department of Biochemistry and Internal Medicine Grant Name ACA Reducing Health Disparity in Chronic Kidney Disease in Zuni Indians Grantor Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)how d o i Prevent dial ysis i F i h ave dia Betes?

Fortunately, there are potent drugs that can help control symptoms, but until recently, little was known about the long-term health effects when used by children. Hengameh Raissy, who took part in the largest and longest prospective asthma study ever conducted, has found that these inhaled corticosteroids permanently stunted growth, leaving patients nearly half an inch shorter on average as adults. Raissy recently completed UNM's component of the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), which began in 1993 with approximately 1,000 children in the US and Canada, ages 5 to 12. These children received inhaled corticosteroids or a placebo for four years. The remainder of the study period consisted of follow-ups and observation. The study yielded 140 scholarly articles regarding environ- mental and genetic factors of asthma, which is the most common chronic health condition in children. Investigators examined how corticosteroids affect lung growth, eyes, bone density and more. A recent New England Journal of Medicine article from the study focused on height. \"We knew one side effect of corticosteroids was growth sup - pression, \" Raissy says, \"but it was thought a person would eventually 'catch up. ' We found there was no 'catch up, ' and patients were an average 1.1 centimeters shorter as adults. \" However, participants did experience more symp - tom-free days. \"There was a 40 percent decrease both in hospitalization and urgent care visits, \" Raissy says. \"If inhaled corticosteroids can prevent asthma symptoms, it's worth being 1.1 centimeters shorter. \" Marisa Wootton, who participated in CAMP from the age of 5 to 24, says her asthma was much worse when she was younger. \"My asthma is exercise induced, but I'm now able to control it, \" she says. Now a soccer coach, she says she recognizes symptoms of asthma in the kids she coaches. \"I teach them how to regulate their breathing so they don't have an attack. \" Principal Investigator Hengameh Raissy, PharmD, Associate Director, Clinical and Translational Sciences Center; School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pulmonology Grant Name CAMP Continuation Study (Phase III) Grantor NIH - National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute what are the lo ng- t erm eFF ects o F asthm a m edication on k ids? 16 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Fifteen-year-old Adam Myers loves to play basketball. Left to his own devices, in the summer months he will literally play all day and all night, until his mom makes him come inside and go to bed. But eight years ago, Adam became seriously ill and was admitted to UNM's Children's Hospital with a rare form of chronic kidney disease related to immune-system mal-function. That's when he met Craig Wong, a UNM kidney specialist who has been leading an international study of 1,400 young kidney patients like Adam. \"We want to find new cures and therapies for the kids I see in my clinic - that's what really drives me to do this science, \" says Wong. \"It's hard to say to a parent, 'Your child has chronic kidney disease and their kidneys are going to fail. We can slow it down, but eventually it's go - ing to lead to kidney failure and we'll have to talk about dialysis and transplant. '\" Adam was only 7 when he inexplicably fell ill. \"At first, doctors kept saying that he just had a virus, \" remembers his mother, Delilah Myers. \"But then he got worse - high fever, sore throat and really bad pain in his leg. \" Most children with kidney disease have it from birth. Sometimes the disease develops spontaneously, as it did for Adam, or is the result of an injury to the kidney. Currently, there is no way to stop its progression once the kidney is damaged. Adam and Delilah hope that by participating in research, future children with chronic kidney disease will have more options. Under Wong's direction, UNM is part of Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD), a nationwide network that seeks to more fully understand pediatric kidney failure.

To conduct this type of ge - nomic analysis, he coordinated recruitment of 1,400 pa-tients from 55 clinics in the U.S. and 33 clinics in Europe. Adam, his family and his team of doctors have been battling his kidney disease for many years. He even-tually needed treatment for kidney failure through the UNM Pediatric Dialysis program and recently had a kidney transplant performed at the UNM Children's Hospital in collaboration with the hospital's Kidney Transplant Services. Delilah is the donor - she jokes now about how he recovered much more quickly from the surgery than she did. Adam's enthusiasm for playing basketball sometimes makes her and his coach nervous (he wears a special belt to protect his new kidney), but Adam doesn't worry much or let the disease get in his way. 18 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Every day, each of us breathes in dangerous toxins like carbon monoxide, ground-level ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. That troubles Matthew Campen, who's been studying such common pollutants as engine exhaust and wood, coal and tobacco smoke since 1991. Campen knows these toxins cause serious damage to the human body beyond the lungs. \"Air pollution is associated not just with respiratory diseases, but also cardiovascular disease, \" he says. \"Epidemiological studies have long shown that there are increased cardiovascular deaths on bad air pollution days. But it's unclear why something you breathe in - that doesn't really physically get past the lungs - causes vascular disease. \" So Campen and his team are digging deeper. \"From a pub - lic health standpoint, it's important that we learn more about how the everyday pollutants we're all exposed to affect us and remain aware that highway-related emis-sions are still a significant health problem, \" he says.Campen suspects that when we inhale air pollutants, potent particulates and gases somehow alter our blood chemistry, causing vascular inflammation. His team is in-vestigating the biological pathways these toxins exploit to access the vascular system, and ultimately how they lead to cardiovascular insult. \"We're taking what we're learning from air pollution and lung disease and linking it back to coronary artery disease, \" he explains. \"I'm a discovery person - I look for the 'eureka' moment, \" Campen says. \"I live for designing studies where we have a hypothesis, we do an experiment and we prove it. Our big-gest challenge is to ensure that what we see at the molecu-lar level is actually something that translates to humans. \" Studies have shown that when an air pollutant bypasses the lungs to reach a blood vessel, it's not as damaging as when it is inhaled, Campen says. \"We've also discovered a blood-borne signal originating in the lung - but found outside of the lung - that causes inflammation in blood vessels and the brain. So there's something essential to various pollutants entering the lungs first. \"are lun gs a Pathway to card iovascular disea se? 18 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 19 Principal Investigator Matthew Campen, PhD, Associate Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences, UNM College of Pharmacy Grant Name Enhancement of Coronary Constriction by Organic Air Toxics Grantor National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Campen believes that damaged proteins or fragments of proteins he calls \"molecular shrapnel\" are formed following exposure to toxic pollutants. When they breach the lungs and enter the blood stream, the cells lining the blood vessels become irritated. \"They think the molecular shrapnel is a sign of damage, \" he says, \"so they respond appropriately with inflammation, which can contribute to long-term heart disease. \" No single chemical in air pollution appears to be re - sponsible, Campen says. \"When gaseous and particulate portions of exhaust combine, gases adhere to particles, which seems to make it more toxic to the cardiovascular system, \" he says. \"We need to know which pollutants are most potent, how they affect other parts of the body, and which people are most susceptible. \" The good news, Campen says, is that the health risks from air pollution can be reduced. \"Try not to locate or exer-cise in industrial areas or near transportation corridors, \" he suggests. Genetics and nutrition also play a role. \"We think that polyunsaturated fats already present in the lungs help protect the lungs and body from generating these 'molecular shrapnel' - these fragments of proteins, \" he says. \"So a diet of polyunsaturated fats is good for our lungs. Vitamin C also is a great defense for your lungs. \" Cross-sectional slices of aortas reveal an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), shown in red, following exposure to a combination of gasoline and diesel emissions. MMP9 is an enzyme known to cause the growth of atherosclerotic plaques, which are central to major heart diseases and stroke.

From 1944 to 1986, some four million tons of uranium ore were mined within the Navajo Nation, leaving behind more than 500 abandoned mines, 1,100 abandoned waste sites and a legacy of environmental contamination. UNM researcher Johnnye Lewis is leading an investigation of its generational impacts on the health of Navajo mothers and babies. Lewis previously has shown a link between uranium-contaminated water and soil and high rates of kidney disease in Navajo communities. With the Navajo Birth Cohort Study, she is examining whether contamination relates to reproductive outcomes, congenital disorders and developmental disabilities. \"The Navajo Birth Cohort Study developed out of these earlier initiatives because people wanted to know how this contamination is affecting their children, \" Lewis says. She and her team are recruiting 1,500 mother/baby pairs from six regional medical centers in the Navajo Nation. Pregnant women provide urine and blood samples and their babies are later monitored for a year to assess growth and developmental progress. Study coordinators also conduct home environmental assessments with families and provide referrals for such needs as prenatal care and developmental disability services. The study is a collaboration between the Navajo Nation, federal agencies, Navajo community health workers and UNM researchers. Anna Rondon, a project manager with the Navajo Division of Health, believes that the study is a critical step in build-ing research capacity and influencing health policy. \"This project is very historic for Navajo and indigenous people across the world, \" she says. \"Navajo women are now conducting research, and health providers are asking questions about environmental contaminants. We want to find healing. We want to find the monster and rename it, and obliterate the diseases from uranium mining. \" Principal Investigator Johnnye Lewis, PhD, Research Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy Photo: Malcolm Benally20 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 21 Principal Investigator Vojo Deretic, PhD, Chair and Professor, Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology Grant Name Pattern Recognition Receptors and Autophagy in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Control in AIDS; Autophagy as a Cell-Autonomous Mechanism of HIV Control (Phase II GCE) Grantors NIH - NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation how can w e Power- uP o ur immune systems F rom the i nside? Autophagy is nature's way of cleaning house. Tiny, autonomous vacuum cleaners zip around inside a cell, ingesting bits and pieces of worn-out proteins, malfunctioning parts and invading microorganisms. Scientists have begun to decipher this extraordi-nary process, and are coming to understand how vital autophagy is to human health. Vojo Deretic and postdoctoral fellows Michael Mandell and Santosh Chauhan are trying to harness the power of this innate immunity as a therapy for a variety of diseases. Deretic and his team have launched interrelated projects to discover how to encourage autophagy to treat people with dual HIV and Mycobacterium tubercu-losis infections. It's a deadly disease combination, because people with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to TB's most severe effects. TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, with co-infection most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging strains of drug-resistant TB are on the rise, further reducing the options available to treat these patients. Mandell and Chauhan have isolated autophagy-specific proteins and molecules that are part of a complex intracellu-lar communication system responsible for making things happen inside the cell. With this new understanding, the team is usings high-tech molecular equipment and computational tools to search for FDA-approved drugs that might encourage autophagy to fight infection in a clinical setting. \"Every pathogen has its own story - they become so specialized, \" says Deretic, who began his research career in developmental biology studying sea urchins. \"With autophagy, what you have is a general answer to many different questions. That's the beauty of it for me. \" Featured on http://vimeo.com/hsctv/dereticSource: Deretic, J Man\" pillow22 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Principal Investigator Tudor I.

Tudor Oprea spends his days searching for needles in haystacks. As futile as that sounds, he loves the challenge and teamwork that come with seeking elusive new applications for existing medicines. \"On average, it takes about 10 to 15 years and up to $2 billion to put a new drug on the market, \" Oprea says. \"Academia can't afford that, so we use ingenuity and adap - tive performance to seek new uses for already approved drugs. \" As chief informaticist for the UNM Center for Molecular Discovery, Oprea leads a team that manages the hundreds of terabytes of data accumulated from chemical library screening the center has conducted over the past decade. His primary data source is the high-throughput flow cytometer, invented by center director Dr. Larry Sklar. This advanced instrument runs thousands of cytometric assays per hour in search of a yet-unidentified puzzle piece that might reveal new treatments for can-cers, infections or other diseases. Oprea's team also is using virtual screening, a computer-based method of formulat - ing hypotheses, to focus on products that have been on pharmacy and even grocery store shelves for years. \"We're covering about 50,000 FDA-approved drugs, which contain about 1,600 ac - tive pharmaceutical ingredients, \" Oprea says. \"We're rapidly sifting through immense data sets, evaluating their impact on cells - and even whole biological systems - and comparing that information with knowledge distilled from indications, off-label prescription use and adverse event reports. \" Housed in the newly renovated Innovation, Discovery and Training Complex, Oprea's computers are constantly humming as he and his team continue the search for new uses for already approved therapeutics, awaiting the flash of insight that comes with discovery.

An innovative new partnership between UNM's College of Nursing and the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System will help meet the health care needs of the state's veterans for decades to come. The College was one of only six schools chosen to participate in the prestigious Veterans Affairs Nursing Academy Partnership (VANAP) program, which will fund an expansion of the nursing workforce, from faculty to students to practitioners. It will allow the College to increase undergraduate nursing enrollment, faculty and clinical placement with an emphasis on the bachelor of science in nursing degree (BSN). An additional eight students will be admitted each fall, and 16 additional students each spring over the next four years, for a total of 96 new nurses funded by the grant. \"Veterans comprise nearly 20 percent of New Mexico's population, \" says Nancy Morton, undergraduate program director in the College and VANAP co-director. \"This partnership will significantly advance care for our veterans statewide, as we develop clinical sites to prepare nurses for the future of health care delivery. \" \"Educating a high-quality workforce in veteran-centric care is a challenge, \" adds Cynthia Nuttall, RN, New Mexico VA Health Care System associate chief of nursing for professional practice and VANAP co-director. \"This grant allows us to increase our BSN-prepared nurses throughout New Mexico who are knowledgeable regarding veterans' specific health care needs. \" Cynthia Nuttall and Nancy Morton24 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Poor oral health has been linked to a host of health prob - lems, such as heart disease and diabetes, yet too many New Mexicans fail to receive routine preventive dental care.UNM and community health providers have teamed up to address this problem by incorporating oral health into a team-based primary care setting. Patients receiving an exam at the El Pueblo Health Services Clinic in Bernalillo, NM, are seen by a primary care physician, a dentist and a nurse practitioner, says Peter Jensen, director of UNM's Advanced Education in General Dentistry residency program. \"We're finding it's a good dynamic to have all of the prac - titioners in the room, \" Jensen says. \"We're really starting to feed off one another as we focus on wellness checks for diabetics, pregnant moms and kids. \" The program, implemented with the help of a grant and faculty from the College of Nursing and the School of Medicine's Department of Dental Medicine, relies on CAMBRA (Carries Management by Risk Assessment), a tool dentists use to assess cavity and gum disease risk. \"CAMBRA is becoming part of our physicals, regular exams, wellness checks and so forth, \" says Rick Adesso, El Pueblo's executive director. \"So we have our primary care physicians and nurse practitioners looking closer for oral health problems. \" Principal Investigator Nancy Ridenour, PhD, RN, APRN, BC, FAAN, Professor and Dean, College of Nursing Grant Name Innovation in Primary Care Oral Health: Interprofessional Team Practice/Model Grantor ACA - El Pueblo Health Service what can o ur mouths t ell u s a Bout o ur Bodies?

Anyone is eligible to receive services, and no one is denied care due to their inability to pay. \"We're not building a dental clinic within a health clinic, \" says project director Barbara Overman. \"This is an effort at integrating two historically independent health care services. \" El Pueblo patient Connie Welsh said the experience has been eye-opening. \"I'd been going to the emergency room for the pain in my mouth, \" Welsh says. \"I definitely learned more about what's happening, and have been going to Pima Medical Institute for more regular clean-ings and work. \" Improving New Mexicans' oral health is likely to pay off in the long run. More than 37 percent of the state's third graders have untreated tooth decay, while only 64 percent of state residents have had their teeth cleaned in the past year. Six months into the grant, this diverse health team has developed an unexpected symbiosis. \"This is an exciting approach to improving patients' overall health, \" Over - man says. \"We're developing these collegial relationships among professionals of differing disciplines, and we're all expanding our knowledge base. We want to improve our patients' care and train others to do the same. We have an opportunity to put out the best care possible. \"The team hopes its work will become a model for rural areas where dental services are in short supply. They're also incorporating it into curricula in the College of Nurs-ing, says Dean Nancy Ridenour, the project's principal investigator. \"As frontline practitioners begin to integrate oral care into their services, they'll have yet another part of the body that speaks to patient health, \" she says. 26 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Left-to-right: Corey Ford, MD, ex cellence in r esearch aw ards The Fifth Annual Research Day Awards Ceremony was held October 16, 2013, in Domenici Center Auditorium.

Wilson takes special pleasure in viewing the extraordinary images of cells produced in her lab with electron micros-copy and live-cell imaging techniques. \"The world that we look at is really beautiful, \" she says. Sanjeev Arora, MD, FACP , FACG Clinical Science Research, 2012 Growing up in India, Sanjeev Arora trav-eled with his physician father to remote villages assisting in the government's eradication of smallpox. The poverty and social disparities shocked Arora, who would from that point forward commit his life to making a difference. Arora, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist, is the force behind Project ECHO, an innovative program that provides specialized medical expertise to people with complex illness-es living in rural areas. New Mexico's challenges in providing health care access to just more than two million people scattered across more than 121,000 square miles drew Arora to UNM from New England Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes) launched in 2004, using teleconferencing to help treat thousands of Hepatitis C patients throughout the state who couldn't get to Arora for badly needed treatment. ECHO has since expanded to include statewide specialty care for de-mentia, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, addiction, psychiatry, women's health and host of other maladies. Sarah Lathrop, DVM, PhD Population Science Research, 2012 As an epidemiologist for the Office of the Medical Investigator, Sarah Lathrop analyzes data and finds trends involving unexpected deaths in New Mexico, but her work has had significant benefits for the living. Michelle Barry Aurelius nominated her for this award for the impact her work has on New Mexicans: \"Without her in-vestigations, we would not have the data to prevent food-borne illnesses, protect our children from death and realize that New Mexico ranks No. 1 in prescription overdose deaths. \" Lathrop says, \"My greatest satisfaction is working with students - to see them understand that research is really worthwhile and achievable, \" she says. Lathrop grew up on a Wisconsin farm and pursued her lifelong dream of being a veterinarian. Taking opportunities as they came, she shifted careers and eventually ended up at UNM 10 years ago. When she's not busy analyzing data and mentoring students, she enjoys knitting, Irish step-dancing and traveling with her husband and 9-year-old son. Nikki Jernigan, PhD Junior Faculty Research, 2012 Nikki Jernigan's quiet demeanor be-lies her fierce determination to under-stand the molecular mechanisms that damage blood vessels in pulmonary hypertension. Her path to pulmonary circulation research has been as much circumstance as design. She grew up in a large, close-knit family near Grants, NM. From her family she learned the importance of education and the value of persistence. She often found herself in leadership positions at school through her involvement in student government and athlet-ics. Her first undergraduate research project gave her a taste for biological research. \"I'd never considered research as my career prior to that, \" Jernigan says. \"I was taking engineering courses along with biology courses, because my path just didn't seem very clear. \" Now a PhD researcher in UNM's Cell Biology Physiology lab, she finds the hunt for answers to be more compelling than ever. \"The excitement of discovery is exhilarating, \" Jernigan says. She feels the same outside the lab, when she's spend-ing time with her husband raising their two daughters.28 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER unm sc 1940s 1945 College of Pharmacy established.1954 Bernalillo County Indian Hospital (BCIH) opens.1964 UNM School of Medicine opens. 1975 UNM Cancer Research & Treatment Center opens.1972 First centralized radiopharmacy program established. 1977 UNM Medical Center established.1967 Basic Medical Sciences Building opens. 1968 BCIH is renamed Bernalillo County Medical Center, eventually to become UNM Hospital.1955 College of Nursing begins accepting students. 1950s1960s 1970s Juan NAVAJONATION McKinley Cibola Catron Grant Do\u00f1a Otero Eddy Lea Chaves Lincoln De Baca Roosevelt Guadalupe T orrance San Miguel Santa Fe Quay Curry Harding Union Colfax T aos Rio Arriba Sandoval Los Alamos Bernalillo Valencia Mora Health Extension Rural Oces Practice-Based Research NetworkProject ECHO Investigator-led Community-based Programs 31 Research in New Mexico, 201328 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER ANNUAL REpORT Of CONTRACTS AN d G RANTS , 2013 29 unm h ealth s ciences c enter research h ighlights and m ilestones 1982 Biomedical Research Building opens.2003 Research Incubator Building opens. 2005 UNM Cancer Center receives National Cancer Institute designation. 2009 UNM Cancer Center and clinical research facility opens. 2009 Neurobiology Research Facility construction completed.2008 Multidisciplinary Research Facility opens.2008 HSC receives grant for national Molecular Discovery Center.2010 Mountain West Research Consortium created.2010 CTSC building opens.2010 The Clinical and Translational Science Center receives NIH designation. 2012 Innovation, Discovery and Training Complex opens. 2012 Facility for Advanced Cell Engineering opens. 2013 Kidney Research Institute opens. 2013 Mountain West Research Consortium is fully recognized and funded by NIH.1994 Health Sciences Center created. 1998 Cancer Research Facility opens.1984 College of Pharmacy begins offering graduate degrees. 1986 The Center for Non-Invasive Diagnosis opens.1980s 2000s Clinical and Translational Science in the Western IDeA StatesMOUNTAIN WEST CONSORTIUMUNM Clinical and Translational Science Center UNM Hea Lt H Scie N ce S c e N ter aw ard S FY 94 -
