Each of these functions expresses seven types of energies, which manifest in our outward behaviour as dynamic, sensitive ... types of behaviour. If you are new to the seven types, I will recommend that you first read the introductory article: [The Seven Types](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/what-is-the-seven-types/), and the preceding article: [Psychoenergetics and The Seven Rivers of Life](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/integral-meditation-chapter-3/) [_____________________________________________](http://www.jivayou.com/en/)We have also created an [online typology profile](http://www.jivayou.com/en/) where you can discover your personality and [soul](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/soul/) type and receive an extensive report on how to develop your essential qualities as a human being. Visit the profile here. [www.jivayou.com/en/](http://www.jivayou.com/en/) ____________________________________________ By Kenneth S\u00f8rensen Your Energy Typology: Your Psychological and Spiritual DNA \"Energies radiate outwards from the personality as if from a great source of light; luminous rays shine out and pervade the atmosphere. This irradiation occurs spontaneously - I would almost say inevitably - and this explains the effect the mere [presence]of a person who has had transpersonal experiences has on those with whom he or she comes into contact.\" Roberto Assagioli, Transpersonal Development, p. 47-48 When I had come to understand the ray qualities of my Soul, my personality, feelings, body and [mind](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/mind/) - I felt I was in touch with something profound. I could see how understanding the ray qualities offered me an explanation for the good and the problematic aspects of my personality. For example, I used to get irritable if someone asked for a detailed explanation of something because it slowed down my mind. I assumed they were \"idiots\" and knew I had the right answer, even if I didn't. When facts showed that I was wrong I felt as if a natural law had been violated. I realised that my mental processes were dominated by the dynamic energy type (the river of will and power). The positive aspect of [the will](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/the-will/) is the ability to focus, to concentrate, to penetrate to the essence of things. Will helps us to define fundamental principles, to think abstractly and see the larger picture. Its negative qualities are arrogance, impatience and inflexibility. This mental type can be more or less balanced depending on the individual's level of awareness and his mind's developmental progress. The ability to turn what is immature in oneself into one's higher talents is crucial here. Much observation is needed to clarify the five different energies within the personality and Soul. We seldom distinguish between thought, feeling and bodily energies; they are often mixed up. It took me a lot of time to recognise my own energy type profile, a 2-6161 combination; this has been evaluated many times by my friends, colleagues and students. My Soul is influenced by the second ray of [love](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/love/)-wisdom, the sensitive energy type (2). My personality is dominated by the sixth ray, the dedicated energy type (6). My mind is dynamic (1), my feelings are dedicated (6) and my body is dynamic (1). So my energy type profile is 2-6161. This makes me a sensitive Soul endeavouring to express its qualities through a fiery and dedicated personality. There is a touch of humour: we can say that my soft wisdom-orientated Soul unfolds through a persona resembling a battle tank. My two dominating energy types move in opposite directions; no wonder my life has been a struggle against a tendency to isolate myself. My first and sixth ray [typology](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/typology/) also gives me endurance and a will to experience [freedom](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/freedom/). Knowing my typology helps me accept my DNA on all [levels](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/levels/), and to realise my inherent potential. It highlights the qualities I need to develop for my psychological make-up to become whole. Our primary energy types warrant a great deal of focus in our meditations because they are what enables us to experience our [joy](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/joy/), meaning, talents and motivation. Integral meditation balances and develops our psychological and spiritual DNA. I have meditated extensively on the psychological qualities of the sensitive and creative ray qualities, and this has given my character more flow and freedom. Meditating on the creative energy type, radiating harmony and beauty, added lightness, grace and spontaneity to my personality. It has curbed my tendency to be overly serious and single-minded; I now achieve my objectives more easily If I \"go-with-the flow\". It is not always good to force our will onto people and situations, and this has been an important lesson for me. If we identify the qualities we need to become whole, we can design meditations to bring this about. It's important to stress that a meditation not suited to your spiritual type can have negative consequences. Mindfulness meditations are very popular today; yet research has shown that they can create a passive and dispassionate character. This may have advantages in some cases, but in others it may not. We should be aware of the effects of our meditations in order to practice the right one at the right time. Each of the seven energy types expresses a particular ray quality. Table 2 shows the correspondence between ray, function and type. Table 2: The seven rays, seven psychological functions and seven energy types. If we observe human behaviour, it is easy to see how different we are. Different typologies have been devised to classify these differences, for example Gurdjieff's Enneagram, C.G Jung's Psychological Types, the Meyers Briggs test, astrology, psychiatric classifications, and so on. Energy typology is unique because of its vertical levels of types from the body to Spirit. There are also the possible energy types of Spirit, of which we have yet to speak. It is such an advanced study that hardly anyone expresses these qualities. For practical reasons we work with the five levels of body, feelings, mind, personality and Soul based on the development of the seven psychological functions. The possible combinations here are many. When we add the [introvert](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/introvert-2/) and [extrovert](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/extrovert/) version of the types, their 63 talents and 56 shadow parts, we have an enormous variation. Simple, but yet so complex. This is the foundation of our online identity profile - [Jivayou.com.](http://jivayou.com/) These variations safeguard us from narrow categories. The different levels also explain the vertical conflicts we can experience between our mind and emotions. When we begin to understand the different levels, we can help them to co-operate. However, no one is only a type. There is an X-factor, a unique pattern within us, which transcends all systems and classifications. This is the evolutionary stage of the Soul - the development of consciousness-will. This is expressed through the degree of wisdom with which the Soul applies the different energies and informs our life and actions. While we've seen that the rays and types are the same, it is still important to differentiate between the energies of the rays and the energy types, and the ways they manifest. The seven rivers of life are ever-present in the great universal ocean; they flow through every manifestation of the All. An energy type, however, is an energy bound to a particular vehicle, what we call the physical body, the emotional body, the mental body, the personality field and the Soul body. Along with the physical body, we have subtle bodies, or \"sheaths\" as they are called in yogic literature. Each body has a particular energy type coloured by one of the seven rays. I will speak more about them in Chapter 9. When we speak of the five individual energy types, we mean how the seven ray qualities are expressed in our lives through the five bodies. How do we seek meaning? What is our character? How do we think, feel and act? Figure 14 shows the five levels of our inner house, which is made up of our Soul and our personality. We are not aware of all the rooms or floors in our inner house. Some have never been inhabited, and few of us know the layout of all the rooms. In the diagram we see the different holarchies (wholes within wholes) symbolising the five layers from the bottom up: the [symbol](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/symbol/) of the energy types is illustrated at each level. An exchange takes places through these levels between the environment and the incoming energies of the different rays. Moving down from above this diagram depicts a 7-2521 profile: a manifestation type on the Soul level (7), with a sensitive personality (2), an analytical mind (5), a sensitive feeling nature (2), and a dynamic body (1). The seven different energy types combined with the five levels make up a kind of physical, psychological and spiritual DNA in each of us. The seven ray quali- ties that are influencing us all the time are coloured by, or filtered through, the different energy types and bodies that express them. It is through this process that variations of personality develop. We can see that: Body types are different, some are slim, fast, light; others are strong, slow and heavy ... Emotional types are different, some are calm, others fiery, and some are stoic ... [Thinking](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/thinking/) types are different, our thought processes can be dominated by analytical, associative or abstract thinking. Personality types are different, some are dynamic, some are sensitive, others are creative in the way they create success in life. Soul types are different, some express their spirituality through politics, others through science, teaching or art ... Energy typology helps locate different types on the appropriate levels, and applies methods to develop each to the fullest potential. When we under- stand our types, we can harmonise them, which is key to the integration of the personality and Soul-realisation, which is what we mean by personal and transpersonal Psychosynthesis respectively. Here is a brief run through of the seven energy types and their characteristics. As previously described, each type develops in keeping with its corresponding psychological function. The dynamic energy type is often found in the archetypical roles of Hero, Manager and Pioneer. If you are influenced by this energy you will seek a position of power, that of a leader. You enjoy competition and thrive on challenges. You embrace the role of the hero, who puts things into order. The manager expresses the introvert aspect of the will through endurance, and as the one who upholds purpose and protects values. The pioneer expresses the will's extroverted aspect, its power to make breakthroughs. This person leads people to the horizon and beyond; he can overcome any obstacle. The Hero balances both sides of the will and leads through [inspiration](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/inspiration/). The hero does not want followers but is committed to the idea. The Hero inspires through charisma, magnetism, integrity and courage, leading others to unite their efforts. Those strongly influenced by the [archetype](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/archetype/) of the Hero can shape the future by uniting all available resources around a common goal. The Hero takes risks and goes where angels [fear](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/fear/) to tread. He knows that at the edge of the unknown much power can be found. The downward pointing red arrow symbolises the dynamic energy type, which is fiery and strong. It illustrates its power to stimulate greatness through bold decision-making, like a lightning bolt from the sky. Sudden decisions and quick actions are an expression of this creative and powerful life force. Virtues: Strength, one-pointed, focus, [liberation](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/liberation/), courage, forceful, pioneering, steadfast, simplicity, impersonality, boldness, directness, truthful, self-esteem, [empowerment](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/empowerment/), fearless, authority, impartiality, decisiveness, break-through power, immovable, sovereignty, [authenticity](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/authenticity/), centredness, will to victory, trustworthy, broad-minded. Vices: Ruthless, hard, domineering, insensitive, cold, isolating, power hungry, destructive, prideful, arrogant, violent, suppressive, impatient, stubborn, tyrannical, self- [centred](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/centred/), cruel, control freak. The sensitive energy type fills the roles of The Illuminator, The Guide and The Helper. Your life is motivated by what we might call the intelligence of the heart. Your deep insights help you understand your own psychological life as well as that of others. You excel in building good human relationships. A sense of belonging and community is important to you. The ability to empathise and understand the psychological world of others comes with the influence of The Guide. This is the introverted aspect of the feeling function, which enables you to develop a profound insight into the causes of suffering and separation. This can be a great help to the people around you. The Helper expresses the extrovert qualities through compassion, warmth and heartfelt understanding. You are attracted to people who suffer and need your protection. You can be a true healer, a per- son who cures physical illnesses or psychological wounds. The Illuminator masters both sides and aids the [enlightenment](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/enlightenment/) of others through teaching, mostly through personal example. Your presence is calm and peaceful, and you are an [authentic](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/authentic/) expression of the Soul's light in the world. The Illuminator brings new revelations of what we can accomplish when we unite our common forces, and it is this that lies behind ideas of sisterhood and brotherhood. The blue counter clockwise arrow symbolises this type: blue is calming and peaceful, the circle embracing and inclusive. Virtues: Wisdom, calm, unity, love, compassion, holistic, connection, appreciation, healing, co-operative, inclusiveness, insight, warmth, forgiveness, strength, endurance, patience, magnetism, openness, love of truth, [acceptance](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/acceptance/), [intuition](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/intuition/), serenity. Vices: Sentimental, victimised, naivety, vague, passive, oversensitive, indifference, self pity, fear, love of being loved, [attachment](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/attachment/), overprotective, fear of conflict, powerless, impractical. The mental energy type enjoys playing The Genius, The Thinker and The Strategist. The skillful use of the mind motivates those who feel this energy. You love to think, to develop new perspectives, to communicate and to foster new understandings. The Thinker expresses the introverted aspect of thought through an ability to gain an overview of his field of knowledge. You can acquire much knowledge, get to the point and create new ideas. The Strategist expresses the extroverted aspect of thought. Your plans succeed because you make the best use of whatever is available. You handle financial and other resources intelligently to secure practical output. Because The Genius combines these aspects he or she is a true innovator who knows how to create new ideas by thinking outside the box. Here we find the open and free expression of a mind that plays with ideas but is not attached to them. Through this, new inventions and theories enter the world. The yellow arrows symbolise the mental type: like the mind, the arrows move in many directions, linking thoughts together. Yellow is traditionally thought to stimulate the intellect. Virtues: Mental understanding, abstract views, strategic, communicative, oral skills, curiosity, sincerity, clarity of intellect, originality, foresight, caution, planning, flexibility, intelligence, quickness, impartiality, economic, high activity, efficiency, alertness, [concentration](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/concentration/), skillful, understands complexity. Vices: Mental pride, cold, calculating, hyperactive, veiling facts, spin, over- complicated, manipulative, devious, scheming, inaccuracy, obstinacy, critical, treacherous. The creative energy type gives us The Artist, The Aesthete and The Transformer. Harmony and beauty are essential to types informed by this energy. The Aesthete expresses the introverted side of imagination. You can create images of harmony and beauty, which are expressed in your life and work, through your relationships with others or through your surroundings. The Transformer expresses the extroverted aspect of imagination; he is the dramatist, actor, psychotherapist or mediator. You are attracted to the light and dark sides of life and can foster harmony through conflict. You make peace through shadow- work with an open heart. The Artist combines both of these aspects creatively. You are able to play with opposites and create new levels of design, beauty and inventive life forms. Your intuitive lifestyle inspires new cultural and social values and outlooks, which in turn inspire new communities and holistic awareness. Your spontaneity, joy and unorthodox behaviour invigorate the social atmosphere, so we can discover a new way of being together. The two green connected arrows are an appropriate symbol for the creative type because imagination helps us to unite opposites into wholes, and green is the colour of harmony. Virtues: Beauty, vision, humour, mediating, peacemaker, balance, affectionate, conflict resolution, artistic, spontaneity, aesthetic, joy, play, entertainment, improvising, presence, sympathetic, courage, clarity, generous, quick intellect. Vices: Worrier, exaggerated, muddy, agitating, daydreamer, inaccuracy, theatrical, lazy, unstable, self-centredness, cowardice, extravagance, moody, dramatising. The analytical energy type appears in the archetypes of The Explorer, The Investigator and The Specialist. This type has a strong motivation for objective knowledge; they have a great need to know with certainty. For them knowing the truth and having all the facts is important. The Investigator expresses the introverted aspect of logic. She skilfully collects and systemises facts so as to arrive at an accurate picture of whatever is under scrutiny. Those influenced by this type will excel at discriminating between true and false knowledge. The Investigator cuts through assumptions to reach the core. The Specialist expresses the extroverted aspect of logic; this type uses knowledge in a very practical way. Inventing new products or improving the practical world with technical skills is common to these types - perhaps through psychological methods, green technology or crafts such as carpentry. The Explorer combines both skills in a spirit of invention, extending the boundaries of what might be thought possible. This type researches deeply and uncovers everything necessary to get to the truth. Possibilities abound in all areas of study, and will be discovered. The orange arrow pointing right symbolises the analytical energy type because logic moves from point to point. Orange is the colour of the dynamic mind. Virtues: Insight, revealing, know-how, knows cause and effect, perseverance, discrimination, inventive, verifying, scientific, just, common sense, fair, accuracy, impartiality, rational, uprightness, objective, experimenting, independence, precise, clarity, keen intellect. Vices: Dogmatic, arrogant, dry, over-analytical, narrowness, harsh [criticism](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/criticism/), unsympathetic, pride, prejudice, suspicious, hard, narrow-minded, cold. The dedicated energy type takes on the roles of The Visionary, The Idealist and The Advocate. Whatever your other roles, with this in your psychological makeup you will be motivated by ideals. Something in your life demands your passionate, enthusiastic [devotion](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/devotion/). The Idealist expresses the introverted aspect of passion through seeing the potential goodness in the projects in which you are involved. This brings great loyalty and dedication. You motivate others through your optimism and steadfastness. The advocate displays the extroverted aspect of passion, and produces the skilful activist or motivational speaker. You love to infect others with your enthusiasm. You radiate love by giving projects your all. The Visionary is a dreamer who makes dreams come true. You see into the future and have great faith in what you see. Through your insight and hard work you make your visions available to others. The purple upward pointing arrow symbolises the passionate heart, which lift the spirits of those around it. Purple suggests movement into the world of ideals. Virtues: [Idealism](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/idealism/), devotion, strength, perseverance, one-pointedness, dedication, faith, optimism, humility, loyalty, purity, seriousness, intensity, courage, courtesy, motivation, fiery, self-reliance, inspiration, seeing potentials, futuristic, sincere, loving. Vices: Naive, impulsive, formal, extreme, jealous, bigotry, pride, opinionated, fanatic, superficial, blind faith, judgmental, impractical, narrow. The practical energy type meets us as The Creator, The Systematiser and The Organiser. This energy motivates us to achieve concrete results through whatever is available to us. The Systematiser expresses the introverted aspect of action; through it you can turn chaos into order. Through your controlled actions and performance, you exude efficiency, reliability and skill. You lead whenever there's a need for order and structure. The organiser embodies the extroverted aspect of action, the energy to order your environment to optimum efficiency. You love to organise people and resources. The Creator is a magician when it comes to great ideas. He can plan and execute large projects, manifesting an inventive spirit. The Creator fashions new organisations, buildings or projects, expressing and mastering the divine fire within. The dark red converging arrows symbolise this practical type; they focus the will, mind and feelings around a single goal. The dark red colour anchors and grounds the will through the body. Virtues: Organising, strength, creative, timing, coordination, perseverance, courage, courtesy, detailed, self-reliance, practical, nobility, sense of order, ritual, [synthesis](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/synthesis/), integration, elegance, co-operative, self-mastery, action, transformational, mastery of skills. Vices: Power-greedy, hard, formal, bigotry, materialistic, pride, fixated, inflexible, opinionated, judgmental, narrow-minded, superficial. The Seven Ways to the Soul There are seven ways to the Soul, and each way benefits from certain meditation styles. The Soul's \"way\" is the process of bringing its qualities and aims into our lives. This does not mean a system of meditation in which, for example, you meditate solely on the will if you are a dynamic type. Dynamic types and all the others need to integrate all the different energies. Nevertheless it can help different types to follow a meditation that explores their specific qualities and develops their primary energies. Energy typology embraces an evolutionary perspective, with a progression from awareness of the body to that of the Soul. The Soul's way of being becomes available to us depending on our level in this progression. The Soul opens our awareness beyond [the self](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/the-self/) to others and the world, even to all of humanity. Soul qualities are always present in an indirect manner through diffusion through the personality and the types. An analytical personality will appear differently depending on whether he is wedded to a sensitive Soul or a dynamic one because the Soul quality conditions the energies of the personality. The Soul manifests in the body through the personal self, which is a reflection of its luminous source. The [awakening](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/awakening/) to the Soul often accompanies an existential [crisis](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/crisis/), when the Soul's values slowly begin to motivate the personality. Our earlier values, needs and habits don't necessary disappear but become secondary to those of the Soul. It is important to remember that the seven ways are like the rainbow, with one colour passing into the other. One [path](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/path/) will always attract us more than others, and this is our own way to the Soul. Piero Ferrucci's wonderful book Inevitable Grace presents the seven ways through accounts of the lives of famous men and women. Below I will describe some well-known characters from history who infused their personalities with the altruism, dedication, goodness, truthfulness and beauty of the Soul. 1. The Way of the Hero The hero's way leads through the will, so meditations emphasising the will are important here. We can think of heroes who showed courage during war. Others were pioneers who showed moral courage to resist mainstream opinion and open new ways to freedom and justice. They had the power to stand alone, fortified by a calm certainty that their actions were correct. They sustained and defended their vision and values. The American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who suffered severe physical handicaps, led his country out of depression and came to Europe's aid in World War II. Winston Churchill's spirited resistance to Hitler is another good example. But there are also inner wars that require heroes too. Here we find many religious pioneers. Very often these are sensitive or dedicated types, with much of the leader within them. The hero's way is that of the leader because through leading one can develop the strength and power needed to perform heroic deeds. The leader is guided by a purpose that defines the law of his or her life. This purpose is often expressed in a new vision of freedom and justice for the people they serve. Leaders are moved by an evolutionary impulse and initiate new developments in society. A true leader empowers those around them. Such leaders give us the courage to step into the unknown and inspire us to embrace lofty visions of humanity. The hero can also be a reformer. Heroes often bring a sword, and not peace, because the old order seldom gives up without a fight. They sow new ideas that eventually inspire humanity. England's Queen Elisabeth I brought England into a Golden Age and was a true reformer. The greatness of the hero manifests as a bold, daring spirit that serves the love that motivates them. This is the mark of a true hero. The diamond symbolises the hero. It is strong, yet transparent, allowing light and inspiration to shine through. 2. The Way of the Illuminator Meditations on the ray qualities of love and wisdom are important for this path. Let's see who we find here. Who am I? Where do we come from? Where are we heading? Human beings have asked these questions for millennia. The spiritual illuminators have answered them through their own enlightenment. The illuminator is called to seek an answer to the big questions concerning life and death through their own lives. They are motivated by a deep need to end suffering. They develop their understanding through a kind of wisdom that comes from contemplating the question and acting from this inner knowledge. They feel a love for all humanity in its misery and become a channel for boundless compassion. The Dalai Lama and the South African bishop Desmond Tutu are contemporary examples of the illuminator. Christ was one and so was the Buddha; each in their own way showed the world that love and wisdom are the ultimate goal of humanity. The archetypical role of the teacher is typical for this path. He teaches best by example, and through a deep sympathy with the people he is able to enlighten. Teachers understand the need for education: children are like flowers - anyone who wants to learn is like a flower - and education is sun, water and [earth](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/earth/). True education stimulates our inner light; through this our awakening to knowledge, wisdom and love is made possible. Good teachers know this and bestow [empathy](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/empathy/), understanding and kindness on their students. They are the light that awakens light. On this way we find many influential teachers and educationalists such as the founder of the Montessori Method, Maria Montessori. The sun symbolises this way. Those who have developed their light illuminate all around them. 3. The way of the Genius The Genius realises himself through intelligence, ideas and abstract thinking. Meditations aimed at reflection and reception are important here. The eagle-eyed can see through complexity and confusion. This is the way of the genius and the philosopher. I offer Albert Einstein and Ken Wilber as examples. Genius penetrates the mystery of creation and grasps the purpose behind the forms. They translate the complexity of [evolution](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/evolution/) into theories and weave these theories into an integral pattern. They are in search of a theory of every- thing because they know intuitively that everything is interconnected. For them separation is an illusion. The way of genius follows the path of ethics Societies and cultures change quickly: new technologies, discoveries and values emerge and trigger a re-evaluation of our ethical frameworks, such as in human rights, animal rights and gender [equality](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/equality/). The genius is more than an intellectual; she forms the avant-garde creating new cultural patterns through being a living example of the change. These are the writers, thinkers and philosophers who raise our level of consciousness. These are the trendsetters who offer themselves as examples for how to pursue the true, the good and the beautiful. In her life, the French existential thinker Simone de Beauvoir pioneered new possibilities for modern women. Thinkers and the geniuses formulate the ideas that direct the evolution of culture. The eye symbolises the way of genius, ever on the lookout for new evolutionary perspectives. 4. The Way of the Artist The evolution of the artist requires the qualities of harmony and beauty. Imagination dominates in him, so meditation based on [visualisation](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/visualisation/) is important for this type. Artists occupy all the rays, but here is an artist of life. The artist can harmonise contrasts and unite conflicts. By enduring chaos, darkness and drama they can distil their particular wisdom. When they succeed in balancing opposites, great beauty is their reward. The way of the artist is often the way of suffering. The true artist embraces painful oppositions in life; by doing so, she becomes a true representative of humanity. Artists mirror imperfection and grace, dramatising our inner lives. A longing for harmony and balance sustains them through their struggles, which the artist presents to us through dance, music, film and theatre, showing us life in the form of great dramas and their resolution. The great composer Richard Wagner is a good example. The psychotherapist or mediator also moves in this way, helping people to find harmony through their conflicts. C.G. Jung, founder of analytical psychology, is an example. The way of the artist is also the way of aesthetics. Beauty is the artist's polar [star](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/star/). Without beauty this world cannot truly reflect Spirit. Someone who set new standards in this way was the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe. The Soul is beautiful, and contains all that is good and true. Meditation can be an inner atelier where we beautify our personality using the qualities of the Soul. This is the importance of visualisation. The Chinese symbol of Yin-Yang, linking light and darkness in a unified whole, can represent this way. 5. The Way of the Explorer The explorer illuminates through the concrete mind. Through intuition and analysis the explorer investigates the mysteries of life. Focused reflective meditation is an important practice for this way. The overall theme here is the [revelation](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/revelation/) of the truth about a given subject. The explorer's strength combines intuition and logic. Explorers penetrate the facts and get behind a mystery that requires resolution. The explorer goes where others do not. New discoveries, technologies and possibilities fascinate them. They explore subtle realms: the quantum physicist is an example here, but also those who study life after death and the reality of the Soul. Explorers map new territory; their research brings new technological, psychological and spiritual innovations that change our understanding of the world. The Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, well-known for her research into the near-death experience, is an example for this type. The explorer is a man or woman of science, exploring not only the physical sciences but also the mental and spiritual realms. Only through comparative experimental studies within all three areas will true knowledge of the world emerge. It is not the subject matter that makes a study scientific, but the rigor that is applied to the research. The American psychologist Dean Radin, one of the leading explorers in contemporary [parapsychology](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/parapsychology/), is a good example of this kind of science. Mysteries are revealed and problems solved through the explorer's reflective, focused analysis, which is a kind of meditation. The practical value of their research is important for the explorer. Madame Curie, who developed the theory of [radiation](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/radiation/), is an example of the true explorer. The key of wisdom, opening the doors of the mysteries, is a good symbol for the explorer. 6. The Way of the Visionary The idealising ray informs the way of the visionary. Visionaries access spiritual dimensions through their surrender to the passionate heart. They are the world's true mystics. Appropriate meditations here focus on devotion and passion. A longing for the transcendent leads the visionary on his quest. In search of perfection, supernal light or boundless love, the visionary is always on his way to the Promised Land. His visions are not necessary religious. As Carl Sagan puts it: \"The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us\u2014there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant [memory](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/memory/), or falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.\" Visionaries like Mahatma Gandhi risked their lives for their cause. Their focused, passionate love led them to their goals. Within religion, visionaries are the introverted mystics or the extroverted saints. The mystic wants to illuminate the divine and bow to it in humble surrender. Through [purification](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/purification/) of the heart and dedication to the One, visionaries unite with the source. Here we can think of Saint Teresa of Avila. The saint is motivated by a [desire](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/desire/) to be a true representative of the divine. If God is love, our duty is to bear witness to this and be an example through the consecration of our life. Saints follow their divine passion with utmost dedication. They care for the sick, help the poor and embrace the outcast, all of whom are children of God. Mother Teresa devoted her life to walking in the footsteps of Jesus. The same love can be directed at all of life, even the planet. The flame symbolises the visionary: it is the fire that burns in their heart. 7. The Way of the Creator The manifesting qualities of the seventh ray motivate this type. Meditations leading to well-structured rituals are important for this way. The Creator brings ideas to life through organised and collaborative processes. The true creator follows a higher purpose that transcends personal ambition. Creators turn their resources towards a great goal. This requires psychological insight and great skill. Human and other resources are put to the test in the service of art, architecture or society. The creator organises people, formulates detailed and intelligent plans, and systematises everything to get the best results. An orchestra conductor is a good example of this type. He orchestrates a collection of musicians to create a musical masterpiece. Herbert von Karajan is a role model in this regard. Creators bring law and order through new social systems and methods of administration. Great architects exemplify these ray qualities. Through their unique skills they manifest grand designs seen with their inner eye. As Spirit-in-Action created the manifest universe, so can we manifest our creative ideas (as above, so below). J\u00f8rn Utzon, designer of the Sydney Opera House, is an example of this type. The six-pointed star is a good symbol here because it represents the unified triangles of Spirit and matter. In Tables 3 and 4 I have represented all the energy types discussed so far. Table 3: Personal energy types Table 4: Transpersonal energy types. This concludes our introduction to integral meditation. We have met the traveller, the Soul, the seven rivers of life, the seven energy types, the seven ways to the Soul and the seven levels of consciousness. In the next seven chapters, we will travel on the seven rivers and feel their flow. By focusing on the most useful meditations, we will learn how to harvest the qualities of the rivers.
