GOVERNMENT POLICY, L EGISLATIVE ANNOUNCEM ENTS AND NEWS Department of Health and Social Care ( 09/02/2022) Patients to receive better care as NHS and social care systems link up . The integration white paper sets out a vision for an integrated NHS and adult social care sector which will better serve patients and staff. The white paper sets out some of the ways health an d care systems will draw on the resources and skills across the NHS and local government to better meet the needs of communities, reduce waiting lists and help level up healthcare across the country. NHS England and NHS Improvement (08/02/2022) Delivery plan for tackling the COVID -19 backlog of elective care . The plan sets out a progressive agenda for how the NHS will recover elective care over the next three years. This is in the context of restoring elective performance in the longer term. It explains how the NHS will take the opportunity to capitalise on current success and embed new ideas to ensure elective services are fi t for the future. A statement in the House of Commons from Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid can be read here. This plan sets out a number of ambitions, including: 1. That the waits of longer than a year for elective care are eliminated by March 2025. Within this, by July 2022, no one will wait longer than two years, we will aim to eliminate waits of over 18 months by April 2023, and of over 65 weeks by March 2024. Long -waiting patients will be offered further choice about their care, and over time, as the NHS brings down the longest waits from over two years to under one year, this will be offered sooner. 2. Diagnost ic tests are a key part of many elective care pathways. Our ambition is that 95% of patients needing a diagnostic test receive it within six weeks by March 2025. 3. The NHS has continued to prioritise cancer treatment throughout the COVID -19 pandemic and we have consistently seen record levels of urgent suspected cancer referrals since March 2021. To maintain this focus, our ambition is that, by March 2024, 75% of patients who have been urgently referred by their GP for suspected cancer are diagnosed or hav e cancer ruled out within 28 days . This will help contribute to the existing NHS Long Term Plan ambitions on early diagnosis. Local systems have also been asked to return the number of people waiting more than 62 days from an urgent referral back to pre -pandemic levels by March 2023. 4. For patients who need an outpatient appointment, the time they wait can be reduced by transforming the model of care and making greater use of technology. We will work with patient groups and stakeholders to better monitor and improve both waiting times and patients' experience of waiting for first outpatient appointments over the next three years .
