By People of the State of Washington.Background: In 1993 voters en acted Initiative 601. Among other things, Initiative 601 required a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature to increase state revenue. The Legislature temporarily suspended the supermajority requirement from March 2002 through June2003 and again from April 2005 through June 2006. Initiative 960, enacted by th e voters in 2007, restated this requirement for a supe rmajority legislative vote to increase taxes, and it also declared that under the stateConstitution the Legislature ma y refer tax increases to the voters through the referendum bill process. In addition, Initiative 960 required prior le gislative approval of any new or increased state fees. It also established publicityand cost projection requirements for legislation that raises taxes or increases fees, and it required advisory votes for legislation that raises taxes and does not appear on theballot as a referendum b ill or referendum measure. In 2010 the Legislature susp ended until July 1, 2011, the two-thirds vote requiremen t for state tax increases, and the requirement for advisory votes for tax increases.Provisions of Initiative 960 regarding publicity and costprojection requirements for tax and fee legislation, andprior legislative approval of new fees and fee increases,were not affected by the 2010 legislation. Summary: Initiative 1053 reinstates and restates the statutory requirement that any action or combination of actions by the Legislature that raises state taxes must beapproved by at least two-thirds legislative approval in both houses of the Legislature or by referral to the voters. Theinitiative also restates the requirement that new or in-creased state fees must be approved with majoritylegislative approval in both houses of the Legislature. Effective: December 2, 2010 I 1107 C 2 L 11 Reversing certain 2010 amen dments to state tax laws. By People of the State of Washington. Background: Carbonated Beverage Tax . In 1989 the Legislature enacted a tax on carbonated beverages and syrup used to produce carbonated beverages. The tax waseffective July 1, 1989, and wa s originally set to expire on July 1, 1995. The tax was dedicated to the ViolenceReduction and Drug Enforcemen t Account. (This account was eliminated in 2009.) In 1994 the voters modified the tax through the passage of Re ferendum Bill No. 43. The referendum allowed the carbona ted beverage tax to expire as originally scheduled, but in creased the tax rate for syrupand eliminated the original expiration date for the syrup tax. In 2010 the Legislature, through the enactment of Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6143 (2ESSB6143), reestablished a tax on carbonated beverages, effec-tive July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2013. The carbonatedbeverage tax is imposed on the sale of carbonated bever-ages at wholesale or retail in Washington. The tax doesnot apply to successive sales of previously taxed carbonat-ed beverages. The legislatio n also provided an exemption for the first $10 million of carbonated beverages sold in the state by a bottler. Sales and Use Taxes on Bottled Water and Candy . Retail sales and use taxes are imposed by the state, mostcities, and all counties. Re tail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangible personal property,digital products, and some services. If retail sales taxeswere not collected when the property, digital products, orservices were acquired by the user, then use taxes are ap-plied to the value of most tangible personal property, digital products, and some serv ices when used in this state. Use tax rates are the same as retail sales tax rates. Washington specifically ex empts \"food and food in- gredients\" from state and local sales and use taxes. There-fore, any food product includ ed within the definition of \"food and food ingredients\" is exempt from sales and usetaxes. The term \"food and fo od ingredients\" is defined to mean substances, whether in liquid, concentrated, solid,frozen, dried, or dehydrated form, that are sold foringestion or chewing by humans and are consumed fortheir taste or nutritional value. Prepared food, soft drinks, and dietary supplements are excluded from the definitionand are therefore subject to sales and use taxes. In 2010the Legislature, through th e enactment of 2ESSB 6143, excluded candy and bottled water from the definition of \"food and food ingredients,\" thereby extending state and local sales and use taxes to these items. The sales and usetaxes on bottled water are temporary, with the exemptionrestored on July 1, 2013. The sales and use taxes on candy are permanent. The legislation includes certain narrow ex-emptions for bottled water. Th e legislation also includes a business and occupation (B&O) tax credit for candymanufacturers. Tax Preferences for Manufacturers of Certain Agricultural Products . Washington law provides a preferential B&O tax rate for the business of slaughtering, breaking, or processing of perishable meat products and the wholesal- ing of such perishable meat products. In Agrilink Foods,Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, 153 Wn.2d 392 (2005), the Washington Supreme Court he ld that the preferential B&O tax rate applies to the pr ocessing of perishable meat products into nonperishable finished products, such ascanned food. In 2010 the Le gislature, through the enact- ment of 2ESSB 6143, narrowed the exemption for slaugh-tering, breaking, or processing perishable meat products,or selling these perishable meat products at wholesale, byHB 1000 2requiring that the end product be either: a perishable meat product; a nonperishable meat product that is comprised primarily of animal carcass by weight or volume otherthan a canned meat produc t; or a meat by-product. A B&O tax exemption is provided for manufacturing by canning, preserving, freezing, processing, or dehydrat-ing fresh fruits or vegetables , and selling such products at wholesale by the manufacturer to purchasers who trans-port the goods out of state in the ordinary course of busi-ness. The exemption expires Ju ly 1, 2012, and is replaced by a preferential B&O tax rate. In 2010 the Legislature,through the enactment of 2 ESSB 6143, narrowed these tax preferences for fruit and vegetable manufacturers byrequiring that the end product be comprised either exclu-sively of fruits or vegetables , or any combin ation of fruits, vegetables, and certain other substances that, cumulative- ly, may not exceed the amount of fruits and vegetablescontained in the product measured by weight or volume. Summary: Carbonated Beverage Tax . The provisions of 2ESSB 6143 (2010) imposin g a tax on the retail and wholesale sale of carbonated beverages are repealed. The $10 million exemption for bottlers as well as the otherprovisions in 2ESSB 6143 (2010) relating to thecarbonated beverage tax are also repealed. Sales and Use Taxes on Bottled Water and Candy . The provisions of 2ESSB 6143 (2010) eliminating the sales and use tax exemption for candy and bottled water are repealed, i.e. the exemption is restored. The narrowexemptions for bottled water and the B&O tax credit forcandy manufacturers are also repealed. Tax Preferences for Manufacturers of Certain Agricultural Products . The provisions of 2ESSB 6143 (2010) narrow- ing the B&O tax preferences for processors of meat products and fruits and vegetables are repealed.

SHB 1008 3Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed section 2, amending an election statute to require county auditors to mail ballots to overseas and service voters at least 30 days before each special election and at least 45 days before each primary or general electi on. The bill required the statute, as amended, to take effect 90 days following the end of the legislative session. The reason for the veto isthat another bill enacted during the 2011 legislative ses-sion, Second Engrossed Subs titute Senate Bill 5171, con- tained the same amendment as that in section 2 of HouseBill 1000, but with an effectiv e date of January 1, 2012. VETO MESSAGE ON HB 1000 May 16, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 2, House Bill 1000 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to overs eas and service voters.\" I am vetoing Section 2 of Hous e Bill 1000 because another bill I am signing today amends the same statute regarding the date ballots are mailed to military and overseas voters. Section 16 of Second Engrossed Substitute Senat e Bill 5171 contains the same amendment to this statute. Each of these amendments to the statute takes effect on a different date. H ouse Bill 1000 take s effect ninety days after the end of session, whereas Section 16 of Second En- grossed Substitute Se nate Bill 5171 takes e ffect January 1, 2012. The Secretary of State has stated that the statutory amendment should take effect in 2012 to co rrespond with other election date changes in Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5171. For this reason I have vetoed Section 2 of House Bill 1000.With the exception of Section 2, House Bill 1000 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SHB 1008 C 254 L 11 Changing provisions relatin g to membership on the Washington citizens' commissi on on salaries for elected officials. By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs (originally sponsored by Representatives Appleton and Hunt).

By Representatives Angel, Haler, Klippert, Fagan, Rolfes and Fitzgibbon. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: A city, town, or county may create a plan- ning commission to provide its legislative authority with citizen review and recomme ndations on planning-related matters. While the local government entity has broad authority to define the role of its commission, planning commissions often have two distinct functions. First, theymay prepare and revise the community's comprehensiveplan and local land use regulations, such as the zoning orsubdivision code. Second, they may review developmentproposals, such as site plans and subdivisions, and makerecommendations to the local governing body. Commission membership falls into two categories: ex officio and appointive. Ex officio members are membersby virtue of the public office they hold and may notcomprise more than one-third of commission membership. Appointive members are appoin ted by the mayor or chair of the municipality and confirmed by the legislative body.A member's term in office depends on his or her categoryof membership and the lo ngevity of the commission: 1. The terms of office for ex officio members correspond with their tenu res in elected office. 2. The terms of office for the first appointive members to a newly-established commission range from one to six years, to provide for the expiration of the fewest possible terms in one year. 3. The terms of office for appointive members to established commissions are six years. Summary: A city, town, or county legislative authority may establish a four-year or a six-year term of office for appointive members of an est ablished planning commis- sion. Terms of office for th e first appointive members to a newly-established planning commission will continue torange from one to six years.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011HB 1016 C 13 L 11 Changing restrictions on firearm noise suppressors. By Representatives Blake, Condotta, Armstrong, Shea, Kristiansen, Chandler, Ross, Sells andUpthegrove. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Washington law does not regulate the possession of firearm suppressors. However, it is a gross misdemeanor crime in Washington for any person to use\"any device or contrivance for suppressing the noise ofany firearm.\" Under federal law, the Na tional Firearms Act (NFA) regulates the manufacture, importation, and transfer offirearm silencers and mufflers, as well as certain firearms,destructive devices, and other weapons. Items regulatedunder the NFA are referred to as NFA firearms. The NFAfirearms must be registered in a database maintained bythe Bureau of Alcohol, Toba cco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE). Only the manufacturer, importer, or maker ofthe NFA firearm may register it with the BATFE. A person wishing to acquire a firearm silencer or other NFA firearm has to obtain a certification from the localchief law enforcement officer, undergo a backgroundcheck, obtain prior approval for the transfer, and pay a $200 tax on the transaction. Under the NFA, a person isallowed to make his or her ow n silencer or other NFA fire- arm by applying to the BATFE and meeting certainrequirements. These requirements include: obtainingprior approval and registration of the item, obtaining acertification from the chief of the local law enforcement agency, undergoing a backgr ound check, and paying a $200 tax on the item. Federal law defines the term \"firearm silencer or fire- arm muffler\" as \"any device for silencing, muffling, or diminishing the report of a portable firearm, including anycombination of parts, designed or redesigned, andintended for the use in assembling or fabricating a firearmsilencer or firearm muffler, and any part intended only for use in such assembly or fabrication.\" Summary: The crime of using a contrivance or device for suppressing the noise of a firearm is amended to exemptthe use of a suppressor that is legally registered and possessed in accordance with federal law.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 88 0 Senate 48 0 House 88 4Senate 47 0SHB 1024 5SHB 1024 C 123 L 11 Adding to the scenic and re creational highway system. By House Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Representatives Fagan, Schmick,Armstrong, Clibborn, Liia s, Frockt and Moeller). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Scenic and Recreational Highway System was created by statute in 1967. The process was modified in 1999 to improve Washington highways'competitiveness under the federal National ScenicByways Program within the Tr ansportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. A highway does not become part of theScenic and Recreational Highway System unlessapproved by the Legislature. Two sections of State Route 27 are designated as a scenic and recreational highway; no sections of StateRoute 278 are so designated. Summary: One section of State Route 27 that is designat- ed as a scenic and recreationa l highway is extended by approximately 20 miles to th e vicinity of Rockford. In addition, about five mile s of State Route 278 are designated as a scenic and recreational highway. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1026 C 255 L 11 Changing provisions relating to adverse possession claims. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Rolfes, Orcutt, Carlyle, Blake, Angel and McCune). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: The doctrine of adverse possession allows a person who without permission physically possesses another's land to ma ke a legal claim against the title holder in order to gain title to the property. For a person to make a successful claim, he or she must have sufficientlypossessed the property for a set period of time and meet several additional conditions stemming both fromcommon law and state statut es. Adverse possession claims often arise as a defense to actions for ejectment or to quiettitle to a parcel. Statutes of Limitations . Washington law generally requires plaintiffs or their predecessors to have possessedthe land at issue for at least 10 years before an adversepossession action is commenced . In certain situations, state statutes reduce the length of possession necessary.The \"payment-of-taxes\" statut e allows an adverse possess- or to gain title in only seven years if, in addition to meeting the usual common-law requirements, he or she has \"colorof title,\" has paid all taxes on the land for seven successive years, and has a \"good faith\" belief that he or she has title.The less-commonly used \"conn ected-title\" statute reduces the period to seven years for a possessor who has a title tothe land traceable to a public deed. Common-Law Elements . Judicial decisions generally require an adverse possession to be: (1) open andnotorious, such that possession is visible and discoverable to the true owner; (2) actual and uninterrupted, requiringsufficient physical possession or use of the land over acontinuous, specified length of time; (3) exclusive, or not shared with the true owner; and (4) hostile, or objection- able to the owner of the land considering the character of possession and locale of the pr operty. Courts presume the holder of legal title to the la nd has possession, so the party claiming to have adversely po ssessed the property has the burden of establishing the existence of each element forthe requisite period. In Washington, courts do not takeaccount of the adverse poss essor's good faith belief, or lack thereof, that he or she owns the land. Costs and Fees . Adverse possession claimants generally are not required to pay defending parties' legal costs or attorneys' fees. When a landlocked propertyowner wants to acquire access through a private condem-nation of a way of necessity, however, the owner must payattorneys' fees incurred by th e other parties, and for the value of the easement granted. Summary: A party who prevails against the holder of recorded title at the time an adverse possession action isfiled, or against a later purchaser of the title, may berequired to reimburse that ho lder or purchaser for part or all of any taxes and assessments on the property that thelosing party paid during the period of adverse possession.The court also may require the prevailing party to pay tothe county treasurer part or all of any taxes and assess-ments levied on the property after the filing of the claim that are due and remain unpaid at the time of judgment. Ifthe court orders payment or reimbursement of taxes and assessments, the court must d ecide how to allocate the taxes and assessment based on all the facts and in a waythat appears equitable and just. The court may award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in an action asserting title to real property by adverse possession if the court determinesthat an award is equitable and just. This act applies to adverse possession actions filed on or after July 1, 2012. House 92 0Senate 49 0EHB 1028 6Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 EHB 1028 C 14 L 11 Using state correctional facility populations to determine population thresholds for certain local government purposes. By Representatives Schmick, Takko, Fagan, Springer, Kretz, Shea, Blake and McCune. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: City Council Membership . The Optional Municipal Code (Code) spec ifically provides for two plans of government for noncharter code cities: themayor-council plan and the council-manager plan. Underboth plans, the Code lim its the number of council members in a noncharter code city according to thepopulation of that city. For the purpose of determining population thresholds, the population of a code city is determined by reference toeither the most recent state or federal census, or thepopulation statistics compiled by the Office of FinancialManagement. State law is sile nt as to whether the inmates of a state correctional facility located within a code city or town may be counted as part of the population threshold determination. In a charter code city oper ating under the mayor-coun- cil or council-manager form of government, the number ofcouncil members is controlled by the charter, which mayprovide for an uneven number of council members not toexceed 11. In a noncharter code city operating under either form of government, the number of council members variesaccording to population. A city with a population of fewerthan 2,500 inhabitants is requ ired to have five council members, and a city with a population of greater than 2,500 inhabitants is required to have seven councilmembers. For a city with a fluctuating population, the following rules apply: If the population decrease s from 2,500 or more inhab- itants to fewer than 2, 500, council membership remains at seven. If the population increases from fewer than 2,500 inhabitants to more than 2,500 inhabitants, the existing council may vote to increase council membership from five to seven. If the population increases to 5,000 or more inhabit- ants, council membership is required to increase from five to seven members. Small City Pavement and Sidewalk Account . State law provides for the Small City Pavement and Sidewalk Account (Account) in the state treasury. Cities and towns with a population of fewer than 5,000 inhabitants are eligible to receive mone y from the Account for the maintenance, repair, and resurfacing of city and townstreets. State law is silent as to whether the inmates of astate correctional facility located within a code city ortown may be counted as part of the population thresholddetermination. Summary: A code city or town with a mayor-council form or council-manager form of government may include or exclude the population of any state correctional facility within its jurisdiction in calculating the populationthresholds pertinent to determining the requisite numberof city council members. A city or town may include or exclude the population of any state correctional fac ility within its jurisdiction in calculating the population thresholds relevant to determin-ing its eligibility to obtain funding from the Account.

By Representatives Armstron Pearson, Green, McCoy, McCune, House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: When voting by mail, a voter receives a ballot, a security envelope, and a return envelope. The purpose of the security envelo pe is to provide secrecy of the ballot. V oters are instruct ed to place the ballot in the security envelope, and then to place the security envelope in the return envelope. Th e return envelope provides space for the voter to sign the oath to affirm and attest to the statements regarding th e voter's qualifications. Summary: A change is made to di stinguish that the secu- rity envelope must \"conceal\" rather than \"seal\" the ballot.House 95 1 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 1 (House concurred) House 87 5Senate 47 0SHB 1037 7Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1037 C 220 L 11 Placing restrictions on legal claims initiated by persons serving criminal sentences in correctional facilities. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Ross, Jo hnson, Bailey, Upthegrove, Hurst, Armstrong, Walsh, Hinkle, Angel, Warnick, McCune, Fagan,Nealey, Blake, Ladenburg, Kristiansen, Pearson,Tharinger and Moeller; by request of Attorney General). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Generally, a person must pay a filing fee to the court in order to commenc e a civil lawsuit. However, a person who is indigent may ask the court to proceed inan action \"in forma pauperis.\" In forma pauperis, a Latin phrase meaning \"in the form of a pauper,\" is a designationallowing a person who is in digent to maintain a court action without having to pay fees for filing the action. In 1996 as one part of th e federal Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), the United States Congress enactedlimitations on the ability of a prisoner who has brought anumber of prior court actions that were found to befrivolous or without basis to bring subsequent actions informa pauperis. Under the PLRA, a prisoner who has had three or more cases dismissed as frivo lous, malicious, or failing to state a claim for relief, may not proceed in forma pauperisin a civil action or appeal unless the prisoner is underimminent danger of serious physical injury. Thisprovision of the PLRA is often referred to as the \"threestrikes\" provision. \"Prisoner\" is defined as a personincarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms of parole,probation, pretrial release, or a diversionary program. A frivolous action is one that cannot be supported by any rational argument on the law or facts. An action failsto state a claim for relief when it appears beyond doubtthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts consistent withthe complaint that would entitle the plaintiff to relief. Summary: Limitations are established on the ability of a person serving a criminal senten ce in a federal, state, local, or private correctional fac ility (correctional inmate) to proceed in certain civil ac tions or appeals without payment of filing fees.A court must deny a request from a correctional inmate to proceed without the payment of filing fees in a civil action or appeal against governmental entities or their officers, employees, or volunteers, if the court finds thatthe correctional inmate, while incarcerated or detained, has had three or more prior civil actions or appealsdismissed by a federal or state court on the grounds thatthey were frivolous or ma licious. One of the three dismissals must have involved an action or appealcommenced on or after the effective date of the act. This restriction on a corr ectional inmate's ability to proceed without paying filing fees does not apply toactions or appeals that, if successful, would affect theduration of the person's conf inement, or to actions or appeals where the court finds that the correctional inmate is in imminent danger of serious physical injury.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1040 C 183 L 11 Regarding the use of electronic signatures and notices. By Representatives Pedersen, Armstrong, Kirby, Warnick, Kelley and Hunt; by request of Secretary of State. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Notices to Business Entities . The Corpora- tions Division of the Office of the Secretary of State (OSOS) administers a variety of programs, including thelicensing and registration of domestic corporations,foreign corporations doing busi ness in the state, corpora- tions sole, charitable organi zations, and commercial fund- raisers. Business entities licensed with the OSOS mustfile certain documents, such as their annual reports, with the OSOS. The OSOS must send notices to these businessentities to renew their registrations and file their reports.These notices must be sent by postal mail. Digital Signatures . The OSOS also administers the Electronic Authentication Act (EAA), which governs the use of digital signature techno logy in electronic transac- tions and creates a process fo r the OSOS to license entities that verify the authenticity of digital signatures. These entities are called certification authorities. Digital signature technology is an encryption system used to protect the confidentia lity of an elec tronic docu- ment and authenticate its sour ce. The technology operates on the basis of digital keys or codes. These keys must becertified for their authentic ity. Licensed certification authorities issue the certificates of authenticity.House 96 0Senate 41 7 House 98 0Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 47 0 (Senate receded)ESHB 1041 8Under the EAA, a unit of state or local government must become a subscriber to a certificate issued by a licensed certification authority if the governmental entity's signature is required to conduct official public businesswith electronic records. Summary: Notices to Business Entities . The OSOS may send notices of registration renewals and notices to file annual or biennial reports to certain business entities using either postal or electronic mail, as elected by the business entity. Those business entities are charitable organizations and commercial fundraisers registered with the OSOS, domestic corporations, foreign corporations doing busi-ness in the state, and corporations sole. The option toreceive the notice by electronic mail may be selected onlywhen the OSOS makes the option available. Digital Signatures .

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1041 C 221 L 11 Including certain correctional employees and community corrections officers who have completed government-sponsored law enforcem ent firearms training to the lists of law enforcement personnel that are exempt from certainfirearm restrictions. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Green, Angel, Goodman, McCune, Kelley, Hope, Dammeier, Warnick, Blake, Hurst, Moellerand Upthegrove). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: State law regulates the possession, use, and transfer of firearms and other weapons under the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons law. Among other things, thislaw imposes restrictions on the carrying of certain fire-arms and prohibits possession of weapons in certainplaces. A person is prohibited from carrying a concealed pistol in Washington unless the person has a validconcealed pistol license. In addition, there are restrictionson the carrying of pistols in vehicles. A person may notcarry a loaded pistol in a ve hicle unless the person has a concealed pistol license and either the pistol is on theperson, the person is within the vehicle at all times the pistol is present, or the pistol is locked within the vehicleand concealed from view. An unloaded pistol kept in avehicle must be locked within the vehicle and concealedfrom view. A number of exemptions are provided from the requirements relating to carrying concealed pistols andcarrying pistols in a vehicle. Marshals, sheriffs, prison orjail wardens or their deputies, or other law enforcement of- ficers of this state or anothe r state are exempted, as are retired Washington law enforcement officers. Also ex-empted are federal officers and military members, persons engaged in various firearms manufacturing or dealingjobs, and persons engaged in various activities such assport shooting, gun collectin g, or outdoor recreation. The Firearms and Dangerous Weapons law also prohibits possession of weapons in certain places.Weapons are prohibited in court facilities, taverns andbars, and restricted areas of jails and law enforcementfacilities, public mental hea lth facilities, and commercial airports. \"Weapons\" include firearms, explosives, spring- blade knives, daggers, dirks, sling shots, sand clubs, and metal knuckles.

Summary: Correctional personnel and community corrections officers who have completed government-sponsored law enforcement firearms training are exemptfrom restrictions on carrying a concealed pistol and carry-ing a pistol in a vehicle. The exemption applies only if thecorrectional employee or co mmunity corrections officer has had a background check through the National InstantCriminal Background Check System or an equivalentbackground check within the past five years. Correctionalpersonnel and community corrections officers seeking thiswaiver are required to pay for any background check thatis needed in order to exercise the waiver. Correctional personnel and community corrections officers who have complete d government-sponsored law enforcement firearms training also are exempt fromrestrictions on possession of weapons in court facilities and restricted areas of jails and law enforcement facilities, public mental health facilities, and commercial airports.Correctional personnel are not exempt from the restriction on possessing weapons in taverns and bars. The govern-ment-sponsored law enforcemen t firearms training must be training that is received as part of the job requirementand reference to such trai ning does not constitute a mandate that it be provided by the correctional facility. The state, local governments, and their officers, employees, and agents, are not liable for damages caused by the use or misuse of a firearm by off-duty correctionalpersonnel or community corrections officers based on aclaim of negligence in the provision of government-sponsored firearms training.House 92 0Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House (House concurred)SHB 1046 on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1046 C 326 L 11 Concerning vehicle and vessel quick title. By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Moeller, Condotta and Morris). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Vehicle and vessel title changes in Washington can be made at a county auditor's office, or offices of other agents or subagents, or at the Departmentof Licensing (DOL). The app licant must fill out a Vehicle or Vessel Certificate of Owner ship Application. Docu- mentation and the required taxes and fees are collected atthe location and sent to the DOL. Seven county auditors in Washington (Benton, Clark, Franklin, Kitsap, Pierce,Spokane, and Whatcom counties) prepare quick titles,which are titles that are processed by the counties andgiven to the applicant immediately. Summary: A quick title is defined as a certificate of ownership printed at the time of application. A $50 fee is charged by the participating county auditor or other agent; $25 is retained by the county treasurer in the same manner as other fees collected by the county auditor, and the remaining $25 is deposited into the Motor Vehicle Fund for a vehicle and the General Fund fora vessel. If the fee is paid directly to the DOL, the entirefee of $50 must be deposited into the Motor Vehicle Fundfor a vehicle and into the General Fund for a vessel. The application for a quic k title may not be used to obtain the first title issued to a vehicle previouslydesignated as a salvage vehicle.

By House Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Representatives Pedersen, Rodne, Eddy, Goodman, Kelley and Moeller; by request of Washington State BarAssociation). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Trusts are a means of transferring property. A trust is created by a trustor, who gives the trustor's prop- erty to a trustee. The trustee holds legal title to the prop-erty, but only manages the property for the benefit of otherindividuals specified by the trustor (beneficiaries). Thebeneficiaries hold equitable title to the property, meaning the beneficiaries enjoy the property, but do not havecontrol over the trustee or how the trustee manages theHouse 84 13Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 92 4 (House concurred) House 58 40Senate 41 8 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 39 9 (Senate amended)House 70 26 (House concurred) House 98 0 Senate 49 0SHB 1051 10legal title. Trusts may be made revocable or irrevocable by the trustor. Revocable liv ing trusts are commonly used as an alternative to traditional wills as a way to passproperty upon death. Washington's laws of trusts and estates exist in both statute and common law. W ashington statutes govern a range of trust issues, includ ing the authority of trustees, trust administration, distribu tion of assets, liability issues, and the investment of trust fu nds. In 1999 the Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act was enacted, whichupdated and revised the laws on resolving trust disputes. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has proposed a Uniform Trust Code(UTC) for the purpose of providing a consistent andintegrated framework of rules to deal with trusts. TheWashington State Bar Association's Executive Committeeof the Real Property, Probate and Trust Section appointeda task force to review the of ficial version of the UTC and Washington's current trust la ws. The task force recom- mended several amendments and additions to Washing-ton's trust laws, including amending current sections andadopting new sections to chan ge current law and adopting new sections to codify preexisting common law. Summary: Changes are made to many aspects of trust and estate law, and several areas of preexisting common law are codified. Trust Situs . The situs of a trust, or its location, is Washington if the trust inst rument designates Washington as the situs and the trust has at least one connection to the state. A list of possible connections are set forth. If thetrust instrument does not designate Washington as thesitus, the trustee may register the trust in the state as longas the trust has a connection to the state. If there is nodesignation and the trustee does not register the trust, then the trust may qualify as a Washington trust in certain circumstances. The transfer of the trust situs is permissible if the new jurisdiction has a connection to the trust. The trustee must provide beneficiaries with 60 days advance notice. If thebeneficiaries do not object w ithin that period, the trust situs may be transferred, and consent of the beneficiariesis no longer required. Venue for Proceedings . Venue for court proceedings is in the county where the beneficiary resides, where thetrustee resides or has a place of business, or where the realproperty of the trust is located. If the trust was created bya will, then venue can be in the county where the will was administered. Venue may be changed by request withinfour months of a notice of court proceedings. Venue mustbe changed to the county w ith the strongest connection to the trust, rather th an being determined by the location of the trust situs or of the county where the letters testamen-tary were granted to a personal representative of an estatesubject to a will. Trustee's Duty to Give Notice . When a trust becomes irrevocable, the trustee must provide notice to all personswith an interest in the trust regarding the existence of thetrust and their right to request information. The trusteemust continue to keep all interested persons reasonablyinformed about the administration of the trust and thematerial facts necessary for them to protect their interests. Electronic transmission, or e-mail, is added as an acceptable delivery method fo r all required notices. Statute of Limitations . A beneficiary's claims against a trustee for breach of trust must be commenced withinthree years from the date the beneficiary was sent a reportthat adequately disclosed the existence of a potential claim and informed the beneficiary of the time allowed forcommencing a proceeding. Th e criteria for providing ad- equate disclosure are set forth. If the beneficiary did notreceive adequate disclosure, then the proceeding must be commenced within three years from the earlier of: thedischarge of the trustee; the termination of the beneficia- ry's interest in the trust; or th e termination of the trust. Certification of a Trust . When a person other than a beneficiary requests informa tion regarding the trust, the trustee may provide the person a certification of trust con-taining information in accordance with the provided list. Termination of a Trust . Before terminating a trust, a trustee may send notice to th e beneficiaries of the pro- posed plan for termination an d distribution of the remain- ing assets. After receiving notice of the plan, thebeneficiary has 30 days to object to the distribution. Virtual Representation . Virtual representation refers to circumstances where an individual can be representedby a decision-making process w ithout the ability to partic- ipate. Virtual representation is extended to apply to noticeto fiduciaries where the fiduciary estate is the interestedparty. Damages for Breach . A trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable for the great er of the amount required to restore the value of the property or the profit the trusteemade. Correction of Mistakes . The courts may change the terms of a trust to conform to the trustor's intent if it is proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that amistake of fact or law affected both the trustor's intent andthe terms of the trust. The courts may also change theterms to conform to the trustor's intent if the parties to abinding nonjudicial agreement agree that there is clear, cogent, and convincing evid ence to the same effect. Noncharitable Trusts Without Beneficiaries . Non- charitable trusts without ascertainable beneficiaries areenforceable as long as there is a valid purpose and the trustcomplies with the rule against perpetuities. Revocable Living Trusts . A new chapter is created in the code to supple ment trust laws for revocable living trusts. The chapter codifies the common law related to amending or revoking revocable living trusts and thelimitations of actions on the validity of a revocable livingtrust. HB 1052 11A beneficiary may commence judicial proceedings to contest the validity of a revo cable living trust within the earlier of 24 months after the trustor's death or four months after receiving notice of the trust. Codifying Areas of Common Law . Several other areas of the common law on trusts and estates are codified and clarified, including the methods and requirements for creating a trust, trusts in other jurisdictions, the purposesof a trust, oral trusts, truste es' authority and duty of loyalty, the nonliability of third parti es acting in good faith, and the cy pres doctrine. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012 HB 1052 C 328 L 11 Addressing the authority of shareholders and boards of directors to take certain actions under the corporation act. By Representatives Pedersen, Rodne, Eddy and Moeller; by request of Washington State Bar Association. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: The Washington Business Corporations Act (WBCA) provides requirements for the creation, orga- nization, and operation of co rporations an d the relation- ship between shareholders, dire ctors, and officers of the corporation. Many of the provisions of the WBCA pro-vide default rules that may be altered or modified in the corporation's articles of inco rporation or bylaws. The articles of incorporation and the bylaws are the governing documents for the corporatio n and set forth rules with respect to numerous organizatio nal and operational issues. Board of Directors, Shareholders, and Bylaws . The WBCA requires a corporation to have a board of directorsunless the articles of incorpor ation dispense with the board of directors. All corporate po wers must be exercised by or under the authority of the board of directors, and the busi-ness and affairs of the corporation must be managed underthe direction of the board of directors, except as limited bythe articles of incorporation. However, the WBCA autho-rizes shareholders to enter into unanimous shareholderagreements that may eliminate or restrict the power of the board of directors. The bylaws of a corporation may contain any provi- sion that is not in conflict with law or the articles of incor-poration. The board of directors has authority to adopt,amend, or repeal bylaws, unless that power is specificallyreserved for the shareholders under the articles of incorpo-ration or the WBCA, or unless the shareholders in adopt-ing or amending a bylaw specifically provide that theparticular bylaw may not be amended by the board ofdirectors. Shareholders also have concurrent authority toamend or repeal bylaws, or adopt new bylaws. Indemnification Rights . The WBCA contains a number of provisions requir ing or allowing indemnifica- tion of directors, officers, employees, or agents of the cor-poration for expenses and lia bilities they incur as a result of their positions with the corp oration. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a corporation mustindemnify a director or officer for reasonable expensesincurred if the director or officer was wholly successful inthe defense of a proceeding. A corporation has discretionto indemnify or advance expenses to a director for anyliability or expenses incurre d in a proceeding as long as certain standards of conduct ar e met. In addition, a corpo- ration has broad discretion to indemnify and advanceexpenses to officers, employees, or agents of the corpora-tion as provided in its articles of incorporation or bylaws,or through action of the board. \"Force the V ote\" Agreements . A \"force the vote\" agreement is a provision in an agreement regarding a pro- posed corporate action that re quires the board of directors to submit the proposed corpor ate action to a vote of the shareholders even if the boar d of directors determines later that it no longer recommends the action. \"Force the vote\" agreements are often used as deal protection devices inmerger agreements. In 20 08 the Committee on Corporate Laws of the American Bar Association Section on Busi-ness Law adopted amendments to the Model BusinessCorporations Act authorizing corporations to enter intoagreements containing \"force the vote\" provisions. Under the WBCA, there are a number of corporate actions that may be taken by the board of directors onlyupon approval of the sharehol ders. These include: (a) amendments to some provisions of the articles of incorpo-ration; (b) mergers or share exchanges; (c) the sale of theassets of the corporation other than in the regular course ofbusiness; and (d) dissolution of the corporation. With respect to all of these actions, the WBCA re- quires the board of directors to recommend adoption of theproposed action to the shareholders unless the board of di-rectors determines that it sh ould make no recommendation because of a conflict of interest or other special circum-stances. It is not clear whether \"force the vote\" agreementsare valid under these requirements in the WBCA. Summary: Revisions are made to provisions of the WBCA governing the powers of the board of directors, content and adoption of bylaws, indemnification rights fordirectors, officers, employees, and agents, and authority ofcorporations to enter into \"force the vote\" agreements. Board of Directors, Shareholders, and Bylaws . The authority of the board of dir ectors is revised to explicitly state that the board of direct ors has exclusive authority as to the substantive decisions concerning management ofthe corporation's affairs. House 98 0Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1053 12Provisions governing the co ntent of bylaws, and the authority of the board of directors and shareholders to adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws, are amended to specifical-ly state that bylaws may not contain a provision thatinfringes upon the exclusive authority of the board ofdirectors to make substantive decisions concerning themanagement of the corporation's business. In addition,these provisions are revised to reference the right of share-holders to alter these rules through unanimous shareholderagreements. Indemnification Rights . A new provision is added to the WBCA governing the vestin g of rights to indemnifica- tion or advancement of expenses for directors, officers,employees, or agents of a corporation. A right to indem-nification or advancement of expenses that is provided inthe articles of incorporatio n or the bylaws may not be eliminated or impaired after occurrence of the act or omis- sion that is the basis of th e proceeding for which indemni- fication or advancement of expenses is sought, unless theprovision specifically authorizes elimination of the rightafter the act or omission occurs. \"Force the V ote\" Agreements . A new provision is added authorizing a corporation to agree to submit acorporate action to a vote of the shareholders whether ornot the board of directors determines after approving thecorporate action that the boar d no longer recommends the action. Conforming amendments are made to provisionsof the WBCA governing ame ndments to the articles of incorporation, plans of merger or share exchanges, the sale of assets other than in the regular course of business, anddissolution. For any of these corporate actions, the boardof directors may submit the proposed action to the share-holders without recommending approval of the action ifthe corporation has agreed to submit the proposed action to the shareholders for approval.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1053 PARTIAL VETO C 329 L 11 Implementing recommendati ons from the Washington state bar association elder law section's executive committee report of the guardianship task force. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Moeller, Kenney, Ladenburg,Appleton, Roberts, Darneill e and Upthegrove; by request of Washington State Bar Association). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government Appropriations & OversightSenate Committee on Judiciary Background: Guardianship is a legal process through which a guardian is given the power to make decisions for a person who is determined to be \"incapacitated\" and therefore unable to take care of himself or herself. A per-son may be incapacitated if the individual is at a signifi- cant risk of financial harm because of an inability to manage his or her property or financial affairs or has a significant risk of personal ha rm because of an inability to provide for nutrition, health, housing, or physical safety. Appointment of a Guardian . The court may establish a guardianship over the person, the person's estate, or both. The court may also establis h a limited guardianship for persons who need protection or assistance because of anincapacity, but who are capable of managing some of theiraffairs. Any adult person residing in Washington may serve as a guardian unless the person is of unsound mind,has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, or isfound unsuitable by the court. Professional guardiansmust be certified by the Certified Professional GuardianBoard (Board) and must meet certain education, experi-ence, and training requiremen ts established by the Board. Guardians or limited guardian s must inform the court of a designated standby guardi an to serve the incapacitated individual if the original guardian dies or becomes inca-pacitated. When a court appo ints a standby guardian, the court must issue letters of guardianship authorizing the standby guardian to act on behalf of the incapacitatedperson. There is no explicit statutory requirement to issueletters of guardianship to gu ardians or limited guardians. Intermediate and Final Reports . Guardians and limit- ed guardians must file annual reports regarding the status of an incapacitated person's well-being. While guardians and limited guardians of estates typically must fileaccounts annually, the courts may schedule the filing requirement at intervals of up to 36 months if the value of the estate does not exceed more than twice the homesteadexemption. Guardians of esta tes belonging to minors need not file accounts unless the guardian has withdrawal powers. Upon the termination of a guardianship, guardians and limited guardians must file a final report and/or accountwithin 30 days of the termina tion of the guardianship and petition the court for an order settling an account within 90days of the termination. Recommendations of the Washington State Bar Asso- ciation . In 2007 the Elder Law Section of the Washington State Bar Association formed a task force to examine the performance of the guardiansh ip system in Washington. The task force issued a final report containingrecommendations for legislation. Summary: The guardianship laws are amended in several areas, including requiring gu ardians and limited guardians to complete training, requiring courts to issue letters of guardianship and review ac counts and reports filed by guardians and limited guardians, and creating deadlinesHouse 98 0Senate 46 013for certain guardianship proceedings. A filing fee is creat- ed for accounts of certain guardianship estates. Guardianship Appointments . Guardians or lay guard- ians who are not certified professional guardians or finan-cial institutions must co mplete any training made available by the Administrative Office of the Courts or thesuperior courts in the form of a video or webcast at no cost to guardians or limited guardians. An extension for or agood cause waiver of the completion of the trainingrequirement may be granted to guardians who wereappointed prior to the act's effective date and who alreadypossess the requisite knowledge to serve as a guardianwithout completing trai ning. A list of factors is provided for the court to consider wh en determining whether good cause exists to grant a waiver. A guardian or limited guardian may not act on behalf of an incapacitated person w ithout valid letters of guard- ianship. The court may issue letters of guardianship that are valid for a period of up to five years from the anniver- sary date of the appointment. A list of factors is provided for the court to consider wh en determining the time period for which the letters will be valid. Within 90 days of a guardian's appointment: the superior court may set a hearing for review of the initial personal care plan; guardians and limited guardians must designate a standby guardian; and guardians and limited guar dians are required to notify interested persons of thei r right to request special notice on the guardianship's proceedings. Immediate Final Reports . The deadline for the annual account or report must be set within 90 days of the anni- versary date of appointment, and the court must review it within 120 days of the anniversary date. The court mayreview and approve an account or report without conduct-ing a hearing. All court orders approving accounts andreports must contain a guardi anship summary, in the form set forth in the act. If a guardian or limited guardian fails to file an account and/or report or fails to appear at a hearing, thecourt must enter an order for one or more of the following actions: entering an order to show cause and requiring the guardian to appear at a he aring. At the hearing the court may remove the guardian and appoint a successor guardian; directing the clerk to extend the letters of guardian- ship for good cause shown for an additional 90 daysin order to permit the guardian to file his or her account or report; requiring the completion of training; appointing a guardian ad litem; or providing other relief as the court deems just and equitable.Upon the termination of a guardianship, the guardian or limited guardian is required to file the final report or ac- count and the petition for se ttling the account within 90 days. The deadline for the petition may be extended for good cause. Filing Fee . A filing fee must be charged to an incapac- itated person's esta te when the guardian or limited guard- ian files a required account with the court. The amount of the fee is determined by a sliding scale based on the totalnet fair market value of the estate. There is no fee if thetotal net fair market value of the incapacitated person's estate is equal to or less than $100,000. The court maywaive the fee or reduce the fee amount if payment of thefiling fee would result in substantial hardship.

By House Committee on La bor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsored by Representatives Hudgins, Green, McCoy, Eddy, Kenney and Reykdal; by request of Department of Labor & Industries). House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: The Contractor Registration Act requires general and specialty contractors to register with the Department of Labor and Industries (Department). Inaddition to registering, cont ractors must follow require- ments relating to advertising, bonds and insurance, andother matters. The Department may issue a notice of infraction to an unregistered contractor for failure to register and toregistered contractors for specified violations. Monetarypenalties are set forth. A party has 20 days to contest anotice of infraction by filing a notice of appeal with theDepartment. Appeals are heard by an administrative lawjudge (ALJ) with the Office of Administrative Hearings.Generally, penalties must be paid within 30 days of a finaldetermination by the ALJ. If an unregistered contractor defaults in payment of a penalty, the Director of the Department may issue a noticeof assessment. An unregistered contractor has 30 days tocontest the penalty by requestin g reconsideration or filing an appeal in court. Procedures are set forth for the Depart-ment to file a warrant in the amount of the assessment insuperior court and to enfo rce the warrant in the same manner as a judgment. Summary: The time period to appeal contractor infrac- tions is changed from 20 to 30 days. The separate 30-day time period for an unregister ed contractor to appeal a notice of assessment by reques ting reconsideration or fil- ing an appeal in court is elim inated. Instead, the notice of infraction serves as the notice of assessment for bothunregistered and registered contractor violations. If acontractor does not appeal a no tice of infraction within the 30-day appeal time period, the notice becomes final. The procedures for filing an d enforcing a warrant in court are made applicable to all penalties, not limited to penalties for unregistered contractors.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SHB 1061 C 256 L 11 Concerning on-site wastew ater treatment systems designer licensing. By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored byRepresentatives Green and Kelley). House Committee on Business & Financial Services House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy Background: Licensing of On-site Wastewater System Designers . On-site wastewater system designers are licensed and regulated by the Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (Board). Thelicensing requirement was enacted in 1999. Previous tothat, many local health ag encies had licensed designers. The law allowed for designers licensed under a localordinance to obtain a \"pra ctice permit\" to continue practicing. All practice permits expired on June 30, 2003. An \"on-site wastewater treatment system\" is an integrated system of componen ts that convey, store, treat, and/or provide subsurface so il treatment and disposal of wastewater effluent on the property where it originates oron adjacent or other property and includes piping, treat-ment devices, other accessories, and soil underlying thedisposal component of the initia l and reserve areas, for on- site wastewater treatment under 3,500 gallons per day when not connected to a public sewer system. \"On-site wastewater design\" means the development of plans, details, specifica tions, instructions, or inspec- tions by application of speci alized knowledge in analysis of soils, on-site wastewater treatment systems, disposalmethods, and technologies to create an integrated systemof collection, transport, distribution, treatment, anddisposal of on-site wastewater. License Requirements. A license to design on-site wastewater treatment systems is obtained by passing a written examination, having a high school diploma or itsequivalent, and having either at least four years of experi- ence, or two years of relevant college-level course workand two years of experience. Out-of-state experience inon-site design, inspection, and/or construction activitiesmay satisfy the necessary experience requirements. License Renewal. Licenses must be renewed annual- ly. A license not renewed for two years is canceled, andthe holder must reapply. To renew a license, the holdermust pay a fee and satisfy continuing educationrequirements establishe d by the Board. Unprofessional Conduct. Activities which constitute unprofessional conduct are specified. Upon finding aviolation, the Board may reprimand or fine a practice per-mit or license holder, or suspend, revoke, deny, or refuseto renew a license or permit. The work of licensedHouse 97 0Senate 46 0HB 1069 15designers must also comply with standards of practice adopted by the Board. Local Health Inspector Ce rtificates of Competency . Employees of local health jurisdictions who inspect, review, or approve the design and construction of on-sitesystems must obtain a certificate of competency by pass-ing the examination administered for licensing designers.A certificate of competency does not allow the holder toprovide on-site wastewater treatment design services.Certificates may be renewed by payment of a fee andsatisfaction of continuing education requirements. Summary: References to practice permits for designing on-site wastewater treatment systems are removed. It isunprofessional conduct, for disciplinary purposes, if anapplicant submits false, fraud ulent, or misleading infor- mation in an application for licensure or certification. Inaddition to individual s acting on behalf of the Director of the Department of Licensing, individuals acting on behalfof the Board are also immune from liability in any civilaction or criminal case for acts performed in the course of their duties. Changes are made to the experience and education requirements for licensure as an on-site wastewater treat-ment system designer. Rather than allowing applicants tosubstitute two years of the experience requirements bycompleting two years of colle ge-level work in specified subjects, applicants may e ither complete satisfactory college-level course work or successfully participate in a Board-approved internship program. The continuing education requirement for certificate holders is removed. The reciprocity requirements are also modified. Certain people licensed from jurisdictions outsideWashington to perform design services for site soil assess-ment, hydraulics, topographic delineations, use of special-ized treatment processes and devices, microbiology, andconstruction practices of on-site wastewater treatmentsystems may be granted a license without examination. Rather than requiring that the licenses be renewed annually, authority is granted to the Board to determine the renewal period for licenses and certificates. For determin- ing renewal fees, the pool of licensees and certificateholders is combined with engineer and land surveyorlicensees. Local health jurisdictions and the Washington State Department of Health retain authority to: administer state and local regulations and codes for approval or disapproval of designs for on-site waste- water treatment systems; issue permits for construction; evaluate soils and site conditions for compliance with code requirements; and perform on-site wastewat er treatment design work as authorized in state and local board of health rules.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Moe ller, Fitzgibbon and Frockt). House Committee on TransportationSenate Committee on Transportation Background: Executive Order E 1028, adopted by the Washington Secretary of Transportation on November 24, 2003, directs the Washington State Department ofTransportation (WSDOT) em ployees to implement a context sensitive solutions ap proach for all department projects. A context sensitiv e solutions ap proach means that the WSDOT employees working on projects andfacilities should engage affect ed communities, assure the transportation objectives ar e clearly described and discussed with the local co mmunities, recognize and address community and citizen concerns, and ensure the project is a safe facility for both the user and community.House 89 4Senate 47 0 House 97 0 Senate 47 0HB 1074 16The WSDOT's Office of Highways and Local Programs and the State Design Engineer are responsible for carrying out this Executive Order. \"Complete streets\" refers to the practice of designing and operating streets so that safe access is provided to allusers, including motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit users. With regard to city streets that are part of astate highway system, local communities have jurisdictionand responsibility for curb maintenance and improve- ments while the WSDOT is re sponsible for maintaining and preserving the street itself. The WSDOT may relin-quish control of street maintenance to the local jurisdiction. Summary: Complete Streets Grant Program . The Complete Streets Grant Program (Grant Program) is estab- lished in the WSDOT's Highways and Local Programs Di-vision. The purpose of the Grant Program is to encouragelocal governments to adopt urban arterial retrofit street or- dinances to provide safe access to all users including pe-destrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportationusers. When developing the Grant Program, the WS-DOT is to include local gove rnments, the Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, and other organi-zations and groups that are interested in the Grant Pro-gram. Projects that are eligible for grants must be from alocal government that has adopted a jurisdiction-wide complete streets ordinance that plans for the needs of all users and is consistent with sound engineering principlesand the project must be: a street retrofit project that includes the addition of, or significant repair to, fac ilities that provide street access with all users in mi nd including pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users; or a retrofit project on city streets that are part of a state highway that includes the addition of, or significant repair to, facilities that pr ovide street access with all users in mind. Sound engineering principles are defined as peer- reviewed context sensitive so lution guides, reports, and publications. The Comple te Streets Grant Program Account (Account) is created in the state treasury. The WSDOT may solicit and receive gifts, grants, or endow-ments from private and other sources and deposit thosefunds into the Acc ount. Moneys in the Account may only be spent after appropriation. The WSDOT must reportannually to the transportatio n committees of the Legisla- ture on the status of any grant projects funded by the grantprogram. State Highways that Include City Streets . The WSDOT must consult with lo cal jurisdictions in the design planning phases for new construction, reconstruc-tion, or major street repair projects which include citystreets that are part of a state highway and are initiallyplanned or scoped after July 1, 2011. This consultation must include public outreach, meetings with stakeholders,and identification of community goals and priorities. The WSDOT must consider the needs of all users by applyingcontext sensitive design solutions consistent with peer-reviewed context sensitive so lutions guides, reports, and publications. The WSDOT may use Grant Program fundsfor city streets that are part of a state highway.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1074 C 124 L 11 Changing qualifications fo r appointees to metropolitan water pollution abatemen t advisory committees. By Representatives Takko, Angel, Springer, Upthegrove and Fitzgibbon. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: State law authorizes any area of the state containing two or more cities, at least one of which has a population of 10,000 or more, to create a metropolitanmunicipal corporation to perform one or more of thefollowing functions: metrop olitan water pollution abate- ment; metropolitan public transportation; metropolitan garbage disposal; metropoli- tan parks and parkways; and metropolitan comprehensiveplanning. The legislative body of a municipal corporationis a metropolitan council (council). The council of a metropo litan corporation charged with performing water polluti on abatement must form a metropolitan water pollution abatement advi sory commit- tee (advisory committee) to advise the council in mattersrelated to the performance of the water pollution abate- ment function. Membership on the advisory committeemust include an appointee from each component city and county that operates a sewer system and a member of the board of commissioners of each water-sewer district thatoperates a sewer system, any part of which lies within themetropolitan area. Summary: The advisory committee of a metropolitan municipal corporation may include members appointed bythe boards of commissioners of qualifying water-sewerdistricts in the metropolitan area who are not commission-ers of those districts.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 56 41 Senate 29 19 (Senate amended)House 53 43 (House concurred) House 88 0 Senate 49 0SHB 1084 17SHB 1084 PARTIAL VETO C 355 L 11 Creating the board on geographic names. By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs (originally sponsored by Representatives McCoyand Hunt). House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: State Board on Geographic Names . In 1983 the Washington State Board on Geographic Names(BGN) was established. The purpose of the BGN was to: establish a procedure for the retention and formal recognition of existing geographical names; standardize the procedures for naming or renaming geographical features within the state; identify a responsible agency to coordinate geographic names among local, state, and federal agencies; avoid duplication of names for similar features; and retain the significance, spelling, and color of names associated with the early history of Washington.Membership on the BGN included: the State Librarian, or a designee; the Commissioner of Public Lands (Commissioner), or a designee; the chairperson ofthe Washington State Heritage Council; and four membersof the general public appo inted by the Commissioner. Specifically, the BGN was authorized to: establish the official na mes for the lakes, mountains, streams, places, towns, and other geographic features within the state; assign names to lakes, mountains, streams, places, towns, and other geographic features for which nosingle generally accepted name has been in use; cooperate with other public entities to establish, change and/or determine ap propriate names in order to avoid duplication of pl ace names within the state; serve as the state's liaison with the United States Board on Geographic Names; and issue a list of names approved by the BGN. The BGN members who were not public employees were compensated by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in the amount of $50 for attending official meetings, plus travel expenses. Members of theBGN who were public employees were compensated fortravel expenses by the agency that the person represented. The BGN was eliminated in 2010.Board of Natural Resources . The Board of Natural Resources (BNR) was established in 1986. The BNRperforms duties relating to appraisal, appeal, approval, andhearing functions provided by law and establishes policies to ensure that acquisition, management, and disposition of lands and resources are based on sound principlesdesigned to achieve the maximum effective developmentand use of such lands and reso urces. In addition, the BNR also constitutes the Board of Appraisers and theCommission on Harbor Lines. Membership includes: the Governor, or a designee; the Superintendent of Public Instruction; the Commission-er; the director of the University of Washington School ofForest Resources; the dean of the Washington StateUniversity College of Agricu ltural, Human, and Natural Resources Sciences; and a representative of those countiesthat contain state forest lands acquired or transferredpursuant to mineral interests. Summary: The BGN is reestablished as a constituted board of the BNR and has the same duties as the originalBGN. The BGN must establish a Committee on Geographic Names (Committee) to assist th e BGN in its duties and to provide broader contextual, pub lic, and tribal participation in the naming of geographic features in the state.Membership on the Committe e includes: the State Librarian, or a designee; th e Commissioner, or a designee; the director of the Department of Archaeology andHistoric Preservation, or a designee; a representative ofthe Washington state tribes ; and three members of the public, selected by the Comm issioner. The Commissioner is the chairperson for the Committee. The Committee must hold at least two meetings each year, and may hold special mee tings as called by the chair- person. The Committee is requ ired to establish rules of conduct in carrying out its duties. The Committee must cooperate with the United States Board on Geographic Names, and must make reports andrecommendations to the BG N following each meeting. Recommendations regarding adoption of names may only be made following consideration at two committeemeetings. The BGN must consider the recommendations made by the Committee for adoption of names and must eitheradopt the name as recomme nded or refer the matter back to the Committee for furthe r review. Names adopted by the BGN must be published in the Washington StateRegister. Secretarial and administrative support for the BGN is provided by the DNR. If specific funding for the Committee is not provided in the state omnibus operating appropriations act, the act isnull and void.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that contained a null and void clause.House 58 40 Senate 32 16 (Senate amended)House 60 37 (House concurred)ESHB 1086 18VETO MESSAGE ON SHB 1084 May 16, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 7, Substitute House Bill 1084 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to creating the board on geographic names.\"Substitute House Bill 1084 rec ognizes the need for a board on geographic names.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hunter, Alexander andDarneille; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state government operates on a fiscal biennium that begins July 1 of each odd-numbered year. The 2009-11 State Omnibus Operating AppropriationsAct (Operating Budget), as amended by the 2010 Supple-mental Operating Budget (Engrossed Second Substitute Bill 6444, Chapter 37, Laws of 2010, First Special Session) and House Bill 3225 (C hapter 1, Laws of 2010, Second Special Session), appropriated $30.5 billion fromthe State General Fund and two other accounts, togetherreferred to as the State Near General Fund. The totalbudgeted amount, which includes state and federal funds,is $60.2 billion. Summary: Appropriations are modified for the 2009-11 biennium. State Near General Fund appropriations are reduced by $242.2 million, while the total budgeted amount is reduced by $284.3 million.Votes on Final Passage: Conference Committee Effective: February 18, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed provisions related to a prohibition on th e Department of Information Services to spend fund s to equip the State Data Center, a 3 percent salary reduction for many non-represented state employees, savings from re ducing executive branch communications staff, savings from management efficien- cies in the Department of Social and Health Services, and savings from restrictions on dual language pay. VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1086 February 18, 2011 The Honorable Speaker and Members The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: First, I extend my appreciati on for the collaborative and bipar- tisan effort that has culminated in this early action supplemental operating budget. I fully recognize the difficult choices that you made in a short period of time. I asked the Legislatur e to consider an early target date for pas- sage of state General Fund reduc tions due to concerns about the feasibility of implementing major service alterations this late in the biennium. With the passage of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1086, we still face challenges about the timing of program cuts, es-pecially for reductions predic ated on a March 1 implementation date. I will continue to monitor the situation as agencies move for- ward with budget implementation, and keep you informed of issuesthat require additional consideration. As you wait for final caseload, enrollment and revenue forecasts for this biennium, I encourage your attention to those budget ad- justments and the small number of additions I included in my De- cember budget proposal. As one example, the en tire $30 million cut in information technology (IT) in the enacted 2009-11 budget cannot be achieved. Given the mu ltiple administr ative cuts al- ready specified in the budget, this IT cut will likely lead to unin- tended service reductions at such agencies as the Department of Social and Health Services and Department of Corrections. As I sign this appropriations bi ll, the 2011 legislative session is a little more than one-third complete. Many issues of critical im-portance to our state must still be addressed. I commit to working with you to craft a timely and responsible budget for the 2011-13 biennium. This is the time to set strategies in place that can be implement- ed and accomplish projected savings for now and the future. Be-cause some budget revisions do not meet that criteria, I am returning, without my approval as to Sections 123(5), 707, 708, 709, and 710, Engrossed Substitute House Bi ll 1086 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to fiscal matters.\" Section 123(5), page 32, Department of Information Services, Prohibition on Expenditures to Equip the State Data Center Budget language prohibits the De partment of Information Ser- vices from spending any funds fo r the purchase or installation of equipment for the new State Data Center. This prohibition will notsave any money, and will signific antly delay Data Center opera- tion and budget savings made possibl e by the consolidation of ex- isting data centers. While I agree with the intent to create more time for legislative involvement, this collaboration can take place without a restriction on the equipm ent necessary to make the Data Center operational with in its original budget. House 55 43 Senate 38 9 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur) Senate 37 10 House 55 412ESHB 1087 19For these reasons, I hav e vetoed Section 123(5). Section 707, page 211, 3 Percent Pa y Reduction This budget would cut the pay of many non-represented state employees by 3 percent beginning April 1, for a savings of $3.4 million in the state General Fund. While my 2011-13 budget pro- posal includes an employee pay cu t, the early im plementation date in this bill is not achiev able and would have unintended consequences. First, there is insufficient ti me for the necessary changes to be made to the state's payroll system to meet the April 1 implementa- tion date. In addition, while I belie ve that sacrifice s by state em- ployees, in addition to many ot hers, are essential during these tough times, I also be lieve that compensatio n reductions should be made fairly and compassionately. The Legislature's cut does not provide exceptions for workers who are paid the least and would have the most difficulty in absor bing this reduction to their pay- checks. Hundreds of employees making less than $30,000 a year would be affected by this pay cut while the pay of some higher- salaried employees would be unchanged. Lastly, a salary reduction should also recognize actions already taken. Thousands of state employ ees are already bringing home smaller paychecks as a result of temporary layoffs required by En- grossed Substitute Senate Bill 6503 enacted last year. Many of these employees will be temporarily laid off for one day each in April and June of this year. M any also will have a layoff day in May. This budget does not distinguish between employees who are subject to temporary layoffs duri ng this time period and those who are not. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 707. Section 708, page 211-212, Communications Staff Savings The budget requires agencies to achieve $1.0 million of savings through reductions in communications functions in the executive branch. The communications staff of the legislative and judicial branches would not be affected. Communications staff provide in- formation to the public, media, and legislators, which advances the goal of transparency in government. Given the importance ofthe work performed by these em ployees, ranging from providing information on real-time traffic to public health concerns to unem- ployment insurance and licensed child care facilities and the bud- get, it is difficult to see how th e public would be served through the sudden and dramatic elim ination of these staff. Marketing functions gene rate revenue in the State Lottery, state liquor stores, and correctional i ndustries, and stimulate economic development through promotion of tourism and agricultural prod- ucts. We will continue our effort s to create efficiencies such as abolishing non-essential reports, but the savings target is notachievable in the last thre e months of the biennium. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 708. Section 709, page 212, Management Efficiencies in the De- partment of Social and Health Services This section requires the Depart ment of Social and Health Ser- vices to achieve state General F und savings of $1.7 million by re- ducing management staffing and administration in addition to achieving other efficien cies. In reality, the reduction is closer to twice that amount because many of these positions are partially supported by federal or other fund sources. The department has already instituted signi ficant administrative and other reductions, including the elimination of 147 ce ntralized administrative staff, which represents a 27 percent reduction. Additional administra-tive reductions have b een made in every DSHS program. With the previously mentioned information technology cuts, these proposedreductions would jeopardize the de partment's ability to implement the program changes required in the budget. Therefore, I have vetoed Section 709.Section 710, page 212, Dual Language Pay Reductions This section restricts dual language pay, which is provided to some employees who are fluent in more than one language and usetheir language skills in the performance of th eir duties. The reduc- tion exceeds anticipated expenditures for this purpose in the re- mainder of the biennium. Furthe r, dual language assignment pay is included in the collective ba rgaining agreements that cover all but a fraction of these employees, which means that this reductioncannot be implemented. For these reasons, I hav e vetoed Section 710. With the exception of Sectio ns 123(5), 707, 708, 709, and 710, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1086 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hunter, Alexander andDarneille; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state government operates on a fiscal biennium that begins on July 1 of each odd-numbered year. Supplemental budgets frequently are enacted in eachof the following two years after adoption of the biennialbudget (each odd-numbered year). Appropriations aremade in the biennial and supplemental budgets for theoperation of state government and its various agencies and institutions, as well as for K-12 public schools. The 2009-11 State Omnibus Operating Appropria- tions Act (Operating Budget ), as amended by the 2010 Supplemental Operating Budget (Engrossed SecondSubstitute House Bill 6444, Ch apter 37, Laws of 2010, First Special Session), House Bill 3225 (Chapter 1, Lawsof 2010, Second Special Session), and EngrossedSubstitute House Bill 1086 (C hapter 5, Laws of 2011), appropriated $30.2 billion from the State General Fund and two other accounts, together referred to as State NearGeneral Fund.

VETO MESSAGE ON 2ESHB 1087 June 15, 2011 The Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning, without my approv al as to Sections 123(4); 125, 98, lines 8-11; 302(9); Engrossed Substitute entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to fiscal matters.\" I have vetoed the following approp riation items because of con- cerns with policy or technical i ssues relating to the legislative provisions: Section 123(4), page 14, St ate Auditor's Office, Fraud Ombudsman The State Auditor is provided funding for the work of the fraud ombudsman, whose office was to be created through passage of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5921 (relating to social services). Because I have vetoed the crea tion of the fraud ombudsman's of- fice within the State Auditor's Office, I have also vetoed Section123(4). Section 125, page 14, line 28, Attorney General's Office, Medicaid Fraud Penalty Account Section 213, page 68, line 12, Heal th Care Authority, Medicaid Fraud Penalty Account These appropriations, which were to be used to fund the Attor- ney General's Fraud Investigation Unit, are from a non-existent account. The budget assumed pa ssage of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5960 (relating to Medi caid fraud), which did not pass. As a result, the Attorney General's Office and Health Care Author-ity will need to use other sour ces of funding until an appropriate fund source can be identified in the 2012 supplemental budget. Be- cause this account does not exist, I have vetoed Section 125, page 14, line 28, and Section 213, page 68, line 12. Section 127(11), page 19, De partment of Commerce, Public Works Assistance Account Savings The administrative savings attributed to the Public Works Assis- tance Account is from the implem entation of Substitute Senate Bill 5844 (local government infrastruc ture), which did not pass. The Department should be afforded flex ibility in how it achieves its budget reductions. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 127(11). Section 129(4), page 23, Offi ce of Financial Management, Collective Bargaining for Health Insurance The requirement to propose empl oyee contributions to health insurance on a sliding scale is incompatible with Washington's collective bargaining statutes, which limit bargaining on health insurance to the amount of the em ployer contribution. It is also problematic to consider single el ements of collective bargaining in isolation. The existing statute re cognizes this by having the Gov- ernor negotiate the agreements in their totality, with input from theJoint Committee on Em ployment Relations. Further, sliding scale contributions would present impl ementation challenges. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 129(4). Section 129(5), page 23, Offi ce of Financial Management, Direct Deposit Fe asibility StudyThis proviso requires the Office of Financial Management (OFM) to conduct a feas ibility study on the im plications of man- dating direct payroll deposit for state employees, and to report to the legislative fiscal committee s by December 1, 20 11. OFM has already researched the feasibility of mandating direct deposit for all state employees. As a part of this research, stakeholders were contacted and concerns were raised regarding the impact of sucha mandate. Since the majority of state employees voluntarily use direct deposit, the am ount of effort required to make this change would outweigh the possible savings. For this reason, I havevetoed Section 129(5). Section 129(6), page 24, Office of Financial Management, Study to Use Digital Signatur es for Employment Actions This proviso requires OFM to conduct a feasibility study on the potential impacts of a system t hat would allow digital signatures for the purpose of employment acti vities. OFM is responsible for coordinating an unprecedented level of organizational and gov- ernmental service changes in th e 2011-13 biennium . It does not have the capacity to perform this study with existing resources. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 129(6). Section 129(8), page 24, Office of Financial Management, Washington State Quality Award Training Section 129(9), page 24, Office of Financial Management, Washington State Quality Award Assessment Section 129(10), page 24, Offi ce of Financial Management, Priorities of Government Program Information Section 925, page 204, Office of Financial Management, Em- ployee Performance Manage ment Training Tracking and Performance Management Section 129(8) provides $100,000 State General Fund for OFM to contract with the Washington State Quality Award for training, outreach, and assessments for publ ic agencies and public agency vendors. Section 129(9) directs the Government Management and Accountability Perform ance (GMAP) program to develop, in coordination with the Washington State Quality Award, a plan for all state agenc ies to complete a Washington State Quality Award or Baldrige full assessment by June 30, 2013. Section 129(10) requires the Prio rities of Government program to include in its report the Washington State Quality Award assess- ment score for agencies. Section 925 adds requirements related tothe Washington State Quality Award and Baldrige assessments and the tracking of employee performance manage ment training. Given the unprecedented level of 2011-13 budget reductions, I be- lieve our existing GMAP process is more cost-effective. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 129(8), Section 129(9), Section 129(10), and Section 925. Section 139(3) and (4), pages 27-28, Consolidated Technology Services Agency, Consoli dated State Data Center These provisos set forth a number of conditions that must be met prior to equipping and operating th e new state data center. These restrictions will significantly impede the ability of state agenciesto use this asset. We are in the process of implementing all of theseconditions (appointing a new Chie f Information Officer, adopting technical standards for shared se rvices, developi ng competitive rates for data center services, and developing a detailed imple- mentation plan). However, work to design and equip the data cen- ter network and infrastructure must proceed to maintain thecurrent schedule to migrate state agency data centers to the new consolidated data center. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 139(3) and Section 139(4). Section 201(5) , page 35, Depar tment of Social and Health Services, Food Procurement Cost Information Section 219(14), pages 91-92, Department of Health, Food Procurement Cost Information Section 220(1)(b), page 93, De partment of Corrections, Food Procurement Cost Information Section 221, page 96, lines 8-14, Department of Services for the Blind, Food Procurement Cost Information These provisos direct these age ncies to compile and submit food procurement costs to the Department of Health. No funding was provided to collect or analyze this data. Given the amount of ad- ministrative reductions to be incurred by these departments,2ESHB 1087 21additional unfunded requirements cannot be completed. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 201(5), Section 219(14), Section 220(1)(b), and Section 221, page 96, lines 8-14. Section 202(8), pages 38-39, De partment of Social and Health Services -- Children and Family Services, Foster Care Reduction Workgroup In 2010, the Office of Financ ial Management, Department of Social and Health Services (DSH S), and Washington State Casel- oad Forecast Council developed a plan to reinvest resources from foster care savings and presented it to the Governor and theLegislature. Section 202(8) instructs DSHS to establish a workgroup to du- plicate the work that has already been performed. In addition, no resources were provided to comple te this task. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 202(8). Section 202(11), page 39, Depart ment of Social and Health Ser- vices -- Children and Family Se rvices, Administrative Reductions Section 205(2)(c), page 54, Department of Social and Health Services -- Developm ental Disabilities, Administrative Reductions Section 207(9), page 64, Depar tment of Social and Health Services -- Economic Servic es, Administra tive Reductions Whenever possible, state agenc ies reduce administrative ex- penses before reduci ng services. The Department has made signif- icant progress in finding ways to improve services to Washington residents while reducing costs. Ho wever, given the significant re- ductions in administrative activities made in the past few years, additional reductions cannot be lim ited to administrative reduc- tions and will likely impact services. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 202(11), Section 205(2)(c), and Section 207(9). Section 205(1)(j), page 53, Department of Social and Health Services -- Developmental Disabilities, Community First ChoiceOption This proviso requires the Depart ment to determine whether it would be cost-efficient for the st ate to exercise a 1915(k) Medicaid waiver and submit a plan to the Le gislature during the next legis- lative session. I am directing the Department to conduct this re- view and move forward with implementing the waiver if the findingdemonstrates that it is cost-efficient, instead of waiting for the sub- sequent legislative session. For th is reason, I have vetoed Section 205(1)(j). Section 205(2)(d), page 54, De partment of Social and Health Services -- Developmental Dis abilities, Frances Haddon Morgan Center and Yakima Valley School This proviso directs that no resident shall be moved from these residential habilitati on centers unless and until the Department has the \"appropriate and suitable\" community option and services available as specified in the cl ient's individual habilitation plan. The terms \"appropriate and suitabl e\" are subjective and would be difficult to implement. I am directing the Department to keep thewellbeing of the residents at th e forefront as these moves take place. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 205(2)(d). Section 206(17), page 61, Departme nt of Social and Health Ser- vices -- Aging and Adult Services , Community Firs t Choice Option The Department must determine wh ether it would be cost-effi- cient for the state to exercise a 1915(k) Medicaid waiver, and sub- mit a plan to the Legislature in th e next legislative session. I am directing the Department to conduc t this review and move forward with implementing the waiver if th e find ing demonstrates that it is cost-efficient, instead of waiting for the s ubsequent legislative session. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 206(17). Section 209(1), page 66, Depar tment of Social and Health Services -- Vocational Rehabilitation, Servi ng Lifeline Clients This proviso, which applies to the entire 2011-13 biennium, di- rects the Department to serve Lifeline clients; however, the Life- line program terminates on Oc tober 31, 2011. I am, however, directing the Department to make every effort to continue to serve clients receiving public as sistance, within the requirements of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. For this reason, I have vetoedSection 209(1). Section 213(16), pages 74-75, Health Care Authority, Disability Lifeline Managed Care The reference to Disability Life line is no longer valid becausethe Disability Lifelin e program no longer exis ts effective Novem- ber 2011. I am directing the Health Care Authority to contractmanaged care services in a way that maximizes patient outcomes in the most cost effective manner. For this reason, I have vetoedSection 213(16). Section 213(17), page 75, Heal th Care Authority, Impact Evaluation for Disability Lifeline The Health Care Authority is directed to evaluate the impact of a managed care delive ry system on state costs and outcomes for Lifeline medical cl ients. No funding was provided for this evaluation. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 213(17). Section 213(34), page 79, Health Care Authority, Power Wheelchairs The state must meet the medical necessity test as a condition of operating a Medicaid program. This proviso creates a confusing situation by prohibiting the current limitation of power wheel-chairs to clients in school or work . As a cost savings step, reducing power wheelchairs is preferable to many other service reduction options. The state should be allowed to establish a benefit designthat meets federal standards without overly prescriptive budget provisos. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 213(34). Section 213(38), page 80, Health Care Authority, Federally Qualified Health Clinics This proviso directs payments to federally qualified health cen- ters and rural health clinics. On lines 22-23, the proviso referenc- es the incorrect years, which w ould result in deeper reductions than is intended. I am, however, directing the Health Care Author- ity to implement the reductions in accordance with the appropria- tion amounts. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 213(38). Section 213(47), page 82, Heal th Care Authority, State Pharmacists Contract The agency is directed to contra ct with an organization that will use state pharmacists to provid e medication therapy management services to lower costs and improv e patient compli ance. No other state Medicaid program in the c ountry has implemented this pro- gram and achieved savings. For th is reason, I have vetoed Section 213(47). Section 213(48), page 82, Health Care Authority, Report on Not-For-Profit Disproportionate Share Hospitals This proviso requires the agenc y to evaluate community benefit information provided by disproportionate share hospitals and re- port to the Legislature with an as sessment of improved measures for charity care efforts. No resources were provided to conduct this evaluation. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 213(48). Section 218(2) (a), page 87, De partment of Vete rans Affairs, Identify and Assist General As sistance Unemployable Clients The General Assistance Unempl oyable program no longer ex- ists. I am directing the Departm ent of Social and Health Services and the Department of Veterans Af fairs to continue working col- laboratively to help public assist ance clients access veterans' ben- efits for which they qualify. For th is reason, I have vetoed Section 218(2)(a). Section 220(2)(a), page 93, De partment of Corrections -- Priority of Pe rsonnel Reductions Section 220(3)(a), page 94, De partment of Corrections -- Priority of Pe rsonnel Reductions The Department continues to lo ok for administrative and other reductions that minimize impact on custody staff and correctional industries. However, given the significant expenditure reductions made in the past few years, it is critical that the Department has flexibility in how it achieves its budget reduc tions. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 220(2)(a) and Section 220(3)(a). Natural Resource Agency ConsolidationSeveral appropriations in Se cond Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1087 assume the passage of Engrossed Second Substitute Sen- ate Bill 5669 (Consolidating natur al resources agencies and pro- grams); however, this bill did not pass. Appropriation bill language signals a legislative inte nt to shift Fiscal Year 2013 fund- ing among agencies to reflect th e new organizational structure created in Engrossed Second Subs titute Senate Bill 5669. These discrepancies will need to be reconciled duri ng the 2012 legisla- tive session. Initial steps can be taken now through some vetoes of2ESHB 1087 22unneeded consolidation-related pr ovisos that contain duplicative information or technical errors. For these reasons, I have vetoed the following sections: Section 301, page 98, lines 8- 11, Columbia River Gorge Commission Section 302(9), page 101, Department of Ecology Section 302(10), page 101, Department of Ecology Section 310, page 110, lines 25-28, Washington Pollution Liability Insurance Program Section 303(4), page 102, St ate Parks and Recreation Commission, Land Purchase The Commission is prohibited from expending state monies to purchase or acquire lands other th an those called for in Senate Bill 5467 (capital budget) or House Bill 1497 (capital budget). A technical problem is created by the fact that the House bill cited is only one of the two capital budget b ills that passed the Legislature. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 303(4). Section 307(12), page 107, Departm ent of Fish and Wildlife, Purchase of Lands This proviso restricts the De partment from expending state monies to purchase or acquire additional lands other than those called for in Senate Bill 5467 (capital budget) or House Bill 1497 (capital budget). The House bill cited is only one of the two capital budget bills that passed the Legisl ature. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 307(12). Section 308(10), pages 109-110, Department of Natural Resources, Marine Rents Committee This proviso directs the Departm ent to convene a marine rents review committee in order to ex plore ways to refine and improve the method for calculating rent s for marinas occupying state- owned aquatic lands. A report and recommendations are due tothe Legislature by December 1, 2011. Since no funding was pro- vided to complete this report, I have vetoed Section 308(10). I am however, asking the Commissioner of Public Lands to review paststudies on this subject, discuss th e issue with all affected stake- holders and prepare legisl ation for next session. Section 312, pages 111-112, Depart ment of Agriculture, De- partment of Ecology, and Stat e Conservation Commission - Livestock Operations Review Three agencies are required to conduct a process to review the impact of livestock operations on water quality, and to make rec- ommendations by December 31, 201 1. In March, these agencies committed to conducting a review process similar to this one;however, this proviso expands that process without an increase in funding. For this reason, I have veto ed Section 312. I am directing these agencies to continue the process they committed to during the legislative session. Section 401(4), pages 113-114, De partment of Licensing, House Bill 2017 - Master Licens e Service (MLS) Transfer This proviso prohibits the Depar tment of Revenue from reim- bursing the Department of Licensi ng for costs related to transfer- ring the Master License Service program after July 1, 2011. Thisrestriction limits the agencies' ability to facilitate a seamless transfer of the program, as requi red by Substitute House Bill 2017. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 401(4). However, I am di- recting the Department of Licensing to expedite the transfer in or- der to minimize the work and costs t hat will be incurred in the next biennium. Section 501(1)(a)(iv), page 11 7, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Electron ic Certification System The Office of the Superintendent of Pu blic Instruction and the Office of Financial Management are required \"to work to allocate sufficient funding from the federa l grant funds for the state's P-20 longitudinal data sy stem, to the extent allowable, for the purpose of developing and implementing a new electronic certification sys- tem.\" The P-20 grant links student education data across time and databases, from early childhood to career, by funding data tech- nology projects at ten state agencies . As drafted, this proviso plac- es construction of the electronic certificati on system ahead in the funding priority line, in front of all other pr ojects. Addi tionally, the electronic certification sy stem can be built with fees authorized in Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1449, a funding source not avail-able for the other projects. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 501(1)(a)(iv). However, I am dire cting OFM to explore the use of grant funds for the syst em's construction, if funds are available and consistent with the administrat ion of other projects in the P-20 program. Section 601(6)(c), page 155, Higher Educa tion, Salary Increases from Other Sources This proviso authorizes salary increases from sources other than the State General Fund for instructional and research facultyat the state's universities and Th e Evergreen State College. This authority conflicts with Engr ossed Substitute Senate Bill 5860, which freezes state government sa laries unless agencies or insti- tutions demonstrate di fficulty in retaining qualified employees. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 601(6)(c). Section 605(3), page 160, State Board for Community and Technical Colleges, Administrative Efficiencies The State Board for Community and Technical Colleges is di- rected to achieve $7 million in savings through efficiencies, in- cluding consolidation of college districts and administrative and governance functions. The State B oard will achieve the required savings, but the proviso is overly prescriptive. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 605(3). Section 610(9), page 167, The Evergreen State College, Controlled Substances Study This proviso directs the Washington State Institute for Public Policy to study the costs and bene fits to state and local govern- ments and the citizens of Washingt on from implementation of the state's policies on \"controlled s ubstances, excluding alcohol, to- bacco and pharmaceuticals.\" The re ality is that these are con- trolled substances under federal law. It is unwise to spend taxpayer dollars on a study that cannot address the fundamental issues in this policy area. Theref ore, I have vetoed Section 610(9). Section 613(2)(b), page 168, Higher Education Coordinating Board -- Financial Aid and Grant Programs, State Need Grant Scholarships for Private College Students This proviso limits State Need Gr ant award in Fiscal Year 2012 for private college students to th e level of students attending pub- lic regional unive rsities. This would redu ce Need Grant awards to levels below current practice. This proviso was included in the bill as a result of a technical drafti ng error. Appropriations in the bud- get are not based on this unintended restriction. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 613(2)(b). Section 613(4), page 169, Highe r Education Coordinating Board, Financial Aid and Grant Programs -- Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs Project This proviso would restrict the use of funding in an appropria- tion from the Education Legacy Trust Account. This apparently isa technical bill drafting erro r, because no such appropriation exists in this section. Therefor e, I have vetoed Section 613(4). Section 617(7), page 173, Depar tment of Early Learning, Eligibility for Working Connections Child Care This proviso prohibits the De partment of Early Learning from making rules that reduce the income eligibility criteria of theWorking Connections Child Care program to below the current level of 175 percent of the federa l poverty level. Such a limitation infringes on my aut hority to manage the WorkFirst program, which includes the Working Connections Child Care program. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 617(7). Section 617(11), page 173, De partment of Early Learning, Child Care Copayment Structure This proviso directs the Departm ent of Early Learning to imple- ment a child care copayment structure that gradually increases thecopayments of parents in the Wo rking Connection Child Care pro- gram based on income and other fa ctors. Additional ly, the proviso includes multiple directives a bout how the copayment structure should be developed. The Departme nt of Early Learning is already beginning work on potential child care copayment structures that smooth out the tiers in the curren t model. The parameters of this proviso unnecessarily limit the age ncy's options. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 617(11). Section 716, pages 182-184, O ffice of Financial Management, Agency Reallocation and Realignment CommissionSHB 1089 23Section 716 creates the Agency Reallocation and Realignment Commission with responsibilities for examining current state op- erations and organization, and making proposals to reduce expen- ditures and eliminate duplication and overlapping services. The sum of $100,000 in State General Fu nd dollars is provided for this purpose. During the Priorities of Government acti vity conducted during the summer of 2010, I appoi nted an external stakeholder team that performed similar re sponsibilities envisioned for this commission. Several of the public 's suggestions, including the merger of central service func tions, were proposed in my budget and enacted by the Legislature. Since we already have mecha-nisms to perform many of the sa me responsibili ties without addi- tional expense, this commission is not needed. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 716. Section 805, page 192, lines 35- 37, and page 193, lines 1-18, State Treasurer, Conditions on Life Sciences Discovery Fund These provisos place seven conditions on the Life Sciences Dis- covery Fund (LSDF). With the exce ption of subsection 1 these con- ditions decrease its autonomy and overall efficacy. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 805, page 192, lines 35-37; and page 193, lines 1-18. Section 934, page 212, Amending the State Civil Service Law, RCW 41.06.022 Section 935, pages 212-218, Ame nding the State Civil Service Law, RCW 41.06.070 Section 934 makes two changes to the current civil service law for the duration of the 2011-13 biennium: (1) Any manager whose position is eliminated and who tr ansfers to a different position shall be compensated at a level no higher than commensurate with the new position, and (2) No manage r whose position is eliminated shall have reversion rights to cl assified position unless the em- ployee was employed in the positi on, or a substant ially equivalent one, within three years prior to the effective date of this act. Sec- tion 935 requires that any exempt employee whose position is eliminated and who trans fers to a different position shall be com- pensated at a level no higher th an commensurate with the new po- sition. It is inappropriate to uni laterally and retroactively change the terms of employment for empl oyees who have served with suf- ficient excellence to be promot ed to leadershi p positions. Revok- ing guarantees made when these employees accepted offers to serve in management pos itions is simply unwarranted. In addition, the language is written in such a way that it would be applied un-evenly to employees in equivale nt situations, based on the pre- sumed specific budget reduction that might apply in a given case. This approach would also make it distinctly more difficult for stateagencies to promote from within th e ranks of their employees. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 934 and 935. Section 978, page 271, Reports on Ensui ng Biennium Impact of Budget Proposals While I am supportive of the inte nt to provide ensuing biennium impact statements on legislative and executive budget proposals,this language originated as se parate legislation and is more ap- propriately implemented as a change to sta tute, not as part of an appropriations bill that expires in two years. Furthermore, the in-formation required for both th e State General Fund and other funds is far more detailed than necessary for a statewide budget outlook. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 978. A number of appropriations in Second Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1087 are contingent upon passage of separate legisla-tion, with legislative direction that the appropriations will lapse if the bills are not enacted. The following vetoes relate to bills thatdid not pass: Section 134(4), page 26, Departm ent of Retirement Systems, Substitute Senate Bill 5846 (Retired public employees) Section 144(1), page 29, Liquor Control Board, House Bill 2043 or Senate Bill 5916 (L iquor related products) Section 144(2), page 29, Liquor Control Board, House Bill 2043 or Senate Bill 5917 (Co-located contract stores) Section 206(16), page 61, Departme nt of Social and Health Ser- vices, Engrossed Second Substi tute House Bi ll 1901 (Reshaping the delivery of the l ong-term care system) Section 217(3), page 86, Department of Labor and Industries,Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1701 (Contractor misclassification) Section 219(11), page 91, Depar tment of Health, Substitute House Bill 1468 (Public wa ter system permits) Section 219(17), page 92, Depa rtment of Health, Substitute Senate Bill 5542 (Cigar lounge and tobacconist shop special license) Section 401(3), page 113, Departm ent of Licensing, Substitute House Bill 1205 (Court reporter licensing) Section 501(1)(i), pages 118-119, Office of the Superintendent of Public Instructi on, House Bill 2111 (Implementing Quality Education Council recommendations) Section 610(3), page 165, The Evergreen State College, En- grossed Second Substitute House Bill 1443 (Continuing education reforms) Section 721(2), page 186, Trans portation agencies, Senate Bill 5920 (Limiting annual increase amounts) Section 724, page 187, Substitute Senate Bill 5846 (Health benefit subsidies) For these reasons, I have lines 8-11; 302(9); Substitute H ouse Bill approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SHB 1089 PARTIAL VETO C 356 L 11 Regarding instructional materi als provided in a special- ized format. By House Committee on Higher Education (originally sponsored by Representative McCoy). House Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: Upon request by a public or private institu- tion of higher education acting on behalf of a student witha print access disability, a pu blisher of instructional materials must, unless tech nically unable, provide the institution any instructional material in an electronic format mutually agreed up on by the publisher and the institution. This includes computer files or electronic versions of printed instructio nal materials, video materials captioned or accompanied by transcriptions of spokentext, mpanied by transcriptions. EHB 1091 24These must be provided in a timely manner and at no additional cost to the institution. A request from an institu tion to a publisher for materials in a specialized format must be in writing andinclude the institution' s certification that: the student has a print a ccess disability preventing the student from utilizing the st andard format material; the material is for the student's use in connection with a course in which the st udent is enrolled; and the student or the in stitution has purchased the material in its standard fo rmat prior to requesting the specialized format. A publisher may require that requests for specialized format materials also includ e a statement signed by the student promising that the material will be used solely for the student's own purposes and that the student will notcopy or duplicate the material for use by others. An insti- tution that allows students to use specialized format instructional material must take precautions to ensure students do not copy or distri bute the material in violation of federal copyright laws. An institutions may also arrange on its own for the transcription or translation of standard format materialsand may share the specialized formats created with otherstudents who have print ac cess disabilities, including students at other institutio ns. Each institution must establish guidelines for implementation and administra-tion of requests for, and use of, instructional materials inspecialized formats. The Americans with Disa bilities Act (ADA) is a federal law whose purpose is to provide a clear andcomprehensive national mandate for the elimination ofdiscrimination against pe rsons with disabilities. Summary: The Legislature finds that the knowledge, skill, and ability to succeed both academically and later in a chosen profession are accumulated through manysources, including instructio nal materials. Generally, an institution that provides a specialized format version ofinstructional material may not require that the studentreturn the specialized format version. There is a limited exception to this prohibition on requiring the return of the sp ecialized format version when the institution has: (1) determ ined that it is not required to allow the student to retain the material under the ADA or other applicable laws; and (2) translated or transcribed thematerial into the specialized format at its own expense and the cost to reproduce a copy of the translation ortranscription is greater than $100. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the intent section which found that the knowledge, skill, and ability to succeed in a chosen prof ession are accumulated through many sources, including instru ctional materials, and stated that it was the intent of th e Legislature to ensure that students be permitted to retain specialized format versions of instructional materials if they so desired. VETO MESSAGE ON SHB 1089 May 16, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 1, Substitute House Bill 1089 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to instructional materials provided in a specialized format version.\" I am vetoing the intent section, Section 1 of the bill, because it is broader than the substantive language in the bill. Vetoing the in- tent section may avoid confusi on and does not impede implemen- tation of the bill. For this reason I have vetoed Se ction 1 of Substitute House Bill 1089. With the exception of Section 1, Substitute House Bill 1089 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor EHB 1091 C 4 L 11 Modifying the unemployment insurance program. By Representatives Sells, Reykdal and Kenney; by request of Governor Gregoire. House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: The unemployment compensation system is designed and intended to provide partial wage replace- ment for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own. Most covered employers pay contributions(taxes) to finance benefits. Eligible unemployed workers receive benefits based on their earnings in their base year.The Employment Security Department (Department)administers this system. 1. Taxes . An employer's taxes are based on the tax rate assigned to the employer and the taxa ble wage base. The tax rate includes an experience rated factor, a social cost factor,and, when the balance in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (Trust Fund) me ets certain conditions, a solvency surcharge. (There is currently no solvencysurcharge.) The experience rated factor (or \"array calculation factor\") is based on the employer's rate class. An employ-er is assigned to one of 40 rate classes depending on theHouse 97 0Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred) EHB 1091 25employer's layoff experience. For rate classes one and 40, the rates are 0.00 percent and 5.40 percent. For rate classes two through 39, the rates range from 0.11 percentto 5.30 percent. The social cost factor is a percentage of costs not directly charged to an employer. First, a flat rate iscalculated as the difference between benefits paid and taxes paid, divided by total ta xable payroll. The flat rate is adjusted for months of bene fits in the Trust Fund. (For rate year 2010, the flat rate wa s 1.22 percent. For rate year 2011, the flat rate is calculated to be 1.70 percent.) Then, multipliers are used to calculate graduated rates. For rateclasses one through 11, the multipliers range from 78percent to 118 percent. For rate classes 12 through 40, themultiplier is 120 percent. The tax rate is the sum of the experience rated factor and the social cost factor, and may not exceed 6.0 percent.The tax rate is capped at 5.4 percent for certain seasonalindustries (agricultural cr ops, livestock, agricultural services, food and seafood processing, fishing, and coldstorage). 2. Benefits . a. Benefit amounts . An individual's weekly benefit amount is 3.85 percent of th e average of the individual's wages in the two quarters of the base year in which wageswere highest. Under certain circumstances, an alternative method may be used to establish a base year. The maximum amount payable weekly is 63 percent of the state average weekly wage. The minimum amountpayable weekly is 15 percent of the average weekly wage.As of July 1, 2010, the maximum amount is $570 and theminimum amount is $135. The maximum amount of regular benefits payable in an individual's benefit year is the lesser of 26 times theindividual's weekly benefit amount or one-third of the individual's base year wages. (This amount is commonlyexpressed in terms of duratio n. In those terms, the maximum duration of regular benefits is 26 weeks.) b. Modernization incentive payment . As part of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(ARRA), the United States Congress approved up to $7billion in special transfers or \"modernization incentivepayments\" to states with unemployment in surance laws that meet certain requirements. One-third of the payment is contingent on state law providing for an alternative base year. Washington hasalready received the one-third payment (approximately$49 million). Two-thirds of the payment is contingent on state law providing for at least two of the following: No disqualification from benefits for voluntarily quitting employment for compelling family reasons. No denial of benefits to part-time workers seeking only part-time work. Continuation of weekly benefits for exhaustees in state-approved training. Dependents' allowances of at least $15 per dependent per week. Washington has not yet qualified to receive the remaining two-thirds pa yment (approximately $98 million). The deadline by which states must apply to receive the payment is August 22, 2011. c. Training benefits . The training benefits program allows an eligible individual to receive additional benefits while he or she is in retraini ng. The following individuals who are unemployed may be eligible to receive training benefits: dislocated workers; low-wage workers; militarypersonnel and National Guard members; persons who are disabled. A dislocated worker is defi ned as an individual who: (1) has been terminated or r eceived a notice of termination from employment; (2) is unlikel y to return to employment in his or her principal occu pation or previous industry because of a diminishing dema nd for his or her skills; and (3) is eligible for or has exhausted benefits. The individual must submit a training plan to the Department within 90 days of the individual's notification of the program's requirements and must enter the approved training program within 120 days (unless these deadlines are waived for good cause). The individual must beenrolled in training on a fu ll-time basis (except when a disability precludes such enrollment). The training must target a high demand occupation and may include vocational training or courses needed asa prerequisite to that training. The training may notinclude courses primarily in tended for completion of a baccalaureate degree. An individual may qualify for this program only once every five years. The Department must verify that anindividual is eligible to wo rk in the United States before the individual receives training benefits. The maximum amount of trai ning benefits payable in an individual's benefit year is 52 times the individual'sweekly benefit amount (less we eks of regular benefits and extended benefits paid). The weekly benefit amount is the same as the amount the individual receives as regular benefits. The amount isreduced if the individual re ceives any \"remuneration\" in the week. The reduction is based on a statutory formula(75 percent of the amount of the remuneration in excess of$5). Training benefits are subject to available funding from the Trust Fund. Funding is capped at $20 million for each fiscal year. Any funds not oblig ated in one fiscal year may be carried forward to the next fiscal year. Training bene-fits are not charged to the experience rating accounts ofemployers. For an individual who is in the training benefits program, training benefits ar e payable for up to two years beyond the end of the benefit year of the regular claim. EHB 1091 26d. Extended benefits . During periods of high unem- ployment, the extended benefits program may provide additional weeks of benefits to individuals who have exhausted other benefits. The indicators of highunemployment are based on the current unemploymentrate and how it compares to unemployment rates during atwo-year look-back period. The federal Tax Relief,Unemployment Insurance Re authorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the 20 10 Act) authorizes states, through 2011, to use a three-y ear look-back period in place of the two-year look-back period. One indicator used to de termine whether extended benefits are payable is based on the seasonally adjustedtotal unemployment rate (SAT UR). If the SATUR is at least 6.5 percent for the most recent three months and atleast 110 percent of the SA TUR for the same period in either of the two preceding calendar years, extended ben-efits are payable. (Based on th is indicator, up to 13 weeks of extended benefits were payable beginning in February2009. Another indicator ma de up to seven additional weeks of extended benefits payable beginning in May 2009, for a total of up to 20 weeks.) The federal government and the state usually split the cost of extended benefits. The federal government beganpaying the full cost of extended benefits pursuant to theARRA, and will continue doing so through 2011 pursuantto the 2010 Act. For an individual who is eligible for emergency unemployment compensation, the eligibility period for extended benefits is defined as the period consisting of the week ending February 28, 2009, through the week endingMay 29, 2010. The 2010 Act authorizes states to continueto permit an individual to qualify for extended benefits after exhausting emergency unemployment compensation, and provides for the eligibility period to continue through2011. Summary: 1. Taxes . The formulas used to calculate the social cost factor are changed for rate year 2011 and thereafter. For rate classes one through 20, the flat rate is capped. If there are more than 10 months of benefits in the Unemployment Insurance Trus t Fund (Trust Fund), the cap is 1.22 percent. If there are 10 months of benefits orless in the Trust Fund, the cap is 1.22 percent or 150 percent of the previous year's flat rate, whichever isgreater. Also, the multiplie rs used to calculate the graduated rates are reduced. The range is 40 percent to116 percent of the flat rate (instead of from 78 percent to120 percent). For rate classes 21 through 40, the flat rate is capped in the same manner as for other rate classes. Thegraduated rate continues to be 120 percent of the flat rate. 2. Benefits . a. Temporary benefit increase . An additional $25 is added to an individual's weekly benefit amount.Corresponding increases are made to the maximumamount of regular benefits payable (maximum duration),the maximum amount payable weekly, and the minimumamount payable weekly. The temporary benefit increase is applicable to claims with an effective date on or after March 6, 2011, andbefore November 6, 2011. Except for individualsreceiving extended unemployment compensation orextended benefits, the temporary benefit increase is notadded in any week after the total amount of temporarybenefit increases for all weeks equals $68 million. Weeks of emergency unemployment compensation and extendedbenefits are not considered in calculating the total amount. During the two-year period consisting of Fiscal Years 2012 and 2013, a total amount equal to the total amount of temporary benefit increases is requisitioned first from the Trust Fund, if the remaining modernization incentivepayment is credited to the Trust Fund. The temporary benefit increase is not charged to the experience rating accounts of employers, and is not con-sidered when calculating the social cost factor rate. It alsodoes not count when determining eligibility for AppleHealth for Kids, the Basic Health Plan, and Working Connections Child Care. b. Training benefits . The training benefits program is modified for claims on or after July 1, 2012. The definition of \"dislocated worker\" is expanded. A dislocated worker is an individual who: (1) has beeninvoluntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at theindividual's place of employment, or has separated from adeclining occupation; and (2 ) is eligible for or has exhausted benefits. For dislocated workers, certain deadlines and require- ments are eliminated. These ar e: the 90-day application deadline and the 120-day en rollment deadline; the full- time enrollment requirement; and the five-year limitation on qualifying for training benefits. The requirement thatthe Employment Security Department (Department) verify employment elig ibility is continued. The maximum amount of tr aining benefits payable is modified. The maximum amount is reduced only byweeks of regular benefits (instead of regular benefits andextended benefits). The reduction to an individual's weekly benefit amount for any remuneration in the week is changed. The reduction is 50 percent (instead of 75 percent) of theremuneration in excess of $5. The cap on funding for training benefits is modified. Funding continues to be lim ited to $20 million per fiscal year, in addition to any funds carried forward fromprevious fiscal years. Howe ver, if available funding is equal to or less than $5 millio n, training benefits are not obligated for low-wage work ers, military personnel and National Guard members, and persons who are disabled.If funds are exhausted, training benefits are obligated toSHB 1103 27dislocated workers only, and available funding for the following year is reduced by a corresponding amount. Upon approval of an individual's training benefits plan, regular benefits are not charged to the experiencerating accounts of employers. The Department is required to include the following in annual program reports: assessments of employment outcomes; an analysis of whether training leads to employment in high-demand occupations, whether degrees or certificates are required to obtain employment, and the number of participants who take courses in basic language, reading, or writing skills; an analysis of the type of work participants were engaged in prior to unemp loyment, and whether they return to their previous em ployer within two years, or are employed in a field for which they were retrained; a projection of program costs for the next fiscal year; and an analysis of the total funds obligated for training benefits and the net ba lance remaining to be obligated. The Joint Legislative Aud it and Review Committee (JLARC) is required to review and evaluate the training benefits program in three year s and every five years there- after, as well as in any y ear in which the Department suspends obligation of training benefit funds or totalexpenditures exceed $25 million. The JLARC must: assess whether the program complies with legislative intent, is effective, and operates in a manner which results in optimum performance; and make recommendations on program improvements. After a JLARC review is co mpleted, legislative com- mittees must hold public hearings and consider changes. c. Extended benefits . The look-back period for indicators of high unemployment used to determine whether extended benefits are payable is changed for2011. A three-year look-back period may be used instead of the two-year look-back period. The period during which training benefits are payable is extended. For individuals who are eligible for extended benefits because of the three- year look-back period, train- ing benefits are payable for up to three years beyond theend of the benefit year of the regular claim. The eligibility period for extended benefits is also extended through 2011. The e ligibility period consists of the week ending February 28, 2009, and applies asprovided under the federal Tax Relief, UnemploymentInsurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010,as it existed on December 17, 2010, or a subsequent dateprovided by the Department by rule. 3. Other . The Commissioner of the Department is given author- ity and discretion to make determinations to remedy anyconflicts with federal requirements.

At theHouse 98 0 Senate 41 4 House 90 3 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred)SHB 1105 28conclusion of the review, the DSHS must issue a report on the results within 180 days after the date of the child's death. The Governor may extend the due date. The DSHSmust distribute the report of th e child fatality review to the appropriate legislative committees and post all reports ofthe review to a public website maintained by the DSHS. In the case of a near fatality, the DSHS may conduct areview; it is not mandatory. The Office of the Family and Children's Ombudsman . The Office of the Family and Children's Ombudsman (OF-CO) was created in 1996 to protect children and parentsfrom harmful agency action or inaction, and to make agency officials and state policy makers aware of system-wide issues in the child protection and child welfare system. The OFCO is part of the Governor's Office andoperates independently from the DSHS and other stateagencies, acting as a neutral fact-finder, not as an advo-cate. The OFCO's responsib ilities include investigating complaints related to child pr otective services or child welfare services, monitoring the procedures used by theDSHS in delivering family and children's services, and providing information about the rights and responsibilitiesof individuals receiving family and children's services andthe procedures for providing those services. To performthese duties, the OFCO has authority: to interview children in state care; to access, inspect, and copy all records, information, or documents in the DSHS's possession that the OFCO considers necessary to conduct an investiga- tion; and to have unrestricted online access to the case and management information system operated by theDSHS.The OFCO is required to is sue an annual report to the Legislature on the implementa tion of the recommenda- tions from reviews of child fatalities. The DSHS must notify the OFCO: in the event of a near fatality of a child who is, or was within the past 12 months, in the care of or receiving services from the DSHS; and whenever a referral of child abuse or neglect consti- tutes the third founded refe rral on the same child or family within a 12-month period. Autopsy Report . Reports of autopsies or postmortem examinations are confidentia l and are released only by statutory authority. The Secretary of the DSHS is not authorized to receive a report of an autopsy for purposes of conducting a required child fatality review. Summary: Child Fatality Reviews . The DSHS must con- duct a child fatality review when a fatality of a child is suspected of being caused by abuse or neglect. The DSHS must consult with the OFCO to determine if a review should be conducted if it is not clear whether a child's death was the result of child abuse or neglect. The DSHSmust assure that persons assi gned to a child fatality review team have no previous invo lvement in the child's case. A child fatality review repo rt is subject to public disclosure and must be posted on the public website. The DSHS is expressly authorized to redact confidential infor-mation contained in a review report according to existing state and federal laws protecting the privacy of victims ofchild abuse and neglect, incl uding laws regarding the confidentiality of postmo rtem and autopsy reports. Near Child Fatality Reviews . In the event of a near fatality of a child, the DSHS must promptly notify theOFCO. The DSHS may conduct a review at its discretionor at the request of the OFCO. Access to Files . The DSHS and the fatality review team must have access to all records and files from asupervising agency that pr ovided services to the child while under contract with the DSHS. Civil or Administrative Proceedings . A child fatality or near fatality review is subject to discovery in a civil oradministrative proceeding. However, any use oradmission into evidence is limited as follows: Employees of the DSHS may not be questioned in a civil or administrative proceeding relating to the work of the child fatality review team, the incident under review, the employee's statements, thoughts, or impressions or those of the review team members or others who provided information to the review team. A witness may not be examined regarding his or her interactions with the child fatality or near fatality review, including whether the person was interviewedduring the review, questions asked during the review, and answers provided by the person. Documents prepared for a review team are inadmissi- ble in a civil or administrative proceeding. Docu-ments that existed before u se or consideration by the review team or that were created independently of a fatality or near fatality revi ew may still be admissible. The limitation also does not apply to licensing or dis-ciplinary proceedings relating to the DSHS's effortsto revoke or suspend a licen se based on allegations of misconduct or unprofessional conduct connected witha near fatality or a fatality being reviewed. Autopsy Report . The Secretary of the DSHS is autho- rized to receive a report of an autopsy for purposes of conducting a required child fa tality review.

By House Committee on La bor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsored by Representatives Moeller and Sells).House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Under the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act (Act), local government and certain other public employees have the right to organize and designatecollective bargaining representa tives. In the event that acovered employer and a bargaining representativedisagree as to the selection of a bargaining representative,the Public Employment Relations Commission (Commis-sion) must be invited to inte rvene. State law and Commis- sion rules designate proc edures for the Commission's intervention. The Commission may conduct an election to ascertain the exclusive bargaining representative. If aprospective bargaining representative shows written proofof at least 30 percent representation of the employeeswithin the unit, the Commissi on must hold an election. In each application for certification as an exclusive bargaining representative the Commission must decide theappropriate unit for collective bargaining. In determining,modifying, or combining a bargaining unit, the Commis-sion is required to consider: the duties, skills, and working conditions of the employees; the history of collectivebargaining by the employees and their bargainingrepresentatives; the extent of organization among theemployees; and the desire of the employees. Unfair labor practices fo r covered employers and bargaining representatives are enumerated in the Act. TheCommission is directed to prevent unfair labor practices and issue appropriate remedial orders. It is an unfair laborpractice for a covered employer to: interfere with, restrain, or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights; control, dominate, or interfere with a bargaining representative; discriminate against a pu blic employee who has filed an unfair labor practice charge; or refuse to engage in collective bargaining. Summary: In the event that a covered employer and a bargaining representative disagree as to the merger of twoor more bargaining units in the employer's workforce that are represented by the same bargaining representative, theCommission must be in vited to intervene. It is an unfair labor practice for a covered employer to refuse to bargain with the certified exclusive bargainingrepresentative.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 96 1 Senate 45 0 House 93 2Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 93 2 (House concurred)2SHB 1128 302SHB 1128 C 330 L 11 Providing support for eligible foster youth up to age twenty-one.

Title IV-E of the Social Security Act authoriz es federal funds for states to provide foster care for children under an approved stateplan. To be eligible for T itle IV-E funding, a child must meet the eligibility requirem ents, including requirements regarding age, whether there has been a deprivation ofparental support or care, and whether there has been ajudicial determination that remaining in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare. Federal funding isprovided for foster children who are enrolled in highschool or a GED program until age 19. Definition of Juveniles . For purposes of juvenile court, the terms \"juvenile,\" \"y outh,\" and \"child\" are synon- ymous under Washington law. With some exceptions, ajuvenile is any individual under the age of 18 years. Foster Care to 21 . For at least the past two decades, the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS), hasbeen authorized to provide continued foster care or groupcare for youth between the ages of 18 and 21 years in orderto support the youths' completion of high school or voca-tional school programs. In 2005 legislation was enacted authorizing the DSHS to provid e continuing foster care or group care for youth between the ages of 18 and 21 yearswho are enrolled in post-secondary education or trainingprograms. The practice of providing continuing fostercare past age 18 for post-secon dary and related purposes is commonly referred to as Foster Care to 21. The enacting legislation for Washington's Foster Care to 21 program provides that, beginning in 2006, the DSHSis authorized to allo w 50 youth to remain in foster care af- ter reaching age 18. In addition to the first 50 youth, an ad-ditional 50 youth could also enter the program in 2007 and2008. In 2010 there were 83 slots available. As of January2011, 66 youth were enrolled in the program. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 . In October 2008 the U.S. Con- gress approved, and the President signed, the FosteringConnections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Act). The legislation includes a variety of provi-sions, both mandatory and pe rmissive, intended to reform aspects of child welfare programs. Some of the changestook effect immediately and others are phased in over aperiod of years. The mandatory provisions in the Actinclude the following: developing health care oversight and coordination plans for children in foster care; requiring due diligence in identifying and notifying adult relatives of children placed in foster care; ensuring school-age children in foster care are enrolled in school and re quiring school stability issues to be addressed in children's case plans; negotiating in good faith with Indian tribes seeking to develop their own foster care program using federal moneys; notifying prospective adoptive parents of federal adoption tax credits; and requiring children's case plans to include a transition plan for youth aging out of foster care. The DSHS has determined it can, for the time being, implement the mandatory provisions without a change in state law. One of the key changes permitted by the Actincludes allowing states to use foster care funds to provide Foster Care to 21 placement services to youth engaged ina broader array of qualifying activities. The federal fund-ing attached to this provisio n became available October 1, 2010. Foster Care to 21 and Ot her Transitional Supports . In 2009 Engrossed Second Subs titute House Bill 1961 was enacted clarifying the Foster Care to 21 statute to allowcontinued enrollment in the pr ogram, subject to the avail- ability of appropriated funding. Under that bill, eligibilityto remain in foster care or group care continued until the youth turned 21 years old if he or she adhered to programrules and remained enrolled in a post-secondary program. Beginning October 1, 2010, the type of activities necessary to qualify for Foster Care to 21 was expanded toreflect the activities eligible fo r use of federal funds. The DSHS is authorized to prov ide continued foster care or group care up to age 21, within amounts appropriated forthis specific purpose, for youth who are: enrolled and participating in a post-secondary program; participating in a program to promote, or reduce barriers, to employment; working 80 or more hours per month; or incapable of participatin g in school, work, or other activities due to a medical condition supported with regularly updated information. In lieu of Foster Care to 21 placement services and within amounts appropriated fo r this specific purpose, the DSHS may provide adoption support or relative guardian- ship benefits on behalf of youth who achieved permanen-cy through adoption or a guar dianship after age 16 and who are engaged in one of the activities listed above. Eligibility for continued su pport or subsidy payments continues until the youth reaches age 21. Summary: Definition of Juveniles . In addition to indi- viduals under 18 years of age, a juvenile, child, or youth is an individual age 18 to 21 who is eligible to receiveHB 1129 31extended foster care services. Once the youth turns 21, he or she is no longer eligible to receive extended foster care services. Those who are determined to be a \"juvenile,\"\"child,\" or \"youth\" as a result of receiving extended foster care services are not considered to be a \"child\" under anyother statute or for any other purpose. Extended Foster Care Serv ices/Court Jurisdiction . Extended foster care services are defined as residentialand other support services that the DSHS is authorized toprovide to foster children. They include the following: placement in licensed, relative or otherwise approvedcare; supervised independent living settings; assistance in meeting basic needs; independ ent living services; medical assistance; and counseling or treatment. When a child or youth in foster care reaches age 18, his or her parent or guardian is dismissed from the depen-dency proceeding. The dependency court must postponethe dismissal of the dependency petition in its entirety for six months after a child in foster care turns 18. This sixmonth postponement allows th e youth who is eligible for extended foster care services time to request those servicesafter turning 18. At the end of the six-month period, if theyouth has not requested extend ed foster care services, the court must dismiss the dependency. After the youth turns18 and before the youth requests the DSHS to provideextended foster care services, the DSHS is not required tosupervise the youth's dependen cy. As long as the youth continues to agree to particip ate in extended foster care services, he or she is under th e care and placement author- ity of the DSHS. The court must dismiss the dependencyat the request of the youth wh o has turned 18 or when the youth is no longer eligible to receive extended foster care services. The requirement to conduct six month review hear- ings on the case plan for and the delivery of servicesapplies to youth receiving extended foster care servicesand should be applied in a developmentally appropriatemanner. At the hearing, the court must also consider the following: whether the youth is safe in his or her placement; whether the youth continues to be eligible for extended foster care services; whether the current pl acement is developmentally appropriate for the youth; whether the youth is developing independent living skills; and whether the youth is making progress towards transi- tioning to full independen ce and the projected date for achieving such transition. The court must appoint co unsel to represent youth who continue in a dependency after his or her 18th birthday. Foster Care to 21 . The statutory provisions regarding the Foster Care to 21 program are recodified into aseparate section, distinct from the statutory provisions regarding extended foster care services. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1129 C 17 L 11 Including a bicycle and pedestrian traffic safety curriculum in certain traffic schools and safety courses. By Representatives Klippe rt, Liias, Billig, Rolfes, Fitzgibbon, Reykdal, Ryu, Finn Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: In Washington, individuals may defer one moving and one non-moving traffic violation every seven years. As a condition of this deferral, a court may impose such conditions as the court fi nds appropriate, which often includes attendance at a dr iver improvement school or traffic school. If the individual meets all of the requiredconditions and has not committed another infraction, thecourt may dismiss the infractio n at the end of the deferral period. The Department of Licensing (DOL) is responsible for overseeing the commerci al driver training school program. The DOL is also responsible for providing thedriver training school curriculum to each applicant for aninstructor or driver training school permit. In addition to information on the safe, lawf ul, and responsible operation of motor vehicles, the curriculum must include informa-tion regarding the in termediate driver's license restrictions and sanctions, the effects of al cohol and drug use on motor vehicle operators, and the importance of safely sharing theroad with bicycles, ped estrians, and motorcycles. Summary: Jurisdictions that cond uct traffic schools in connection with a condition of a deferral, sentence, or penalty for a traffic infraction or a traffic-related criminaloffense are required to util ize the curriculum for driving safely among bicyclists and pedestrians approved by theDOL. This addition to the traffic school curriculum doesnot require that more than 30 minutes be spent on thecurriculum.

By Representative Haigh; by request of Office of Financial Management. House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Initiative 728 (I-728), approved by the vot- ers in November 2000, created the Student Achievement Fund and dedicated certain state revenues to supportvarious school reform activ ities in public schools. The allowable uses for I-728 funding include: reductions in K-4 class size; selected class size reduction in grades 5-12; extended learning opportunities for students; investments in educators and their professional development; early assistance for children who need pre-kindergar- ten support; and providing improvement or additions to facilities to support class size reductions.The funding sources for the Student Achievement Fund have been modified several times by the Legislature. Beginning in 2001, portions of state property tax and statelottery revenues were dedicat ed to the Student Achieve- ment Fund. Beginning in 2004, I-728 directed that thestate property tax contribution to the Student AchievementFund was to increase to $450 per student full-time equiv- alent (FTE) and that lottery revenues would be deposited in the School Construction Fund. The 2003 Legislaturerevised the property tax per student contributed to theStudent Achievement Fund to $254 for 2004, $300 for2005, $375 for 2006, $450 for 2007, and an amountadjusted annually fo r inflation thereafter. By law, $278 of the per pupil allocations must be supported with stateproperty tax revenues, with the remainder supported bythe Education Legacy Trust Account, which is supportedby cigarette taxes and the estate tax. Each year, school districts must submit a plan to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction outlining plans for the expenditure of I-728 revenues. Additionally,before every May 1, school boards must hold a publichearing on the proposed use of the new money. During the2007-08 school year, about 52 percent of the funding wasused for class size reduction, about 20 percent was usedfor professional development, about 10 percent was usedfor extended learning programs, and the remainder wasused for a variety of initia tives such as early childhood programs and facilities improvements. During the 2009 legislative session, the Student Achievement Fund was brought into the State GeneralFund and accordingly was renamed the Student Achieve-ment Program. The 2009-11 base budget included a $131per student allocation in th e 2009-10 school year, which was funded by $2 00 million in federal funding from the American Recovery and Reinve stment Act. No funding was provided in the 2010-11 school year. Chapter 541, Laws of 2009 (Substitute House Bill 2356) made 2009-11 allocations from the StudentAchievement Program subject to appropriations in thestate omnibus operating approp riations act (operating bud- get), and further, required per student allocations to returnto their original value adjusted for inflation, had they not been suspended during the 2009-11 biennium. In the2011-12 school year, that allocation would beapproximately $476 per eligible student FTE. Summary: Per student allocatio ns from the Student Achievement Program in 2011-13 are made subject to appropriations in the operating budget. Additionally, therequirement is eliminated to fund per student funded rates beginning in the 2011-12 scho ol year that are equal to what they would been if rates had not been reduced duringthe 2009-11 biennium. (Based on November economicforecast data, the per student rate would be about $476 per eligible student beginning September 1, 2011.)

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representative Haigh; by request of Office ofFinancial Management). House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Initiative 732 . Initiative 732 (I-732) was approved by the voters in the November 2000 general election. It requires the stat e to provide an annual Cost-of- Living Adjustment (COLA) for K-12 teachers and otherpublic school employees, as well as community collegeand technical college academic employees and classifiedemployees at technical colleges. The COLA is based onthe Seattle-area Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the most recently completed calendar year. In 2003 after the Washington Supreme Court ruled in McGowan v. State regarding interpretation of the state'sfunding obligation, the statute was enacted to specify thatHouse 71 25 Senate 27 17SHB 1133 33the state must provide fundin g for cost-of-living increases for K-12 state-funded fo rmula staff units only. Legislation was enacted to suspend I-732 for the 2003-05 biennium. Therefore, no COLAs were provided for the 2003-04 or 2004-05 school years. However, asalary adjustment was provided that biennium for stateformula certificated instructional staff in their first sevenyears of service. Legislation again suspended I-732 for the 2009-11 biennium. In addition, Chapter 573, Laws of 2009(Substitute House Bill 2363) specified that the suspended COLAs in the 2009-11 biennium would be made up in theensuing biennia. Specifically, statute requires that salary rates must be adjusted such th at, by the end of the 2014-15 school year, base salaries used in state allocation formulas are, at a minimum, what th ey would have otherwise been if COLAs had not been suspended during the 2009-11biennium. Initiative 732 COLA adjust ments assumed in the 2009-11 maintenance level budget are 4.2 percent for the2009-10 school year, and 0.6 percent for the 2010-11school year. According to the November 2011 forecastfrom the Economic Revenue and Forecasting Council, theSeattle CPI is 0.4 percent fo r calendar year 2010 (applica- ble to school year 2011-12) and 1.9 percent for calendaryear 2011 (applicable to school year 2012-13). National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Program . The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) provides an opportunity for teachers to seek an advanced teaching credential by undertaking arigorous application process. Once earned, the certifica-tion is valid for 10 years. The application process requirescandidates to complete 10 assessments that are reviewedby trained educators. The assessments include four port- folio entries that featur e teaching practice and six constructed response exercises that assess subjectknowledge. The NBPTS program was created in 1987after several important research reports documentedemerging needs for outcomes-based professional develop-ment in the teaching profe ssion. The NBPTS program is framed around five core principles which shape therequirements of certific ation. They include: 1. Teachers are committed to students and their learning. 2. Teachers know the subjects they teach and how to teach those subjects to students. 3. Teachers are responsible for managing and monitor- ing student learning. 4. Teachers think systematically about their practice and learn from experience. 5. Teachers are members of learning communities. Washington is in its 10th year of participation in the program. In 2000 Washington had 71 NBPTS-certifiedteachers. The Office of the Superintendent of Public In-struction (OSPI) projects 5,247 in the 2010-11 school year,and nearly 1,450 in 2010-11 candidates in process withportfolios due March 31, 2011. Additionally, the OSPI offers a conditional loan that funds $2,000 of the $2,500 fee for beginning the processof the NBPTS certification. The loan is competitive andmust be repaid once a candidate achieves certification andreceives a bonus. The co nditional loan was accepted by just under 1,000 candidates in school year 2009-10, and800 candidates in 2010-11. The maintenance-level budget for fiscal year 2011 assumes 5,022 teachers w ill receive the NBPTS base bonuses of $5,090 per teacher the 2010-11 school year,while 1,353 teachers will receive additional $5,000 NBPTS bonuses for teaching in high poverty schools. Certificated Instructiona l Staff Salary Schedule . The state allocates funding to school districts for certificatedinstructional staff (CIS) based on a salary schedule that is established each year in th e state omnibus operating appropriations act (operating budget) and is subject toconditions and limitations contained in the operatingbudget. Previous salary schedules have contained \"incre-ments,\" under which the schedule includes increased sala-ry allocations for CIS staff as they gain additional years of experience or educational credits. Educational credits areeligible for inclusion in the salary schedule if they meet criteria specified in statute. Summary: Initiative 732 COLAs are suspended for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years for both K-12 and applicable higher educatio n employees. Additionally, bonuses for teachers certifie d under the NBPTS program are subject to appropriations in the operating budget forthe 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1135 C 224 L 11 Regarding refrigerants for motor vehicles. By House Committee on Environment (originally sponsored by Representatives Finn, Armstrong andUpthegrove). House Committee on Environment Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Federal Significant New Alternatives Poli- cy. The Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program is the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency's (EPA) program to ev aluate and regulate substi- tutes for ozone-depleting ch emicals that are being phased out under the federal Clean Air Act. Pursuant to its authority under the SNAP prog ram, the EPA has published a list of safe alternative motor vehicle air conditioningsubstances that are non ozone-depleting chemicals. Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning Equipment . Washington law prohibits air conditioning equipmentfrom containing any refrigerant that is toxic or flammable,unless the refrigerant is incl uded in the list published by the EPA as a safe alternativ e motor vehicle air condition- ing substitute for chlorofluo rocarbon-12. Air conditioning equipment is defined in statute. A person may not sell, equip, or operate on any high- way any motor vehicle with air conditioning equipmentunless it complies with state law. The Washington State Patrol (WSP) may adopt and enforce safety requirements and regulations (applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning equipment) consistent withthe current recommended practice or standard approvedby the Society of Automotive Engineers. The Department of Ecology . Under the federal Clean Air Act, states have the optio n to implement either federal motor vehicle emission standards or California motorvehicle emissions standards for passenger cars, light dutytrucks, and medium duty passenger vehicles. Legislationwas enacted adopting Californi a motor vehicle emissions standards and authorizing the Department of Ecology(DOE) to adopt rules to implement these standards. Summary: Air conditioning equipment may not containany refrigerant that is toxic or flammable, unless therefrigerant is allowed un der motor vehicle emission standards rules adopted by th e DOE (instead of the list published by the EPA for safe alternative motor vehicle airconditioning substitutes for chlorofluorocarbon-12). Provisions related to selling or operating a motor vehicle with air conditioning equipment are modified andlimited to new motor vehicles. The provision allowing the WSP to adopt safety requirements and regulations applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning equi pment is removed.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy, Armstrong, Morris,Kristiansen, Chandler, Pearson and Kenney). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Department of Licensing (DOL) issues special vehicle license plates that may be used in lieu of standard plates. A governmental or nonprofit sponsoringorganization seeking to sponsor a special plate eithersubmits an application to the DOL or requests legislation to create the special plate. For special license plates that are enacted by statute, a sponsoring organization must, within 30 days of enact-ment, submit prepayment of a ll start-up costs to the DOL. If the sponsoring organization is not able to meet the prepayment requirement, revenues generated from the saleof the special license plate ar e first used to pay off any costs associated with establishing the new plate. Thesponsoring organization must also provide a proposedlicense plate design to the DOL. Additionally, the spon-soring organization must submit an annual financial reportHouse 92 3Senate 49 0 House 93 4Senate 44 4 (Senate amended)House 92 5 (House concurred)SHB 1145 35to the DOL detailing actual revenues generated from the sale of the special license plate. There is a moratorium on the issuance of new special license plates until June 30, 2011. Summary: The volunteer firefighter special license plate is created, which would depict a symbol, description, or artwork that recognizes voluntee r firefighters. In addition to all fees and taxes required to be paid upon application for a vehicle registration, a fee of $40 would be chargedfor a volunteer firefighter special license plate and a $30renewal fee would be charged for renewal of a volunteer firefighter special license plate. The DOL must apply allfees collected from the volunteer firefighters speciallicense plate towards administration and collectionexpenses incurred by the DOL. An applicant for the ini tial volunteer firefighter special license plate must be a volunteer firefighter for atleast one year or have been a volunteer firefighter for at least 10 years, and must have documentation of servicefrom the appropriate fire serv ice district. The volunteer firefighter special license plate must be surrendered if thevolunteer firefighter leaves fi refighting before 10 years of service has been completed. If the volunteer firefighterstays in service for at least 10 years and then leaves, thelicense plate will be retained by the former volunteer fire- fighter, and the person will c ontinue to pay the future reg- istration renewals. A qualifying firefighter may have nomore than one set of plates per vehicle and a maximum oftwo sets per applicant for their personal vehicles. If thevolunteer firefighter is conv icted of a felony, the license plate must be surrendered upon conviction. The DOL is required to annually report the status of the volunteer firefighter special license plate to the JointTransportation Committee. Th e volunteer firefighter spe- cial license plate is exempt from the temporary moratori- um on special license plates.

By House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness (originally sponsored by RepresentativesOverstreet, Hurst, Klippert, Hinkle, Angel, Ross, Nealey,Warnick, Kirby, Short, Fagan, Hunt, Kelley, Eddy, Bailey,Kenney, McCune and Condotta; by request of AttorneyGeneral).House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Washington's theft statute punishes a person based upon the value of the property stolen. A person commits theft if he or she: wrongfully obtains or ex erts unauthorized control over the property or services of another with intent to deprive him or her of the property or services; by color or aid of deception, obtains control over the property or services of another with the intent todeprive him or her of the property or services; or appropriates lost or misdelivered property or services of another with intent to deprive him or her of theproperty or services. A person commits Possession of Stolen Property if he or she knowingly receives, retains, possesses, conceals, or disposes of stolen property knowing that it has been stolenand withholds or appropriates the property to the use of any person other than the true owner. Washington's criminal statute does not have a specific crime relating to Mail Theft or Possession of Stolen Mail. Generally, federal law governs most postal crimes. Under the federal statute, a pe rson is guilty of Obstruction of Mail if he or she takes any letter, postal card, or packageout of any post office or any authorized depository for mailmatter, or from any letter or mail carrier, or takes mailwhich has been in any post office or authorized depository,or in the custody of any letter or mail carrier, before it hasbeen delivered to the person to whom it was directed, with the intent to obstruct the correspondence, to pry into thebusiness or secrets of another, or to open, secrete,embezzle, or destroy the mail. The penalty is up to fiveyears of imprisonment, up to $250,000 fine, or bothimprisonment and a fine. Summary: Mail Theft . A person is guilty of Mail Theft if he or she: (1) commits th eft of mail addressed to three or more different mailboxes; and (2) commits theft of a minimum of 10 separate pieces of stolen mail. Each set of10 separate pieces of stolen mail addressed to three or more different mailboxes constitutes a separate anddistinct crime and may be punished accordingly. MailTheft is an unranked class C felony offense (carrying amaximum sentence of up to 12 months in jail). Possession of Stolen Mail . A person is guilty of Possession of Stolen Mail if he or she: (1) possesses stolenmail addressed to three or more different mailboxes; and(2) possesses a minimum of 10 separate pieces of stolenmail. \"Possesses stolen ma il\" means to knowingly receive, retain, possess, conceal, or dispose of stolen mailknowing that it has been stolen , and to withhold or appro- priate the use of it to any person other than the true owneror the person to whom it is addressed. The fact that theHouse 94 0Senate 46 2 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1148 36person who stole the mail has not been convicted, apprehended, or identified is not a defense to the charge of possessing stolen mail. Each set of 10 separate pieces ofstolen mail addressed to three or more different mailboxesconstitutes a separate and distinct crime and may bepunished accordingly. Posse ssion of Stolen Mail is an unranked class C felony offense. If a person commits any ot her crime in the commis- sion of Mail Theft or Possession of Stolen Mail, thatperson may be prosecuted for the additional crimes. \"Mail\" is defined as any le tter, postal card, package, bag, or other item that is addr essed to a specific address for delivery by the United States Postal Service or anycommercial carrier performing the function of delivering similar items to residences or businesses, provided themail: (1) is addressed to a specific name of an individual person or with a family name or specific company, business or corporation name on the outside of the item of mail or on the contents insi de; and (2) is not addressed to any general unnamed occupant or resident of the addresswithout an identifiable person or company, business, or corporation on the outside or the inside of the item; and has been left for collection or delivery in a letter box, mailbox, mail receptacle, or other authorized deposi- tory for mail, given to a mail carrier, or left with any private business that provides mailboxes or mail addresses for customers or when left in a similar location for collection or delivery by any commercialcarrier; is in transit with a postal service, mail carrier, letter carrier, commercial carrier, or is at or in a postalvehicle, postal station, mailbox, postal airplane,transit station, or similar location of a commercial carrier; or has been delivered to th e intended address, but has not been received by the intended addressee.

By House Committee on Agricu lture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Blake andKretz). House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) is authorized to conduct experimental or trial emerging commercial fisheries. An emerging commercial fishery allows for the commercial taking of a newly classified fish, a formally classified fish with a newgear type, or a formally classi fied fish in a new geographic area. Trial emerging fish eries allow for an unlimited number of participants. Experimental emerging fisheriesallow the WDFW to limit the number of authorized partic-ipants. Fisheries with a lim ited number of allowable participants are called limited-entry fisheries. An emerging fishery was created for coastal spot shrimp in 1999. The Director of the WDFW (Director) isauthorized to issue a total of 15 experimental permits for an annual fishery that is open March 15 throughSeptember 15. During the annual time window, fisheryparticipants are permitted to harvest up to a total of200,000 pounds of spot shrimp in combined catch using amaximum of 500 shrimp pots per participant. Experimen-tal fishery participants are prohibited from an incidentalcatch of any salmon, bottomfish species, or more than 50pounds of other shrimp species. Octopus and squidincidental catch are permissible. Spot shrimp (also known as Pandalus platyceros ) is the largest species of shrimp found on the west coast of North America and can be fo und in subtidal rocky and sandy habitats from San Diego, California to waters off ofUnalaska Island, Alaska. Sp ot shrimp are reddish with longitudinal white stripes on the carapace and a distinctive white spot on the sides of the first and fifth abdominalsegments. Summary: A new limited-entry commercial fishery license is created. This new license, the Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license (spot shrimplicense), allows the holder to use spot shrimp pot gear toHouse 95 3Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 95 1 (House concurred)HB 1150 37fish for spot shrimp, possess sp ot shrimp, and arrive at port with spot shrimp. The annual fee for the new license is $185 for residents and $295 for non-residents. Each spotshrimp license holder must designate a correspondingvessel meeting designated size requirements that is ownedor operated by the license holder to use in the fishery. The spot shrimp license is a limited-entry license that must be renewed prior to the end of each calendar year toremain active. Only participants in the 2010 coastal spotshrimp experimental emerging commercial fishery, andtransferees from a 2010 fisher y participant, may purchase an initial spot shrimp license. Initial spot shrimp license holders are eligible to transf er their license beginning in the year 2012. Although the initial offering of spot shrimp licenses is limited to participants in th e 2010 emerging fishery, the Director may, after the 2012 session, extend offers toadditional participants. Pa rticipant expansion may only occur after taking into consideration the population statusof the resource, the market for spot shrimp, and the num-ber of harvesters actively engaged in state and tribal spotshrimp fisheries. However, the total number of spot shrimp licenses offered by the WDFW may not exceed eight. Possession of a spot shrimp license does not confer any right of compensation shou ld the fishery be closed by the Legislature. License posse ssion also does not guaran- tee that the Fish and Wildli fe Commission (Commission) will open a spot shrimp fishery in any given year. The WDFW must present a report to the Legislature in 2016 regarding the spot shrimp fishery. The report must include any recommendations to change the fishery and a summary of the impacts of re moving spot shrimp from the marine ecosystem.

By Representatives Smith, Probst, Schmick, Warnick, Dahlquist, Hunt, Rolfes, Condotta and Klippert. House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Under legislation enacted in 2010, before an agency may impose a fine, civil penalty, or administra- tive sanction on a small business for a violation of a law orrule, the agency must provide the small business with a copy of the law or rule being violated. The agency mustalso allow the small business at least two business days tocorrect the violation. If no correction is possible or theagency is acting in response to a complaint made by a third party who would be disadvantaged by an opportunity tocorrect, the opportunity to correct does not apply. Exceptions to the opportunity to correct may be made if: an agency head determines that the effect of the viola- tion presents a direct danger to the public health, results in a loss of income or benefits to an employee, poses a potentially significant threat to human healthor the environment, or cau ses serious harm to the public interest; the violation involves a knowing or willful violation; the violation relates to taxes, a regulated entity's financial filings, or an insu rance rate or form filing; the opportunity for corre ction conflicts with federal law or program requiremen ts, conditions for receipt of federal funds, or requ irements for eligibility of employers for federal unemployment tax credits; or the small business previo usly violated a substantially similar requirement or the owner or operator of thesmall business previously violated a substantially similar requirement as owner or operator of a different small business.A \"small business\" is a business with 250 or fewer employees or an annual gross revenue of less than $7 million. Summary: The two business days that an agency must provide to a small business to correct a violation beforeimposing a fine, civil penalty, or administrative sanction isextended to seven calendar days.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 98 0 Senate 46 0 House 96 0Senate 47 02SHB 1153 382SHB 1153 C 125 L 11 Concerning costs for the collection of DNA samples. By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representa-tives Ladenburg, Walsh, Hurst, Goodman, Kagi, Rodneand Jinkins). House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: The Washington State Patrol operates and maintains a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) identification system. The purposes of the system are to assist withcriminal investigations an d identify human remains and missing persons. Unless a sample has already beencollected, biological samples must be collected from anyperson (adult or juvenile) convicted of a felony, any personwho is required to register as a sex or kidnapping offender, and any person convicted of the following misdemeanorsand gross misdemeanors: Assault in the fourth de gree with sexual motivation; Communication with a Mi nor for Immoral Purposes; Custodial Sexual Misco nduct in the second degree; Failure to Register as a Sex or Kidnapping Offender; Patronizing a Prostitute; Harassment; Stalking; Sexual Misconduct with a Minor in the second degree; and Violation of a sexual assault protection order. Jails, the Department of Corrections, and the Department of Social and Health Services collect samples from offenders incarcerated in their respective facilities. Police and sheriff's departments collect samples fromoffenders who do not serve a term of incarceration. When a sentence is imposed under the Sentencing Reform Act for a felony offense, the court must levy a$100 fee for any crime that requires collection of a DNAsample. The fee constitutes a legal financial obligation payable after all other legal financial obligations included in the sentence have been satisfied. A legal financial obligation is money ordered by the superior court forobligations including victim restitution, crime victims' compensation, court costs, cost s of defense, fines, and any other financial obligation assessed as a result of a felonyconviction. Eighty percent of the fee is deposited in the state DNA Database Account, and 20 percent is transmitted to theagency responsible for collection of the biological sample. Summary: Sentences imposed for crimes that by law require collection of a DNA sample must include a $100 fee. Thus the fee must be included in sentences not onlyfor felonies committed by adults , but also for the specified gross misdemeanors and misdemeanors and for offenses committed by juveniles. When the DNA sample collection fee is imposed as a consequence of a felony conviction, it is payable after allother legal financial obligations have been paid. When the fee is imposed as a consequence of a misdemeanor orgross misdemeanor conviction, it is payable in the same manner as other assessments. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SHB 1163 C 185 L 11 Creating a work group on pr eventing bullying, intimida- tion, and harassment and incr easing student knowledge on mental health and youth suicide. By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representatives Liias, Johnson, Maxwell, Santos , Sullivan, Walsh, Orwall, Moeller, Rolfes). House Committee on EducationHouse Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 EducationSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Harassment, Intimidation, and Bullying. Since 2003 school districts have been required to maintain a district policy prohibiting ha rassment, intimidation, and bullying of any student. The Office of the Superintendentof Public Instruction (OSPI) developed a modelprevention policy and training materials to assist schooldistricts. In 2010 legislation was enacted requiring the OSPI to revise and update the model policy, create a modelprocedure, and adopt rules regarding communication to parents, students, and employees. The 2010 law requiresschool districts to amend their policies by August 1, 2011,to, at a minimum, incorporat e the new OSPI policy and procedure. School districts must also designate a primarycontact person in the district for their policies andprocedures. The Office of the Education Ombudsman(OEO) is designated as the lead agency to provideresources and tools to parents and families aboutanti-harassment policies and strategies.House 96 2 Senate 47 139The OSPI convened a workgroup of stakeholders to assist in developing the new model policy and procedure. In November 2010 the OSPI conveyed the new policy and procedures to the Education Committees of theLegislature, and included the following additionalrecommendations fro m the workgroup: 1. A continuing state-level anti-bullying workgroup is needed to advise the Legislature on the next steps in addressing bullying. 2. Training is needed for all school staff and should be required where resources permit. 3. School districts should periodically analyze their data on harassment, intimida tion, and bullying and remediate where there are high incidents of bullying. 4. Funding should be provided to assist districts with training, data collection, best practices, and addition- al personnel to monitor ar eas with low supervision. Health and Fitness Standards. The OSPI has developed learning standards for health and fitness that require students to gain knowledge and skills in: movement, physical fitness, and nutrition; dimensions of health, st ages of growth and develop- ment, reduced health risks, and promotion of safeliving; analysis and evaluation of the impact of real-life influences on health; and analysis of personal information to develop an individualized fitness plan.School districts make curriculum decisions and deter- mine what materials are used to provide health and fitness instruction. School dist ricts must have classroom-based assessments or other strategies in place for elementary, middle, and high school to assure that students have anopportunity to learn the hea lth and fitness standards. Parents of students who ha ve been bullied or harassed often testify that their children become depressed andsometimes suicidal as a result of their experiences. Summary: The OSPI and the OEO must convene a school bullying and harassmen t prevention workgroup to develop, recommend, and implement strategies to improve school climate and cr eate respectful learning environments in public schools. The Superintendent of Public Instruction or a designee serves as Chair.Organizations to be represented in the workgroup arespecified. The workgroup must: consider whether additional disaggregated data on incidents of bullying and harassment should be collected and make recomm endations to the OSPI on data collection; examine procedures for anonymous reporting of incidents; identify curriculum and be st practices for improving school climate; incorporating instruction aboutmental health, youth suicide prevention, andprevention of bullying an d harassment; and training staff and students in de-escalation techniques; recommend best practices for informing and involving parents; recommend training for school district primary contacts; recommend pre-service training for educators; examine and recommend policies for discipline of students and staff; and in collaboration with the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC), examine and recommend policies to protect K-12 students attend-ing community and technical colleges from bullying and harassment. A biennial report is required beginning December 1, 2011, until the workgroup expires January 1, 2016. The SBCTC and the Higher Education Coordinating Board must compile and analyze college and university policies and procedures rega rding harassment, intimida- tion, and bullying prevention. Each must submit a reportto the Education and Higher Education Committees of the Legislature with recommen dations for improvement by December 1, 2011. The report must also include recom-mendations about disaggregated data, training forpersonnel who are primary c ontacts regarding policies, and policies for disciplining students and staff who harass,intimidate, or bully. Beginning July 1, 2012, i ssues of mental health and suicide prevention education are included in health and fitness learning standards for purposes of classroom based assessments. The OSPI is directed to work with otheragencies to develop pilot projects to assist schools in implementing youth suic ide prevention activities.

By House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Haigh,Chandler, Blake, Kristiansen, Taylor, Rivers, Finn andShea). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development Background: A noxious weed is a plant that, when estab- lished, is highly destructive, competitive, or difficult to control. The state maintains an active list of noxiousweeds present in Washington and categorizes the plants onthe list into one of three categories. These categories aredesignated as Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A weeds are those no xious weeds that are not native to Washington and are of limited distribution or areunrecorded in Washington ye t could cause a serious threat if established. Class B weeds are non-native plants thatare of limited distribution in a region of the state but couldcause a serious threat in that region. Class C weeds are all other noxious weeds. Noxious weeds are indentified and listed by the State Noxious Weed Control Board (Board). The Board isrequired to adopt a statewide noxious weed list at leastonce a year following a public hearing. Once a statenoxious weed list is adopted, county noxious weed controlboards must select weeds identified on the state list forinclusion on the local noxiou s weed list for that county. Each county is empowered to have a noxious weed control board within its jurisdiction. Once a weed is included on a county's weed list, certain responsibilities apply to landowners within that county. Landowners are resp onsible for eradicating all Class A weeds as well as cont rolling the spread of Class B and Class C weeds listed on the county list. The enforce-ment of violations of these duties is the responsibility of the county weed boards. Summary: The Board is directed to adopt rules regarding how the Board will select spec ies for listing on the noxious weed list. Included in these rules must be criteria for the listing of species that have been previously rejected for listing by the Board. The listing must include a require-ment that additional scientif ic data be presented to the Board regarding the invasive or noxious qualities of theplant in question, along with information about the plant's economic benefits. County noxious weed control boards are still permitted to conduc t education, outreach, or other assistance regarding plant speci es not included, or eligible for inclusion, on the state noxious weed list if the countydetermines that a plant species causes a localized risk orconcern. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1170 C 148 L 11 Concerning triage facilities. By House Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Representatives Roberts, Hope, Dickerson, Dammeier, Green, Rolfes, Haigh, Appleton, Walsh, Ormsby,Darneille and Kenney). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections Background: The Involuntary Treatment Act provides requirements and procedures for the detention and civil commitment of persons with me ntal disorders. Generally, a person may be involuntaril y detained for mental health assessment or treatment only under court order. However,in emergency circumstances, persons may be detainedwithout a court order. Emergency Detention . A person may be taken into custody and detained in an evaluation and treatmentfacility for up to 72 hours without a court order under emergency circumstances when the person, as a result of a mental disorder, presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm or is in imminent danger because of beinggravely disabled. Law Enforcement Detention Authority . Law enforce- ment officers have authority under certain circumstances to take into custody and deliver a person with a mental dis- order to a facility for short-te rm detention and evaluation. When a peace officer has reasonable cause to believe a person is suffering from a mental disorder and presentsan imminent likelihood of serious harm or is in imminentdanger because of being gravel y disabled, the officer may take the person into custody and deliver the person to a crisis stabilization unit, eval uation and treatment facility, or emergency department of a local hospital. A personbrought to one of these faciliti es by a peace officer may be held for up to 12 hours, as long as the person is evaluatedwithin three hours of arrival. When a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that an individual known to have a mental disorder hascommitted a non-felony crime th at is not a serious offense, the officer may take the individual to a crisis stabilizationunit, refer the individual to a me ntal health professional for evaluation under the mental health commitment statutes,or release the individual upon agreement to voluntaryparticipation in outpatient tr eatment. If the individual is taken to a crisis stabilization unit, the person may bedetained for up to 12 hours if the person is evaluated within the first three hours of arrival. House 90 7 Senate 45 3EHB 1171 41Crisis Stabilization Units . In 2007 legislation was enacted creating crisis stab ilization units as a type of facility to which law enfo rcement officers could take individuals suffering from mental disorders for up to 12- hour detention. A crisis st abilization unit is defined as a short-term facility for indivi duals who are experiencing an acute crisis and who need to be assessed, diagnosed, andprovided short-term treatment. The Department of Socialand Health Services (DSHS) certifies and establishesminimum standards for cr isis stabilization units. Summary: \"Triage facilities\" are added to the types of facilities to which a law enfo rcement officer may take an individual who is suffering from a mental disorder andwho either presents an imminent likelihood of seriousharm, is in imminent danger because of being gravely dis-abled, or has committed a non -felony offense that is not a serious offense. A person deliv ered to a triage facility that operates as an involuntary facility must be evaluated with-in three hours of arrival and may be held for up to 12hours. \"Triage facility\" is defined as a short-term facility licensed by the Department of Health (DOH) and certifiedby the DSHS that is designed to assess and stabilize anindividual or determine the need for involuntary commit- ment of an individual. Triage facilities may be structuredas voluntary or involuntary placement facilities, and must meet DOH residential treatm ent facility standards. The DSHS is directed to certify triage facilities and must work with the Washington Association of Countiesand the Washington Associa tion of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs in developing rules on certification standards for triage facilities. The rules may not require triage facilities to provide 24-hour nursing. Facilities operating as triage facilities as defined in the act, whether or not they are certified by the DSHS, as ofthe effective date of the act ar e not required to relicense or recertify under any new rules governing licensure orcertification of triage facilities.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 22, 2011 EHB 1171 C 127 L 11 Concerning high capacity transportation system plan components and review. By Representatives Rolfes, Armstrong, Liias, Billig, Angel, Finn, Appleton, Seaquist and Reykdal.House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on TransportationBackground: In the central Puget Sound region, high capacity transportation (HCT) systems may be established and financed by a regional transit authority (SoundTransit) and potentially by certain other transit agencies. Outside the central Puget So und region, HCT systems may be established by certain transit agencies only in Clark,Spokane, Thurston, Whatcom, and Yakima counties. High capacity transportation service means a system of public transportation se rvices within an urbanized region operating principally on exclusive rights of way,and the supporting services and facilities necessary toimplement the system, includ ing interim express services and high occupancy vehicle lanes, which, taken as awhole, provides a substantia lly higher level of passenger capacity, speed, and service frequency than traditional public transportation syst ems operating principally in general purpose roadways. Transit agencies authorized to provide HCT service may seek to finance the system and service with thefollowing voter-approved revenue measures: an employer tax of up to $2 per month per employee; rental car sales and use tax not to exceed 2.172 percent; and sales and use tax not to exceed 0.9 percent. To assure development of an effective HCT system, the local transit agency mu st establish a system and financing plan, and must provide for public involvement. In addition, an expe rt review panel must be appointed to provide independent technical review for development ofany plan which is to be funded in whole or part by HCTvoter-approved taxes. The state's role in HCT planning isto facilitate cooperative state and local planning efforts,and to provide system and project planning review andmonitoring in cooperation with the expert review panel. In general, most transit ag encies, like public transpor- tation benefit areas and coun ty transportation authorities, are authorized to impose a sales and use tax of up to 0.9percent with voter approval for the purpose of funding public transportation services. Summary: The planning process required of local authorities seeking to implem ent a HCT system is limited to system plans that include a rail fixed guideway compo- nent or a bus rapid transit co mponent that is planned by a regional transit authority. Th e requirement that an expert review panel be appointed to provide independenttechnical review of the plan is also limited to those system plans.

By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs (originally sponsored by Representatives Kenney,Hasegawa, Maxwell, Finn, Ryu, Reykdal andUpthegrove). House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Wineries and microbreweries may obtain an endorsement from the Liqu or Control Board (Board) to sell their products for off-premises consumption atqualifying farmers markets. Farmers markets must meet certain criteria and receive authorization from the Board toallow beer or wine sales. Sampling of beer and wine is permitted in some circumstances. Beer and/or wine specialty shops mayserve samples of two ounces or less to a customer.Legislation enacted in 2010 al lows certain grocery stores to conduct tastings with an endorsement issued by the Board. Wineries and microbreweries may also servesamples. A farmers market endorsement to a winery ormicrobrewery license, however, does not authorize tastingat a farmers market. Persons who serve alcohol for on-premises consump- tion on licensed retail premises must obtain a MandatoryAlcohol Server Training (MAST) permit. Liquor licensees are subject to penalty, including license suspension, for violatio ns of the law. The Board may vacate a suspension if the licensee pays a monetarypenalty. By rule, the Board has classified some violations,such as the sale or service of liquor to a minor, as publicsafety violations. For a first public safety violation, alicensee receives a five-day suspension or may receive a$500 penalty in lieu of suspension under somecircumstances. An Alcohol Impact Area (AIA) is a geographic area, designated by a local gove rnment and recognized by resolution of the Board, that is adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption. The Board may placerestrictions on licensees located in an AIA. Summary: The Board is directed to establish a pilot project for beer and wine tasting at farmers markets. The pilot project is for 10 farmers markets with at least six daysof tastings at each location between September 1, 2011,and November 1, 2012. Only one winery or microbrewerymay offer samples at a farmers market per day. Farmers markets chosen to participate in the pilot project must be authorized, as of January 1, 2011, for winery sales and must also be authorized for micro- brewery sales, as of January 1, 2011, if a microbrewery isproviding samples. Wineries and microbreweries offeringsamples must hold an endorsement to sell at farmersmarkets on May 1, 2011. In selecting farmers markets, theBoard must consult with statewide organizations of farmers markets and make an effort to select farmersmarkets throughout the state. A number of conditions fo r sampling must be met: Samples must be two ounces or less, up to a total of four ounces per customer per day, and no more than one sample of any single brand and type may be provided to a customer per day. Customers must remain at the designated stall, booth, or other designated location while sampling beer orwine. A winery or microbrewery may advertise sampling only at its designated loca tion at the farmers market. A winery or microbrewery must have food available or be adjacent to a vendor offering prepared food. Winery and microbrewery licensees and employees who are involved in samp ling activities must hold a MAST permit. If a winery or microbrewery commits a public safety violation in conjunction with tasting activities, the Board may suspend the winery or microbrewery's farmers marketendorsement for up to two years. If mitigating circum-stances exist, the Board may offer a monetary penalty inlieu of suspension during a settlement conference. The Board may prohibit sampling at a farmers market within an AIA if the Board find s that tasting at the farmers market is having an adverse effect on the reduction ofchronic public inebriation in the area. The Board may establish ad ditional requirements for the pilot project to ensure th at persons under 21 years of age and apparently intoxicat ed persons cannot possess or consume alcohol. The Board must report to the appropriate committees of the Legislature on the pilot project by December 1,2012. The act expires on December 1, 2012.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 77 21 Senate 37 12ESHB 1175 43ESHB 1175 PARTIAL VETO C 367 L 11 Making transportation appropriations for the 2009-2011 and 2011-2013 fiscal biennia. By House Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Representatives Clibborn, Armstrong, Liiasand Billig; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Transportation Background: The operating and capital expenses of state transportation agencies and programs are funded on a biennial basis by an omnibus transportation appropriationsact (transportation budget) adopted by the Legislature inodd-numbered years. The Transportation Budget providesappropriations to the major transportation agenciesincluding: the Washington State Department ofTransportation (WSDOT); the Washington State Patrol;the Department of Licensing; the Washington TrafficSafety Commission; the Transportation ImprovementBoard; the County Road Ad ministration Board; and the Freight Mobility Strategic Investment Board. Thetransportation budget also provides appropriations out oftransportation funds to many smaller agencies withtransportation functions. Summary: Appropriations are made for state transportation agencies and programs for the 2011-13 fiscal biennium. Adjustments are made to theappropriations for certain ag encies and programs for the 2009-11 fiscal biennium. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: May 16, 2011 July 1, 2011 (Sections 703, 704, 716, and 719) Partial Veto Summary: For the 2011-13 Transportation Budget, the Governor vetoed 22 provisions as the result of policy differences, technical matters, or other reasons. Ofthe provisions vetoed, 14 ar e related directly to the WSDOT's Ferry Operating and Capital programs orindirectly to the ferry prog rams via studies, the Marine Employees' Commission, or other agency oversight. While most of the vetoes do not impact appropriations,two have the net effect of reducing appropriations by$479,000. For the 2009-11 Supplemental Operating Budget, the Governor vetoed a provision relating to a reduction inspending in the WSDOT Rail Operating program attribut-able to Amtrak credits. Am trak miscalculated the extent of the credit. The veto restores the 2010 appropriationamount, an increase of $7.5 million. See the veto message for specific items.VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1175 May 16, 2011 The Honorable Speaker and Members The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: Thank you for your work on the supplemental and 2011-13 transportation budgets. I am returni ng, without my \"AN ACT Relating to making tr ansportation appropriations for the 2009-2011 and 2011-2013 fiscal biennia.\" Section 103(3), pages 3-4, Office of Financial Management, Predesign Requirements for Washington State Ferries This proviso requires the Office of Financial Management (OFM) to review and modify the Department of Transportation's (WSDOT) predesign requirements for state ferry vessel and termi- nal projects so that they continue to meet legal mandates without unduly burdening WSDOT. OFM is comm itted to working with the legislative transportation committ ees and stakeholders during the interim to assess and re-write the predesign manual for all appro- priate transportation fa cilities, not just for ferry terminals and vessels. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 103(3). Section 103(4), page 4, Office of Financial Management, List of Ferry Demands to Bargain This proviso requires the Offi ce of Financial Management to provide the legislative transporta tion committees, on a quarterly basis, a list of all demands to bargain with respect to unions rep- resenting marine employees. While I support sharing this informa- tion with the Legislature, it shoul d not be limited to only one sector of employees. Therefore, I am directing OFM to provide informa- tion on all demands to bargain rece ived by the Labo r Relations Of- fice to the legislative transpor tation committees and the Joint Committee on Employment Relati ons, as appropriate. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 103(4). Section 204(2), page 8, Joint Transportation Committee, Study of Management Organizat ional Structure of Ferries Division This proviso provides funding to the Joint Transportation Com- mittee (JTC) to conduct a study of the management organizationalstructure of the Department of Transportation Ferries Division. The ferry system has been studie d extensively. The transportation budget passed in 2009 directed twel ve studies or reports, and six more were added in the 2010 budget. The JTC recently completed a three-year series of finance st udies related to ferries. The most recent study was conducted last year by the national Passenger Vessel Association (PVA) at my request and provided recommen- dations now being impl emented by the Ferries Division. This re- port noted that the level of over sight for Washington State Ferries is greater than the five ferry systems represented on the PVA panelthat performed the study. \"Thi s constant responding, educating and reacting are tremendously cos tly and this expenditure could be better utilized elsewhere.\" For these reasons, I have vetoedSection 204(2). Section 205(3), page 10, Transp ortation Comm ission, Survey of Transportation Users This proviso ties the appropriation for a survey of transporta- tion users to the passage of Subs titute Senate Bi ll 5128, which did not pass. It is important to conduc t a statistically valid survey to identify the transportati on priorities the public would like to target for future investments. In order to preserve the funding necessary for this survey, I have vetoed Section 205(3). Section 208(11), page 15, Department of Licensing, Commercial Drivers Funding is provided to implement provisions of Engrossed House Bill 1229 (related to commercial drivers) from the HighwaySafety Account-State. However, this proviso incorrectly identifies the funds as Motor Vehicle Account-Federal instead of HighwayHouse 89 6 Senate 39 9 (Senate amended)House 87 9 (House concurred)ESHB 1175 44Safety Account-State. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 208(11). Section 210(4), pages 17-18, Department of Transportation, Time, Leave and Labor System This proviso directs the Department of Transportation to report quarterly on its progress on the development of a time, leave, and labor distribut ion system. While this is a high priority for WSDOT, it is an important need of all stat e agencies. That is why I proposed that this project be developed as an enterprise solution by the Of- fice of Financial Management in partnership with the Department of Personnel and WSDOT, with WSDO T being the pilot site to im- plement what will become an en terprise-wide application. Be- cause it is important to clearly set out the state's commitment to an enterprise solution for business process systems improvements, I am vetoing this section and dire cting that the project commence as a partnership of state agencies with OFM leadership. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 210(4). Section 210(6), page 18, Depart ment of Transportation, 511 Traveler Information System Improvements This proviso directs the Depar tment of Transportation to make enhancements to the 511 traveler information system, as well as to develop or purchase software to allow public transportation users to determine the public transporta tion options available to them. The private sector is pr oviding similar services for travelers, often at no cost to consumers. During th is time of limited state resourc- es, it is unnecessary to dedicate sc arce state resources to areas be- ing addressed by the private sect or. Furthermore, no funding was provided to accomplish these actions. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 210(6). Section 221(3), pages 31-32, Department of Transportation, Ferry Performance Metrics This section requires the Departm ent of Transportation to de- velop a set of performance metrics for th e Ferries Division and make recommendations to the 2012 Legislature on which mea- surements should be incorporated into the transportation appro- priations act. My Government Management Accountability and Performance (GMAP) program al ready requires WSDOT to in- clude ferry performance measures as part of its quarterly reports. WSDOT is further enhancing its use of perfor mance metrics, which was one of the recommendat ions of the Passenger Vessel Association study I directed last year. WSDOT will continue re-porting its progress and we will share those updates with the Leg- islature. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 221(3). Section 221(4), page 32, Depar tment of Transportation, Ferries Division Process Changes This section requires the Depar tment of Transportation Ferries Division to continue to identi fy and implement route-by-route on- time performance changes. At the same time, it directs WSDOT to consider slowing down vessels to sa ve fuel. It is unclear how the Ferries Division should improve on-time perform ance while slow- ing down vessels. WSDOT remains co mmitted to a safe and reli- able ferry system, as evidenced by the 94% of sailings arriving within ten minutes of the schedul ed sailing time in 2010. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 221(4). Section 221(7), page 32, Departme nt of Transportation, Fiscal Year Reports Outlining Wages an d Benefits to Ferry Employees This proviso requires the Depar tment of Transportation to pro- vide to the legislative transport ation committees fiscal year re- ports outlining wages and benefits provided to marine employees. While I support sharing this inform ation with the Legislature, it should not be limited to only one se ctor of employees. Therefore, I am directing the Office of Financia l Management to work with the appropriate agencies to provide wage and benefit information to the legislative transportation committees and ways and means committees. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 221(7). Section 221(8), page 32, Depart ment of Transportation, Ferry Detail in the Transportation Executive Information System (TEIS) This proviso requires the Depar tment of Transportation to work with the Legislativ e Evaluation and Account ability Program Com- mittee to provide more details on ferry projects in the capital re- porting system used by the Legi slature, Office of FinancialManagement, and WSDOT. It is impor tant that versions of this system are compatible among th e agencies for transmitting and comparing data. Furthermore, it wo uld be premature to make such changes to the TEIS until the work required in Section 221(16) re- garding the budget structure of th e Ferries Division is complete, including a potential restructuri ng of the ferries budget. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 221(8). Section 221(9), page 32, Departm ent of Transportation, Ferry Operating Program, Restrictions on Use of Appropriations for Labor Costs This proviso limits appropriations used for labor costs to obli- gations under collective bargai ning agreements, civil service laws, and judgments. This limita tion would prevent the Depart- ment of Transportation from paying legal and necessary labor costs that fall outside these c onstraints. For example, WSDOT would not be able to pay the salari es and benefits of exempt em- ployees, travel reimbursement for all nonrepresented employees, or the cost of contractors who pe rform labor-related services from funds appropriated for labor costs. For this reason, I have vetoedSection 221(9). Section 221(18), pages 34-35, Depa rtment of Tr ansportation, Ferry Operating Program, Re port Linking Vessel Asset Condition Reports with Vess el Life-Cycle Cost Model This proviso requires the Department of Transportation to link vessel asset condition reports with its life-cycle co st model for in- tegration with a vessel managemen t system. It also requires WS- DOT's 2013-15 budget request to provide a project scope forimplementing a vessel asset man agement system. Predesign re- quirements, life-cycle cost mode l changes, asset condition ratings, proposed new management system s, and revised budget structures must be considered in total. To that end, I am directing the Office of Financial Management to convene a workgroup that includes staff from the legisl ative transportation co mmittees to evaluate how these various requirements s hould be integrated and reflected in future budget instructions. Therefore, I have vetoed Section221(18). Section 305(6), page 40, Depa rtment of Tr Federal 47, Depa rtment of Tr ansportation, These provisos require that redi stributed federa l funds received by the Department of Transporta tion first be applied to offset planned expenditures of state funds, and second to offset planned expenditures of federal funds, on pr ojects identified in the project list in the 2010 supplemental budget. If these options are not fea- sible, WSDOT must consult with the Joint Transportation Commit- tee (JTC) prior to obligating redi stributed federal funds. If such consultation is not feasible and Washington does not act quickly, we may lose the opportunity to re ceive redistributed federal funds. However, because input from the Le gislature is impor tant, I am di- recting WSDOT to consult with JTC members when possible. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 305(6) and Section 306(4). Section 308(6), page 50, Departm ent of Transportation, Ferry Capital Program, Restrictions on Use of Appropriations for Labor Costs This proviso limits appropriations used for labor costs to obli- gations under collective bargai ning agreements, civil service laws, and judgments. This limita tion would prevent the Depart- ment of Transportation from paying legal and necessary labor costs that fall outside these c onstraints. For example, WSDOT would not be able to pay the salari es and benefits of exempt em- ployees, travel reimbursement for all nonrepresented employees, or the cost of contractors who pe rform labor-related services from funds appropriated for labor costs. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 308(6). Section 308(10), page 51, Depart ment of Transportation, Ferry Capital Program, Review and Adjust Capital Funding Levels This proviso requires the Department of Transportation to re- view and adjust its capital progra m staffing levels , compare the findings to a 2009 capital staffin g level report, and report to the Office of Financial Management and the legislative transporta-EHB 1177 45tion committees. WSDOT is curr ently conducting a thorough re- view of its staffing levels in all program areas, including the Ferries Division, as it downsizes to meet diminishing revenues. Thus, this requirement specific to Ferries is unnecessary. There- fore, I have vetoed Section 308(10). Section 308(12), page 51, Depar tment of Transportation, Ferry Capital Program, Provide Co st-Benefit Analysis of Eagle Harbor Slips This proviso requires the Department to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of replacing or repairing existing structures at the Eagle Harbor maintenance facility. A repor t is due to the Legislature by December 31, 2011. While I appreciate the need for a thoughtful cost-benefit analysis prior to an y capital budget request, I cannot support another unfunded reporting mandate. I am directing the Office of Financial Management to ensure adequate provisionsare included in the predesign manual and budget instructions toaddress these concerns. Therefore, I have vetoed Section 308(12). Section 610, pages 73-74, Depar tment of Transportation, Report on Depart ment's Future Business Model This section requires the Department of Transportation to re- port to the Joint Transportation Committee on its future businessmodel staffing scenarios and met hod of program and project de- livery. I understand the importance of tailoring the workforce both to reflect the ramping down of c onstruction funded by the last two transportation revenue packages and to prepare for a potential new transportation revenue pack age. However, Section 608 also directs WSDOT to develop new busin ess practices so that a small- er, more nimble workforce can effectively and e fficiently deliver transportation projects. In additio n, WSDOT is already conduct- ing a thorough review of its staffing levels as it dow nsizes to meet diminishing revenues. Because this section is unnecessary, I have vetoed Section 610. Section 706, pages 82-83, Depar tment of Transportation, Exempts Ferries from Biodies el Requirements for 2011-13 This section exempts ferries from the state biodiesel use require- ment. By leveraging federal and private funding, we have made the infrastructure investments to provide biodiesel to ferries. We are moving forward with changes to state procurement contractsto help further reduce the cost of biodiesel and take advantage of available in-state production. If we walk away now, our state fund- ing investments in the industry wi ll be lost, our oilseed farming and refining jobs will move out of state, and we will be forced to pay more to transport biodiesel products from the midwest. The rising cost of gas serves to remi nd us that we must rely on our- selves, not other count ries, for our economic security and safety. I am directing the Department of Transportation to use as much biodiesel as pos sible within its authoriz ed budget. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 706. Section 714, pages 95-96, Marine Employee s' Commission Duties Subject to Available Amounts Appropriated for Statutory Duties RCW 47.64.280 creates the Mari ne Employees' Commission (MEC). Section 714 amends this st atute to provide that MEC shall not perform its duties as identified in this section if funding is not provided. Because funding for MEC has not been provided, thissection would prohibit it from performing its statutory duties. Among its duties, MEC adjudicate s complaints, grievances, and disputes between labor and manage ment arising out of the opera- tion of the ferry system. A provis ion in a budget bill cannot extin- guish the rights of employees and labor organizations to access MEC to resolve disputes. Changing or eliminating MEC duties should be the subject of a policy bill, not a provision in a two-year budget bill. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 714. Section 722, page 99, Toll En forcement and Administration During the 2010 legislative session, two separate pieces of leg- out reference to each other. Th is section repeals one of those amendments. However, this ac tion is unnecessary because RCW 1.12.025 clearly provides that the amendments can be merged be- cause they do not conflict in purpose. While ESSB 6499 made pol- icy changes related to toll enforcem ent as we move to a statewide photo toll system, SB 6379 made technical changes to a variety ofvehicle and vessel title and regist ration statutes intended to have no policy or substantive legal effect. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 722. Section 817, pages 130-131, De partment of Transportation A reduction of $7.5 million in the Multimodal Transportation Account-State appropriation was m ade in the Rail Operating pro- gram for the 2009-11 biennium because it was assumed that therewould be offsetting Amtr ak credits. Amtrak recently informed WS- DOT that it had incorrectly calculated the credits. Vetoing this sec- tion will restore funding to 2010 levels and allow the Rail Operating program the flexibility needed to close the 2009-11 Bi- ennium. WSDOT is directed to report to the Office of Financial Management and legislative transportation committees on the to-tal credits received from Amtrak. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 817. With the exception House Bill 1175 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor EHB 1177 C 219 L 11 Regarding field investigations on privately owned lands. By Representatives Hunt and McCoy.House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: State law provides that archaeological studies conducted on public lands be performed by profes- sional archaeologists. Professional archaeologist isdefined as a person with qual ifications meeting the federal Secretary of the Department of Interior's (Secretary)standards for a professional archaeologist. Archaeologists not meeting this standard may be conditionally employedby working under the supervision of a professional archae-ologist for a period of four years provided the employee ispursuing qualifications necessary to meet the Secretary'sstandards for a professional archaeologist. During this four-year period, the profession al archaeologist is respon- sible for all findings. The fo ur-year period is not subject to renewal. The Secretary's standards for a professional archaeol- ogist require a graduate degr ee in archaeology, anthropol- ogy, or closely related field, plus: at least one year of full-time professional experience or equivalent specialized training in archaeological research, administration, or management; at least four months of supervised field and analytic experience in general North American archaeology;and demonstrated ability to ca rry research to completion. HB 1178 46In addition to these minimum qualifications, a profes- sional in prehistoric archaeo logy must have at least one year of full-time professional experience at a supervisory level in the study of archaeological resources of the prehis-toric period. A professional in historic archaeology must have at least one year of fu ll-time professional experience at a supervisory level in the study of archaeologicalresources of the historic period. Summary: Legislative intent pertai ning to archaeological field investigations conducted on privately owned lands is revised to state that such work should be conducted byprofessional archaeologists, an d the intent is not to be interpreted to allow trespassi ng on private property. A \"field investigation\" is defined as an on-site inspection by a professional archaeologist or by anindividual under the direct supervision of a professionalarchaeologist employing arch aeological inspection tech- niques for both the surface and subsurface identification of archaeological resources and artifacts resulting in a pro-fessional archaeological report detailing the results of such inspection.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1178 C 149 L 11 Addressing the office of regulatory assistance. By Representatives Appleton and Miloscia; by request of Office of Regulatory Assistance. House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Economic Development, Trade & Innovation Background: Originally created as the Permit Assistance Center in 1995, the Office of Regulatory Assistance (ORA) has evolved from its original mission of providingthe public with informatio n on environmental permitting and regulatory laws to a primary point of contact for infor-mation on and assistance in navigating the state'senvironmental and busine ss regulatory systems. Specifically, the ORA: provides information regarding permits; maintains a website that provides extensive informa- tion on permit laws, includin g relevant local, state, federal, and tribal laws; acts as a service center; provides project scoping services; offers, under agreement, coordinated permit processes for certain projects; and participates in multiagency permitting teams.In 2010 the ORA was subject to a sunset review by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC). The following recommendatio ns were made by the JLARC: the Legislature should continue the ORA without further sunset reviews; the ORA should include in its biennial reports infor- mation on tasks that are and are not working; and the ORA should improve its reports to the Legislature for purposes of tracking previous performance targets. Summary: The termination date fo r the ORA is repealed. The ORA is required to provide additional information in its biennial report to the Governor and the Legislature: (1)specific information on any difficulty encountered inprovision of services, implementation of programs orprocesses, or use of tools; (2) trend reporting that allowscomparisons between statements of goals and perfor-mance targets and the achievement of those goals andtargets; and (3) recommenda tions on changes needed to make cost reimbursement, a fully coordinated permit process, multiagency permitting teams, and other process-es effective. The duty of reporting the effects of rule-making on the regulatory syst em to the Governor and the Legislature are transferred from the Office of FinancialManagement to the ORA. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: June 29, 2011 HB 1179 C 63 L 11 Clarifying that public employ ees may attend information- al or educational meetings regarding legislative issues. By Representatives Hunt, Hudgins, Appleton, Liias, rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: State ethics laws and legislative ethics rules prohibit the use of any person, money, or property under a legislator's official control or direction or in his or herofficial custody for the private benefit or gain of the legis-lator. However, there are ex ceptions to this prohibition, and the Legislative Ethics Board has general rules inter-preting the exceptions. For example, if there is no actualcost to the state or the cost is de minimis, if there is a publicbenefit, and if the use do es not interfere with theHouse 66 31Senate 26 20 House 62 36Senate 43 5 (Senate amended)House 71 26 (House concurred)HB 1181 47performance of official duties, then infrequent and inci- dental use of state resources for private benefit may bepermissible. In addition, a legislator ma y not use or authorize the use of state facilities, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of assisting a campaign for election of a person to office orfor the promotion of or op position to a ballot proposition. Knowing acquiescence by a legislator with the authority todirect, control, or influence the actions of the state officeror state employee using the public resources constitutes a violation. Facilities of an ag ency include stationery, office space, publications, and use of state employees. Amongthe exceptions to th is prohibition: (1) a legislator may use state facilities for activities that are part of the normal and regular conduct of the office; and (2) he or she may havede minimis use of public facilities incidental to thepreparation or delivery of communications. Summary: Exceptions are added to state ethics laws regarding the prohibition agai nst: (1) the use of public facilities by a legislator or state employee for political purposes; and (2) a legislator's use of a state employee forpolitical purposes during th e employee's working hours. These new exceptions have the effect of clarifying thescope of state ethics prohibitions by establishing that: state employees are not prohibited from attending an informational or educationa l meeting regarding legis- lative issues while accompanied by a legislator or other elected official; and state facilities, including state-owned or leased build- ings, may be used for info rmational or educational meetings regarding legislative issues. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1181 C 41 L 11 Creating the Washington state board of naturopathy. By Representatives Green, Hinkle, Santos and Dickerson.House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Naturopathic medicine is the art and science of the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment ofdisorders of the body through the natural processes of the body. Naturopathic medicine includes: manipulation (mechanotherapy); the prescription, dispen sing, and use of nutrition and food science; physical modalities; minor office procedures; homeopathy; naturopathic medicines; hygiene immunization; contraceptive devices; common diagnostic procedures; and suggestion. Naturopaths are licensed by the Department of Health (DOH), which is responsible for: adopting rules; setting minimum education and experience require- ments; preparing and administering licensing examinations; determining alternative training requirements; implementing a continuing competency program; setting license and examination fees; issuing licenses; maintaining records of applicants and licensees; conducting hearings if a denial of a license is appealed; and disciplining licensed naturopaths for unprofessional conduct. When carrying out its func tions, the DOH is advised by the Naturopathic Adviso ry Committee, which consists of five members appointed by the Secretary of Health. Summary: The Board of Naturopathy (Board) is created (replacing the Naturopathic Advisory Committee). The Board consists of seven members appointed by theGovernor for four-year terms. Five members of the Board must be licensed naturopaths and two members must bemembers of the public. The Board is responsible for: adopting rules; setting minimum education and experience require- ments; preparing and administering licensing examinations; determining alternative training requirements; implementing a continui ng competency program; and disciplining licensed naturopaths for unprofessional conduct. The DOH maintains th e responsibility for: setting license and examination fees; issuing licenses; maintaining records of applicants and licensees; and conducting hearings if a denial of a license is appealed.

By Representatives Goodma n, Ross, Kirby, Johnson, Hope, Hurst, Pearson, Billig, Warnick andLadenburg. House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: A person is guilty of Intimidating a Witness if he or she uses a threat to attempt to influence a witness's testimony, induce a witness to absent him or herself from proceedings, induce a person not to report informationrelevant to a criminal investigation or child abuse, orinduce a person not to have a crime or abuse prosecuted.Intimidating a Witness is a class B felony with a seriousness level of VI. A person is guilty of Tampering with a Witness if he or she attempts to induce a witn ess to testify falsely, absent him or herself from proceedings , or withhold information from law enforcement or an agen cy that is relevant to a criminal investigation or child abuse. Tampering with a Witness is a class C felony with a seriousness level of III. The Washington Supreme Court (Court) recently determined that where a de fendant makes multiple phone calls to induce a single witness not to testify, the prosecu-tor may charge the defendant with one count of Tamperingwith a Witness. The Court determined that the unit ofprosecution is the ongoing atte mpt to persuade the witness not to testify. Summary: For the offenses of Intimidating a Witness and Tampering with a Witness, each instance of an attempt to intimidate or tamper with a witness constitutes a separate offense.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011ESHB 1183 C 150 L 11 Regarding certain osteopathic or allopathic medical schools prohibiting hospitals or physicians from entering into agreements to provide c linical rotations to qualified osteopathic or allopathic medical students. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Johnson, Cody, Ross,Kenney, Ahern and Stanford). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Medical Quality Assurance Commis- sion (Commission) establishes standards for the issuance of licenses to physicians an d surgeons, while the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (Board) establishesstandards for osteopathic physicians and surgeons. Thegeneral standards for both pr ofessions require: (1) gradu- ation from an approved medi cal school; (2) completion of a residency or other postgraduate training program; (3) awork history since graduation; (4) a verification of alladmitting or specialty hospita l privileges granted within five years of application; and (5) a verification of all stateswhere the applicant is credentialed. To meet the Commission's postgraduate training requirement, the applicant fo r a physician or surgeon's license must have completed a two-year programaccredited by either the Accreditation Council forGraduate Medical Education or the Royal College ofPhysicians and Surgeons of Canada. To meet the Board'spostgraduate training requirement, the applicant for anosteopathic physician or surgeon's license must havecompleted either a nationally approved one-year intern- ship program or the first year of a residency programapproved by the American Osteopathic Association or theAmerican Medical Association.

By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight Seaquist). House Committee on Environment House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Oil Spill Contingency Plan Requirements . All covered vessels and faciliti es are required to have an oil spill contingency plan on file with the Department of Ecology (Department). The contingency plan must meet standards identified by the De partment and provide for the containment and cleanup of o il spilled into the waters of the state. The contingency plan is a legally bindingagreement on the part y submitting the plan. The contingency plan requir ements apply to facilities located on the land and to ve ssels that dock at the facilities. A facility is, with a few exceptio ns: a structure, a pipeline, a device, or equipment located on or near state waters thattransfers oil to or from a vessel or pipeline. A covered ves-sel is: a tank vessel that is designed to carry oil in bulk as cargo; a cargo vessel weighing over 30 gross tons; or apassenger vessel weighing over 300 gross tons. Contingency plans must meet the requirements devel- oped in rules by the Departme nt. These rules, which must be periodically updated, establish the standards thatcontingency plans must meet. Examples of the standards include: details for the method of response to spills ofvarious sizes; lists of personnel and equipment used toremove oil and/or to minimize damage in a worst casespill; and procedures for early detection and timely notifi-cation of spills. Rules adopted by the Department alsorequire the use of random, unannounced drills ofcontingency plan holders as a means for testing the adequacy of the contingency plans. Emergency Communication . A covered vessel located within 12 miles of th e state's coastline is required to notify the United States Coast Guard (USCG) withinone hour of becoming disabled, colliding with anothervessel, or experiencing a near miss collision with anothervessel. The Department, the Washington State MilitaryDepartment, and the USCG are expected to negotiate anagreement that allows state notification of incidentsreported to the USCG. From these notifications, theDepartment must create summaries of reported incidents.Compensation Schedule . The owner or operator of a covered vessel that experiences a spill in Washingtonwaters or fails to satisfy th e contingency planning require- ments faces three different financial liabilities: civil penal-ties, natural resource damage assessments, and third partytort liability. Civil penalties are assessed by the Department on covered vessels that enter the waters of the state without anapproved contingency plan, or without having metfinancial responsibility requ irements in compliance with state and federal standards. In these cases, the Departmentmay assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for each daythe vessel is in violation of compliance with the standards. Natural resource damage assessments are issued by the Department in consu ltation with other natural resources agencies based on a compensation schedule for unlawful oil discharges. The amount of compensation must be at least $1 per gallon and no more than $100 pergallon spilled. The compensation schedule must reflectcompensation for impacts including those to the environment, recreatio n, and aesthetics. A person whose private property is damaged by an un- lawful oil discharge may bring an action against the owneror operator of the vessel. Generally, the vessel owner or operator faces strict liability for damages resulting from a spill. Summary: Oil Spill Contingency Plan Requirements . The Department is required to evaluate and update plan- ning standards for oil spill response equipment that isrequired under contingency plans in order to ensurein-state access to the best achievable technology thatallows for a continuous resp onse to a worst case spill. These equipment standard evaluations must include aerialsurveillance availability and be updated every five years. An initial evaluation for tank vessels must occur by theend of 2012. By the same date, the Department must adoptrules to improve the effectiv eness of an existing system that utilizes private fishing boats as part of an oil spillresponse. The Department is authorized to require joint, large- scale multiple plan equipment deployment drills to deter- mine the compliance with con tingency plan requirements. At a minimum, one such drill must be ordered every threeyears. These extra drills must be focused on theoperational readiness of the spill response both during thefirst six hours of a spill and in the following operationalperiods. When practicable, the Department mustcoordinate the drills with Oregon and British Columbia. V olunteer Coordination System . The Department is required to establish a volunteer coordination system aspart of the state's overall spill response strategy. In doing, the Department may organize the system with local emer-gency management centers and coordinate with analogousfederal efforts. Civil immun ity is created for volunteers and the state for any acts or omissions by volunteersparticipating in the volunteer coordination system. SHB 1188 50Emergency Communication . The owner or operator of a vessel experiencing an emergency at sea must notify the Department within one hour if there has been a discharge, or a substantial threat of discharge, caused bythe emergency. This notification is in addition to similar notification that is required to be given to the USCG. Contingency Plan Approval . The Department is required to notify a person who submits a contingencyplan within 65 days as to whether or not the plan isapproved, disapproved, or conditionally approved. For conditional approvals, the Depa rtment must describe the conditions and specify a time line for the submittal of an amended plan. Umbrella Plans . For contingency plans providing umbrella coverage to both tank vessels and non-tankvessels, the plan holder must specify the maximum worstcase discharge from both types of vessels to be covered bythe plan. The vessels covered by the plan must have agree-ments that provide for access to additional oil spillresponse equipment beyond that provided in the umbrellacontingency plan. Federal Assistance . The Director of the Department is required to formally reques t, from the federal government, a contribution to the establishment of regional oil equip-ment caches to ensure adequa te response capabilities. Compensation Schedule . The range of compensation to be assessed by the Department for the unlawfuldischarge of oil is raised from between $1 and $100 pergallon of oil discharged to between $3 and $300 for anyvessels discharging 1,000 or mo re gallons of oil. Any persistent oil recovered from the surface of the water with-in the first 48 hours following a spill is to be deducted from the calculation of total gallons discharged. The civil damages a vessel th at spills oil may be found strictly liable for are speci fied to include the loss of income and revenue to the damaged party. Actions towhich liability attaches include those conducted inresponse to a spill.

By House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness (originally sponsored by RepresentativesGoodman, Kelley, Hurst, Kenney, House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: A person is guilty of Assault in the second degree if he or she assaults another by strangulation. \"Strangulation\" means to compress a person's neck,obstructing or intending to obstruct blood flow or theability to breathe. Assault in the second degree is a classB felony with a seriousness level of IV . If there is a findingof sexual motivation, it is a class A felony. The definition of \"most serious offense\" includes Assault in the second degree. A person who has beenconvicted of three most serio us offenses is a persistent offender and may be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release. The standard sentence range for a person convicted of a felony is based on the serio usness level of the offense and the person's offender score. The offender score isdetermined based on points for prior offenses. Generally only prior felonies are included in the offender score, but where the present conviction is for a felony domesticviolence offense, one point is added to the offender scorefor each prior conviction for a repetitive domestic violence offense. A repetitive domestic violence offense includes non-felony Assault, Harassment, Stalking, and violationof no-contact and protection orders. A prior conviction \"washes out\" of an offender's score if the person spends a specifi ed number of years in the community without being convicted of a crime. Forexample, a class B felony other than a sex offense washesout after 10 years, and a class C felony other than a sexoffense washes out after five years. Summary: Assault in the second degree includes assault- ing another by suffocation. \"Suffocation\" means to block or impair the intake of air at the nose and mouth, whetherby smothering or other means, with the intent to obstructthe ability to breathe. A prior conviction for a repetitive domestic violence offense is not included in the offender score if the person has spent 10 consecutive year s in the community without being convicted of a crime.

By Representatives Hinkle, Kelley, Van De Wege, Liias and Stanford. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Licensed physicians, osteopathic physi- cians, dentists, and pharmacists are prohibited fromreceiving a payment, such as a rebate, refund, or commis- sion, if that payment is rece ived in connec tion with the referral of patients or the furnishing of health care treat-ment or diagnosis. The stated intent of the prohibition isto prevent licensed health care providers from receiving compensation for services that they did not perform. The prohibition does not apply to a licensed health provider who charges for the health care services rendered by anemployee who is licensed to provide the services. In 2005 the Washington State Attorney General issued a formal opinion related to th e application of the referral prohibitions to pathology services. The opinion concluded that a physician may only charge for profes-sional services that are actually rendered, such as takingsamples for a biopsy, prepar ing the sample, and other associated costs. In addition, a physician may charge for services related to reviewing the pathologist's diagnosis orconsulting with the patient ab out the diagnosis. The opin- ion also specified that if the pathologist indirectly bills the patient through the referring physician, that physician could not, in turn, receive compensation for those specific services beyond what the pathologist charges. Summary: Clinical laboratories and physicians that pro- vide anatomic pathology services must submit any claims for payment for pathology services to either: (1) thepatient; (2) the responsible insurer; (3) the hospital or clinic that ordered the services; (4) the referringlaboratory, unless that laborato ry is part of a physician's office or group practice that does not perform the profes-sional component of the anatomic pathology service; or(5) governmental agencies acting on the behalf of therecipient of the services. Licensed health care prac titioners are prohibited from charging for anatomic pathology services unless theservices were personally de livered by the practitioner or under the direct supervision of the practitioner. Lab-oratories that refer to another physician or laboratory forconsultation or histologic processing are exempt from thepersonal delivery and direct supervision requirements,unless the laboratory that makes the referral does not perform the professional component of the service. Violations of the billing practices regarding anatomic pathology services are governed by the UniformDisciplinary Act.The term \"anatomic pathology services\" is defined to include histopathology or surgical pathology, cytopathol-ogy, hematology, subcellular pathology or molecular and blood-banking services on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1191 C 129 L 11 Changing the expiration date s of the mortgage lending fraud prosecution account and its revenue source. By Representatives Ryu, Kirby, Buys, Fitzgibbon and Bailey; by request of Departme nt of Financial Institutions. House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: In 2003 legislation was enacted creating the Mortgage Lending Fraud Prosecution Account(Account), a specific fund to aid in the prosecution of con- sumer fraud in the mortgage lending process. The Account is administered by th e Department of Financial Institutions (DFI). Funds fo r the Account are generated by a $1 surcharge, assessed at the recording of a deed of trust.In order to defray the costs of collection, the countyauditor may retain up to 5 percent of the funds collected.Once collected by a county, the funds must be transferredmonthly to the State Treasurer who, in turn, must depositthe funds into the Account. The DFI may use the Account to reimburse county prosecutors and/or the Office of the Attorney General(AG) for costs related to the investigation and prosecution of mortgage fraud cases. Reimbursable items includesalaries, training costs for staff, and expenses related toinvestigation and litigation. The Director of the DFI or theDirector's designee may au thorize expenditures from the Account. The DFI is required to consult with the AG and local prosecutors in developing guidelines for the distribu- tion of the funds, which are to be used to enhance lawenforcement capabilities at both the state and local level. The Account and the surcharge created in 2003 were originally set to expire on June 30, 2006. In 2006 theexpiration of the Account, the surcharge, and the reportwere delayed until June 30, 2011. In 2009 the annualreport requirement was changed to expire on June 30,2009, in an omnibus bill that eliminated or reduced the fre-quency of a number of report s prepared by state agencies.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: June 29, 2011 ESHB 1202 C 186 L 11 Creating a pilot project to allow spirits sampling in state liquor stores and contract stores. By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs (originally sponsored by Representatives Hunt,Taylor and Moscoso). House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: In Washington, spirits in the original pack- age may be sold only in state liquor stores and contractliquor stores. (An exception al lows limited sales of spirits by craft distillers.) Sampling of spirits, beer, and wine by retail customers is permitted in some circumstances. Beer and/or winespecialty shops may serve samples of two ounces or less toa customer. Legislation enacted in 2010 allows certaingrocery stores to conduct t astings with an endorsement issued by the Board. Breweries and wineries may alsoserve samples. A craft distillery may provide one-halfounce or less samples of spirits, up to a total of two ouncesper day to a customer, on its premises. An Alcohol Impact Area (AIA) is a geographic area, designated by a local gove rnment and recognized by resolution of the Board, that is adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption. The Board may placerestrictions on licensees located in an AIA. Persons who solicit or take orders for a distiller, man- ufacturer, importer, or distributor of spirits must hold arepresentative's license i ssued by the Board. Liquor may not be consumed on the premises of a state liquor store. Summary: The Liquor Control Board (Board) is directed to establish a pilot project for spirits sampling in state and contract liquor stores to promote the sponsor's products. The pilot project consists of 30 locations with at least six samplings to be conducted at each location between September 1, 2011, and September 1, 2012. Only onesampling per week at a store is permitted. The Board mustselect the stores. In selectin g stores, the Board must give: due consideration to the location of the store with respect to places of worship, schools, and publicinstitutions, and written notice to these entities located within 500 feet of the store; and due consideration to mo tor vehicle accident data in the proximity of the store. The following conditions apply to sampling: Only persons age 21 or over and no apparently intox- icated person may sample spirits. Samples may take place only in an area of the store where access to persons under age 21 is prohibited. Samples may be free of charge. Samples must be one-quarter ounce or less, with no more than one ounce of samples per person per day. Only sponsors may serve samples. A sponsor is a domestic distiller or an ac credited representative of a distiller, manufacturer, importer, or distributor of spirits. Any person involved in serving samples must have completed a Mandatory Alcohol Server Trainingprogram. The product sampled must be available for sale at the store where the sampling occurs. Customers must remain on the premises while consuming samples. The Board may prohibit sampling at a store within the boundaries of an Alcohol Impact Area if the sampling is having an adverse effect on the reduction of chronic public inebriation. All other criteri a needed to establish and mon- itor the pilot project are dete rmined by the Board. The Board may adopt rules to im plement the pilot project. The prohibition against consuming liquor on the premises of a state liquor store is amended to allow spiritssampling, and contract stores are given explicit authority for sampling on their premises. The Board must report on the pilot project to the appropriate committees of the Legislature by December 1, 2012. The report must includ e the results of a survey of state and contract liquor store managers. The act expireson December 1, 2012.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 97 0 Senate 47 1 House 80 18Senate 31 17 (Senate amended)House 85 11 (House concurred)E2SHB 1206 53E2SHB 1206 PARTIAL VETO C 64 L 11 Concerning harassment against criminal justice participants. By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representa- tives Dahlquist, Hurst, Pearson, Harris, Parker, Lytton,Rivers, Johnson, Taylor, Wilcox, Ross, Kelley, Ladenburg,Armstrong, Dammeier, Frockt and Schmick). House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Harassment . A person commits the crime of harassment if he or she: without lawful authority knowingly threatens to: (a) cause bodily injury immediatel y or in the future to the person threatened or to any other person; (b) cause physical damage to the property of a person otherthan the actor; (c) subject the person threatened orany other person to physical confinement or restraint; or (d) maliciously do any ot her act that is intended to substantially harm the pers on threatened or another with respect to his or her physical or mental health orsafety; and by words or conduct pla ces the person threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. \"Words or conduct\" includes the sending of an electronic communication.Criminal harassment is generally a gross misdemean- or. However, the crime is a seriousness level III, class C felony offense if: the offender has a previous conviction for harassment or a harassment-related offense against the same victim, members of the victim's family, or personsnamed in a no-contact or no-harassment order; or the offender committed the crime by threatening to kill that person or another person. Address Confidentiality Program . The Address Confidentiality Program (ACP) is a program that allows victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to have an alternative address de signated as his or her substi- tute mailing address. The ACP also allows state and localagencies to comply with re quests for public records without disclosing the confid ential location of a victim. Summary: Harassment . A person is guilty of harass- ment, if he or she harasses: a criminal justice participant who is performing his or her official duties at the time of the offense; or a criminal justice participant because of an action taken or decision made by the criminal justiceparticipant during the performance of his or her duties. The threat that a criminal justice participant receives must create a fear that a reasonable criminal justice partic- ipant would have under all th e circumstances. Threaten- ing words do not constitute hara ssment if it is apparent to the victim that the offender does not have the present and future ability to carry out the threat. Harassment of a criminal justice participant is a seriousness level III, class C fe lony offense (a sentence of one to three months for a first-time offender). A criminal justice participant includes: any federal, state, or local law enforcement agency employee; federal,state, or local prosecuting attorney or deputy prosecutingattorney; staff member of an y adult corrections institution or local adult detention facility; staff member of any juve-nile corrections institution or local juvenile detention facility; community correctio ns officer; probation or parole officer; member of the Indeterminate SentenceReview Board; advocate from a crime victim/witnessprogram; or defense attorney. Address Confidentiality Program . A criminal justice participant who is a target fo r threats or harassment and any family members residing with him or her are eligible for the ACP. It is a class C felony offense for a person to knowingly provide false or incorrect in formation upon an application for the ACP stating that disc losure of the applicant's address would endanger the saf ety of the criminal justice participant or his/her family. Sentencing Guidelines Commission Report . Begin- ning on December 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, theSentencing Guidelines Commission (SGC) must report tothe appropriate committees of the Legislature on the num-ber of prosecutions of harassment crimes against criminaljustice participants.

By House Committee on Technology, Energy & Commu- nications (originally sponsored by on Ways & Means House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Hunger Programs . There are a number of federal and state programs that provide emergency food for low-income and vulnerable individuals. For example, the Food Assistance Programs, sponsored by theWashington State Department of Agriculture, help peoplein Washington receive food through 450 food banks andmeal programs across the state and through tribal voucherprograms with 32 tribes. Public Utility Districts and Municipal Utilities . Public utility districts (PUDs) and municipal utilities are munici-pal corporations authorized by statute. Generally, the powers of municipal corporations are limited to thosepowers that are: (1) expressly granted by statute or by the Washington Constitution; (2 ) necessarily implied in or incident to powers expressly granted; or (3) essential to thedeclared purposes and objects of the municipalcorporation. State law does not address whether a PUD or a munic- ipal utility may collect do nations to support hunger programs. Public Utility Tax . The Public Utility Tax is a tax on public service businesses, including businesses thatengage in transpor tation, communications, and the supply of electricity, natural gas, an d water. The tax is paid on gross income derived from the operation of public andprivately owned utilities in lieu of the business andoccupation tax. Summary: Public utility districts (PUDs) and municipal utilities may request voluntary donations from their customers to support hunger programs. Any donationscollected must be used to support the maintenance and operation of hunger programs. This authorization tocollect donations to support hunger programs does notpreclude a PUD or a municipal utility from requesting donations to support other types of programs. Donations received by a PUD or a municipal utility are not considered gross income of a light and power business or gas distribution business for the purposes ofcalculating public utility taxes.

By Representatives Liias, Rodne, Goodman and Kenney.House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Tow truck operators who impound vehicles from private or public property, or tow for law enforce- ment agencies, are regulated by state law. Impoundment,the taking and holding of a ve hicle in legal custody with- out the consent of the owner, may only be performed byregistered tow truck operators (RTTOs). If on publicproperty, the impound is at the direction of a law enforce-ment officer; if the vehicle is on private property, theimpound is at the direction of the property owner or his orher agent. When an unauthorized vehi cle is impounded, within 24 hours the towing operator must send an impound noticeto the legal owner, based on information received from House 93 1Senate 48 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1218 55law enforcement. After bein g held for 120 consecutive hours, a vehicle is considered abandoned and the RTTO must file an abandoned vehicle report (A VR) with theDepartment of Licensing (DOL). In response to the A VR,the DOL provides information to the RTTO regarding theowner of the vehicle. Within 24 hours of receipt of thisinformation, the RTTO must send by certified mail a notice of custody and sale to the owner. After 15 days from the rece ipt of information from the DOL, the RTTO may no longer accumulate storagecharges. If the vehicle remains unclaimed, the RTTO mustconduct a sale at public auct ion. The RTTO may not hold the vehicle for longer than 90 days, except in the case of a law enforcement or judicial order. Vehicles may be redeemed by their legal owners any time before the start of the auction upon payment oftowing and storage charges. The RTTOs collect towing and storage charges on abandoned vehicles via a lien against the sale of the vehicle at auction. If the vehicle sale proceeds are lessthan the lien, the remaining charges owed to the RTTO aresent to a collection agency for recovery of the deficientclaim. All surplus funds after the sale of an abandoned vehicle at auction and satisfaction of the RTTO lien aredeposited in the Motor Vehicle Fund. Summary: The storage charges that may no longer be accumulated after the 15-day de adline are clarified to be in addition to storage charges accumulated prior to the receipt of the information from the DOL. Abandoned vehicles that are redeemed by an owner prior to their sale at auction are not subject to the 15-day limit and must pay all accumulated storage charges fromthe time of impoundment up to the time of redemption.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1218 C 151 L 11 Making technical corrections to the Revised Code of Washington. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Goodman and Rodne; by request of Statute Law Committee). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Technical errors and inaccuracies may develop in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) for a variety of reasons. Many of these errors are the result ofsuccessive amendments to the same section of law overseveral years. Others are the result of simple draftingerrors or failure to find and amend every statute that contains a reference to another statute that has beenrepealed or amended in a way that makes the referenceincorrect. The Office of the Code Reviser, under the direction of the Statute Law Committee, is authorized to correct certain \"manifest errors\" in th e statutes. These errors may include such things as mistak es in spelling or obvious clerical or typographical errors. The Code Reviser is alsoauthorized to recommend to the Legislature changes regarding deficiencies, conflicts, or obsolescence, and theneed for reorganization in the statutes.

As part of this authority, theOIC has the authority to review insurance rates in both the individual and small group markets. Insurers are requiredto file their individual and group rates with the OIC. TheOIC may disapprove the rates if they are unreasonable inrelation to the benefits in the agreement. The OIC also reviews individual and small group market insurers forcompliance with statutory requ irements such as adjusted community rating and medical loss ratios (for purposes of determining remittances to the Washington State Health Insurance Pool). An insurance filing is open to public inspection and copying except for actuarial formulae, statistics, and assumptions submitted in support of the filing.House 97 0Senate 49 0House 94 0Senate 49 0EHB 1223 56Summary: The entirety of a rate filing submitted by a health carrier in the individual or small group market on or after July 1, 2011, is availa ble for public inspection, except for the numeric values of each small group rating factorused in the rate filing. An exception to this genera l rule is created for new products. The actuarial form ulae, statistics, and assump- tions associated with an indi vidual or small group market rate filing remain confidential for new products that aredistinct and unique from a hea lth carrier's currently or pre- viously offered plans. A health carrier must make a writ-ten request to the Insurance Commissioner, which must be approved in writing in order for this exception to apply.This exception lasts for one y ear or until the date of the next filing, whichever occurs first. Each health carrier in the individual or small group market must submit with its filings \"Part I Rate Increase Summary\" and \"Part II Written Explanation of RateIncrease\" as set forth by the United States Department ofHealth and Human Services.

By Representatives Ross, Taylor, Chandler, Hinkle, Warnick, Armstrong, Johnson, Moeller, Harris andCondotta. House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: A restaurant selling liquor may be licensed by the Liquor Control Board as a spirits, beer, and wine restaurant or a beer and/or wine restaurant. Some restau-rants allow patrons to bring their own wine to be servedwith the meal that they pu rchase. Restaurants typically charge a fee to open and serve this wine. This charge isreferred to as a corkage fee. Restaurants are not requiredto charge a corkage fee. The liquor tied house laws regulate the relationship between liquor manufacturers and distributo rs (\"industry members\") and retailers. Under the \"financial interest\"law, liquor industry members and retailers may have director indirect financial interests between and among eachother unless the interest has caused or is likely to cause orresult in undue influence or result in an adverse impact onpublic health and safety. Certain financial interests arespecifically allowed; for example, a winery may also act asa retailer to sell wine at the winery. Under the \"moneys'worth\" law, no industry member may advance money ormoneys' worth to a retailer and no retailer may receivemoney or moneys' worth under a written or unwrittenagreement or through busin ess practices. A number of exceptions to the prohibition on moneys' worth have beenHouse 92 5 House 83 5 Senate 44 0 (Senate amended)House 85 2 (House concurred)House 92 0Senate 44 4HB 1229 58enacted. For example, industry members may provide branded promotional items to retailers under certain circumstances, and wineries may provide personalservices such as pouring on retailer premises.

By Representatives Moscoso, Armstrong and Kenney; by request of Department of Licensing. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (Act) established minimum national standards that states must meet when issuing commercial driver'slicenses (CDLs). Under the Act, the Federal MotorCarrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issues standardsthat require states to issue CDLs to certain commercialmotor vehicle drivers only after the driver passesknowledge and skills tests admi nistered by the state, that are related to the type of vehicle the driver expects tooperate. In addition, the Ac t requires that CDL holders meet FMCSA medical standards. A CDL is required in Washington to operate certain types of vehicles. Commercial driver's license holders arenot required to indicate to the Department of Licensing (DOL) whether they engage in interstate commerce. Bothintrastate and interstate commercial motor vehicle driversmust meet minimum medical st andards. Drivers are not required to submit a medical certificate to the DOL, butdrivers must possess a medical certificate while driving acommercial motor vehicle. The DOL grants medicalwaivers for intrastate driv ers, and the FMCSA grants medical waivers for interstate drivers. Beginning January 30, 2012, states must comply with revised federal requirements for licensing commercialmotor vehicle drivers. The revisions are primarily relatedto requirements for driver self-certification of drivingtype, requirements for medical examiner certificates, andrequirements for the DOL re garding recordkeeping for drivers' self-certification and medical certificates, drivernotifications, and downgrad ing licenses for failure to comply.If Washington does not comply with the revised federal requirements, the FMCSA may decertifyWashington's CDL program. Decertification of the stateCDL could lead to the followi ng: (1) loss of 5 percent ($16-17 million) of federal hi ghway funds for the first year of noncompliance and loss of 10 percent ($32-34 million) of federal highway funds for subsequent years, and (2)commercial drivers operating under a Washington CDLwould not be allowed to operate commercial motorvehicles in any activity deemed to be interstate commerce. The Washington State Patrol may issue an out-of-ser- vice order on a commercial vehicle if the vehicle is unsafeto operate or if the driver commits certain violations. Aperson is disqualified from driving a commercial motorvehicle for not less than 90 days but not more than a yearfor the first violation of an ou t-of-service order. A person is disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehiclefor not less than one year but not more than five years for two violations of an out-of-service order in a 10-yearperiod. In addition, monetary penalties may be assessed for violators of out-of-service orders. A driver who is con-victed of violating an out-of-service order on a vehicle issubject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,100 but not more than $2,750 for each violation. An employer whoallows the operation of a commercial motor vehicle whilethere is an out-of-service order on the vehicle is subject toa civil penalty of not less th an $2,750 but not more than $11,000. The fee for issuing each class of CDL is $30 for the original license and subsequent renewals. The fee torenew or extend a CDL for a period other than five yearsis $6 for each year that the license is extended or renewed. Summary: Various changes are ma de to Washington's CDL requirements. A person who applies for a CDL must certify that he or she expects to engage in one of four types of driving: nonexcepted interstate, excep ted interstate, nonexcepted intrastate, or excepted intrasta te. For a two-year period of time, the DOL may require a person who holds a CDL prior to the effective date of this act to self-certify driving type. Definitions are added for each of the four types of driving. Those who engage in excepted interstate driving are not required to obtain a medical certificate. Those whoengage in excepted intrastate driving are excepted from all or parts of the state CDL driver qualification requirements.A person who self-certifies that he or she expects toengage in nonexcepted inters tate driving must submit a medical examiner's certificate to the DOL. A category labeled \"V\" has been added to the endorse- ments and restrictions to indicate that a driver has beenissued a federal medical variance. If a driver fails to self-certify or provide a medical examiner's certificate when one is required, the DOL must mark the commercial driver license information systemHouse 94 0Senate 45 4SHB 1237 59(CDLIS) driver's status as \"not-certified\" and must start procedures to downgrade the driver's license. A driver whose CDL has been downgraded may restore his or herCDL privileges by providing the necessary documents tothe DOL. If a driver's medical certification or medical variance information expires, the DO L must provide notification that the driver will be given a noncertified medical status,and the DOL must provide no tification that the driver's CDL privileges will be removed unless the driver changes his or her self-certification of driving type. If a driver isgiven a noncertified medical status, the DOL must initiateprocedures for downgrading the driver's license. Recordkeeping requirements are revised for the DOL: Within 10 days of issuance of a CDL, the DOL must notify the CDLIS. The DOL must maintain th e self-certification of driv- ing type in the driver's record and in the CDLIS driver record. The DOL must retain the medical examiner's certifi- cate for three years after it is issued. Within 10 days of receiving a submitted medical examiner's certificate, th e DOL must post the infor- mation from the certificate to the CDLIS. The DOL must update the medical certification status of the driver to \"not-certif ied\" within 10 days of a medical certificate expiring or being rescinded. The DOL must update the CDLIS driver record to include medical variance in formation within 10 days of receiving the information. Minimum disqualification periods are increased for a driver who violates an out-of-service order. A person is disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle fornot less than 180 days but not more than a year for the firstviolation of an out-of-service order. A person is disquali-fied from driving a commercial motor vehicle for not lessthan two years but not more than five years for twoviolations of an out-of-service order in a 10-year period. Monetary penalties for drivers and employers for violations of out-of-service orders are increased. A driverwho is convicted of violating an out-of-service order issubject to a civil penalty of no t less than $2,500 for a first violation and not less than $5,000 for a second orsubsequent violation. An employer who allows the oper-ation of a commercial motor vehicle when there is an out-of-service order is subject to a penalty of not less than$2,750 but not more than $25,000. The fee for issuing each class of CDL is increased to $61 for the original license and subsequent renewals. The fee to renew or extend a CDL for a period other than fiveyears is $12.20 for each year that the license is extended or renewed.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Representatives Haler, Clibborn, Klippert and Moeller). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The federal Military Selective Service Act of 1948 requires virtually a ll men between the ages of 18 and 26 living in the United St ates, as well as male United States citizens between the ages of 18 and 26 living abroad, to register with the Selective Service System.Individuals can register many different ways, includingonline, by mail, or by checking a box on the federalapplication for student aid. Failure to register with the Selective Service System is a felony punishable by up to five years imprisonment, amaximum fine of $250,000, or both. In addition to the criminal penalties, registrati on with the Selective Service System is required fo r men to remain eligible for federal student loans and grants, many federal jobs, certain jobtraining benefits, and United States citizenship for male immigrants seeking citizenship. Summary: All male applicants for driver's licenses, instruction permits, intermedia te licenses, and identicards who are under the age of 26 must be given the opportunity to register with the Selectiv e Service System. An appli- cant who declines to register with the Selective Service System may not be denied th e requested document if the applicant meets all of the other requirements to receive the requested document. When an applicant authorizes the Department of Licensing (DOL) to forward personal information neces- sary to register with the Selective Service System, the DOL is required to forward th e personal information to the Selective Service System within 10 days of receipt of theapplication. The DOL is requ ired to notify the applicant that by submitting the applica tion he is authorizing the DOL to register him with the Selective Service System. If the applicant is under the age of 18, the DOL is required tonotify the applicant that the registration will occur whenHouse 94 0 Senate 46 1 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 40 5 (Senate amended)House 56 41 (House concurred)HB 1239 60the applicant turns 18 years of age.

By Representatives Orcutt, Hunter, Johnson and Rivers. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: A tax warrant is a document that the Department of Revenue (DOR) uses to establish the debt of a taxpayer. When a tax warrant is filed with the superiorcourt in the county where the taxpayer owns real or per- sonal property, a lien is create d. The lien is subordinate to bona fide interests of third persons that vested before thefiling of the warrant. The lien encumbers all real and per-sonal property used in the business and owned by the tax-payer. The tax lien becomes a public record. Under thislien authority, the DOR may also enforce collections of a tax debt. Examples of enforc ed collections include: levy of bank accounts, garnishment of wages, and seizure andsale of assets. Summary: In lieu of filing a tax warrant with a superior court, the Department of Revenue (DOR) may file a notice of lien for any real property in which the taxpayer has anownership interest if the total amount of the warrantexceeds $25,000, and the DOR determines that issuing the notice of lien would best protect the state's interest incollecting the amount due on the warrant. A notice of lien is a lien against specific real property as opposed to all real property when a tax warrant is used. If a tax warrant has already been filed with a superior court, the DOR may issue an d record a notice of lien against real property and f ile a conditional satisfaction of the warrant with the court if the DOR determines that this is in the best interest of co llecting the amount due on thewarrant. The filing of a co nditional satisfaction releases any liens on real or personal property. If a taxpayer requests the DOR to file a notice of lien in lieu of a warrant, the DO R may request the taxpayer's current credit report and an abstract of title, at the tax-payer's expense, for the property that will be subject to the notice of lien.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012 SHB 1243 C 67 L 11 Concerning crimes against an imals belonging to another person.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1247 C 19 L 11 Concerning the staffing levels and staff training require- ments for secure commun ity transition facilities. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon-sored by Representatives Ka gi, Hunter, Darneille and Kenney; by request of Department of Social and HealthServices). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Under the Community Protection Act of 1990, a sexually violent predator (SVP) may be civilly committed upon the expiration of that person's criminalsentence. A SVP is a person who has been convicted of orcharged with a sexually viol ent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts ofsexual violence if not confined to a secure facility. Crimes that constitute a sexually viol ent offense are enumerated in the statute and may include a federal or out-of-stateoffense if the crime would be a sexually violent offenseunder the laws of this stat e. The term \"predatory\" is defined to mean acts directed towards strangers or individ-uals with whom a relationshi p has been established for the primary purpose of victimization. When a prosecuting agency has filed a petition against a person alleging that the pe rson is a SVP or when the person has previously been found to be a SVP and issubject to a hearing for cond itional release, the person is entitled to be examined by qualified experts or pro- fessional persons. If the person is indigent, the court mustassist the person in obtaini ng an expert or professional person to perform an examination. Once a person is found to be a SVP, the person is entitled to periodic hearings to determine if the person continues to meet the definitio n of a SVP or if release to a less restrictive alternative is appropriate. A state-endorsedplan for a less restrictive a lternative will be a graduated release plan that entails the SVP moving to a Secure Community Transition Facility (SCTF). A SCTF is afacility that provides greater freedom to the SVP and isdesigned to allow the SVP to gradually transition back tothe community while continuing treatment. A SCTF is required to meet the following minimum staffing requirements: for SCTFs opened prior to July 1, 2003, that have six or fewer residents, the facility must maintain one staff per three residents during normal waking hours and one staff per four residents during sleeping hours, butin no case less than two staff per housing unit; and for SCTFs opened after July 1, 2003, with six or fewer residents, the facility must maintain one staffper resident during normal waking hours and twostaff per three residents during normal sleeping hours, but in no case less than two staff per housing unit. If a SCTF has six or fewer residents, all staff must be classified as a Residential Rehabilitation Counselor II or have a classification that indicates an equivalent or higherlevel of skill, experience, and training. All staff must have training in sex offender issues, self-defense, and crisisde-escalation skills and must pass a background check. Summary: The minimum staffing requirements for a SCTF are modified. At least three staff are required for the SCTF on McNeil Island and at least two staff are requiredfor the SCTF in Seattle. The staffing requirements applyunless there are no residents housed at the facility. If thereare six or fewer residents at the SCTF, the staff must beclassified as a Residential Rehabilitative Counselor II or higher.

By Representatives Hunter and Darneille; by request of Office of Financial Management. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Rulemaking Procedures Under the Admin- istrative Procedures Act . A rule or regulation is a written policy or procedure by a state agency that is generally applicable to a group of peopl e, industries, activities, or circumstances. Agencies adopt rules under the proceduralrequirements established by the WashingtonAdministrative Procedures Act (APA). The APA's procedural requirements for rulemaking include: solicitation of comme nts on possible rulemaking prior to filing a notice of proposed rulemaking; prepara- tion of a semi-annual agenda for rules under development;maintenance of a rulemaking docket containing a listing ofeach pending rulemaking proceeding; having copies ofnotices available for public inspection; notifying persons who have requested notification of proposed rulemaking;holding a rulemaking hearing; and accepting oral andwritten public comment. An agency may not adopt a ru le that is substantially different from the rule proposed in the published notice ofproposed rule adoption or a supplemental notice in theproceeding. An agency must file with the Code Reviser acertified copy of all rules it adopts. Emergency Rules Under the APA . Under certain circumstances, an agency may adopt, amend, or repeal ad-ministrative rules without following the specified APAprocedures. These emergency ru les take effect upon filing with the Code Reviser, unless a later date is specified inthe order of adoption. An emergency rule may not remainin effect for longer than 12 0 days after it is filed. To adopt emergency rules, an agency must find good cause that: immediate adoption of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption ofa permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest; state or federal law, federal rule, or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or observing the time requirements of notice and oppor- tunity to comment upon th e adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or require- ments of the agency, if the rule is needed to imple- ment budget requirements or reductions for fiscalyears 2009-2011.An agency must incorporat e its finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding in its order adopting the emergency rule. Summary: The authorization to ad opt emergency rules to address agency fiscal needs and requirements is extended. Agencies may adopt, amend, or repeal rules on anemergency basis to implement requirements or reductionsin appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal years 2009-2013.

By House Committee on Agricu lture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Lytton, Blake, Takko, Van De Wege, Ladenburg and Rolfes). House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Legislature created the Institute of Forest Products (IFP) under the Department of Conserva- tion and Development in 1947. Legislation was enacted totransfer the administration of the IFP to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington (UW) in 1959. The IFP was renamed the Institute of Forest Resources(IFR) in 1959 and was made responsible for pursuing research and education related to forest resources and itsmultiple uses. Summary: The authorizing statues for the IFR are amended both technically, to modernize the language, and substantively. These changes include correcting the titleof the chief administer of th e UW's forest resource pro- gram, directing that person to coordinate the various co- operatives and centers located administratively within the UW to broaden the UW's forest products research and out-reach, and providing the auth ority for the creation of an 11-member policy advisory board. The direction to the IFR is expanded to clarify that its mission is to pursue coordi nated research related to the forestry sector in both urban and rural areas. The missionof the IFR is expanded to consider traditional forestry issues along with emerging issues such as environmentalservices, sustainable management, and forest restoration. The IFR is also directed to provide a framework for identifying, prioritizing, fund ing, and conducting interdis- ciplinary research critical to the forest sector and forsynthesizing complex forestry issues and information intotools that aid policymakers. House 91 4 Senate 47 0SHB 1257 63Direction is given for the IFR to utilize appropriated funds that are dis tinct from the genera l appropriation for the UW. The IFR is provided additional mechanisms for raising funds such as the receipt of conveyances and bequests.

By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Repr esentatives Stanford, Kirby and Kelley; by request of Insurance Commissioner). House Committee on Business & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: General Background on Financial Regula- tion of Insurers . Capital and Surplus Requirements. Insurers are required to have minimum amounts of capitaland surplus to transact busi ness in Washington. The amounts vary based on which type or types of insurance the insurer is licensed to sell. Risk-based Capital. This tool is used to determine if an insurer has enough assets in relation to the risk it holds.There is a complicated series of algorithms used to deter-mine the asset to risk ratio. If the insurer does not meetthreshold ratios, the Insurance Commissioner (Commis-sioner) may take prescribed actions. The types of actionsrange from requiring more reports to liquidation. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Standards. As a general rule, the financial and accounting standards used by insurance regulators are uniform standards developed by the NAIC. The NAICperiodically reviews the financial regulatory structures ofthe states to determine if th ey meet minimum thresholds. If a state meets the appropriate standards, it is \"accredited\"and other states know they can rely on the examinations ofthat state. If it is not accredited, other states may chooseto conduct more thorough exams of the companies domi-ciled in that state. This increases the costs for the otherstates and for the examined insurers. Quarterly and Annual Report. Every insurer must submit specific financial r ecords to the NAIC and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) every quarterand each year. These are public records.Financial Exams. At least once every five years, the OIC is required to conduct a financial examination of an insurer domiciled in the state. Insurers must provide all records to the examiners and pay for the examination. Regulation of Investments . The NAIC has two different model acts to regula te insurers and investments. Investment models are not included as a part of theaccreditation process. The first model, the \"defin ed limits\" model, restricts the specific level of investme nts by insurers in certain areas. The second model, the \"defined standards\" model,provides more flexibility for insurers by utilizing guidance and principles for investment. In the defined standardsmodel, restrictions on investments are applied to makesure the insurer meets minimum financial standards. Afterthe threshold standards are met, an insurer has more flexi- bility to invest according to the insurer's principles and policies. State Investment Standards. The state's regulatory framework regarding insurer investments predates the current NAIC models. Insure r investments are limited to certain specific levels of investment classes similar to adefined limit approach as the base for oversight. Theinvestment standards apply to domestic insurers but thereis also a provision requiring insurers formed in another state or country to have investments of \"a quality substan-tially as high as those required\" for domestic insurers. Transactions Authorized by Board or Committee. Every investment, loan, sale, or exchange made by anydomestic insurer must be authorized or approved by itsboard of directors (board) or by a committee that is charged with the duty of making the investment, loan, sale,or exchange. The minutes of any such committee must berecorded and reports submitted to the board for approvalor disapproval. The only exce ption is for policy loans of a life insurer. Limits on Investments. There are prescribed limits for aggregate investments in: cash; bonds; real property held as a home office; real property investments; mortgages; equities and preferred equities; foreign investments; loans on policies; and other investments. Some investments either are not recognized or are not allowed by Washington law. For example, an insurer may not invest in mutual funds or in several types of foreign investment, including currencies, loans, and real property. Prohibited Investments. Unless approved by the Commissioner in advance, an insurer must not invest in orhold: issued shares of its own capital stock, except for the purpose of mutualization;House 97 0Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1257 64 securities issued by any corporation if a majority of its stock having voting power is owned by or for the benefit of any one or more of the insurer's officers and directors; any investment or loan not authorized by state law or in excess of the allowed limits; securities issued by any insolvent corporation; obligations that do not meet standards regarding medium grade or lower investments; or any investment or security which is found by the Commissioner to be design ed to evade any prohibi- tion of the insurance code.An insurer may demand a hearing regarding any act, threatened act, or failure to act by the Commissioner. This includes determinations re garding investments and actions or inactions based on those determinations. Summary: The existing provisions for the regulation of insurer investments are repealed. A new regulatory struc- ture for insurer inve stments is created to apply to: domes- tic insurers; United States branches of alien insurersentered through this state; alien insurers admitted and using this state as their port of entry; domestic fraternal benefit societies; domestic health care service contractors; domestic health maintenan ce organizations; and domestic self-funded multiple employ er welfare arrangements. The new oversight provisions establish minimum financial security benchmar ks and asset standards for insurers. Insurers may not exceed specified aggregateinvestments in meeting their minimum financial securitybenchmarks. After the threshold benchmarks are met,insurers may invest beyond the specified aggregate limits. Minimum Financial Security Benchmark . The mini- mum financial security benchm ark for an insurer is the greater of: the authorized cont rol level risk-based capital applicable to the insurer in current statutes; or the minimum capital or minimum surplus required for the maintenance of an in surer's ability to transact business. The Commissioner may order a minimum financial security benchmark to apply to a specific insurer provided it is not less than a specifi ed amount. The Commissioner must determine the amount of surplus that constitutes an insurer's minimum financial security benchmark, as anamount that will provide reas onable security against con- tingencies affecting the insurer's financial position that arenot fully covered by reserves or by reinsurance. There are a host of contingencies and fa ctors that must be considered by the Commissioner in maki ng a determination. The Commissioner may adopt a minimum financial security benchmark by rule that is a mu ltiple of authorized control level risk-based capital to ap ply to any class of insurers. The benchmark for a class must not be less than theamounts currently required by statute under specifiedconditions.The minimum asset requirement is the the sum of an insurer's liabilities and its minimum financial security benchmark. Invested assets may be counted toward theminimum investment requirement, only so far as theinvestments comply with the statutes, any rules adopted, and orders issued by the Commissioner. An investmentthat qualified as an admitted asset prior to the effective date of the act remains qualified as an admitted asset. If aninsurer does not own and cannot apply an amount of assetsequal to its minimum as set requirement, the Commissioner may deem it to be financially hazardous. Investments . An insurer may loan or invest its funds, and may buy, sell, hold title to, possess, occupy, pledge,convey, manage, protect, insure, and deal with itsinvestments, property, and other assets. Reasonable Prudence Standard . In making invest- ments for an insurer, the bo ard must exercise the judgment and care that persons of re asonable prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise rega rding the permanent disposi- tion of their funds, consider ing the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital. Investments must be of sufficient valu e, liquidity, and diversity to assure the insurer's ability to meet its outstanding obliga- tions based on reasonable a ssumptions. The insurer must establish and implement internal controls and proceduresto assure compliance with investment policies andprocedures. A number of specific factors must be evaluated by the insurer and considered along w ith its business in determin- ing whether an investment po rtfolio or investment policy is prudent. The Commissioner must consider the samefactors prior to making a dete rmination that an insurer's investment portfolio or investment policy is not prudent. Written Investment Policy . An insurer must establish and follow a written investment policy. The policy mustbe reviewed and approved by the insurer's board at leastannually. The policy must include specific writtenguidelines appropriate to the insurer's business. Limits on Investments . There are standards or prescribed limits for ag gregate investments in: cash; bonds; real property held as a office; real property investments; mortgages; equities, preferred equ ities, and mutual funds; investments in foreign currencies, loans, property, bonds, and equities; loans on policies; and other investments. Prohibited Investments . An insurer must not invest in: the use of a derivative instrument for replication, speculative, or for any purp oses other than hedging or income generation;SHB 1257 65 real property for speculative, ranching, farming, min- ing, gaming, amusement, oil, gas, or mineral exploration, or club purposes; issued shares of its own capital stock, held directly or indirectly, except for the purpose of mutualization; securities issued by any corporation if a majority of its stock having voting power is owned directly or indirectly by or for the benefit of any one or more of the insurer's officers and directors; securities issued by any insolvent corporation; any instrument or secu rity which is found by the Commissioner to be design ed to evade any limitation or prohibition of the Insurance Code; and other investments prohibited by rule. A reasonable time must be allowed for disposal of a prohibited investment if: the investment is demons trated by the insurer to have been legal when made; the investment is the resu lt of a mistake made in good faith; or the Commissioner deems that a sale of the asset is contrary to the interests of insureds, creditors, or the general public. Reports to the Commissioner . The Commissioner may require any of the following: statements, reports, answers to questionnaires, and other information; an explanation of any data storage or communication system in use; and production of informa tion from any books, records, data systems, computers, or any other information storage system at a reasona ble time and in a reason- able manner. An insurer or specified person must reply within 15 business days to a written in quiry from the Commissioner. Failure to make a timely response is a violation. The Commissioner may require verification of any communi-cation made to the Commissioner. The Commissionermay bring suit against any pers on that provided informa- tion that is not truthful and accurate. Commissioner's Powers . If the Commissioner deter- mines that an insurer's inv estment practices do not meet the statutory requirements, the Commissioner may orderthe insurer to make the neces sary changes. The Commis- sioner may impose reasonable additional restrictions uponthe admissibility or valuatio n of investments or may impose restrictions on the in vestment practices of an in- surer, including prohibition or divestment if the Commis- sioner determines that the fina ncial condition of an insurer is or may endanger: a current investment practi ce or plan of an insurer; or the interests of insureds , creditors, or the general public.The Commissioner may count assets in which an insurer is required to invest under the laws of a foreigncountry as a condition for doin g business in that country toward the satisfaction of the minimum asset requirement. If the Commissioner is satis fied with the financial stability of an insurer and th e competence of management, the Commissioner may: adjust the class limitations for that insurer. Adjust- ments are limited to an amou nt equal to 10 percent of the insurer's liabilities; or exempt the insurer from sp ecific restrictions to the extent that the Commissione r is satisfied that the interests of insureds, creditors, and the general public are protected. Commissioner Staff . The Commissioner may retain expert staff at the insurer's expense as is reasonably necessary to assist in reviewing the insurer's investments. Insurer's Right to a Hearing . An insurer aggrieved by an order or any other act or failure to act by theCommissioner may request a hearing. Confidentiality of the Investment Policy . The invest- ment policy and information related to the investment policy provided to the Commiss ioner for review is confi- dential and is not a public record or subject to subpoena. Rules . The Commissioner ma y adopt rules interpret- ing and implementing the provisions of the act. TheCommissioner has specific authority to adopt rules regarding certain investment restrictions. Report . By December 1, 2011, the Commissioner must submit a report to the Go vernor and to the appropri- ate committees of the Legislatur e. The report must include the following information: the estimated total dolla r amount of insurer assets affected by the act; an analysis of the statutory changes in investment regulation made by the ac t and the reasons for the changes; an analysis of any risks to policyholders and tax- payers associated with the implementation of the act and any provisions in the act that protect against those risks; any proposed rul es to implement the act; any changes to staffing in the OIC related to imple- menting the act; an explanation describing why the investment policy of an insurer must be exempt from public disclosureand subpoena; a list of other states that have adopted all or part of the NAIC model legislation on insurer investmentsand the reasons for their decisions; and a list of states that have explicitly chosen not to adopt the NAIC model legislation and the reasons for their decisions. HB 1263 66In preparing the report, the Commissioner must con- sult with the Department of Financial Institutions and the Washington State Investment Board. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2012 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that required the Insuran ce Commissioner to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature. VETO MESSAGE ON SHB 1257 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 19, Substitute House Bill 1257 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to adopting the investments of insurers model act.\"This bill updates the statutes on insurer investments to increase financial security and to provide mo re flexibility for insurers to manage their investments. Section 19 would require the Of fice of the Insurance Commis- sioner to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature, in consultation with the Department of Financial Institutions and the State Investment Board, by December 1, 2011. This is prior to the effective dat e of the act, July 1, 2012. Section 19 would require the Office of the Insurance Commiss ioner to gather information that is a redundant to the bill analysis, overly burdensome to obtain, or difficult to analyze prior to implem entation of the law. Further, re- quiring proposed rules to be subm itted to the Governor and Leg- islature would infringe upon the role of the Insurance Commissioner and would blur the di stinction between the Legisla- ture and a state executive office with regard to the rulemaking process. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 19 of Substitute House Bill 1257. With the exception of Section 19, Subst itute House Bill 1257 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor HB 1263 C 68 L 11 Addressing the definition of employer for certain public corrections entities formed by counties or cities under RCW 39.34.030. By Representatives Crouse, Bailey and Seaquist; by request of Select Committee on Pension Policy. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Public Safety Em ployees' Retirement System (PSERS) was created in 2004 and opened tomembers on July 1, 2006. The PSERS provides retirement benefits for state and local government employees who work in positions with law enforcement duties but are noteligible for membership in the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System. Members ofPSERS with at least 20 years of service will be eligible for full retirement benefits from ag e 60, five years earlier than the regular retirement age in Public Employees' Retire-ment System Plans 2 and 3. Members of PSERS with 20 years of service may also re tire early beginning at age 53 with a 3 percent reduction in benefits per year of earlyretirement. Membership in PSERS is restricted by an individual's employer and by specific job criteria. The PSERSemployers are defined as the Department of Corrections,the Department of Natural Resources, the Parks and Rec-reation Commission, the Gambling Commission, the Washington State Patrol, the Liquor Control Board,county corrections department s, the corrections depart- ments of municipalities not clas sified as first-class cities, and employers employing st atewide elective officials. A new correctional facility is expected to open in the fall of 2011 as a shared jail for the cities of Auburn,Burien, Des Moines, Federal Way, Renton, SeaTac, andTukwila. A multi-jurisdictiona l agency called the South Correctional Entity has been created under the InterlocalCooperation Act to build and operate the facility. About 124 full-time corrections officers will be employed at thefacility, including many that will transfer from pre-exist- ing facilities operated by the participating cities. Corrections officers employed at the facility will not beeligible for PSERS because the statutory definition ofemployer in PSERS does not include corrections departments created by interlocal agreements betweencities. Summary: The definition of employer for the Public Safety Employees' Retiremen t System is amended to include public corrections entities formed by counties, cities, or both. The employ er definition change applies retroactively to any public co rrections entity existing on or after January 1, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 98 0 Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred) House 97 0Senate 47 0SHB 1266 67SHB 1266 C 132 L 11 Modifying the landlord-ten ant act and other related provisions. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Pedersen, Rodne, Warnick, Kenney and Kelley). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: The Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RLTA) regulates the creation of residential tenancies and the relationship between landlo rds and tenants of residen- tial dwelling units. The RLTA establishes rights and dutiesof both tenants and landlords, procedures for the parties toenforce their rights, and reme dies for violations of the RLTA. Landlord duties include such things as the duty to maintain the premises in reasonably good repair andremedy defective conditions within specified timelines.Tenant duties include the duty to pay rent, not damage thedwelling or allow a nuisance , and not engage in drug activity or criminal activity on the premises. The RLTA covers a wide variety of other issues governing the land-lord-tenant relationship, incl uding: prohibited provisions in rental agreements and proh ibited practices by landlords; the landlord's right of acce ss to the dwelling unit; proce- dures and remedies available to a landlord when a tenanthas abandoned the tenancy or is subject to eviction for violations of the RLTA; and requirements with respect tothe collection and re tention of security deposits, nonre- fundable fees, and fees or de posits to hold a dwelling unit or secure a tenancy. Summary: Numerous provisions of the RLTA are revised and updated. Long-Arm Jurisdiction Over Out-of-State Owners . District courts are given authority to issue service of process out of state in actions filed in the small claimsdepartment if the action is brought under the RLTA againstan owner. An owner who resi des outside the state and who violates a provision of the RLTA is deemed to have sub-mitted himself or herself to the jurisdiction of the state. Inactions brought in small claims court, the notice of claim may be served out of state in the same manner as if servedin the state except that the date on which the party isrequired to appear must not be less than 60 days from the date of service. Tenant Remedies for Defective Condition . Changes are made to provisions governing a tenant's rights when alandlord fails to remedy a defective condition within required time frames after written notice from the tenant.A tenant may use first-class mail, rather than certifiedmail, when sending a notice to the landlord containing agood faith estimate of needed repairs. The amount thetenant may deduct from rent in order to carry out repairs isincreased from no more than one month's rent to no morethan two month's rent. In the case of defective conditions that a landlord must commence to remedy within 10 days, the time period a tenant must wait in order to commence repairs after providing a written estimate is reduced to twodays, rather than five days, but in no case sooner than 10days after notice of the defe ctive condition. The value of repairs that may be completed by the tenant and deductedfrom the rent is increased fro m one-half month's rent to one-month's rent. Landlord Entry . More specific notice requirements are established for landlord entry into a tenant's dwellingunit. The notice must be in writing and specify the date ordates of entry and either the exact time of entry or a periodof time during whic h entry will occur. The notice must also include a telephone number for the tenant to call and communicate an objection or request to reschedule theentry. Fees or Deposits to Hold a Unit or Secure a Tenancy . When a landlord requires a fee or deposit to hold a dwell-ing unit or secure that a prospective tenant will move intoa dwelling unit, the landlord may not withhold a portion of the fee or deposit if the dwelling unit fails a tenant-basedrental assistance program inspection by a qualifiedinspector. A landlord may elec t to no longer hold a unit for a tenant if the inspection do es not occur within 10 days from the date the fee or deposit is collected. The penaltyfor a violation of provisions relating to fees or deposits tohold a unit or secure a tenancy is changed from $100 totwo times the fee or deposit. Security Deposits . A landlord who collects a security deposit without providing a written checklist describingthe condition of the dwelling unit at the commencement of the tenancy is liable for the am ount of the deposit, and the prevailing party in an action may recover costs and reason-able attorneys' fees. A tenant may request one freereplacement copy of the written checklist. When a tenant's dwelling unit is foreclosed upon and the security deposit is not transferred to the successor afterthe foreclosure sale, the foreclosed-upon owner mustprovide a full refund to the tenant immediately after the foreclosure sale. A foreclosed-upon owner who fails toeither transfer the deposit to the successor or refund it tothe tenant is liable for damages up to two times the amountof the deposit. Damages for Certain Prohibited Actions . The damages that may be awarded to a tenant when a landlordengages in certain unlawful practices are increased.Statutory damages of up to $500 and costs of suit are add-ed to the remedies a tenant may recover if a landlordincludes prohibited provisions in a rental agreement. The statutory damages a tenant may recover when a landlordintentionally and wrongfully takes and detains a tenant's property are increased from $100 to $500 for each day theE2SHB 1267 68tenant is deprived of the property, up to a maximum of $5,000. Other Changes . When there is a change in the land- lord, the requirement that the tenant be notified by certified mail is removed and instead the tenant must be notified in writing either by personally delivering the notice to the tenant, or by mailing the notice to the tenantand posting it on the premises. The types of criminal activ ity resulting in arrest that allow a landlord to proceed directly to an unlawfuldetainer action against the te nant are expanded to include physical assaults and the use of a firearm or other deadlyweapon. The dollar limit for when a la ndlord may sell a tenant's abandoned property upon seven -day notice is raised from $50 to $250. A landlord must provide each tenant who signs a lease agreement with an ex ecuted copy of the rental agreement, and a tenant is entitled to one free replacement copy. Inaddition, a landlord must pr ovide a receipt for all tenant payments made in cash. If a landlord charges a nonrefundable fee without providing the tenant with a written rental agreement, thelandlord is liable for the amou nt of any fees collected as nonrefundable fees. Any fee that is not designated in therental agreement as a nonrefundable fee must be treated asa refundable fee. Various provisions of the RLTA are revised for clarity and to remove unnecessary language.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 E2SHB 1267 C 283 L 11 Clarifying and expanding the rights and obligations of state registered domestic partners and other couplesrelated to parentage. By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representa-tives Pedersen, Walsh, Jinkins, Eddy, Roberts, Kagi,Sullivan, Van De Ladenburg, Lytton, Moscoso,Upthegrove, Green, Hasegawa and Tharinger; by requestof Washington State Bar Association). House Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Genera l Government Appropria- tions & Oversight Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Washington's Uniform Parentage Act (UPA) is based on model le gislation from the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL). The NCCUSL amended its model act in 2002and Washington has not yet adopted those changes. Under the UPA, parentage may be established based on a presumption, signed acknowledgment, or adjudica-tion. A person is a presumed parent if the child was born in the context of marriage. A person is an acknowledged parent if the person signs an acknowledgment of paternitythat is later filed with the St ate Registrar of Vital Statistics. A person is an adjudicated parent if the person's parentagewas determined in a court proceeding. The procedures for challenging parentage vary depending on whether the ch ild has a presumed, acknow- ledged, or adjudicated parent. Generally, a challenge mustbe brought within two years after the child's birth, andparentage may be disproved by admissible results of genetic testing. There are specific procedures for when genetic testing may be ordered and when a motion forgenetic testing may be denied. In 2009 legislation was enacted adding language to the UPA stating that terms such as spouse, marriage, husband, and wife used in the UPA must be interpreted to applyequally to domestic partners, to the extent that such inter- pretation does not conflict with federal law. In addition, gender-specific terms must be construed to be gender neutral. Summary: The UPA is amended to specifically reference state-registered domestic partnerships in various provi-sions and to specify that the UPA applies to persons of thesame sex who have children together to the same extent itapplies to opposite sex couples who have childrentogether. However, acknowle dgments of paternity apply only when there is a mother and a man claiming to be thegenetic father of the child. Gender-specific terms arereplaced with gender-neutral te rms. Some of the changes made by the NCCUSL are adopted, including a newprovision for the presumption of parentage. A person is apresumed parent if, for the first two years of the child'slife, the person resided in the same home with the child and openly held out the child as his or her own. The time period under which a person may challenge parentage is extended from two years to four years. If an action to challenge parent age is commenced more than two years after the child's birth, the child must be made aparty to the action. If a person signed an acknowledgmentor denial of paternity when the person was a minor, theperson may commence an ac tion to rescind the acknow- ledgment or denial up until the date of his nineteenthbirthday. House 92 5Senate 46 3ESHB 1277 69Provisions on genetic test ing do not apply when the child is conceived through assisted reproduction. A person who provides gametes for or consents to assisted reproduction with another person with the intent to be the parent of the child is the parent of the resulting child. Theparentage of a child conceived through assisted reproduc-tion may be disproved by ad missible evidence showing the intent of the parents. A child conceived through assisted reproduction who is at least 18 years old must be provided, upon the child'srequest, access to medical hist ory information of the donor and, in some cases, access to identifying information ofthe donor.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representative Cody; by request of Departmentof Social and Health Services). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Social and Health Services (Department) licenses three primary types of residential long-term care se ttings: nursing homes (some- times referred to as skilled nursing facilities), boardinghomes, and adult family homes. Nursing Homes . Nursing homes provide continuous 24-hour convalescent and chro nic care. Such care may include the administration of medications, preparation ofspecial diets, bedside nursing care, application of dress-ings and bandages, and carrying out treatment prescribedby licensed health care providers. Boarding Homes . Boarding homes are facilities that provide housing and basic services to seven or moreresidents. Services provided by boarding homes include housekeeping, meals, snacks, laundry, and activities. They may also provide domi ciliary care including assis- tance with activities of daily living, health supportservices, and intermittent nursing services. Adult Family Homes . Adult family homes are facilities licensed to care for up to six individuals who need long-term care. These homes provide room, board,laundry, necessary supervision, and assistance withactivities of daily living, personal care, and nursingservices. The Department administers the licensing programs for each of the long-term care settings. The Department'slicensing functions include pr ocessing applications for new providers, performing inspections, investigatingcomplaints, and taking enforcement action if resolution isnot met. In some instances, formal dispute resolutions or hearings may be included. License fees are set as directed in statute and depend on facility type. The Department is directed to set thenursing home license fee in an amount adequate to fully recover the costs of the licensure. The boarding home feeis to be based on costs to administer the program, and theadult family home license fee is set in statute. In Washington there are approximately: 220 licensed skilled nursing facilities that provide services for approximately 9,900 Medicaid eligible clients. The average number of beds per facility is 96 and there are a total of 22,788 beds in Washington; 550 licensed boarding homes that provide services for approximately 6,800 Medi caid eligible clients. About 2 percent of these are clients with developmen-tal disabilities. The aver age number of beds per facility is 49 and there are a total of 28,926 beds in Washington; and 2,900 licensed adult family homes that provide services for approximately 6,900 Medicaid eligibleclients.

Adult family home provider s, applicants, and resident managers are required to be able to communicate inHouse 57 41Senate 27 21 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 27 21 (Senate amended)House 57 40 (House concurred)70English. The provider and resident manager must assure that there are staff available to residents at all times whoare able to communicate with the resident in his or her primary language. Inspections of adult family homes must be conducted on a 15-month average. Adult Family Home Practice Requirements . Adult family home providers are ultimately responsible for thedaily operations of each li censed adult family home and for the health, safety, and well-being of each resident ineach of their homes. Residents who require physical,mental, or verbal assistance must be kept on the groundfloor. Adult family home providers are prohibited from operating a separate business in the home.

The Department is autho-rized to impose civil penalties up to $3,000 for eachincident that violates adult family home licensing laws. Acivil penalty up to $10,000 may be imposed upon a currentor former provider who op erates an unlicensed adult family home. Receipts from civil penalties may be usedfor promoting the quality of life for residents living in adult family homes. Long-Term Care Facility Fees . As of July 1, 2011, the per-bed licensing fee for nursing homes and boardinghomes shall be established by the Legislature in theoperating budget, ra ther than by the Department. As of July 1, 2011, the $100 license fee for adult family homesestablished in statute is replaced by a per-bed fee to bedetermined in the operating bu dget. Licensing fees must not exceed the Department's annual costs for licensing andoversight activities and must include the Department'scost of paying providers for the amount the fee attributedto Medicaid clients. Other Provisions . Subject to funding, the Department is directed to use additiona l investigative resources to decrease the average time be tween adult family home and boarding home inspections. The Department mustdevelop a statewide internal quality review and account- ability program to improve co nsistency in investigative activities and outcomes for vu lnerable individuals. In addition, the Department mu st convene a quality assur- ance panel to recommend ways to improve the safety of residents and oversight of adult family homes. The panelmust report its recommendatio ns to the Governor and the appropriate committees of the Legislature by December 1, 2012. These provisions are nu ll and void unless funded in the operating budget. It is specified that licenses for boarding homes are only valid for one year. Th e Department has discretion to deny nursing home, boarding home, and adult familyhome licenses, even if all licensing standards have beenmet. References to the Adviso ry Committee on Adult Family Homes, which was eliminated in 2010, are removed. Legislative Findings . Legislative findings are made stating Washington's long-ter m care system must be more aggressive in protecting vuln erable populations and that the cost of system oversight should be borne by thelicensed providers. Legislativ e findings related to adult family homes are amended to clarify that adult family homes have the responsibility to promote the health, welfare, and safety of their residents, while it is the state'srole to develop and enforce standards that provide suchprotection. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 July 1, 2011 (Sections 401-403)House 57 40 House 50 45 Senate 33 12HB 1290 71HB 1290 C 251 L 11 Concerning mandatory overtime for certain health care employees. By Representatives Green, Cody, Van De Wege, Sells, Kenney and Reykdal. House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Both federal and Washington state mini- mum wage laws establish requirements related to overtime work. These laws require covered employees to receiveovertime pay for hours worked over 40 hours per week.With some exceptions, these wage laws do not prohibit an employer from requiring empl oyees to work overtime. One exception, enacted in 2002, prohibits covered health care facilities from requiring overtime, except inlimited circumstances, for registered nurses and licensedpractical nurses who are involved in direct patient care andpaid an hourly wage. For this prohibition on mandatory overtime, overtime means work in excess of an agreedupon, regularly scheduled shift of not more than 12 hoursin a 24-hour period or 80 hours in a 14-day period. Ahealth care facility means a fa cility that is licensed under specified laws as a hospital, a hospice, a rural health carefacility, or a psychiatric hospital. Institutions operated bythe DOC are not licensed under the statutes specified in theovertime prohibition law. Summary: State or local correctional institutions that provide health care services to adult inmates are added to the list of health care facilitie s covered under the prohibi- tion on mandatory overtime for certain registered andlicensed practical nurses. This provision is continge nt on funding in the 2011-13 State Omnibus Operating Appropriations Act. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1294 C 20 L 11 Establishing the Puget Sound corps. By House Committee on Envi Maxwell, Kenney, Carlyle, and Billig; by request of Commissioner of Public Landsand Department of Ecology). House Committee on Environment House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Washington Conservation Corps (WCC) is a program that provides fee-for-service youth work crews for projects that address defined goals. TheWCC is implemented jointly by the Employment SecurityDepartment, the Department of Ecology (DOE), theDepartment of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), the Depart-ment of Natural Resources (DNR), and the State Parks andRecreation Commission (SPRC). Each department isresponsible for: recruiting staff and WCC members;executing agreements that allow the WCC crews to work;applying for and accepting gr ant funding; and prioritizing projects. The DOE, DNR, WDFW, and SPRC all have specified tasks that their respective WCC crews may complete. These eligible projects are rela ted to the functions of the associated agency. For instance: the WCC crews working for the DOE may work on litte r pickup or irrigation ditch maintenance; the WCC crews working for the DNR mayfocus on jobs such as wood cu tting and reforestation. The WDFW and SPRC have similar agency-specific lists. With some exception, the WCC members must be unemployed Washington residents between the ages of 18and 25 years who are United States citizens or lawfulpermanent residents of the United States. Special effortsare required for the recruitment of minority and disadvan-taged youth, and for youths residing in areas with asubstantial unemployment rate. Members of the WCC serve a six-month term which may be extended up to two years. Members may only bepaid the state minimum wage, although an increase in payof up to 5 percent is allowe d for each additional six-month term served. Summary: The administration of the WCC is centralized at the DOE. The DOE must administer the WCC programas a partnership with the DNR, the WDFW, and the SPRC.The DOE may also partner with other agencies and non-profits when appropriate to advance the WCC's programgoals. Partnering agencies may maintain a WCCcoordinator to assist with the agency partnership. The WCC remains an organization that provides pay- for-service work crews to complete projects designed toaddress identified program goals. The program goals forthe WCC are broadened and are no longer individuallyspecified for each state agency participant. The programgoals, applicable to both th e DOE and all the partner agen- cies, are related to the protection, promotion, or restorationof certain identified public assets. These assets include public lands, state natural resources, water quality, habitat,outdoor recreation and state historic sites. The DOE mayHouse 97 0Senate 47 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1295 72develop more than one career pathway within the WCC to match crew member interests with project types. In addition, the DOE is dir ected to create and admin- ister the Puget Sound Corps ( PS Corps). The PS Corps is to be a distinct program w ithin the WCC. The PS Corps work crews may be assigned to projects meeting the same goals as other WCC work crews. However, the PS Corpsare also directed to seek to deploy work crews to assistwith the restoration of the Puget Sound. The activities ofthe PS Corps must be prior itized, when practicable, to focus on projects located within the Puget Sound basinthat further the Puget Sound Partnership's Action Agenda,benefit public lands, lead to habitat restoration, or are centered on education and stewardship. The administrative respon sibilities for the WCC are removed from the DNR, the WDFW, and the SPRC.These responsibilities are given only to the DOE and in-clude: recruiting staff; serving as a central grant applica-tion recipient; establishing consistent work standards; andreviewing the success of the WCC projects. The recruit-ment of the WCC participants is a primary function of theDOE; however, the DOE should coordinate recruitmentwhen possible with the DNR, the WDFW, the SPRC, the Washington Department of Veterans Affairs, the Employ-ment Security Department, technical and community col-leges, and any interested postsecondary educationinstitution. A person must be a Washington resident and between the ages of 18 and 25 years to participate in the WCC. The upper age limit may be waived for crew leaders,specialists, military veterans, and individuals with sensoryor mental handicaps. Recruitment efforts must be targetedto fully matriculated student s, disadvantaged and minority youths, and military veterans. Recruited WCC partici-pants serve a three-month tour and are eligible for three-month extensions until two years are served. Longer termsof service are available for certain specialty crews. The Director of the DOE and the Commissioner of Public Lands are directed to jo intly host an annual meeting to serve as a forum for partne r agencies and other affected organizations and to provide guidance and feedbackconcerning the WCC. The annual meeting participants must review recently completed WCC projects andestablish a work plan for the next year. The centralization of administration is prospective only and does not affect any existing grant awards or WCCplacements. Going forward, the Salmon RecoveryFunding Board must give preference to projects proposedto be undertaken by the WCC within the list of projectsthat qualify for grant funding. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011ESHB 1295 C 331 L 11 Concerning the installation of residential fire sprinkler systems. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Van De Wege, Hurst, Tharinger, Fitzgibbon and Liias). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: A fire protection sprinkler system is a series of pipes connected to the primary water supply of aresidence that transfers wate r to extinguish, control, or contain a fire. Sprinkler sy stems provide protection from exposure to fire or ot her combusted materials. Fire protection sprinkler systems contractors must obtain and maintain a license issued by the State Director of Fire Protection. An annually renewed certificate ofcompetency is also required of individuals who installsprinkler systems. Both the contractor's license and certif-icate of competency are su bject to a required annual renewal fee, the proceeds of which are placed in the FireProtection Contractor License Fund (Fund) along withfunds generated from relate d rules and regulations. Expenditures of the Fund may be used for limited purposes, including: hospita l fire protection inspections, and assistance with activities that identify recalledsprinkler system components. Counties, cities, and towns planning under the Growth Management Act may impose im pact fees on development activity to help pay for public facilities. Persons required to pay impact fees may not also be required to pay a fee forcomparable purposes under the State EnvironmentalPolicy Act. Summary: Expenditures from the Fund may be used to develop and publish educa tional materials related to residential fire sprinkler effectiveness. Individuals install- ing a residential fire sprinkler system in a single-familyhome are exempted from paying the fire operationsportion of the impact fee but remain responsible for theproportionate share of the impact fee related to thedelivery of emergency medical services. Public water systems are not liable for damages result- ing from shutting off water to a residential home with an installed fire sprinkler system if the shut off is due to: routine maintenance or construction; customer nonpayment for service; or a water system emergency. Any governmental or municipal corporation, includ- ing but not limited to special districts, is deemed to be exercising a governmental function when it acts or under-takes to supply water, with in or without its corporate limits, to a residential home with an installed fire sprinkler system.House 67 30Senate 38 9HB 1298 July 22, 2011 HB 1298 C 21 L 11 Concerning child support order summary report forms. By Representative Kelley.House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Parties establishing or modifying a child support order must complete a child support ordersummary report form. The par ties must attach the form to the child support worksheets filed with the court. The clerk sends the forms to the Division of Child Support(DCS) at the Department of Social and Health Services,and the DCS prepares a report using the data from theseforms. The DCS report is to be used for reviewing the state's child support laws. Federal law requires states toreview their child support laws every four years. In 2007 legislation was en acted directing the DCS to convene a work group every fo ur years to conduct these reviews. The 2007 legislation required the Joint Legisla-tive Audit Review Committee (JLARC) to analyze thedata from the summ ary report forms. The JLARC found that the information re ceived from these forms is incomplete, may not be accurate, and is unusable for purposes of the review required by federallaw. In its final report, th e JLARC recommends that the Legislature eliminate the summary report forms andinstead have the DCS use data from the actual childsupport orders to compile its report. Summary: References to the child support summary order report forms are remo ved from the statutes. To prepare its report, the DCS must use data compiled from child support orders, and the work groups conducting thequadrennial reviews must review the DCS report.

By Representatives Jinkins, Kelley, Van De Wege, Liias and Reykdal; by request of Insurance Commissioner. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) has the authority to regulate health insurance companies in Washington. In 2008 the OIC was grantedthe authority to review insu rance rates in the individual market. Individual market in surers are required to file their rates with the OIC. The OIC may disapprove therates if they are unreasonable in relation to the benefits inthe agreement. The OIC also reviews individual market insurers for compliance with statutory requirements such as adjusted community rating and medical loss ratios (for purposes of determining re mittances to the Washington State Health Insurance Pool). The OIC's authority to review individual market rates expires on January 1, 2012. Summary: The expiration date on the OIC's authority to review individual market rates is repealed. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1304 C 70 L 11 Concerning the administration of drugs by health care assistants. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Jinkins, Harris, Green,Cody, Van De Wege, Kelley, Schmick, Bailey, Clibborn,Moeller, Hinkle and Reykdal). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: A certified health care assistant is autho- rized to provide assistance to certain licensed health care practitioners, such as physicians, nurses, and naturopaths. A licensed health practitioner may delegate certain func-tions to the health care assistant such as administering skintests and injections and performing blood withdrawals. Each health care assistant is certified by the facility in which he or she is employed, or by the practitioner who delegates functions to the health care assistant, pursuant tostandards adopted by the Department of Health (DOH) inHouse 95 2Senate 43 4 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred) House 98 0 Senate 48 0House 93 1Senate 37 974rule. The facility or practitioner must submit a roster of certified health care assistants to the DOH. Health care assistants are divided into seven different categories based on differing educational, training, andexperiential requirements. The different tasks each category of health care assistant may perform are as fol-lows (all health care assistan ts may administer vaccines): Category A: venous procedures for blood withdrawal; Category arterial invasive procedures for blood withdrawal; Category C: intraderma l, subcutaneous, and intra- muscular injections for diagnostic agents and the administration of skin tests; Category D: intravenous injections for diagnostic agents; Category E: intradermal, subcutaneous, and intra- muscular injections and the administration of skin tests; Category F: intravenous injections for therapeutic agents; and Category G: hemodialysis. In 2009 legislation was en acted authorizing health care assistants to administer certain over-the-counter drugs (e.g., Benadryl, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin,Neosporin) cream, raglan, compazine). The administrationof these drugs is limited to oral, topical, rectal, otic,ophthalmic, or inhaled routes and must be pursuant to awritten order of a supervising health care practitioner.Only category C or E health care assistants may administeroral drugs. The provisions allowing health care assistants to administer drugs expire on July 1, 2013. Summary: Only category C or E health care assistants may administer over-the-count er drugs and legend drugs (as opposed to oral over-the-counter and legend drugs). The DOH must adopt any rules necessary to implementthis limitation.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011HB 1306 C 153 L 11 Removing the expiration date for exempting applicants who operate commercial moto r vehicles for agribusiness purposes from certain commercial driver's license requirements. By Representatives Lytton, Bailey, Frockt, Fitzgibbon and Smith. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The operation of commercial motor vehicles is regulated under both state and federal law. In order to operate a commercial motor vehicle inWashington, a person genera lly must hold a commercial driver's license with the app licable endorsements for the vehicle he or she is driving. However, this requirement does not apply to the following persons: a firefighter or law enforcement officer operating emergency equipment who has completed an approved driver training course; the operator of a recreational vehicle used for noncommercial purposes; the operator of a commercial motor vehicle for military purposes; or the operator of a farm vehicle controlled and operated by a farmer. The vehicle itself must also be used totransport agricultural products, farm machinery, orfarm supplies to or from a farm. Finally, the vehicle may not be used in the operations of a common orcontract motor carrier, and it must be used within 150miles of the person's farm. To receive a commercial driver's license from Washington, an applicant must be a resident of the state, pass knowledge and skills test s that comply with mini- mum federal standards, and successfully complete acourse of instruction in the operation of a commercialmotor vehicle that has been approved by the Director of the Department of Licensing (DOL) or be certified by anemployer as having the skills and training necessary to safely operate a commercial mo tor vehicle. The DOL may waive the requirement for instru ction in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle for an applicant who has beenissued a valid commercial driv er's license in another state and is transferring to Washington. Applicants for a commerci al driver's license who operate a commercial motor vehicle for agribusinesspurposes are exempt from the requirement of eithersuccessfully completing a cour se of instruction in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle that has beenapproved by the Director of the DOL or being certified byan employer as having the skills and training necessary tosafely operate a commercial motor vehicle. The exemption expires July 1, 2011. House 93 1Senate 47 0ESHB 1309 75Agribusiness is defined for purposes of this exemption as a private carrier who in the normal course of business primarily transports: farm machinery, farm equipment, and other materials used in farming; agricultural inputs such as seeds, feed, fertilizers, and crop protection products; or unprocessed agricultura l commodities, which are defined as plants or parts of plants, animals, or animal products that are produced by farmers, ranchers,vineyardists, or orchardists. A private carrier is defined by statute as a person who transports by his or her own motor vehicle, with or without compensation, property that is owned or is being bought orsold by the person, or property where the person is theseller, purchaser, lessee, or bailee and the transportation isincidental to and in furtherance of some other primarybusiness conducted by the person in good faith. Summary: The July 1, 2011, expiration date is removed from a section that exempts applicants for a commercialdriver's license who operate a commercial motor vehiclefor agribusiness purposes from the requirement of either successfully completing a cour se of instruction in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle or being certifiedby an employer as having the skills and training necessaryto safely operate a commercial motor vehicle. In addition, the DOL is required to notify the transpor- tation committees of the Legisl ature if the federal govern- ment takes action affecting the agribusin ess exemption. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 ESHB 1309 C 189 L 11 Concerning reserve accounts and studies for condo- minium and homeowners' associations. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Roberts, Appleton, Rodne, Springer, Hasegawa, Ryu, Eddy, Green, Kagi and Kelley). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: In 2008 the Condominium Act and the Horizontal Property Regimes Act were amended torequire condominium associations to conduct an initial reserve study by a reserve study professional, updatedannually with a visual site inspection every three years,unless doing so would impose an unreasonable hardship.Homeowners' associations (HOAs)are not required toconduct reserve studies. Condominium Associations and Reserve Studies . A \"reserve study\" identifies the major maintenance, repair,and replacement expenses that a condominium association will incur over time that are not practical to include in anannual budget. The purpose of a reserve study is toevaluate the expected cost of future repair and maintenance of common elements. A reserve study mustinclude a variety of information such as a reservecomponent list and the balance of the association's reserveaccount. A condominium asso ciation is not required to conduct a reserve study if the cost of a study exceeds 10percent of the annual budget. Condominium associations are authorized and encouraged to establish \"re serve accounts\" independent of the annual operating budget, administered by the board of directors, to fund the mainte nance, repair, and replacement of common elements. A reserv e account consists of funds contributed by condominium owners, supplemental to theassociation's annual operating budget, to fund major main- tenance, repair, and replacement of common elements thatwill be required within 30 years. Examples of common elements include a condomin ium's lobby, roof, parking lot, recreational areas, roads, and sidewalks. The purposeof the reserve account is to offset the financial burden ofnecessary future renovations that, in the absence of areserve account, would require the condominium association to impose a special assessmen t upon the owners. Homeowners' Associations . A HOA is a legal entity with membership comprised of the owners of residential real property located within a development or otherspecified area. A HOA typically arises from restrictivecovenants recorded by a deve loper against property in a subdivision. The purpose of a HOA is to manage andmaintain a subdivision's comm on areas and structures, to review design, and to maintain architectural control. Under the Homeowners' Association Act, the HOA may exercise powers necessar y and proper for the gover- nance and operating of the asso ciation. It must prepare annual financial statements and provide homeowners withnotice of and a ratification process for the annual budget.It is not required to conduct reserve studies or to maintainreserve accounts. Summary: The requirements of condominium associa- tions concerning reserve components and summaries ofannual budgets are amended. Reserve study and reserveaccount requirements are adopted with respect to HOAs. Condominium Associations . A condominium associ- ation is required to comply with the reserve study require- ment if the association has significant assets. For thepurposes of condominium associations, \"significantassets\" means that the current total cost of major mainte- nance, repair, and replacement of the reserve componentsHouse 93 1Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1311 76is 50 percent or more of the gross budget of the association, excluding reserve account funds. A reserve study's reserve component list must include roofing, painting, paving, decks, siding, plumbing,windows, and any other building component that wouldcost more than 1 percent of the annual budget for majormaintenance, repair, or replacement. If one of the compo-nents is not included, the stud y must explain the basis for the exclusion. The board of directors must disclose information to owners regarding reserve stud ies with the summary of the annual budget. The list of re quired information includes: the current amount of regular assessment budgeted for contribution from the reserve account; any regular or special assessments and the date of such assessments; the sufficiency of reserve funds for the next 30 years and, if the funds are insufficient, notice of a possible assessment; and the projected balances of the reserve account at the end of the next five budget cycles. Homeowners' Associations . Homeowners' associa- tions with significant assets are required to prepare an initial reserve study based upon a visual site inspectionconducted by a reserve study professional. The study must be updated annually and must include a visual site inspec- tion every three years by a reserve study professional. When more than three years have passed since the date of the most recent reserve study prepared by aprofessional, the owners to which at least 35 percent of thevotes in the association are al located may demand that a reserve study be conducted in the next budget year. Theboard of directors must provide the owners with reason-able assurance that a study will be conducted if the next budget is not rejected by a majority of the owners in theassociation. A HOA is not required to comply with the reserve study requirements if: there are 10 or fewer homes in theHOA; the cost of the reserve study exceeds 5 percent ofthe HOA's annual budget; or the HOA does not possesssignificant assets. For the purposes of HOAs, \"significant assets\" means that the current replacement value of themajor reserve components is 75 percent or more of the HOA's gross budget, excluding reserve account funds. Homeowners' associations are encouraged to establish reserve accounts, supplemental to the annual operatingbudget, to fund major maintenance, repair, and replace-ment of common elements. Similar to the new require-ment for condominium associ ations, HOAs must disclose information to owners rega rding reserve accounts and reserve studies with the summary of the annual budget. Monetary damages or any other liability may not be awarded against the association, the officers, or board ofdirectors, or those who may have provided assistance to the association for failure to: (1) establish a reserveaccount; (2) have a reserve study prepared or updated; or(3) make reserve disclosures. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012 ESHB 1311 C 313 L 11 Creating a collaborative to improve health care quality, cost-effectiveness, and outcomes. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Health Care Authority (Authority) administers state employee health benefit programs through the Public Employees Benefits Board, as well as health care programs targeted at low-income individuals,such as the Basic Health Pl an and the Community Health Services Grants. In addition, the Authority coordinates initiatives related to state-purchased health care, such asthe Prescription Drug Progra m and the Health Technology Assessment Program. Through the Prescription DrugProgram, the state contract s for independent reviews of prescription drugs to compare the safety, efficacy, andeffectiveness of drug classes from which recommenda-tions are made by a clinical committee for the develop-ment of a preferred drug list. The Health TechnologyAssessment program reviews scientific, evidence-basedreports about the safety and effectiveness of medicaldevices, procedures , and tests, and a clinical committee determines whether or not the state should pay for them. Chapter 258, Laws of 2009 (Engrossed Substitute House Bill 2105) established a wo rk group to be appointed by the Authority. The work group included physicians andprivate and public health care purchasers. The work groupwas responsible for identif ying evidence-based best practice guidelines and decision support tools related toadvanced diagnostic imaging services. All state-purchased health care programs that purchase servicesdirectly were required to implement the guidelines by September 1, 2009. The work group expired on July 1,2010. Summary: Legislative findings are established related to the need for public and privat e health care purchasers to work together to improve th e quality and cost-effective- ness of health care services and the existence of substantialHouse 93 5 Senate 48 1 (Senate amended)House 95 1 (House concurred)ESHB 1311 77variations in practice patterns or high utilization trends as indicators of poor quality and potential waste. Legislative declarations are made regarding the need for state and private health care purchasers to collaborate to identify strategies to increase the effectiveness of health care andto provide immunity from stat e and federal antitrust laws. It is stated that it is not the Legislature's intent to mandatepayment or coverage decision s by private health carriers or purchasers. The Robert Bree Collaborative (Collaborative) is established. The Co llaborative consists of 20 members appointed by the Governor . The members include: two representatives of health carriers or third party administrators; one representative of a health maintenance organiza- tion; one representative of a national health carrier; two physicians, one of whom is a primary care provider, representing large multispecialty clinicswith 50 or more physicians; two physicians, one of whom is a primary care provider, representing clinics with fewer than 50 physicians; one osteopathic physician; two physicians repre senting the largest hospital- physician groups in the state; three representatives of hospital systems, at least one of whom is responsible for quality; three representatives of self-funded purchasers; two representatives of state-purchased health care programs; and one representative of th e Puget Sound Health Alli- ance. The Collaborative is required to add members or establish clinical committees to acquire clinical expertise in particular health care service areas under review. Clinical committees must include at least two memberswho are associated with the most experienced specialty orsubspecialty society for the health services under consid- eration. No member may be compensated for his or herservice. Members of the Collaborative and clinicalcommittees are immune from civil liability for anydecisions made in good faith while conducting work related to the Collaborative or its clinical committees. TheCollaborative's proceedings mu st be open to the public and notice of meetings must be provided at least 20 daysin advance. The Collabora tive may not begin its work unless there are sufficient federal funds, private funds, orstate funds available through other ongoing health careservice review efforts. Private funds may not be acceptedif their receipt could present a potential conflict of interestin the Collaborativ e's deliberations. The Collaborative must annua lly identify up to three health care services for which there are substantialvariations in practice patterns or high utilization trends inWashington. In addition, the services must not produce better care outcomes and be indicators of poor quality andpotential waste in the health care system. Upon the identification of such health care services, the Collaborative is required to iden tify evidence-based best practices to improve qu ality and reduce variation in the use of the service. The Collaborative must also identify data collec tion and reporting for the development of baseline utilization rates and ways to measure theimpact of strategies to promote the use of the bestpractices. To the extent possible, the reporting mustminimize cost and administrative effort and use existingdata resources. Lastly, the Collaborative mu st identify strategies to increase the use of the evid ence-based practices. The strategies may include: go als for appropriate utilization rates; peer-to-peer consultation; provider feedbackreports; use of patient deci sion aids; incentives for the appropriate use of health services; centers of excellence orother provider qualification standards; quality improve- ment systems; and service utilization and outcome report- ing. In the event that th e Collaborative selects a health care service that lacks eviden ce-based best practices, the Collaborative must consider strategies that promoteimproved care outcomes, including patient decision aidsand provider feedback reports. The Collaborative muststrongly consider the effort s of other organizations when developing strategies. The Collaborative is required to report to the Admin- istrator of the Health Care Authority (Administrator) on the selected health services and the proposed strategies.The Administrator must revi ew the recommended strate- gies and inform the Collab orative of any decis ions to adopt the strategies. Follo wing the Administrator's review, the Collaborative must report to Governor andLegislature. The reports mu st be submitted annually and describe the selected services, proposed strategies, and results of the Administrator's review. Upon receiving the endorsement of the Administrator, all state-purchased health care programs, including healthcarriers and third party administrators that contract withstate programs, must impl ement the evidence-based practice guidelines and strategies by January 1, 2012, andevery subsequent year. If the Collaborative does not reach consensus, state purchased health care programs mayimplement evidence-based strategies on their owninitiative. The Health Care Authority work group, established to identify evidence-based prac tices related to advanced diagnostic imaging services that would apply to all state-purchased health care programs, and its duties arerepealed. SHB 1312 on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1312 C 284 L 11 Regarding statutory changes needed to implement a waiver to receive federal assistance for certain statepurchased public health care programs. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Cody, Jinkins, Greenand Kenney). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: State Health Care Programs for Low- Income Individuals . The Basic Health Plan (BHP), Disability Lifeline (DL), and the Alcohol and Drug Addic- tion Treatment and Support Act program (ADATSA) arethree of the largest programs in Washington that providehealth care coverage to low- income individuals with state- only funds. The Health Care Authority (Authority) administers the BHP, which is a health care insurance program thatassists enrollees by providing a state subsidy to offset thecosts of premiums. Residents of Washington with anincome of less than 200 percent of the federal povertylevel are eligible for enrollmen t in the BHP. In addition, the enrollee must not be: (1) eligible for Medicare; (2) in- stitutionalized; or (3) in scho ol on a temporary work visa. In addition to administering the Medicaid program, the Department of Social and Health Services (Depart-ment) administers the medical care services program withstate-only funds. Medical care services programs providemedical benefits to individuals enrolled in the DL andADATSA programs. To be el igible for the DL program, an applicant must meet th e same financial criteria that exists for the Temporary As sistance for Needy Families program and be incapacitated from gainful employmentbecause of a physical or mental condition that is expectedto last more than 90 days. Enrollees in the DL program may not receive benefits for more than 24 months in afive-year period. To be eligible for the ADAT SA program, an individual must meet financial and incapac ity eligibility criteria. The financial eligibility criteria are equivalent to those of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. Theincapacity eligibility criteria are met if the applicant: (1)has a diagnosed chemical de pendency on a psychoactive substance class; (2) has not abstained from alcohol anddrug use during the prior 90 days; (3) has not beengain-fully employed during the prior 30 days; and (4) isunable to work. Federal Waiver . Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health care services to specified categories oflow-income individuals purs uant to federal standards. States may request a waiver from federal requirements forexperimental, pilot, or demonstration projects. The 2010supplemental budget directed the Authority and theDepartment to seek a waiver from the federal government to support some of the enrollees on the BHP and DL programs. The federal government approved this waiverin January 2011. Under the terms of the waiver, the federalgovernment will provide ma tching funds to Washington for those enrollees in the BHP, DL, and ADATSAprograms whose income is at or below 133 percent of thefederal poverty level and who are United States citizens oreligible qualified aliens. Summary: Individuals who are e ligible for federally financed categorically needy or medically needy medical assistance programs may not enroll in the Basic Health Plan (BHP). The Administ rator of the Health Care Authority must identify BHP enrollees who are currently eligible for other coverage an d transition them to federally financed medical assistance programs. Applications for enrollment in the BHP must include a Social Security number, if available, for ea ch family member requesting coverage. Applications for the BHP shall also beconsidered an application for medical assistance. The Department of Social and Health Services is authorized to suspend new enrollment in medical care services for Disability Lifeline (DL) applicants andestablish a waiting list of those who are eligible once thereare sufficient funds. People subject to termina tion from DL benefits due to time limits remain enrolled in medical care services.People subject to denial of DL benefits due to time limits remain eligible for medical care services. Technical corrections are made to fix erroneous references.

House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Medical Services in Nursing Homes . Nursing homes are licensed fa cilities that provide conva- lescent care and/or chronic ca re for more than 24 consec- utive hours for three or more unrelated patients who areunable to care for themselves. Each resident of a nursing home must have a compre- hensive plan of care prepared by an interdisciplinary team that includes the attending ph ysician. The nursing home must inform a resident of th e name and specialty of the physician responsible for the resident's care and provide away for the resident to contact his or her physician.According to federal interpre tive guidelines for the Medi- care and Medicaid programs, residents should be allowedto designate a personal physic ian, and the nursing home is responsible for assisting the resident to obtain theseservices. A nursing home that has contracted to provide care under the Medicare or Medicaid program must ensure thata resident is seen by a physician whenever necessary andthat the medical care provid ed by the nursing home is supervised by a physician. This includes supervising themedical care when the attendi ng physician is not available and providing physician services 24 hours a day in case ofemergency. Under some circumstances, physician tasksmay be delegated to a phys ician assistant or advanced registered nurse practitioner wh o is not an employee of the nursing home. A nursing home must designate a medical director who is responsible for implementing resident care policiesand coordinating medical care in the facility. A nursing home may maintain a quality assurance committee that includes a ph ysician designated by the nursing home, along with the director of nursing servicesand three other staff members. The Corporate Practice of Medicine . Generally, under the common law in Washington, a business entity isprohibited from employing a medical professional topractice his or her licensed profession unless legislativelyauthorized. Courts conclude that this prohibition exists to protect the relationship between the professional and thepatient. There are statutes that addr ess the corporate practice of medicine. For example, a statute authorizes persons licensed or authorized to re nder the same professional services to form a professional corporation (including alimited liability company). The Washington SupremeCourt (Court) interpreted this statute in 1988, holding thatit did not authorize a business partnership between a nurseand a physician. In a 2010 case, the Court consideredwhether this statute or the corporate practice of medicinedoctrine was violated by a limited liability companyowned by physicians that em ployed physical therapists. The Court found no violation of either, reasoning that bothphysicians and physical therap ists were providing aspects of the \"practice of medicine.\" Summary: A nursing home may employ physicians to provide professional services to residents of the nursing home or a related living f acility (such as a boarding home on the same campus). The authority applies both to theentity licensed to operate a nu rsing home and a subsidiary of the licensee, as long as the licensee adheres to itsresponsibility for the daily oper ations of the nursing home. The nursing home may not supplant, diminish, or regulate any employed physician's judgment directly orindirectly, concerning the practice of medicine ordiagnosis and treatment of any patient. The authority fora nursing home to employ a physician may not interferewith federal rules, state statutes, or Department of Socialand Health Services (DSHS) rules addressing a resident'srights. The DSHS must monitor nursing homes who employ physicians and report its findings to the Legislature byJanuary 1, 2013, including information on consumersatisfaction and cost implications.

Motorcycle riders must meet certain requirements in terms of riding position in relation to permanent seats and foot pegs, and operators are prohibited from carrying passengers unless there is proper seating forthe passenger. Motorcycles must meet requirements for handlebar height. With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for a person to operate a motorcycle, moped, or motor-driven cycleunless he or she is wearing a helmet. It is unlawful to transport a child under the age of 5 on a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle.The Department of Licensing (DOL) issues special vehicle license plates that may be used in lieu of standard plates. A governmental or nonprofit organization seekingto sponsor a special plate eith er makes an application with the Special License Plate Review Board or requests legis-lation to create the special plate. Generally, the organiza-tion seeking to sponsor the special plate is required toreimburse the DOL for the costs of establishing the newspecial plate. After the DOL is reimbursed for the costs,the revenue generated from the plate goes into an accountfor the benefit of an organization that supports a particularcause or institution. The DOL may issue some types of special license plates to passenger vehicles, motorcycles, and trailerswhile other special plate types are restricted to certainvehicle types. Certain specia l license plate types may not be issued to motorcycles or trailers. Summary: Certain provisions related to motorcycle equipment standards and helmet use are temporarily suspended with respect to th e operation of motorcycles on closed roads during a parade or public demonstration that has been permitted by a local jurisdiction. The types of special license plates that the DOL may issue to motorcycles is expanded.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Maxwell, Liias, Haigh,Dammeier, Armstrong, McCoy, Probst,Lytton, Jacks, Orwall, Van DeWege, Roberts, Tharinger and Miloscia). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Department of Licensing (DOL) issues special vehicle license plates that may be used in lieu of standard plates. A governmental or nonprofit sponsoringorganization seeking to sponsor a special plate either sub-mits an application to the DOL or requests legislation tocreate the special plate. For special license plates that are enacted by statute, a sponsoring organization must, within 30 days of enact-ment, submit prepayment of a ll start-up costs to the DOL. If the sponsoring organization is not able to meet the pre-payment requirement, revenues generated from the sale ofthe special license plate are firs t used to pay off any costs associated with establishing the new plate. The sponsor-ing organization must also provide a proposed licenseplate design to the DOL. Additionally, the sponsoring organization must submit an annual financial report to theDOL detailing actual revenues generated from the sale of the special license plate. There is a moratorium on the issuance of new special license plates until June 30, 2011. Summary: The \"Music Matters\" spec ial license plate is created, which would displa y the \"Music Matters\" logo. In addition to all fees and taxes required to be paid upon application for a vehicle registration, a fee of $40 would becharged for a \"Music Matters\" special license plate and a$30 fee is charged for renewal of a special license plate. The DOL is required to annually report the status of the \"Music Matters\" special license plate to the Joint Transportation Committee. Th e \"Music Matters\" special license plate is exempt from the temporary moratorium on special license plates.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012House 95 2 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred)House 89 5Senate 47 2 (Senate amended)House 94 2 (House concurred)ESHB 1332 81ESHB 1332 C 258 L 11 Providing for the joint provision and management of municipal water, wastewater, storm and flood water, andrelated utility services. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy, Anderson, Goodman, Takko, Liias, Springer, Rodne, Hurst and Tharinger). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Provision of Water-Related Utility Servic- es by Local Governments . General purpose and selected special purpose local governments are authorized toprovide water-related utility services. Cities and towns, for example, may provide for the sewerage, drainage, andwater supply of the city or town, and may establish, construct, and maintain wate r supply systems and systems of sewers and drains within or outside their corporatelimits. In addition to broad pr ovision, control and regula- tion powers, cities and town s may participate in and expend revenue on cooperative watershed managementactions related to water suppl y, water quality, and water resource protection and management. Interlocal Cooperation Act/Watershed Management Partnerships . Under the Interlocal Cooperation Act (ICA), public agencies are authoriz ed to contract with one another to provide services either through cooperative action or when one or more agencies pay another for aservice. A \"public agency,\" for purposes of interlocalagreements, includes any agency, political subdivision, orunit of local government. Th e term specifically includes municipal corporations, special purpose districts, localservice districts, state agencies, federal agencies, recog-nized Indian tribes, and politic al subdivisions of other states. In addition to provisions governing gene ral coopera- tive actions between public agencies, the ICA authorizes counties, cities, and selected special purpose districts toenter into agreements to form watershed management partnerships. The particip ating entities may expend 10 percent of their water-rela ted revenues for watershed management plan projects or activities that are in addition to the existing water-related services or activities of thecounty, city, or district. Actions Against Political Subdivisions, Municipal, and Quasi-Municipal Corporations . All local govern- mental entities, whether acting in a governmental orproprietary capacity, are liable for damages arising out oftortious (wrongful) conduct by their officers, employees, or volunteers while performing, or in good faith purport-ing to perform, official duties. The term \"local govern-mental entities,\" for purpos es of tortious conduct provisions, includes counties , cities, towns, municipalcorporations, quasi-municipal corporations, and public hospitals. Summary: Joint Municipal Utility Services Authority: Formation, Membership, and Services . A Joint Municipal Utility Services Authority (Authority) may be formed by two or more members to perform or provide any or all ofthe utility service or services that all of its members, otherthan tribal government members, perform or provide. A\"member\" for purposes of Authority provisions, may be acounty, city, town, special purpose district, or other unit oflocal government in Washington or another state thatprovides utility services and is party to an agreement form- ing an Authority. The term \"member\" also includesfederally recognized Indian tribes. \"Utility services\" is defined to mean any or all of specified functions, including: the provision of retail or wholesale water supply and conservation services; the provision of wastewater, sewage, or septage collection, handling, treatment, transmission, or disposal services; and the management and handling of storm water, surface water, drainage, and flood waters. With limited exceptions, at the time an agreement to form an Authority is exec uted, each member must be providing the type of utility se rvice or services that will be provided by the Authority. The agreement, which must be filed with the Secretary of State, must be approved by the legislative authority of each member organization. Thedate of filing is the date of formation, and the formation and activities of an Authority, including the admission orwithdrawal of members, are not subject to review by a boundary review board. Formed Authorities are mu nicipal corporations and are authorized to perform or provide any or all of theutility services that all of its members, excepting tribalgovernment members, perform or provide. Authorities areentitled to all immunities and exemptions that apply tolocal governmental entities un der tortious conduct provi- sions specified in statute. Authorities are subject to Wash-ington's public records and op en public meetings acts, and the code of ethics for municipal officers. Authoritiesmay be audited by the State Auditor. The formation and operation of an Authority does not diminish a member's powers in connection with its provi-sion or management of utility services or its taxing powerwith respect to its services. The formation and operation of an authority also does not diminish the authority of local governments to enter into agreements under the ICA oragreements formed under th e ICA. Additionally, the formation and operation of an Authority does not impair ordiminish valid water rights. Corporate Powers . For the purpose of providing utility services, Authorities are entitled to exercisenumerous powers, including the power to:HB 1334 82 acquire and fully control property and property rights, including water rights and other assets; incur liabilities, including issuing bonds; employ persons and fix salaries; determine fees, rates, and charges for services; and exercise eminent domain. Authorities do not have the power to levy taxes. Asset Transfer and Availability: Member Authoriza- tions . Members of an Authority are authorized to transfer or otherwise make available assets of member organiza- tions, including money, real property, and water rights, toan Authority with or without payment or other consider-ation. The transfer and asset availability provisions are not required to be submitted and approved by the electors ofthe members. Formation and Governance Agreements . A joint municipal utility services agreement that forms and governs an Authority must include numerous provisions,including provisions that: identify members and specify terms or conditions for joining or withdrawing from the Authority; specify how the number of directors of the Authority's board will be determined and how those directors will be ap pointed (each dire ctor must be an elected official); describe how the agreement may be amended; and describe how rates and charges imposed by the Authority, if any, will be determined. Conversion of Existing Entities into Authorities . Any intergovernmental entity formed under the ICA or other applicable law may be conver ted into an Authority and is entitled to all powers and privileges available toAuthorities if delineated eligibility and proceduralrequirements are met. n, and Miscellaneous Provi- sions . Tortious conduct provisions are amended to specify that Authorities and entities cr eated by public agencies under the ICA are consider ed \"local governmental entities\" and are subject to statutes governing tortiousconduct claims involving these entities. Payments between or any transfers of assets to or from an Authority and its member s are exempted from business and occupation taxes and pub lic utility taxes. Addition- ally, Authority property is ex empt from taxation, and retail sales and use tax provisions do not apply to any sales ortransfers made to or from an Authority and its members. Flood control districts and flood control zone districts are expressly authorized to participate in watershed management arrangements and actions, rather than water-shed management partnerships, including thoseauthorized under the ICA and provisions governingAuthorities.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1334 C 282 L 11 Authorizing civil judgments for assault. By Representatives Nealey, Hurst, Walsh, Johnson, Klippert, Haler, Rodne, Pearson, McCune, Warnick, Hinkle, Kelley, Orcutt, Chandler, Rivers, Ross, Schmick and Smith. House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections Background: The Department of Corrections (DOC) provides inmate work programs through the Correctional Industries Board (Board). The Board develops and imple-ments programs that offer inmates employment, workexperience, and training, and that reduce the cost ofhousing inmates. To achieve these goals, the Boardoperates five classes of correctional industry workprograms. All inmates workin g in class I - IV employment receive financial compensatio n for their work. Class V jobs are court ordered community work that is preformedfor the benefit of the co mmunity without financial compensation. Class I Industries . As of 2011, there are no class I Correctional Industry programs operating in the state.However, the statute requires that inmates working in classI (\"free venture\") industries be paid according to theprevailing wage for comparable work in that locality.There are two models for class I industries authorizedunder state law\u2014an employer model and a customermodel. Employer model industries are operated and managed by for-profit or nonprofit organizations under contractwith the DOC. They produce goods and services for saleto both the public and priv ate sector. Customer model class I industries are operated and managed by the DOC to produce and provide Washington businesses with productsor services produced only by out-of-state or foreignsuppliers. Inmates working in free venture industries do so by their own choice and are paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a sim ilar nature in the locality in which the industry is located (ranging from today's mini- mum wage of $8.67 to $14.76 per hour). The productionof window blinds, metal fabrication, upholstery, concretework, water-jet cutting, sewing, carabiners, and multi-packaging services are examples of jobs found in the classHouse 92 2 Senate 40 8 (Senate amended)House 95 1 (House concurred)HB 1334 83I industries work program. Security and custody services are supplied to the participating firm without charge. Class II Industries . Class II (\"tax reduction\") indus- tries are state-owned and oper ated industries designed to reduce the costs for goods and services for public agenciesand nonprofit organizations. Industries in this class mustbe closely patterned after private sector industries but withthe objective of reducing pub lic support costs rather than making a profit. The products and services of thisindustry, including purchased products and services neces- sary for a complete product line, may only be sold to pub- lic agencies, nonprofit organizations, and to privatecontractors when the goods purchased will ultimately beused by a public agency or a nonprofit organization. How-ever, to avoid waste or spoila ge, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold at private sale or donated to non-profitorganizations when there is no public sector market forsuch goods. Inmates working in tax reduction industries do so by their own choice and are paid a gratuity which may notexceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in thelocality in which the industry is located. Class II gratuities range from 55 cents to $1.55 per hour and includes suchjobs as: producing aluminum signs, license plates andtabs, mattresses, asbestos abatement, meat processing,optical lab, engraving, furn iture manufacturing, screen printing and embroidery, industrial sewing, and laundry.Security and custody services are provided without chargeby the DOC. Class III Industries . Class III (\"Institutional Support\") industries are solely operated by the DOC with the objec- tive being to offset tax and other public support costs. Except for inmates who work in training programs, inmates in this class are paid a gratuity ranging between$30 to $55 per month. All supervision, management, andcustody services are solely provided by the DOC. Inmates working in class III industries provide main- tenance and operation of th e DOC's institutions. Ground keepers, barbers, dental assistants, truck drivers, fork-liftoperators, mechanics, libra ry aides, typists, and interpreters are examples of jobs found in the class III industries work program. Class IV Industries . Class IV (\"Community Work\") industries are operated by the DOC and are designed toprovide services in the inma te's resident community. Inmates working in class IV industries provide services at a reduced cost to other state agencies, to county and localgovernment, to persons who are poor or infirm, and tononprofit organizations. Local governments that hireinmates must provide supervision service without chargeto the state and must pay the inmate a gratuity. Janitorial services, grounds keeping, litter control, institutional kitchen support, special event seating set-up, wheelchair cleaning, tree planting, forest maintenance,and fire suppression are exam ples of jobs found in the class IV industries work program.Inmate Wage Deductions . The DOC is required by statute to take certain mandatory deductions from thegross wages and gratuities of e ach inmate working in class I through class IV Correc tional Industry programs. For inmates working in class I industries (and others earning at least minimum wage), excluding child supportpayments, the DOC takes a minimum of 55 percent of theinmates' income. The 55 percent is divided into: 5 percent for crime victims' compensation; 10 percent for the inmate's savings account; 20 percent to the DOC for costs of incarceration; and 20 percent for any owed legal financial obligations (LFOs) which can also in clude restitution for the victim.For inmates working in class II industries, the DOC takes 65 percent of the inmate 's income. The 65 percent is divided as follows: 5 percent for crime victims' compensation; 10 percent for the inmate's savings account; 15 percent to the DOC for costs of incarceration; 15 percent for any child support owed; and 20 percent for any owed LFOs. For inmates working in class III industries, the DOC takes 5 percent of the inmate 's income for the purpose of crime victim's compensation and 15 percent for any child support owed under a support order. For inmates working in class IV industries, the DOC takes 5 percent of the inmate's income to contribute to the cost of incarceration and 15 percent for any child supportowed under a support order. Summary: The DOC must take an additional deduction from the wages and gratuities of an inmate for payment of a civil judgment for assault. A total of 20 percent must be deducted from the wages of an inmate employed in a class I Correctional Industry prog ram and 15 percent from the gratuities of an inmate em ployed in a class II - IV Correctional Industries program. \"Civil judgment for assault\" means a civil judgment for monetary damages awarded to a correctional officer ora DOC employee entered by a court of competent jurisdic-tion against an inmate that is based on, or arises from,injury to the correctional officer or the DOC employee caused by the inmate while the correctional officer or employee was acting in the course and scope of his or heremployment.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 93 1 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred)HB 1340 84HB 1340 C 133 L 11 Regarding the unlawful hunting of big game. By Representatives Kretz, McCune, Johnson and Warnick. House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The crime of unlawful hunting of big game in the second degree is committed when a person does oneof three things: hunts for, takes, or possesses big game without the required licenses and tags; violates any rules regard ing requirements for hunting big game; or possesses a big game animal taken during a closed season. The crime of unlawful hunting of big game in the first degree is committed when a person who has previously committed a wildlife-related cr ime, within five years of that conviction, commits one of the acts that qualifies as unlawful hunting in the second degree. The term \"big game\" is defined to include the follow- ing animals: deer, elk, moo se, mountain goats, caribou, mountain sheep, pronghorn antelopes, cougars, black bears, and grizzly bears. Summary: The elements of the crime of unlawful hunt- ing of big game in the first degree are changed. A person may be convicted of this crime without first beingconvicted of a different wildlif e-related crime if the person kills, or attempts to kill, th ree or more big game animals within the same course of events. The same course of events is defined to mean within a 24-hour period or aspart of a series of acts evidenci ng a continuity of purpose. The authority to prosecute th e first degree of unlawful hunting of big game against a person with an earlierconviction is maintained.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1345 C 22 L 11 Regarding the uniform unswor n foreign declarations act. By Representatives Rivers, Pedersen and Rodne; by request of Uniform Laws Commission. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Participants in legal proceedings before Washington courts and agencies generally may attest that certain statements are true through affidavits, which arevoluntary, written declarations of facts that are sworn to bythe declarant before a government officer and certified bythat officer. For example, affidavits are often used toadmit evidence in court. Washington law permits unswornwritten declarations to be used in lieu of affidavits and other sworn statements, so lo ng as the declarations follow a prescribed form. A declaration must state that it iscertified or declared by the person to be true under penaltyof perjury, be signed by the person, state the date and placeof execution, and state that it is declared under Washingtonlaw. The law does not apply to: written statements requir-ing an acknowledge ment; depositions; oaths of office; or oaths required to be taken before a special official otherthan a notary public. In 2008 the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws issued the Uniform UnswornForeign Declarations Act (Act ), which allows people out- side the geographic boundaries of the United States tosubmit unsworn written declarations in the place ofaffidavits and other sworn statements. The Act parallels afederal law in place since 1976. At least nine states andthe District of Columbia have adopted the Act. Summary: The Uniform Unsworn Foreign Declarations Act (Act) is adopted. Peopl e who are physically located outside the boundaries of the United States, Puerto Rico,the United States Virgin Islands, and territories or posses-sions subject to United States jurisdiction may submitunsworn declarations in lieu of other sworn statements. In addition to existing ex ceptions, the Act does not allow unsworn declarations to be used in place of declara- tions to be recorded pursuant to certain real estate and business partnership laws and certain oaths required bystatute relating to proving wills. Unsworn declarations must be made in the same me- dium as required by Washington laws for sworndeclarations. The Act supersedes certain requirements of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National CommerceAct. In interpreting the Act, courts must consider the need to promote uniformity of the law regarding unsworn declarations among the states that adopt the Act.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representative Hunter; by request of Departmentof Revenue). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Business and Occupation Tax and Nexus . Washington's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gross receipts of business ac tivities conducted within the state without any deduction fo r the costs of doing busi- ness. Nexus is the level of connection with a state neces-sary under the United States Commerce Clause to permita state to impose a tax or collection duty on out-of-statebusinesses doing busine ss in the state. In 2010 Engrossed Substi tute Senate Bill 6143 was enacted, specifying that for service-type activities, abusiness will have substantial nexus in Washington if it has a certain threshold amount of property, employees, orincome in the state. The 2010 changes also provide that a business with substantial ne xus in the current year is deemed to have substantial ne xus the following year. This is referred to as trailing nexus. Sales and Use Taxes . Retail sales and use taxes are imposed by the state, most cities, and all counties. Retailsales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles oftangible personal property, digital products, and someservices. The use tax applies to the acquisition of tangible personal property, digital products, and some services thatare not subject to sales tax. Generally, a person or businessacquiring property in another state is responsible for thepayment of Washington use tax when the property is brought into the state. However, under certain circum-stances, an out-of-state seller may be required to collectand remit use tax to Washington even if the property istransferred to the buyer outsid e the state. This requirement would apply only if the selle r has some connection to the state. Tax Incentive Reporting Requirements . The Citizen Commission for Performance Measurement of TaxPreferences (Commission) was established by the 2006Legislature (Engrossed House Bill 1069). The Commis-sion develops a schedule to review nearly all tax prefer-ences at least once every 10 years. The Commission alsoschedules preferences with expiration dates for reviewstwo years before the tax preference expires. Tax prefer-ence reviews are conducted by the Joint Legislative Auditand Review Committee (JLARC) according to the sched- ule established by the Commi ssion. For each tax prefer- ence, the JLARC provides reco mmendations to continue, modify, schedule for future review, or terminate thepreference. The Commission reviews and comments on the JLARC report. In 2005 legislation was enacted creating a Cost- Recovery Incentive Payment Program to promoterenewable energy systems that produce electricity fromsolar, wind, or anaerobic digesters. The Department ofRevenue must measure the impacts of the program andprovide a report to the Legislature by December 2014.The JLARC is also scheduled to review the tax incentive in 2013. Businesses claiming tax incentives are required to provide data on annual accountability reports or surveysfiled with the Department of Revenue. In general,accountability reports and su rveys require information about employment and economi c activities related to the tax incentives. In prior year s, it was common to create an entirely new accountability repo rt or survey statute for each new tax incentive even though the requirements ofeach new annual report or survey largely duplicated exist-ing report or survey statutes. In 2010 Substitute HouseBill (SHB) 3066 repealed most of these duplicative taxincentive annual report and survey statutes and replacedthem with a uniform annual survey and a uniform annualreport. However, duplicative annual report and surveystatutes were also amended in other bills that passed during 2010. These other b ills did not take cognizance of the repealed sections in SHB 3066. Exemption Study . The Department of Revenue (DOR) must produce and submit to the Legislature a tax exemption report every four ye ars. The report includes a listing of the estimated reve nue lost from the exemption and the beneficiary of the exemption. The next report isdue in January 2012. Summary: The trailing nexus statute is clarified by specifying that a person who has a substantial nexus with this state in any tax year will be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the stat e for the following tax year. Two redundant annual tax incentive accountability report and survey statutes are repealed. For purposes of collecting use taxes, it is explicitly clarified that a seller has no obligation to collect use tax if Washington is prohibited unde r the United States Consti- tution or federal law from requ iring the person to collect use tax. For the January 2012 tax exemption study, the DOR does not have to prepare or update the report for any taxexemption that is not likely to increase state revenue if the exemption was repealed.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011House 58 39 House 53 38 Senate 43 0HB 1347 86HB 1347 C 23 L 11 Concerning sales and use tax exemptions for certain property and services used in manufacturing, research anddevelopment, or testing operations, not including changesto RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565 that reduce staterevenue. By Representatives Hunter and Orcutt; by request of Department of Revenue. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Retail sales and use taxes are imposed by the state, most cities, and all counties. Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangiblepersonal property and digital products and some services.A retail sale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of the property, digital product, or service. If retail salestaxes were not collected wh en the property, digital products, or services were acquired by the user, then usetaxes apply to the value of mo st tangible personal property and digital products and some services when used in this state. The state sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent. Localtax rates vary from 0.5 percent to 3.0 percent, dependingon the location. The average lo cal tax rate is 2 percent, for an average combined state and local tax rate of 8.5 percent. A retail sales and use tax exemption applies to new or replacement machinery and equipment (M&E) used in amanufacturing or research and development operation bya manufacturer or processor fo r hire. The exemption also applies to services, such as installation or repair services, rendered with respec t to the M&E. Th e exemption applies to industrial fixtures and devices as well as pollution control equipment that is used in the manufacturingoperation. The exemption do es not apply to short-lived tools, hand tools, and consumable supplies. King County is constructing a new regional waste- water treatment plant, called Brightwater. Constructionstarted in 2006. The treatment plant is anticipated to beginoperations in 2012. Brig htwater will serve portions of King and Snohomish counti es. The new facilities will include a treatment plant, conveyance (pipes and pumps taking wastewater to and from the plant), and a marineoutfall. King County filed a refund lawsuit claiming it is entitled to the M&E exemption for the M&E installed atBrightwater. The amount of the refund request isapproximately $23 million, not including interest. As part of the wastewater treatment process, many treatment plants produce exceptional quality biosolids thatcontain almost no pathogens. These exceptional gradebiosolids can be used as commercial fertilizer. Two state universities are claiming the exemption for M&E used as part of a technological research anddevelopment operation. Summary: The sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment (M&E) is clarified to onlyapply with respect to busin esses that are taxed under the manufacturing category for business and occupation tax. The exemption does not apply to M&E used for activities within the purview of a utility business, i.e., distributing electricity, providing water and sewer services, distribut- ing natural gas, etc. However, M&E used by a wastewatertreatment facility to proce ss class B biosolids into bio- solids meeting class A or exceptional quality standardswould qualify for the exemption. It is also clarified that the M&E exemption does not apply to the state and its departments and institutions. A stand-alone sales and us e tax exemption for M&E is provided for public research in stitutions using the M&E as part of a research and develo pment operation. The exemp- tion also applies to installatio n, repair, and other services related to the M&E. The fo llowing institutions would be eligible for the exemption: University of Washington, Washington State University, Western WashingtonUniversity, Central Washington University, EasternWashington University, and The Evergreen State College.Any public research institution claiming the exemption is required to file an annual survey with the Department of Revenue providing employment-related information forthe prior calendar year, the general areas of research anddevelopment where exempt M& E is used, and the amount of the tax exemption claimed in the prior calendar year. The act applies retroactively to open assessment periods as well as prospectively.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 11, 2011 HB 1353 C 71 L 11 Concerning continuing education for pharmacy technicians. By Representatives Rivers , Cody, Schmick, Moeller, Orcutt, Ladenburg, Dahlquist, Harris, Moscoso, Green and Kenney. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: Certified pharmacy technicians provide assistance to licensed pharmac ists by performing manipu- lative, non-discretionary func tions associated with the practice of pharmacy. In ad dition, pharmacy technicians who meet criteria for employ ment, experience, training, and proficiency may perform sp ecialized functions such as unit-dose medication checking and parenteral prepara- tions. Pharmacy technicians may only practice whileunder the immediate supervisio n of a licensed pharmacist. In order to be certified, a pharmacy technician must:House 97 0Senate 47 0ESHB 1354 87 be a high school gradua te or successfully complete general education development tests; complete a formal pharmacy technician training program approved by the Board of Pharmacy or an on-the-job pharmacy technician training program approved by the Board of Pharmacy; and pass a national standardized pharmacy technician certification examination.Pharmacy technicians are not subject to continuing education requirements. Summary: Certified pharmacy technicians must complete continuing educatio n requirements established by the Board of Pharmacy. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1354 C 4 L 11 E1 Changing the apportionmen t schedule to educational service districts and school districts for the 2010-11 school year. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hunt, Haigh, Hunter andDarneille; by request of Office of Financial Management). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: General apportionmen t is the primary means by which basic educat ion funding is allocated to school districts. The basic educ ation rate (BEA rate) is the per pupil allocation provided to districts for a general education student, and is the foundation of the generalapportionment budget. In fiscal year 2011, general appor-tionment exceeds $4.86 billio n and represents about 75 percent of the total funding to school districts from the state. The BEA rate used to allocate special education funding for the 2009-10 school year was approximately$4,978 per student full time equivalent. General apportionment funding is allocated monthly to each district through each county treasurer. The amount provided varies by month. In the months of September,October, December, January, February, and March,districts receive 9 percent of their school year apportion-ment payment. In November and May they receive 5.5percent. In June they receive 6 percent. In July andAugust they receive 10 percent. Summary: The school apportionment payment schedule is changed for the 2010-11 sch ool year. The June appor- tionment payment is reduced by $128 million. A payment of an equal, off-setting amount is added on the first day of July, in addition to the re gularly scheduled payment.(These changes have the effect of delaying $128 million in school apportionment payments to fiscal year 2012.)

By Representatives Carlyle, Parker, Hunter, Dickerson, Roberts and Kenney; by request of Department ofRevenue. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Most businesses report and pay their taxes to the Department of Revenue (Department) on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Only monthly filers arerequired to report and pay th eir taxes electronically. The Department is authorized to assess various penalties on a number of tax reporting and payment deficiencies. For example, separate and cumulativepenalties are assessed on late tax payments, substantiallyunderpaid tax payments, and failing to register with theDepartment. The Department may also assess a 10 percentpenalty where the taxpayer has disregarded specific writ-ten instructions by the Depa rtment regarding reporting requirements or tax liabilities. Summary: All taxpayers are required to report and pay taxes electronically. However, the Department is autho- rized to waive these requirem ents for taxpayers filing on an annual basis and taxpayers with certain extenuating circumstances such as lack of access to the Internet,computer problems, or not having a bank account or creditcard. The 10 percent penalty for disregarding specific writ- ten instructions is applied to circumstances where the Department has specifically required a taxpayer to elec-tronically file or remit ta xes and the taxpayer willfully disregards those instructions. The act applies to tax retu rns and payments originally due after July 24, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 98 0 Senate 48 0House 52 36Senate 28 14 House 65 31 Senate 34 13HB 1358 88HB 1358 C 230 L 11 Modifying combination of vehicle provisions. By Representatives Klippert, Liias and Sells; by request of Department of Transportation. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: A saddlemount combin ation is a combina- tion of vehicles in which a truck or truck tractor tows one or more trucks or truck tractors. Each one is connected bya saddle or fifth wheel to the vehicle in front of it. Thesaddle is a mechanism that connects the front axle of thetowed vehicle to the frame or fifth wheel of the vehicle infront and functions like a fifth wheel kingpin connection.When two vehicles are towed in this manner, the combina- tion is called a double saddl emount combination. When three vehicles are towed in this manner, the combination iscalled a triple saddlemount co mbination. These combina- tions are used when there is a need to move multiple vehicles, for example, from a truck manufacturer to a truckdealer. Washington law prohibits a combination of these vehicles to exceed 75 feet in overall length. In 2005federal law was changed to prohibit any state from impos-ing a length for these saddlemo unt combinations of no less or more than 97 feet. Federal law states that non-compliance with the feder- ally mandated saddlemount length could lead to a 10percent reduction of federal aid for the National Highway System apportioned to the state for the next fiscal year. When seeking to enforce a federal law or regulation, an agency, through the Washington Administrative Code,may adopt the federal rules and regulations as a state rule. Summary: The 75-foot restriction is removed from exist- ing Washington statutes regarding the saddlemountcombination.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SHB 1362 C 58 L 11 Protecting and assisting homeowners from unnecessary foreclosures. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Takko, Sullivan, Blake, Seaquist, Billig, Stanford, Ladenburg, Finn and Pedersen). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: Foreclosure Process for Deeds of Trust . A deed of trust may be nonjudicially foreclosed if theborrower defaults on the loan obligation. The Deeds of Trust Act imposes certain requ irements on beneficiaries and trustees during the foreclosure process. To foreclose on a deed of trust, the beneficiary or trustee must send a notice of default to the borrower.Thirty days after the notice of default is sent, the trustee may record a notice of sale in the county auditor's office.The foreclosure sale may not occur until 90 days after thetime the notice of foreclosure sa le is recorded, and may not occur until at least 190 days from the date of default. Within that time frame, the borrower may, among other things, cure the default and discontinue the sale or bring acourt action to enjoin the foreclosure. Meet and Confer . In 2008 legislation was enacted that amended the Deeds of Trust Act to require a beneficiary tocontact a borrower by letter an d telephone before issuing a notice of default in order to assess the borrower's finan-cial situation. The beneficiary must give the borrowerinformation for housing co unseling agencies and must inform the borrower that he or she can request a subse-quent meeting with the benefi ciary to explore options to avoid foreclosure. This is referred to as the \"meet and confer\" requirement. The \"meet and confer\" requirementapplies to deeds of trust made from January 1, 2003, toDecember 31, 2007, on owner-occupied residentialproperty and expires on December 31, 2012. Real Estate Excise Tax . The real estate excise tax does not apply when property is tr ansferred by deed in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy a deed of trust and no additionalmoney or thing of value (ca lled \"consideratio n\") is given to the transferor. In some cas es, a lender might provide a nominal amount of money to the borrower as an incentivefor the borrower to transfer th e property in a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction and to assist the borrower inrelocation costs (sometimes referred to as \"cash for keys\"). That money could be \"consideration\" and may besubject to the real estate excise tax. Summary: Meet and Confer . The \"meet and confer\" requirement is amended to a llow for an additional 60 days before the notice of default ma y be issued, if the borrower responds within 30 days of th e initial contact. The benefi- ciary makes initial contact by sending a form letter, which must contain model language developed by the Depart- ment of Commerce (COM). The letter must urge theborrower to contact a housing counselor or attorney assoon as possible. If the bo rrower requests a meeting with the beneficiary, the meeting must be in person unless waived by the borrower. A person authorized to makeHouse 94 0Senate 49 02SHB 1362 89decisions for the beneficiary may participate by phone. The \"meet and confer\" requirement is made applicable toall deeds of trust and the expiration date is repealed. Housing Counselors . A housing counselor who is contacted by a borrower has a duty to act in good faith toattempt to reach a resolution within the time frame of the meet and confer process. A resolution may include, but isnot limited to a loan modification, an agreement toconduct a short sale, a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or someother plan. Housing counselors are not liable for civildamages resulting from acts or omissions in providingassistance to borrowers, unless the acts or omissions con- stitute gross negligence or w illful or wanton misconduct. Mediation . A foreclosure mediation process is estab- lished that applies to borrowers of deeds of trust on owner-occupied residential property who have been referred tomediation by a housing counselor or attorney. Thehousing counselor or attorney may refer a borrower tomediation if appropriate based on the individual circum-stances and if a notice of sale has not yet been recorded. Areferral to mediation does not preclude a trustee from issu-ing a notice of default. A financial institution that certifiesto the COM that it was not a beneficiary in more than 250foreclosure sales in a calendar year is exempt from themediation provisions. A housing counselor or a ttorney referring a borrower to mediation must send a noti ce form to the COM. Within 10 days of receiving the no tice, the COM must select a mediator and notify the parties. The mediator mustconvene an in-person media tion session within 45 days after being selected, unless the parties agree in writing toextend the time. Provisions are established to address when the mediator must send the parties notice of the mediation session, what documents and information theparties must provide to the me diator, and what factors the parties must consider during mediation. The parties mustmediate in person, but a decisi on-maker on behalf of the beneficiary may participate by phone. Parties in mediation have a duty to act in good faith. A party may violate of the duty to act in good faith by fail-ing to timely participate in mediation without good cause, failing to provide certain info rmation to the other party, failing to pay its portion of the mediator's fees, or engagingin other conduct set forth in the act. Within seven days of the co nclusion of the mediation, the mediator must certify to the COM the outcome of mediation and whether the par ties acted in good faith. A certification that the beneficiar y violated the duty to act in good faith constitutes a defense to the foreclosure, but not to any future foreclosure action. A certification that theborrower violated the duty to act in good faith authorizes the beneficiary to proceed with the foreclosure. If an agreement was not reached and the mediator's certification shows that the net present value of a modifiedloan exceeds the anticipated net recovery at foreclosure,the showing co nstitutes a basis for the borrower to enjoin the foreclosure. The mediator's fees must not exceed $400 for a three- hour session and must be paid for equally by the borrowerand beneficiary. The COM must maintain a list ofapproved foreclosure mediators and may establish a train-ing program for mediators. The COM must make annualreports to the Legislature on the results of the mediationprogram. Funding . Beginning October 1, 2011, and every quarter thereafter, beneficiari es must: (1) report to the COM the number of owner-occupied residential real prop-erties for which the beneficiary has issued notices ofdefault during the previous qu arter; and (2) remit to the COM a lump sum payment of $250 per property. No laterthan 30 days after the effectiv e date of this provision, the beneficiaries must remit to the COM a lump sum paymentof $250 per owner-occupied residential real property forwhich the beneficiary has issued a notice of default duringthe three months prior to the effective date of this provi- sion. This reporting and remitting requirement does notapply to financial institutions and loan servicers that have issued fewer than 250 notices of default in the preceding year, or to association beneficiaries. The funds are to be deposited into the newly created Foreclosure Fairness Account, which is a non-appropri-ated account administered by the COM. The funds must be distributed as follows: no less than 80 percent to fund housing counselors; the greater of up to 6 percent, or$655,000 per biennium, to the Consumer ProtectionDivision of the Office of th e Attorney General (AGO); up to 2 percent to the Office of Civil Legal Aid for purposesof contracting with legal aid programs for representationof homeowners in matters re lating to foreclosure; the greater of up to 9 percent, or $451,000 per biennium, to theCOM to implement the Forecl osure Fairness Act; and up to 3 percent to the Department of Financial Institutions to conduct homeowner outreach and education programs.The amount specified to fund housing counselors may be less than 80 percent if necessary to meet the level offunding specified for the AGO and the COM. Consumer Protection Act . It is a Consumer Protection Act violation for any person or entity to: (1) violate theduty of good faith in the me diation requirement; (2) fail to initiate contact with the borrower and exercise duediligence under the \"meet and co nfer\" requirement; or (3) fail to comply with the reporting and remittingrequirements to the COM. Servicer's Duty . A servicer's duty to maximize net present value under a pooling and servicing agreement isa duty that is owed to all parties in a deed of trust pool, notto a particular party, and the servicer acts in the bestinterests of all parties if it agrees to a modification wheredefault on the loan is reason ably imminent and anticipated recovery under a modification is more than the anticipated recovery through foreclosure. ESHB 1367 90Real Estate Excise Tax . For the purpose of the real estate excise tax, \"total consideration\" does not include the amount of any relocation assis tance provided to the trans- feror when a transfer is made by deed in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy a deed of trust. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 April 14, 2011 (Sections 11, 12, and 16) ESHB 1367 C 190 L 11 Concerning for hire vehicles and for hire vehicle operators. By House Committee on La bor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsore d by Representatives and Roberts). House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Industrial Insurance . With limited excep- tions, all workers in the state are covered by mandatory industrial insurance. Some independent contractors areexempt from mandatory coverage. The term \"independentcontractor\" is not defined in law; rather, this concept isembodied in severa l exception tests to the definition of \"worker.\" If a worker fulfills the tests, the worker is notcovered for purposes of wo rkers' compensation, and no industrial insurance premiums are due. Otherwise, theworker is a covered worker, and premiums are due. Mostbusiness owners are exempt but may elect coverage. In nearly all types of employments, premiums are based on hours worked. The retrospective rating pr ogram (retro) allows an employer or a group of employers to assume a portion ofindustrial insurance risk an d receive premium refunds or be assessed additional premiu ms based on claim losses. For Hire Vehicles . For hire vehicle (includes taxicabs) owners must obtain a vehicle certificate from the Depart-ment of Licensing (DOL). Taxicab businesses are alsosubject to regulation by loca l jurisdictions. Cities, towns, counties, and port districts may control rates charged for taxicab transportation servic es and the manner in which rates are calculated and collected. Limousine carriers must obtain a license from the DOL. The state has preempte d local regulation of limou- sine carriers except that the Port of Seattle has someregulatory authority. A limousi ne carrier is a person who, under a single contract, acquires the use of a limousine totravel to a specific destination or for a particular itineraryon a prearranged basis. Summary: Industrial Insurance . Certain for hire busi- nesses and operators of for hire vehicles are within man- datory industrial insurance co verage. Businesses are those that own and operate, or own and lease: a for hire vehicle(includes taxicabs) licensed by the state, a limousine, or a taxicab licensed by a local jurisdiction. Persons whooperate these vehicles for the purpose of carrying personsfor compensation and chauffeurs are covered persons. The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) must determine by rule, the basis for premiums for these busi- nesses. The L&I must consider: (1) the unique economicstructures of the taxicab, for hire vehicle, and limousineindustries; (2) the difficulty of equitably assessingpremiums on classes of businesses that use both employer/employee and independent contractor business models;(3) the economic impact on businesses of a rate and assess-ment alternative, such as a flat rate and per vehicle or miles driven basis, compared to an hours worked basis; (4) the L&I's costs and efficiency of administration; (5) the cost to businesses and covered work ers; and (6) the anticipated effectiveness in implementing mandatory industrial insur-ance of for hire vehicle operators. The L&I may appoint apanel of individuals with for hire and taxicab transporta-tion industry experience and expertise to advise the L&I.The owner of any vehicle subject to mandatory coverageis eligible for inclusion in a retro program. A for hire vehicle certificate, a limousine business license and vehicle certificate, and a local taxicab licensemust be suspended or revoked, and may not be renewed, ifindustrial insurance premiums are not paid. Suspension and revocation for failure to pa y premiums must be at the direction and expense of the L&I. The DOL and the L&Imay adopt rules and enter into cooperative agreements to implement this provision. With respect to local taxicabregulation, local jurisdictions may also enter cooperative agreements with the DOL and the L&I. A for hire vehicle, limousine, locally regulated taxi- cab, and its operator (or chauffer, in the case of a limou-sine) must have evidence of good standing regarding the industrial insurance premiu m. Failure to produce evidence upon demand of a law enforcement officer orother government agent is a civil infraction punishable bya fine of not more than $250 per infraction on both theowner and the operator. Local Regulation . A local jurisdiction setting rates charged for taxicab services must adjust the rates toaccommodate changes in the co st of industrial insurance or other industry-wide costs. An owner of a taxicablicensed by a local jurisdiction that leases the taxicab to an operator must make a reasonable effort to train theoperator in motor vehicle operation and safety require-ments, and to monitor oper ator compliance, which may include the use of operator monitoring cameras.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Darneille and Hunt; by requestof Governor Gregoire). House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 1994 legislation was enacted directing the Governor to review an d submit to the Legislature every odd-numbered year a report recommending which boards and commissi ons should be terminated or consoli- dated. In making a recommendation, the Governor must consider the following: whether the entity completed its work and is no longer of critical signif icance to effective state government; whether the work of the group directly affects public safety, welfare, or health; whether the work can be done by another state agency; what impact termination will have on costs; whether the work can be done by a non-public entity; whether termination will result in significant loss of expertise to state government; whether termination w ill result in operational efficiencies other than fiscal; and whether the work can be done by an ad hoc committee. The Governor is required to make appointments to boards, commissions, and othe r entities, including citizen member appointments to over 200 entities. In 2009 legislation wa s enacted eliminating 18 statutory boards, commission s, and similar entities, and the Governor eliminated a number of non-statutory entities by executive order. In 2010 the enacted legislation eliminated 45 statutory boar ds, commissions, and similar entities. The Office of Financial Management (OFM) sets allowances for subsistence, lo dging, and travel expenses for persons who are appointed to serve on boards, commis- sions, or similar groups. Part-time groups are identified asclass one through class five for purposes of setting anyadditional compensation or allowances.In 2010 the enacted legislation eliminated allowances for class one through three and class five groups if the costis funded by the State General Fund. Exceptions arepermitted. Class one through three and class five groups funded by sources other than the State General Fund areencouraged to reduce travel, lo dging, and other costs. All classes were directed, if feasible, to use methods of con-ducting meetings that do not require members to travel and to use state facilities whenev er possible for meetings that require members to physically be present. Approval of theDirector of OFM is required to use private facilities formeetings. These restrictions apply to fiscal year 2011. Summary: Elimination/Transfer/Duties/Appointment Authority .

By Representatives Clibborn, Maxwell, Liias, Eddy, Hunter and Springer; by request of Department ofTransportation. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are highway lanes reserved part-time or full-time for vehicles carrying a minimum number of occupants. The object ofthese lanes is to facilitate th e operation of transit vehicles and other multi-occupant ve hicles by allowing the vehicles to avoid congestion. The Washington StateDepartment of Transportation (WSDOT) has authority todesignate HOV lanes on state highways, and there are over 200 miles of HOV lanes in op eration in the central Puget Sound area. During certain periods, HOV lanes are oper-ating below capacity while adjacent general purpose lanesare congested. High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes arelanes that are open to carpool s, vanpools, transit vehicles, and toll-paying vehicles. The goal for these lanes is toprovide a higher level of service for multi-occupant vehicles, while permitting othe r vehicles to use surplus capacity in the lane by paying a toll. The WSDOT operates a HOT lane pilot project along the nine miles of HOV lanes on State Route 167 (SR 167)within King County. Tolls on the project are established by the state tolling authority, the Washington StateTransportation Commission (Commission), and vary inamount by time of day and th e level of traffic congestion. During peak hours, the tolls mu st be adjusted to maintain HOT lane performance of at least 45 miles per hour for atleast 90 percent of the time. In 2009 the WSDOT was directed by Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5352 to conduct a traffic revenue study for Interstate 405 (I-4 05) in King and Snohomish counties that included fund ing for improvements and HOT lanes. The WSDOT was also di rected to develop a plan to operate two HOT lanes in each direction on I-405. TheWSDOT delivered the Eastside Corridor Tolling Study tothe Legislature in January 2010. After release of the study,the WSDOT decided to convene an Expert Review Panelto review the eastside corridor express toll lanes studywork. The Expert Review Panel final report was distributed in December 2010. Summary: The imposition of tolls is authorized for express toll lanes on I-405 between the junction with Interstate 5 on the north end and Northeast 6th Street in Bellevue on the south end. In addition, I-405 is designated as an eligible toll facility. An express toll lane means an HOV lane in which the WSDOT charges tolls to regulateuse of the lane to maintain tr avel speed and reliability. The Commission is directed to set the schedule of toll rates forthe express toll lanes, which ma y vary by time of day, level of congestion, and other criteria determined by theCommission. Toll charges may not be assessed on transitbuses and vanpools. Toll revenue may be used for debtservices, planning, administra tion, construction, mainte- nance, repairing, rebuilding, operation, enforcement, andthe expansion of express toll lanes on I-405. The I-405Express Toll Lanes Operations Account is created in the motor vehicle fund, so the expenditure of the revenue islimited to highway purposes. The WSDOT is authorized to construct and operate the express toll lanes and set the performance standards forthe project. Operation of the lanes may not begin until theWSDOT has completed certain capacity improvements.The WSDOT is required to au tomatically adjust the toll rate, using dynamic tolling, within the schedule estab-lished by the Commission to ensure that average vehicle speeds in the lanes remain above 45 miles per hour 90percent of the time during peak hours. The Commissionmust periodically review the to ll rates against the traffic performance of all lanes to de termine if the toll rates are effectively maintaining travel time, speed, and reliability. The WSDOT is required to annually report to theCommission and the Legislat ure on the impact of the express toll lanes project on certain performancemeasures. The express toll lanes project must beterminated if it does not meet certain performance criteria within two years. The Commission is required to hire independent experts to conduct a traffic and revenue analysis of a 40-mile continuous express toll lane system that includes SR167 and I-405. In addition, the WSDOT must develop acorridor-wide project management plan for the eastsidecorridor. The WSDOT is dir ected to use the information from the analysis and the management plan to develop a fi-nance plan to fund improvem ents in the corridor. The WSDOT must consult with th e Commission in developing the corridor-wide management plan and the finance plan,and the WSD OT and the Commission must consult with certain elected officials and representatives from certaintransit agencies while developing the performancestandards, the traffic and reve nue analysis, and the finance plan. The traffic and revenue analysis and the finance planare due to the Governor and Legislature in January 2012.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 52 46 Senate 36 13 (Senate amended)House 51 44 (House concurred)SHB 1384 94SHB 1384 C 231 L 11 Concerning public improv ement contracts involving certain federally funded transportation projects. By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Moscoso, Liias, Clibborn, Billig,Ryu, Kenney, Stanford and Reykdal; by request ofDepartment of Transportation). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: State law requires that public improvement contract provisions include a \"contract retainage\" of no more than 5 percent of the moneys earned by the contractor. The retainage is to be set aside as a trust fundin the event that claims arise under the contract or taxes are not paid by the contractor. Federal disadvantaged bu siness enterprise (DBE) regulations require prime contractors to pay subcontrac-tors in full by no later than 30 days after the subcontrac- tor's work is satisfactorily co mpleted. This is referred to as the DBE \"prompt payment requirement.\" Summary: Public improvement contracts for highway, road, and street projects that are funded by federal trans- portation funds are exempted from the retainage require-ment. Instead, the contract bond is used in the event ofclaims or unpaid taxes. The contract bond must remain infull force and effect until, at a minimum, all claims filed incompliance with contractor 's bond requirements are resolved.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1391 C 72 L 11 Regarding the use of water delivered from the federal Columbia basin project. By Representatives Warnick, Haler, Fagan, Schmick, Chandler, McCune, Armstrong, Condotta, Johnson, Hinkle and Parker. House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Columbia Basin Project . The Columbia Basin Project (Project) of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation(Bureau) receives its waters from Franklin D. RooseveltLake behind Grand Coulee Dam. The Department ofEcology (DOE) has entered in to an agreement with the Bureau and has adopted rules for managing certain comin- gled waters associated with th e Project. Under these rules, the DOEmay issue water use permits.Groundwater Management Subareas . A groundwater management subarea (subarea) may be established by ruleby the DOE to address aquifer levels and to regulate with-drawals of public groundwater. The DOE has adoptedrules establishing the WAC 508-14 Subarea, the OdessaSubarea, and the Quincy Subar ea. Parts of these subareas include lands within the boundaries of the Project. In 2004 legislation was enacted granting the DOE the authority to enter into agreem ents with the Bureau and the Project irrigation districts to offset aquifer depletions dueto groundwater withdrawals. Such agreements allow sur- face water conserved within currently served Project areasto be delivered to deep well irrigated lands in subareas within Project boundaries. When such deliveries occur, the DOE must issue a supers eding water right permit or certificate to indicate that th e unused portion of a replaced subarea groundwater right is a reserve right with low flow protection from relinquishment. This reserve right may again be used if the delivery of conserved Project water is cu rtailed or otherwise unavail- able. The total acreage irrigated under the subarea ground-water right and delivered Project water must not exceedquantity or acreage limits d escribed in the groundwater permit or certificate. Summary: The allowable quantity of water permitted for irrigation is modified in circumstances where a person has a groundwater right within a subarea using surface waterfrom the Project. The total acreage irrigated under thesubarea groundwater right an d delivered Project water must not exceed the quantity of water authorized by theBureau or acreage limits described in the groundwaterpermit or certificate. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1402 C 134 L 11 Concerning certain social car d games in an area annexed by a city or town. By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Af- fairs (originally sponsored by Representatives Upthegroveand Orwall). House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: The Gambling Act authorizes a business to conduct social card games, including house-banked games, when licensed by the Gambling Commission (Commission). A gambling license is legal authority to engage in that gambling activ ity. A city, town, or countyHouse 98 0Senate 48 House 96 0Senate 47 02SHB 1405 95may \"absolutely prohibit\" gambling, but may not change the scope of a license. In 2009 legislation was enacted authorizing certain cities that ban house-banked card games and annex an area that allows house-banked card games to \"grandfather\" anexisting card game business in the annexed area and allowit to continue operating. Th is grandfathering authority is limited in several respects: (1) only cities within King, Snohomish, and Pierce Counties may grandfather; (2) theannexed area must have a population of at least 10,000people (except for areas an nexed by Bellevue); (3) the continuation of the card game business must reduce a tax authorized as a credit against the sales and use tax; and (4)the business to be grandfathered must have been licensedby the Commission as of July 26, 2009. In addition, the grandfathering authorization applies only to house-banked card game businesses. In November 2009 voters in the Panther Lake area approved the annexation of the area to the city of Kent,effective July 1, 2010. In April 2010 Kent adopted an ordinance allowing house-banked card rooms in theannexed area to continue operating. Summary: A jurisdiction with a ban on house-banked card rooms that annexed an area and allowed a house- banked card room in the annexed area to continue operat-ing before July 15, 2010, must allow all card rooms (i.e., non house-banked) card rooms licensed and operating asof January 1, 2011, to continue operating.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SHB 1405 C 191 L 11 Regulating loans made under the consumer loan act. By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representa- Ladenburg , Darneille, Ryu, Stanford and Jinkins). House Committee on Comm unity Development & Housing House Committee on Business & Financial Services House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: The Consumer Loan Act (CLA) authorizes the Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) to regulate consumer loan companies doin g business in Washington. Consumer loan companies in clude mortgage lenders and consumer finance companies.License Required . No person may engage in the busi- ness of making secured or unsecured loans of money,credit, or things in action un less licensed by the DFI under the CLA or exempt from licensure. The CLA providesexemptions from licensing for: any person making loan s primarily for business, com- mercial, or agricultural pu rposes, or making loans to government or government agencies or instrumentali- ties, or to an \"organizatio n\" as defined in the federal Truth in Lending Act; an entity licensed as a bank, savings bank, trust com- pany, savings and loan association, building and loanassociation, or credit union under state or federal law; entities licensed as pawnbrokers; entities making loans fo r retail installment sales of goods and services; entities licensed as a check casher or seller; entities making loans un der the Housing Trust Fund; entities making loans under programs of the federal government that provide funding or access to fundingfor single-family housing de velopments or grants to low-income individuals for the purchase or repair ofsingle-family housing; nonprofit housing organizations making loans, or loans made, under housing programs that are fundedby federal or state programs if the primary purpose of the programs is to assist low-income borrowers with purchasing or repairing housing or the developmentof housing for low-income state residents; and entities making loans which are not residential mort- gage loans under a credit card plan.An applicant for a license and any officers and princi- pals of the applicant must undergo a background check. A licensee must maintain a surety bond or meet other speci-fied financial requ irements. The amount of the bond is based on the annual dollar amou nt of loans originated with a minimum amount of $30,000. Powers of a CLA Licensee . A CLA licensee may: lend money at a rate that does not exceed 25 percent per annum; charge a borrower a nonrefundable, prepaid, loan origination fee limited to 4 percent of the first $20,000 loaned and 2 percent of any amount above $20,000. The fee may be included in the principalbalance of the loan; agree with the borrower for the payment of fees to third parties other than the licensee who providesgoods or services to the licensee in connection with the preparation of the borrower's loan and may include such fees in the amount of the loan. How- ever, no charge may be collected unless a loan ismade, except for reasonable fees properly incurred inHouse 94 1 Senate 46 2ESHB 1406 96connection with the appraisal of property by a quali- fied, independent, professional, third-party appraiser; in connection with a loan secured by real estate, agree with the borrower to pay a fee to a mortgage broker that is not owned by the licensee or under common ownership with the licensee and that performed services in connection with the origination of the loan. A licensee may not receive compensation as a mortgage broker in connection with any loan made by the licensee; charge and collect a penalty of not more than 10 percent of any installment payment delinquent 10days or more; collect fees and expenses related to a collection when a debt is referred to an a ttorney who is not a salaried employee of the licensee; make open-end loans as provided in the CLA; charge a fee for dishonored checks; and sell insurance covering real and personal property, covering the life or disability or both of the borrower,and covering the involuntary unemployment of the borrower. Prohibited Practices . There are a variety of prohibited practices under the CLA to ensure fair, honest, and open practices. Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loan Servicing . In 2009 a law was enacted that regulates mortgage loan servicers under the CLA. In 2010 changes to the EscrowAct were made, including chan ges to the exemptions from regulation under the Escrow Act. As a result of the 2009 and 2010 legislation, a small group of people who servicemortgage loans are regulated under the Escrow Act andthe CLA. The Director has the author ity to waive licensing CLA provisions for persons making mortgage loans when theDirector determines it is necessary to facilitate commerceand protect consumers. Administrative Enforcement . The Director of the DFI (Director) may deny applications or renewals or suspendor revoke licenses for specified actions or failures to act byan applicant or licensee. The Director may impose fines for violations. The Director may issue an order directingthe licensee, its employee or loan originator, or otherperson subject to the CLA to: cease and desist from co nducting business in a man- ner that is injurious to the public or violates any provision of the CLA; take action necessary to comply with the CLA; or make restitution to a borro wer or other person who is injured by a CLA violation. Penalties . Violations of the CLA are violations of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The Office of the Attor- ney General may bring an action on behalf of persons injured by a violation of the CPA. A private party mayalso bring an action to enfo rce the CPA. The CPA allows an injured party to receive treble damages, up to a maximum of $25,000. Certain violations are gross misdemeanors. A gross misdemeanor is punishable by: imprisonment for not more than 12 months in jail; a maximum fine of $5,000; or a combination of imprisonment and a fine. In 2009 the statute concerning the exemptions was amended in two different bills. The difference in language could not be reconciled by the Code Reviser. The result is two different, overlapping statutes in law. Summary: The exemption regarding loans made primar- ily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes ismodified to except loans that are secured by a lien on theborrower's primary residence. It is a prohibited practice for a licensee to execute or induce the execution of an in strument that conveys any ownership interest in a borrowe r's primary residence to the lender. The prohibition only applies to actions that are contemporaneous to the making of the loan and are prior to a default on the loan. The prohibite d practice does not apply to mortgages or deeds of trust. It is a prohibited practice for a licensee, at the time of closing a loan, to obtain a release for da mages resulting from a violation of the usury law, the CLA, or other laws . The Director may waive CLA licensing provisions for persons servicing mortgage loans when the Director deter-mines it is necessary to faci litate commerce and protect consumers. Several formatting and ho usekeeping changes are made.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1406 PARTIAL VETO C 215 L 11 Establishing the intrastate building safety mutual aid system. By House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness (originally sp onsored by Representatives Hunt, Ross, Appleton, Armstrong, Hurst and Stanford). House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Mutual aid is a term in organizational theory used to signify a volu ntary reciprocal exchange ofHouse 96 0 Senate 47 2 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1406 97resources and services for mutual benefit. In emergency services, mutual aid is an agreement among emergencyresponders to lend assistanc e across jurisdictional bound- aries. This may occur due to an emergency response thatexceeds local resources, such as a disaster or a multi- ple-alarm fire. Mutual aid may be ad hoc and requestedonly when such an emergency o ccurs. It may also be a for- mal standing agreement for cooperative emergency man-agement on a continuing basis, such as ensuring thatresources are dispatched from the nearest fire station,regardless of which side of th e jurisdictional boundary the incident is on. Various state and local governmental enti-ties in Washington are involved in emergencymanagement and preparedness. The Washington Association of Building Officials . The Washington Association of Building Officials is anonprofit, professional association of state, county, city,and town officials in Washington engaged in the develop-ment, enforcement, and admi nistration of building con- struction codes and ordinanc es. Membership includes building officials and inspect ors, planners, architects, structural engineers, and others. The Emergency Management Division . The Emer- gency Management Division of the Washington Military Department administers emergency management anddisaster relief programs. The Director of the MilitaryDepartment (Director) is appo inted by the Governor and is required to develop a comprehensive emergency manage-ment plan including an analysis of the natural, technolog-ical, or human-caused hazards that could affect the state. Local jurisdictions are directed to establish comprehen-sive local emergency manage ment plans and submit their plans to the Director for reco mmendations. Local jurisdic- tions may also establish and operate joint local emergency management organizations. The Emergency Management Council . The Emergen- cy Management Council (Council) is a 17-member Coun-cil appointed by the Governor to advise the Governor and the Director on state and local emergency managementmatters. The Council includes representatives from vari-ous state and local agencies as well as emergency medicalpersonnel and private industry. Among other duties, theCouncil must ensure the Governor receives an annualassessment of statewide emergency preparedness. In theevent of a disaster beyond local control, the Governor,through the Director, may assume operational control overall or any part of emergency management functions in thestate. In addition to using state and local agencies and employees for emergency response, the Governor and thechief executives or emergency management directors ofcounties, cities, and towns have authority to press citizens into emergency management service if the Governorproclaims a disaster. The Washington State Emergency Response Commis- sion. The Washington State Emergency Response Com- mission (SERC) was created in accordance with a federallaw that establishes requirements for federal, state andlocal governments, and private industry regarding emer-gency response planning. The membership of the SERCincludes representatives from private industry and stateand local agencies. The SERC is a subcommittee of theCouncil and deals with hazardous chemical type emergen-cy hazards. Among other purposes, the SERC designatesand oversees local emergency planning districts or com- mittees and facilitates preparation and implementation ofemergency planning and preparedness. The Washington State Patrol Fire Protection Bureau . The Washington State Patrol Fire Protection Bureau pro-vides training to first responders on hazardous materialincidents and is the Incident Command Agency if an inci- dent occurs along any state route or interstate freeway.The terrorism unit offers trai ning and information regard- ing terrorism respon se and extremist groups. The training is meant for all first responde rs, but the terrorism unit also provides information to agen cies and the public on these topics. Summary: The Intrastate Building Safety Mutual Aid (IBSMA) System is established to provide mutual assis-tance among member jurisdictio ns in the case of a building safety emergency or to aid in training and exercises. A building safety emergency means a situation that tempo-rarily renders a building saf ety department incapable of providing building safety serv ices. Mutual assistance may include immediate responses to a building safety emergen- cy, any effort to help mitigat e or prevent further damages, or recovery activities. Membership of the IBSMA System . Member juris- dictions of the IBSMA Syst em include counties, cities, towns, and tribal government entities that have provided awritten declaration of their in tention to participate, and any other governmental entities with responsibilities ofensuring building safety. No thing precludes a jurisdic- tion's membership in the IBSMA System from enteringinto or interfering with ot her mutual aid agreements as permitted by law. Request for Assistance . Member jurisdictions of the IBSMA System may request mutual aid assistance from other member jurisdictions to respond to, mitigate, or recover from a building safety emergency, or for participa- tion of other member jurisdic tions in authorized drills or exercises, provided that: the request for assistance is from the chief executive officer of the requesting juri sdiction and that jurisdic- tion is experiencing a build ing safety emergency or is undertaking drills or exercises; the verbal request for assistance is confirmed by a written request as as soon as practicable; a responding member jurisdiction may withhold resources for any reason; emergency responders and resources from a respond- ing member jurisdiction are under the generalESHB 1406 98command of their jurisdictio n but under the operation command of the requesting jurisdiction; and a response to a building safety emergency under an IBSMA agreement is voluntary. A responding member jurisdiction may designate, in writing, persons to serve as temporary emergency responders for the purposes of deploying such persons under the IBSMA System. A designation as a temporary emergency responder does not grant any right to wages,salary, pensions, health benef its, seniority or other bene- fits. The IBSMA Oversigh t Committee (Committee) must develop policies detailing th e temporary designation process. Reimbursement . A jurisdiction requesting mutual aid assistance must reimburse res ponding jurisdictions for the true and full value of assistance. Requests for reimburse-ment must be made within 30 days within the proceduresand rates developed by the Committee. Responding juris-dictions may donate assistance and resources to a request- ing jurisdiction. However, if a member jurisdiction has a dispute over the reimbursem ent payments for assistance, that jurisdiction may send a written request to the othermember jurisdiction to resolve the matter within 30 days.If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days following receipt of the written request, either party may requestarbitration. Reciprocity of Professional Qualifications . There is reciprocity for any emergency responder holding a license,certificate, or other permit evidencing qualification in aprofessional, mechanical, or other skill, issued by Washington or a political subdivision. That person isdeemed to be licensed, cer tified, or permitted in the requesting member jurisdictio n for the duration of the emergency, drill, or exercise, subject to any limitationsand conditions that the chie f executive officer of the requesting member jurisdiction may prescribe. Injuries Under the Mu tual Aid Agreement . If an employee dies or is injured during the course of his or heremployment while providing assistance under the IBSMASystem, such employee is eligib le for benefits that would otherwise be available for injuries sustained or death in thecourse of employment. Immunity . For purposes of tort liability or immunity, an emergency responder of a responding jurisdiction isconsidered an agent of the jurisdiction that has requested assistance. A responding ju risdiction rendering aid under the IBSMA System is not liable for the acts or omissionsin good faith of the respon ding jurisdiction's emergency responders or resources. Go od faith does not include will- ful misconduct, gross negligen ce, or recklessness. The IBSMA System does not prov ide rights or privileges to any person responding for any reason if a member juris-diction has not requested or authorized that person to respond to the emergency.Intrastate Building Safety Mutual Aid Oversight Committee . The Intrastate Building Safety Mutual Aid Oversight Committee (Committee) is created as a Com-mittee of the Washington Association of Building Offi-cials. It is representative of building safety agencies anddisciplines as well as local political subdivisions. The President of the Wa shington Association of Building Officials will appo int members of the Committee from interested applicants. The Committee, which willmeet at least annually, will be responsible for developingand updating the IBSMA System's comprehensive guide-lines and procedures implementing the IBSMA System.The guidelines, at a minimum, must include projected oranticipated costs, checklists for requesting and providing mutual aid assistance, recor dkeeping for all member juris- dictions, rates and reimbursement procedures, and othernecessary implementation instructions and forms. The Committee must review the progress and status of the IBSMA System and draft any necessary guidelines,policies, and procedures to correct any deficiencies in theIBSMA System. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the provi- sion that created the Committe e that was responsible for developing and updating the guidelines and procedures relating to the operations of the IBSMA System. VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1406 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 10, Engrossed Substitute Hous e Bill 1406 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to intrastate building safety mutual aid in the event of emergencies and othe r situations that temporarily render a jurisdiction incapable of providing required building safety services.\"Section 10 creates the intrastate building safety mutual aid oversight committee, and provides th at it shall be a committee of the Washington association of bui lding officials. I do not believe the creation of this oversight commi ttee is necessary to carry out the purposes of the ac t. If desired, the members of the intrastate building safety mutual aid system can establish a committee structure without the need of a statutory reference. For these reasons, I have veto ed Section 10 of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1406. With the exception of Section 10, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1406 is approved.

By Representatives Ryu, Hope, Dunshee, Angel and Kagi.House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: A public utility district (PUD or district) is a type of special purpose dist rict authorized for the pur- pose of generating and distributing electricity, providingwater and sewer services, an d providing telecommunica- tions services. A PUD may operate on a countywide basisor may encompass a smaller jurisdiction. There are 28operating PUDs in the state, many of which provide a mixof services: 23 provide electrical services; 19 providewater or wastewater services, or both; and 13 providewholesale broadband tel ecommunications services. Public utility districts are governed by a board of either three or five elect ed commissioners. A PUD may sell, lease, or convey its works, plants, systems, utilities, and properti es in accordance with spec- ified procedures and the approval of the district voters. In general, PUDs are subject to the same regulations as cities and towns with respect to the disposition of district property. However, the governing statutes provide numerous exceptions to the general rule requiring voter approval for the disposition of property by a PUD. These exceptionsare wide-ranging and allow di sposition of property with- out voter approval under circ umstances that include the following: where the property lies ou tside the boundaries of the district and is being sold to another PUD or other public entity; where the property is obsolete or otherwise not useable and is no longer needed by the PUD; where the property is being sold to another public utility, private utility, utility contractor, or govern- mental entity for not less than fair market value and in response to specified circumstances; and where the property is all or any part of an electric generating project powered by a renewable resource,and the district has specific rights relating to the purchase of energy from th e project and to an option to repurchase the project at fair market value upontermination of the right to purchase energy from the project. Additionally, districts mee ting certain population and geographic requirements ar e authorized to engage in disposition transactio ns under specified circumstances. Summary: A PUD located in a county that borders the Puget Sound and that has a population of between 650,000and 750,000 inhabitants may, without voter approval, selland convey all or part of its water system to a city or town that owns its own water system and has a population offewer than 65,000 inhabitants.

By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Santos, Dammeier, Probst and Liias;by request of Superintendent of Public Instruction). House Committee on Education Background: Since the graduating class of 2008, students have been required to meet the state standard on the statewide high school a ssessments in reading, writing, and mathematics to earn a Certificate of Academic Achievement (CAA). Students in special education whoare not appropriately tested by the regular assessment mayearn a Certificate of Individual Achievement (CIA). Earn-ing the CAA or CIA in reading and writing is a require-ment for graduation. There has been a temporaryexemption through the class of 2012 where students may graduate without a CAA or CIA as a result of not meetingthe state standard in mathem atics by taking additional mathematics courses. Beginnin g with the graduating class of 2013, students will be requi red to meet the state stan- dard on the high school assessments in reading, writing,mathematics, and science bo th to earn a CAA and for graduation. For purposes of graduation, the Legislature has autho- rized alternative assessments for students who do not meetthe standard on state assessmen ts. For example, students may substitute a score of three on specified AdvancedPlacement (AP) exams covering English, language arts, and mathematics. None of the AP exams currentlyauthorized are in science. The high school science assessment is a comprehen- sive assessment. A budget proviso in the 2010 Supple-mental Omnibus Appropriations Act directed theSuperintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) to develop anend-of-course assessment (EOC) for high school sciencein Biology, to be implemented in the 2011-12 school year.The proviso also required the SPI to recommend whetheradditional science EOCs sh ould be developed and to recommend an implementati on schedule. Washington's science learning standards were revised in 2009 andinclude content in life, physical, and earth and spacesciences. The standards also include the study of systems,inquiry, and application that cuts across content areas. In a report submitted in December 2010, the SPI recommends development of two additional EOCs in Physical Science and Integrated Science. The SPI recom-mends that, for purposes of high school graduation,students be required to meet the state standard on one of the science EOCs. The report also recommends delayingthe implementation of the graduation requirement inscience to the class of 2017. A number of science education groups, led by Achieve, Incorporated, are working to develop a set ofcommon science learning st andards that multiple statescould adopt. The framework for the standards is beingprepared by the National Academy of Sciences and isscheduled to be released in the late spring of 2011. Stan-dards are expected to be ava ilable for states to review by spring of 2012. If the SPI pr oposes changes to state learn- ing standards or assessments , the education committees of the Legislature must, on request, be provided an opportu-nity to review the propose d changes before they are adopted. Summary: Beginning with the graduating class of 2015, rather than the class of 2013, students must meet the state standard in science on the state assessment, or on an alter- nate assessment for students in special education, to earn aCAA or CIA for graduation. Beginning in the 2011-12 school year, the state high school science assessment is a Biology EOC. The SPImay develop additional scien ce EOCs for purposes of graduation when directed by the Legislature. The SPI isalso authorized to participat e with consortia of multiple states as common science st andards and assessments are developed, and may adapt the state high school scienceassessment accordingly, as long as the legislative educa-tion committees have an opportunity to review any pro-posed modifications to the standards and assessmentsbefore they are adopted. Various AP science exams are added to the list of ap- proved alternatives for students who take the regular state assessment at least once. Sc ores on the ACT in science and on SAT science subtests may also be used as an alter-native once the State Board of Education has sufficientdata to identify equivalent scores.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 HB 1412 C 25 L 11 Regarding mathematics end-of-course assessments. By Representatives Santos, Dammeier, Probst, Liias, Kelley, Kenney and Van De Wege; by request of Superin-tendent of Public Instruction. House Committee on Education House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: In 2008 legislation was enacted directing the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) to replace the comprehensive state hi gh school mathematics assess- ment with a series of end-of-course assessments (EOCs) beginning in the 2010-11 school year. The EOCs are tocover standards for first-year mathematics (Algebra I andIntegrated I) and also second-year mathematics (Geome-House 86 10 Senate 41 3HB 1413 101try and Integrated II). For purposes of high school gradu- ation, students in the graduating class of 2013 and 2014are permitted to use the results of the EOC for the first year of mathematics plus the EOC for the second year of math-ematics, or the results from a comprehensive mathematicsassessment. Starting with the class of 2015, only theEOCs will be used as the state high school mathematicsassessment. Students must meet the state standard on both mathematics EOCs to earn a Certificate of AcademicAchievement (CAA), which is required for graduation starting with the class of 2013. The comprehensive mathematics assessment was offered to students in the 10th grade. The EOCs are designed to be offered to students after they take therespective mathematics course. The SPI estimates thatapproximately 60,000 10th grade students in the class of2013 took Algebra I or Integrated I as freshmen and areenrolled in Geometry or Integrat ed II in the spring of 2011. Some took the first year of high school mathematics in eighth grade. This class will be expected to take two math-ematics EOCs in the spring of 2011 in order to meet grad-uation requirements. A comprehensive high schoolmathematics assessment is no longer being offered. Summary: Students in the graduating classes of 2013 and 2014 must meet the state stan dard on one high school EOC mathematics assessment rather th an two in order to earn a CAA, which is required for graduation.

By House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Rolfes, Lytton,Moscoso, Van De Wege, Gree Reykdal and Tharinger; by request ofCommissioner of Public Lands). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources House Committee on Capital BudgetSenate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages state land for a number of different pur- poses. Some land must be managed to generate revenue for named beneficiaries. The DNR is also charged withthe responsibility of managing aquatic lands, Natural Area Preserves, and Natural Resource Conservation Areas.State law directs the DNR to manage state lands for multi-ple uses, including recreation, when those uses do not con-flict with the management goal s of the land. Public uses of state land include camp sites, picnic areas, trails, andeducational and scientific research areas. The Board of Natural Resources (Board) has been del- egated the responsibility to di rect the management of state lands that are held in trust fo r identified trust beneficiaries. Beneficiaries of these land trusts include the state's publicschools, higher education instit utions, and counties. Each land trust has a specific beneficiary that financiallybenefits from the land manage ment activities of the DNR. Summary: The DNR is authorized to create and manage the Community Forest Trust (CFT). The CFT must be adiscrete category of non-fiduciary trust lands held by theDNR and actively managed to generate financial supportfor the CFT and to sustain working forest conservationobjectives. The DNR must identify goals for the CFT before iden- tifying lands for inclusion into the CFT. These goals mustinclude the following: protecting in perpetuity working forest lands that are at a significant risk of conversion to another land use; securing financial and social viability through sound management plans and objectives that are consistent with the values of the local community; maintaining the land in a working status; generating revenue at levels that are, at a minimum, capable of reimbursing the DNR for management costs; providing for ongoing, sustainable public recreational access; and providing educational opportunities for local commu- nities regarding the benefits that working forests pro- vide to Washington's economy, communities, environment, and quality of life. The DNR may acquire parc els for the CFT through purchase, gift, donation, grant, transfer, or other means other than eminent domain. If state trust lands are trans-ferred into the CFT, then the va lue of that transfer must be provided to the beneficiaries of the trust. The DNR is required to de velop criteria for identify- ing and prioritizing fo rest land that is suitable for potential inclusion in the CFT. Priority considerations are to begiven to lands that meet cer tain values or conditions. These values and conditions include the active participa- tion of community partners, risk of conversion, bufferingof commercial forest lands from development, and en-hancing the forest products manufacturing infrastructure. The DNR must submit biennially to the Office of Financial Management and th e Legislature a prioritized list that identifies nominated parcels of state land or stateforest land that are suitable fo r transfer into the CFT. The list of nominated parcels mu st reflect consideration of local nominations. Prior to actually acquiring land for aCFT, the DNR must obtain a commitment from the localcommunity to preserve the land as a working forest. This community commitment must be demonstrated by a reim- bursable financial contributio n of at least 50 percent the difference between the parcel's fair market value and itstimber value. Each parcel added to the CFT must beaccompanied by a management plan developed incooperation with a local advisory committee. Revenue produced from CFT lands must first be used to reimburse the DNR for its management costs and for funding the management obje ctives of the land. The Board may, if it chooses, reimburse the state governmentand the local partners with any remaining revenue. Ifreimbursement is provided, it must be provided equally to the state and local partners. In addition to local adviso ry committees for individual parcels, the DNR may establish a statewide advisory com-mittee for the entire CFT progra m. Members to the advi- sory committee are not to be paid or be reimbursed for travel costs. Also discretiona ry to the DNR is the creation of local working forest districts. These districts would beHouse 95 0 Senate 46 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1422 104partnerships with local governments in order to synchro- nize the management of CFT lands with other public andprivate lands located near on e another to accomplish a common set of community goals.

By House Committee on Technology, Energy & Commu- nications (originally spon sored by Representatives Stanford, Orcutt, Chandler, Warnick, Van De Wege,Green, Smith, Jacks, Blake, of Commissioner ofPublic Lands). House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: State Trust Lands . The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) ma nages 5.6 million acres of forest, range, agricultural, aquatic, and commercial lands for the people of Washington. The DNR manages approx- imately 2.3 million acres of forested state trust lands. Under a mix of authorities, including state law, the state Constitution, and the st ate's federal Enabling Act, these state trust lands are he ld by the state for specified trust beneficiaries. In total, there are 18 trust beneficiariesthat derive some level of economic benefit from the man- agement of these trust lands. The beneficiaries includecommon schools, the stat e universities, community colleges, counties, and the state's capital budget. Biomass Energy Pilot Projects . In 2009 legislation was enacted authorizing the DNR to implement biomassenergy pilot projects in eastern and western Washington.The purpose of the pilot proj ects is to demonstrate that removing biomass feedstock in ecologically sustainableways to produce energy (liqui d fuels or heat and electrici- ty) may provide income fo r forest landowners while improving forest health, creatin g rural jobs, reducing wild- fires and greenhouse gas emissions, and aiding in theproduction of renewable energy.In January 2010 the following four biomass projects were selected: Parametrix (Bingen, Washington) is developing a transportable system that uses fast pyrolysis technol- ogy to rapidly convert forest biomass to liquid fuels and bio-char. Borgford Bioenergy, LLC (Colville, Washington) is installing a slow pyroly sis system to generate bio-char, bio-oil, and syngas. Atlas Pellets (Omak, Washington) proposed to pur- chase, install, and operate off-the-shelf debarkers,grinders, and chippers to produce fuel pellets fromforest biomass. Nippon Paper (Port Angeles, Washington) is replac- ing an existing oil-fired bo iler with a high-efficiency biomass boiler and turbine-generator unit at its paper mill, and plans to sell electricity generated by the unit to an electric utility as a renewable energy resources. Long-term Biomass Supply Contracts . In 2010 the DNR was authorized by statute to enter into long-term contracts to supply for est biomass from DNR-managed lands. Under this authoriza tion, the DNR may: (1) con- duct separate sales within valuable materials contracts; (2)enter into long-term competitive contracts of five yearswhich may be renewed up to three times; (3) carry outdirect sales contracts without public auction; (4) offer 15- year contracts for entities making a qualifying capital investment of $50 million; and (5) lease state lands for thepurpose of integrated biom ass supply area and facility siting. Forest Biomass Supply Assessment . Before entering into long-term contracts for forest biomass from state-managed lands, the DNR must first assess the availablesupply of biomass in the cont ract area. In 2010 the DNR received a grant from the Un ited States Forest Service to perform a statewide forest biomass supply assessment.The DNR selected the Univers ity of Washington's School of Forestry to conduct the assessment. The Forest Biomass Supp ly Assessment will assess forest biomass availability and sustainability throughoutWashington on all forest land ownerships, includingstate-owned lands. The Forest Biomass SupplyAssessment is scheduled for completion by August 2011. For these purposes, \"forest biomass\" means the by- products of prescribed or permitted forest managementpractices; forest protection treatments; or forest healthtreatments. \"Forest biomass\" does not include woodpieces that have been ed with chemical preservatives such as: creosote, pentachlo rophenol, or copper-chrome- arsenic; wood old growth forests, except woodremoved for forest health treatments; or municipal solidwaste. Summary: The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Department of Commerce are directed to cooper- ate and consult with the University of Washington (UW)House 55 43Senate 39 10HB 1424 105and Washington State Univers ity in their development of forest biomass to aviation fuel by: identifying opportunities for state lands to generate trust income; identifying how to manage trust lands with potential for contributing to biomass to aviation fuel projects in a manner consistent with any findings by the UW concerning operationally a nd ecologically sustainable feedstock supply; identifying the most cost-effective, efficient, and eco- logically sound techniques to deliver forest biomass from the forest to the production site; addressing and planning to ensure sustainability of forest biomass supply; exploring linkages with other biofuel efforts; identifying any barriers to developing aviation biofuel in Washington; entering into partnerships with research universities and the private sector to conduct a pilot project; collaborating with the federal government, other states, and Canadian provinces; and identifying and applying for funding sources. The DNR must report to the Governor and the Legislature: by December 1, 2011, on activities pertaining to forest biomass to av iation fuel, including expenditures and revenue sources; by December 1, 2011, and December 1, 2012, a summary of research activities, scientific reports, and pilot projects pertaining to forest biomass to aviation fuel by state research ins titutions, including the status of ongoing activities and su mmaries of the findings with their implications for management of forest trust lands; and by December 1, 2011, and December 1, 2012, on the progress of the Forest Practices Board's Forest Bio- mass Policy Work Group consideration of thescience, policy, available technologies, and best management practices related to forest biomass harvest, including final recommendations to the Forest Practices Board. A percentage of the inco me, proportionate to the percent of state resources, derived from the investment of state resources in the developm ent of patents, copyrights, proprietary processes, or licenses developed by the forestbiomass to aviation fuel demonstration project must bedeposited in the State General Fund.

By Representatives Jacks, Haler and Upthegrove; by request of Higher Education Coordinating Board. House Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: Health Professional Loan Repayment and Scholarship Program . The Health Professional Loan Repayment and Scholarship Program (Health Profession-als Program) was created to attract and retain health pro-fessionals to serve in workforce shortage areas inWashington. Students who receive a scholarship or educa-tional loan repayment assistan ce must commit to serve in shortage areas for at least three but no more than fiveyears. The Department of Health (Department), in consulta- tion with the Higher Education Coordinating Board(Board) and the Department of Social and Health Services, is required to determine eligib le health care professions, shortage areas, and annual award amounts for each health profession. Awards are limited to a maximum of fiveyears per individual. The Department also determines thelength of service commitment. For prospective physicians seeking a scholarship, priority is given to those who live in rural areas. Health Professionals Program: Repayment Obliga- tions . Recipients who do not complete their full service commitment must repay twice the amount received fromthe Health Professionals Program in addition to any pay-ments on the principal and interest that are still owing.The interest rate on the conditional scholarship is 8 percentfor the first four years and 10 percent beginning in the fifth year. The interest rate is not addressed for the loan pro- gram. The period for repayment starts no later than ninemonths after completion or discontinuation of study orrequired residency. Participants may be released fromtheir obligations to repay their scholarship or loan if theBoard deems there are circumstances beyond theindividual's control. In the Health Professionals Program there is an 8 per- cent default rate on service contracts and promissory notes by the loan and scholarship recipients. The averageamount owed is just under $22,000 for loan repaymentrecipients who did not meet their service commitments,and just over $28,000 for the conditional scholarshiprecipients who failed to comp lete the required education or meet service commitments. Future Teachers Conditional Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program . Legislation enacted in 2004 modi- fied an existing, but inac tive, conditional scholarship program to target teacher shortage areas. The FutureTeachers Conditional Schola rship and Loan RepaymentHouse 93 1Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)HB 1425 106Program (Future Teachers Program) is designed to encour- age outstanding students and paraprofessionals to becometeachers and to encourage current teachers to obtainadditional endorsements in teac her shortage subjects. The Future Teachers Program is administered by the Board. Recipients agree to teach in an approved educational program in Washington K-12 public schools in return for conditional scholarships or loan repayments. Selectioncriteria emphasize excelle nce and include academic ability, community contribution, bilingual ability, andwillingness to commit to teaching in shortage areas.Priority is given to individuals seeking an additional certi-fication or an additional en dorsement in math, science, technology education, agricult ural education, business and marketing education, family and consumer science educa- tion, or special education. Participants are eligible to receive future teachers scholarships or loan repaymentsfor a maximum of five years. Future Teachers Program: Repayment Obligations . If a conditional scholarship recipien t does not meet his or her service commitment, the recipien t is obliged to repay the scholarship amount plus inte rest and an equalization fee. The repayment amount is prorated depending on theamount of service already pr ovided. The Board sets the minimum payment amount and determines the interestannually. The maximum period for repayment is 10 years.The Board sets terms of paymen t, including interest rates, fees, and deferment, by rule. Summary: Terms for repayment are adjusted for students who do not meet their service obligations for the Health Professional Program or the Future Teachers Program.Repayment terms for the Health Professionals Programare more closely aligned with those for the FutureTeachers Program. For the Health Professionals Program, the Board has the authority to establish the interest rate on repayments. The ability to assess interest is added to the loan repay- ment portion of the Health Professionals Program.Language is added to clarify that the penalty is based on the remaining principal. For the Future Teachers Pr ogram, the Board retains the authority to establish the in terest rate and is no longer required to establish the rate annually. Quarterly interest accrual is removed for both the Health ProfessionalsProgram and the Future Teachers Program. Repayment for the Health Professionals Program is changed to start no later than six months, rather than ninemonths, after completion or discontinuation of study orpostgraduate training. A maximum repayment period forthe Health Professionals Program is set at 10 years. The Board is required to establish an appeals process by rule for both the Health Professionals Program and the Future Teachers Program. A technical correction removes a section regarding eligibility for the Health Professionals Program that wasonly applicable until June 1, 1992. \"Residency training\"is replaced with \"postgraduate training\" to apply toeligible health profession s, not just physicians.

By Representative Haler; by request of Higher Education Coordinating Board. House Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: Health Sciences and Services Authority . Legislation enacted in 2007 authorized the creation of aHealth Sciences and Servi ces Authority (Authority) to promote bioscience-based economic development andadvance new therapies and pr ocedures to combat disease and promote public health. Initially, just a single Author-ity was authorized, and only in a county with a population of less than one million persons. Subsequently, legislation was enacted to allow up to two Authorities in the state,both of which had to be loca ted east of the crest of the Cascade Mountains. An individual local government, or local governments joining together, may establish such an Authority by ordi- nance or resolution. The ordinance or resolution mustspecify the powers of the Au thority, establish an adminis- trative board, clarify the geographic boundaries of theAuthority, and provide investment guidelines. AnAuthority is overseen by a board of not more than 14 members and has all the general powers necessary to carryout its purposes and duties, such as the power to make andexecute agreements and contracts, establish special funds,hire staff, incur general inde btedness, leverage the Author- ity's public funds with mone ys received from other public and private sources, hold funds received by the Authorityin trust, and make grants to entities to promote bioscience-based economic development. The legislative authority of a local jurisdiction that created an Authority prior to January 1, 2010, may imposea sales and use tax of 0.020 percent which is deductedfrom the state's portion of th e sales and use tax collected by the Department of Revenue (DOR). The DOR isrequired to collect the tax on behalf of the Authority. The amounts received by the Auth ority may only be used as specified in the Authority's po wers and duties and to retire indebtedness.House 94 0 Senate 46 0SHB 1431 107To date, there is just a single Authority and it is located in Spokane County. Higher Education Coordinating Board . The Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) has authority to approve or reject applications submitted by local govern-ments for an area's design ation as an Authority. The HECB is also charged with adopting any rules necessary for implementation and given responsibility for develop- ing evaluation and performance measures in order to eval- uate the effectiveness of th e programs in the Authorities that are funded with public resources. The HECB isrequired to report it's evalua tion to the Legislature on a biennial basis beginning December 1, 2009. The HECB isalso tasked with developing evaluation criteria that enable the local governments to measu re the effectiveness of an Authority's programs. Summary: Certain responsibilities of the HECB are removed. The HECB is no longer responsible for devel- oping evaluation and performance measures in order toevaluate the effectiveness of the programs in theAuthorities or for reporting to the Legislature on a biennialbasis. It remains responsible, however, for developing evaluation criteria that enable the local governments to measure the effectiveness of an Authority's program. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1431 C 192 L 11 Addressing financial insolv ency of school districts. By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Ande rson and Haigh). House Committee on EducationHouse Committee on Education Appropriations & Over- sight Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: After experiencing severe financial problems, Vader School Dist rict No. 18 (Vader) was dissolved and annexed to Castle Rock School District No. 401 in 2007. Prior to that event, it had been almost 25 years since the last school consolidation in Washingtontook place. In November of 2009, Jon Molohon, Educational Service District (ESD) 113 Assistant Superintendent forFiscal Services, ESD Fiscal Of ficer, and the Administrator of Vader Binding Conditions published a report titled, The Vader School District Closing In Retrospect (Vader report). Primarily, the Vader report identifies and makesrecommendations to address the lack of a clear legal framework and process for dissol ving a school district forfinancial reasons, including the lack of clear legal author-ity for the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruc-tion (OSPI) or an ESD Region al Committee to determine and manage the myriad financial and practical issues thatsuch an event presents. School District Dissolution . Statutory provisions emphasize voluntary and negotiated reorganization ofschool districts. There are on ly two references to dissolu- tion of a district in statute: 1. School district boundaries may be altered by the dissolution and annexation to an existing district of a part or all of another district. 2. A Regional Committee is required to dissolve any school district that, in the prior year: has an annual enrollment of fewer than five K-8 students; or has not made a reasonable effort to provide the minimum 180-day school year. No statutes provide for dissol ution of a school district in any other fashion or for an y other reason. The dissolu- tion of Vader occurred under the second of the two laws referenced above, but only because the district agreed notto make up some days missed in the prior year due to anemergency closure in order to fall under the provisions ofthis statute. Binding Conditions . School districts must annually submit a budget to the OSPI when expected expenditures for the upcoming school y ear do not exceed expected revenues from all sources. If a school district cannotsubmit a balanced budget, it may petition the OSPI to beallowed to include revenues fro m a future school year (in other words, borrow against future state apportionment payments) only if the district agrees to certain bindingconditions that are intended to improve the district'sfinancial condition. There are nine ESDs in the state. The ESD Financial Officer for the ESD in which the school district is locatedis assigned to be the administrator of the binding condi-tions. The administrator has limited authority and primar- ily serves as a financial consultant to the school district.According to a Joint Legi slative Audit and Review Committee analysis, there have been 12 districts inbinding conditions at some point over the last 10 years.Most have resolved their finances in one to two years. Allbut two of these districts have had fewer than 2,000students. Vader Report Recommendations . The recommenda- tions made in the Vader report can be summarized asfollows: 1. The OSPI or a school district should be authorized to initiate the dissolution of a district due to financial insolvency and the Regional Committee should make the determination and oversee the dissolution. 2. Various financial and legal issues associated with dis- solution should be addre ssed, including determiningHouse 98 0 Senate 48 0HB 1432 108what is the appropriate length of time to permit a dis- trict to solve its own prob lems without outside inter- vention. 3. Technical amendments should be made to other laws dealing with district reorganization and dissolution. Summary: The Superintendent of Public Instruction (Superintendent) is tasked with convening the ESDs for the purpose of analyzing options and making recommen- dations for a clear legal frame work and process for disso- lution of a school district on the basis of financialinsolvency. The analysis must include: a definition of financial insolvency; a timeframe, criteria, and process for initiating dissolution of a district; roles and responsibilitie s of various entities, includ- ing the OSPI, the ESDs, and regional committees on school district organization; and recommendations with re spect to various issues such as terminating staff contract s, liquidation of liabili- ties, and dealing with bonded indebtedness. In conducting the analysis , the ESDs must consult with individuals with legal and financial expertise. The ESDs may recommend a financial early warning systemfor consistent, early identifi cation of school districts with potential fiscal difficulties. The recommendations must address amendments to current law as well as propose new laws as necessary. The Superintendent must submit the final report and recommendations to the Governor and the fiscal committees of the Legislature by January 5, 2012. This act is null and void if not funded in the State Omnibus Operating Appropriations Act.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1432 C 144 L 11 Permitting private employers to exercise a voluntary veterans' preference in employment. By Representatives Rodne, Kelley, Shea, Green, Van De Wege, Ahern and Orwall. House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Both federal and state law provide prefer- ences for honorably discharged veterans in employment in federal, state, and local government. For some publicemployment positions, appli cants must take a competitiveexamination. In those cases, preference is given to veter- ans by adding a percentage to the passing mark, grade, or rating of an examination. Under the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), it is an unfair practice to discriminate inemployment based on age, sex, marital status, sexualorientation, race, creed, colo r, national origin, honorably discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation, the presence of any sensory, me ntal, or physical disability, or the use of a trained guide dog or service animal by aperson with a disability. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate againstany individual because of the individual's race, color,religion, sex, or national origin. The federal law also states that nothing in the la w \"shall be construed to repeal or modify any federal, stat e, territorial, or local law creating special rights or preferences for veterans.\" Summary: The Legislature's intention to establish a per- missive preference in private employment for certain vet-erans is stated. In private, nonpublic employment veteransand their widows or widowers may be preferred for employment. Spouses of honorably discharged veterans with a service-connected permanent and total disabilitymay also be preferred for employment.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1438 C 135 L 11 Concerning the interstate compact for adult offender supervision. By House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness (originally sponsored by RepresentativesKelley and Dammeier). House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Many offenders are subject to some form of supervision once they are released from the Department of Corrections (DOC). While of fenders may be permitted to travel to other states, courts have held that an individual'sconstitutional right to travel is extinguished by a valid con-viction followed by imprison ment, and it remains so while the offender is on parole or probation. The United States Congress has expressly authorized states to enter into compacts or agreements such as the Interstate Compact for Adult Offenders Supervision(Interstate Compact). In 2001, pursuant to Substitute Senate Bill 5118, the Intersta te Compact was enacted into Washington law. The Inte rstate Compact provides a formal means for controlling the interstate movement of offenders who are under the supervision of a memberstate's department of corrections. All 50 states plus PuertoRico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the District ofColumbia are members of the Interstate Compact. Under the Interstate Compact, an Interstate Commis- sion (Commission) was created which establishes uniformprocedures to manage the movement between states ofadults placed under supervision. The Commission has thepower to adopt bylaws governing the management andoperation of the Commission and to make rules which have the force and effect of statutory law. Such rules arebinding upon the states that are members of the InterstateCompact.Pursuant to the Interstate Compact statute enacted in 2001 and the bylaws enacted by the Commission, onceeffective the Interstate Comp act continues in force and remain binding upon the memb er state unless the member state withdraws. Under the Interstate Compact, a memberstate may only withdraw by repealing the statute whichenacted the compact into law. If the Commission determines that any member state has defaulted on any of its ob ligations or responsibilities under the Interstate Compact or its bylaws, it may impose penalties, such as fines, fees, or a suspension, and mayseek judicial action to enforce any penalties. By the end of the year 20 10, the DOC was supervising approximately 2,342 felony offenders on behalf of otherstates under the Interstate Compact, while other stateswere supervising approximately 803 offenders onWashington's behalf. Summary: The Legislature has determined that it is necessary to examine patterns related to the exchange ofout-of-state offenders needing supervision. Following the enactment of this act, at the next meet- ing of the Commission, Washington's representatives onthe Commission must seek a resolution regarding any inequitable distribution of costs, benefits, and obligationsaffecting Washington under the Interstate Compact.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1449 C 23 L 11 E1 Establishing a processing fee for educator certificates. By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representatives Hunter, Haigh, Anderson , Maxwell, Sullivan and Dammeier; by request of Superintendent of PublicInstruction). House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) administers the certification process for educators in Washington. In 2008-09 the certificationoffice within the OSPI processed approximately 38,753certification actions. Tota l certification actions have remained relatively stable over recent years, staying in the range of 38,000 to 40,000 per year. Certification actionsinclude the following types of processing: processing newcertificates, issuing emergenc y substitute certifications, issuing certification renewals, and processing addresschanges. Assuming a $33 pr ocessing fee for each certifi-House 94 4Senate 49 0 House 97 0Senate 48 0SHB 1453 110cation action, the OSPI wo uld generate approximately $1,287,849 each year. The certification system at the OSPI is a paper-based system, and relies on hand-coding of data and use of microfiche to store data. The OSPI spends approximately$855,437 to administer educator certifications. An initial certification fee of $35, as well as other fees for a variety of actions, are levied by the ProfessionalEducator Standards Board (PESB). By statute, thosefunds support precertification training programs, programevaluation, and other professional in-service activities.Proceeds from this fee are split between the PESB and thecollege of education or educational service district fromwhich the action was initiated. Summary: The Superintendent of Public Instruction (Superintendent) may charge a fee for processing initial educator certificates and othe r certification-related activi- ties. The OSPI must set the fee amount through the rule- making process. The fee amount must be set at a levelsufficient \"to defray the costs of administering the educa-tor certification program.\" The Educator Certification Processing Account (Account) is created into which all proceeds from the fee must be deposited. Disbursementsfrom the Account may only be made by the Superinten-dent or a designee, and the Account does not requireappropriation from the Legi slature for expenditure. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 SHB 1453 C 194 L 11 Regarding commercial shellfish enforcement. By House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Rolfes,Chandler, Blake, Van De Wege, Upthegrove, Stanford,Jinkins and Kretz; by request of Department of Health). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Department of Health (DOH) is the state agency responsible for providing licenses tocommercial shellfish operations. Commercial shellfishgrowers must be licensed and must be able to match cer-tificates of compliance with th e state's sanitary standards to shellfish sold or offered fo r sale. The sanitary shellfish standards are established in ru le by the Board of Health. Commercial shellfish may legally be removed only from shellfish beds that have been certified by the DOH as an area that meets all sanitation standards. A personintending to commercially harv est shellfish must apply to the DOH for a certificate for the growing area. Anapproved certificate is valid for 12 months, but is subject to revocation should the sani tation of the area degrade. Shellfish being harvested that are not intended for humanconsumption must also be monitored by the DOH toensure that the shellfish be ing harvested are not diverted for human consumption. Once issued, the DOH can deny, revoke, or modify a license or a certificate of approval if the holder fails orrefuses to comply with all releva nt rules. In the event of a denial or revocation, the affected person is prohibited fromparticipating in any sh ellfish operation. A violation of the sanitary sh ellfish rules is punishable as a gross misdemeanor. The rules are enforceable by bothpersonnel of the DOH and the enforcement personnel ofthe Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife(WDFW). Washington is a participant in the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP), which is a cooperative pro-gram between states and the federal government for the sanitary control of shellfish. The stated purpose of theNSSP is to promote and improv e the sanitation of shellfish moving in interstate commerce through uniformity of stateshellfish programs and regula tions. Components of the NSSP include program guidelin es, growing area classifi- cation and dealer certifica tion programs, and the evalua- tion of state program elements by the United States Foodand Drug Administration. Summary: A specific requirement is added to the state's sanitary shellfish requirements that require an approved shellfish tag or label be affixed to each container of shell-fish prior to removal from the growing area. The approvedtag must meet the requirements of the NSSP model ordi-nance and may be applied in bu lk to mollusks still in their shells. Any shellfish removed from a growing areawithout a tag may be seized by the DOH or the WDFW. The authority to modify a license or certificate of approval is removed from the DOH if a person is foundoperating in violation of the rules governing shellfish pro-duction. However, the DOH may still deny, revoke, or suspend the license or certificate of approval. In addition,a denial, revocation, or suspension may occur should aperson harass or threaten an employee of the DOH. Persons found in violation of shellfish requirements are prohibited from brokering the sale of shellfish or in anyway participating in the shellfis h sales. This is in addition to the prohibition against work ing in shellfish production. Any person found engaging in any of the prohibited activ-ities following a license revocation may be prosecuted fora class C felony and have his or her license revoked for atleast five years.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 50 42 House 52 36 Senate 35 7 (Senate amended)House 50 41 (House concurred) House 96 2Senate 49 0HB 1454 111HB 1454 C 232 L 11 Regarding testing for bloodborne pathogens. By Representatives Van De Wege, Hinkle, Green, Jinkins, Cody, Takko, Hurst, Liias, Hope, Stanford and Overstreet. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Law enforcement officers, firefighters, health care providers, health care facility staff, Depart- ment of Corrections staff, jail staff, and other categories ofemployment that the State Board of Health determines areat risk of substantial exposu re to human immunodeficien- cy virus (HIV) (collectively, \"at-risk employees\"), upon asubstantial exposure to another person's bodily fluids inthe course of their employment, may request a state orlocal health official to orde r testing for HIV upon the per- son to whose bodily fluids they were exposed. If the stateor local health official refu ses, then the at-risk employee may petition the superior cour t for a hearing as to whether or not testing should be ordered. The standard of reviewfor the superior court is whether substantial exposure occurred and whether it presents a possible risk of trans-mission of HIV . If testing is ordered by the state or localhealth officer, the person who is to be tested may alsopetition the superior court, under the same standard ofreview, to have the request for testing denied. Summary: Law enforcement officers , firefighters, health care providers, health care facility staff, Department of Corrections staff, jail staff, and other categories ofemployment that the State Board of Health determines areat risk of substantial exposu re to human immunodeficien- cy virus (HIV) (collectively, \"at-risk employees\") who areeligible to request an order for HIV testing upon a person to whose bodily fluids he or she has been exposed mayalso request a state or local health official to order testingfor bloodborne pathogens. Court orders for the mandatorytesting of an individual for HIV may also include addition- al testing for other bloodborne pathogens. The exceptionto privacy laws regarding th e disclosure of information related to HIV for at-risk employees also applies to thedisclosure of test results for bloodborne pathogens. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011HB 1455 C 193 L 11 Concerning where an individual may petition to restore firearm possession rights. By Representative McCune.House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: A person loses the right to possess a fire- arm if the person is convicted of any felony offense and certain non-felony crimes co mmitted against a family or household member. Involuntary commitment for mentalhealth treatment also results in the loss of the right to pos-sess a firearm. The right to possess may be restored onlyby a court order after the person has met certain eligibilityrequirements. Restoration Following an Involuntary Commitment . A person who has been involuntarily committed formental health treatment may apply for restoration of theright to possess a firearm upon discharge from the com-mitment. The petitioner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is no longer required to partic-ipate in court-ordered treatm ent, is successfully managing the condition related to the commitment, does not present a danger to self or the pub lic, and is not reasonably likely to suffer a recurrence of th e symptoms related to the commitment. A petition for restoration of fi rearm rights lost because of an involuntary commitment may be filed in the superior court that ordered the commitment or where the petitionerresides. Restoration Following a Criminal Conviction . Gener- ally, firearm possession rights lost because of a criminalconviction may be restored if certain conditions are met bythe offender and certain time pe riods have passed. In the case of a conviction for a class A felony or for any sexoffense, however, the right to possess can never beregained. For other offenses, a person may petition a court for restoration if the person is not currently charged with any crime, has no convictions that continue to count ascriminal history under the Sent encing Reform Act, and has spent a specified amount of time in the comm unity without a new conviction, depending on the class of offense. There is no requirement as to where the petition for restoration of firearm rights under this provision must be brought. Summary: A petition for restoration of the right to pos- sess a firearm where the loss of rights was based on a crim-inal conviction must be brough t in the court of record that ordered the petitioner's prohib ition on possession or the superior court in the county in which the petitioner resides. The petition process applicable to restoration of fire- arms following a loss of the right based on an involuntarymental health commitment is amended to provide that the petition must, rather than may, be filed in the superiorHouse 93 0Senate 49 0HB 1465 112court that ordered the commitm ent or the superior court where the petitioner resides. The clerk of the superior court must keep a record of the number of petitions for restoration of the right to possess a firearm and the outcome of the petitions. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1465 C 195 L 11 Modifying conditions and rest rictions for liquor licenses. By Representatives Hunt, Taylor, McCoy, Appleton, Condotta, Miloscia and Dunshee; by request of LiquorControl Board. House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: The Liquor Control Board (Board) issues various types of licenses, in cluding winery, microbrewery, domestic brewery, restaurant, and nightclub licenses. Incertain circumstances, the Board may impose conditionsor restrictions on a license. For example, some grocery stores have a restricted license allowing the sale of onlybeer and table wine, and not strong beer (more than 8 per-cent alcohol by weight) or fortified wine. All conditionsand restrictions the Board imposes must be listed on theface of the license along with the trade name, address, andexpiration date of the license. A licensee must post its license in a conspicuous place on the premises. A spirits, beer, and wine rest aurant license allows the sale of spirits by the drink, be er, and wine. To qualify as a \"restaurant,\" an establishmen t must be approved by the Board and must be maintained in a substantial manner as a place for preparing, cooking, and serving of completemeals. Fry orders and such food as sandwiches,hamburgers, or salads do no t constitute complete meals. A nightclub license also allows the sale of spirits by the drink, beer, and wine. A nightclub is an establishment that provides entertainment and has as its primary source of revenue the sale of alcohol, cover charges, or both, andhas an occupancy load of 100 or more persons. Localgovernments may request the Bo ard to impose restrictions on a nightclub license. Some licensees may sell beer in a sanitary container brought to the premises by the purchaser and filled at thetap at the time of sale (e.g., growlers). Licensees with thisprivilege are: (1) breweries and microbreweries; and (2)beer and wine restaurants, and taverns (those that also holda \"combined\" license). Beer and/or wine specialty shops may sell beer and/or wine for off-premises consumption. With an endorsementfrom the Board, these licensees may also sell kegs. Domestic breweries and microbreweries may act as retailers and sell beer they produce. With a retailerlicense, such as a beer and/or wine restaurant license, adomestic brewery and microbrewery may also sell beerproduced by others. Summary: Conditions and restrictions imposed by the Board are no longer required to be listed on the face of the license and may be included in official correspondence. Any additional corresponde nce with conditions and restrictions must be posted on the premises in addition to the license. The specification that fry orders, and such food as sandwiches, hamburgers, or salads do not constitute \"com-plete meals\" for purposes of qu alifying as a restaurant is removed. Instead, the Boar d must determine requirements for complete meals in rule. The 100 persons or more occupancy load requirement to qualify for a nightclub license is removed. Beer and/or wine specialty shops that exceed 50 per- cent beer and/or wine sales may, with Board approval,receive an endorsement to sell beer in a sanitary containerbrought to the premises by th e purchaser, or provided by the licensee or manufacturer, and filled at the tap at thetime of sale (e.g., growlers). The Board may waive the 50 percent requirement if the beer and/or wine specialty shopmaintains alcohol inventory in excess of $15,000. Domestic breweries and microbreweries may sell beer produced by another domestic brewery or microbreweryfor on- and off-premises consumption as long as the otherbrands do not exceed 25 percent of the brewery ormicrobrewery's offering on-tap of its own brands.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1467 C 196 L 11 Modifying the definition of a well for the purposes of chapter 18.104 RCW.

The Department of Ecology regulates well design, construction, andmaintenance. Wells are defined in the WWCA. Under the WWCA, a well is defined to include water wells, resource protection wells, dewatering wells, andgeotechnical soil borings. A well does not include an excavation made for the purpos e of: obtaining or pros- pecting for oil, natural gas, geothermal resources, miner-als, or products of mining; quarrying; inserting media tore-pressure oil or natural gas bearing formations; orstoring petroleum, natural gas, or other products. Summary: The definition of a well, as defined in the WWCA, is modified to exem pt the following types of excavation from the definition: siting and constructing an on-site sewage disposal system or a large on-site sewage system; or inserting any device or instrument less than 10 feet in depth into the soil for the sole purpose of performing soil or water testing or analysis or establishing soil moisture content as long as there is no withdrawal of water in any quantity ot her than as necessary to perform the intended testing or analysis.

By Representatives Parker, Hurst, Ormsby and Billig. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: In Washington, individuals may defer one moving and one non-moving traffic violation every seven years. As a condition of this deferral, a court may imposesuch conditions as the court fi nds appropriate, which often includes attendance at a dr iver improvement school or traffic school. If the individual meets all of the requiredconditions and has not committ ed another infraction, the court may dismiss the infraction at the end of the deferralperiod. With certain limited exceptions, the Washington Supreme Court prescribes the schedule of monetarypenalties for traffic infractions . Infraction Rule for Courts of Limited Jurisdictions 6.2 contains this schedule ofmonetary penalties and prescribes a base penalty of $42for unscheduled infractions, which increases to $124 when various penalties and assessments are added to the baseamount.Summary: The fees collected for attending a trafficschool provided by a city, town, or county that are inexcess of the cost of providing the traffic school may beused for the following activities: safe driver education materials and programs; safe driver education promotions and advertising; and costs associated with the training of law enforcement officers. A traffic school established by a city, town, or county may not charge a fee in excess of the penalty for an unscheduled traffic infraction established by theWashington Supreme Court, wh ich is defined to include all assessments and other costs that are required by statute or rule to be added to the base penalty.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1477 C 136 L 11 Authorizing the board of trus tees at Eastern Washington University to offer edu cational specialist degrees. By Representatives Schmic k, Sells, Springer, Haler, Roberts and Kenney. House Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: One of the primary purposes of regional universities is to offer undergraduate and graduate educa-tion programs through the master's degree. The regionaluniversities are specifically au thorized by law to grant any degree through the master's degree to any student who hascompleted a program of study in those areas which aredetermined by the faculty and the board of trustees of theinstitution to be appropria te for the granting of such degree. Before being offered, all degree programs are also subject to the review and appr oval of the Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB). In 2001 legislation was enacted authorizing Eastern Washington University (EWU) to offer applied, but not research, doctorate level de grees in physical therapy, subject to review and approval by the HECB. This is the only graduate degree above a master's that a regional university has been authorized to offer. An educational specialist degree (ED.S.) is an advanced degree for people who already have a master'sdegree with a teaching or educational focus.

By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Springer, Asay, Takko, Haler, Probst, Jacks, Johnsonand Kenney). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Growth Management Act . The Growth Management Act (GMA) is th e comprehensive land use planning framework for counties and cities in Washington.Originally enacted in 1990 and 1991, the GMA establishes land use designation and environmental protectionrequirements for all Washingt on counties and cities, and a significantly wider array of planning duties for the 29 counties, and the cities within those counties, that areobligated to satisfy all requirements of the GMA. The GMA directs jurisdictions that fully plan under the GMA to adopt internally consistent comprehensive land use plans that are generalized, coordinated land usepolicy statements of the governing body. Comprehensiveplans are implemented throug h locally adopted develop- ment regulations, both of which are subject to review andrevision requirements. With limited exceptions, fully-planning jurisdictions must review and, if needed, revisetheir plans and development re gulations every seven years according to a schedule set forth in the GMA. The GMA includes numerous requirements relating to the use or development of land in urban and rural areas.Among other requirements, counties that fully plan underthe GMA (planning counties) must designate urban growth areas (UGAs) or areas within which urban growthmust be encouraged and outs ide of which growth may oc- cur only if it is not urban in nature. Planning counties and the cities within these countie s must include within their UGAs areas and densities that are sufficient to permit theurban growth projected to occu r in the county or city for the succeeding 20-year period.Each county that designates UGAs must review, at least every 10 years, its d esignated UGAs, and the associ- ated permitted densi ties in the incorporated and unincor- porated portions of each UGA. In conjunction with thiscounty review, each city located within a UGA mustreview the densities permitted within its boundaries, and the extent to which the urban growth occurring within the county has located w ithin each city and the unincorporated portions of the UGAs. The GMA requires six western Washington counties (Clark, King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, and Thurstoncounties) and the cities within those counties to establish a review and evaluation \"buildab le lands\" program. The purpose of the program is to determine whether a countyand it's cities are achieving urban densities and to identifyreasonable measures, subject to statutory provisions, that will be taken to comply with GMA requirements. Evaluations must be completed every five years. Publicly Owned Vehicles and Fuel Usage . By June 1, 2015, to the extent determin ed practical by rules adopted by the Department of Commerce (Commerce), all stateagencies and local government subdivisions of the state must satisfy 100 percent of th eir fuel usage for operating publicly owned vessels, vehicles, and construction equip-ment from electricity or biof uel. Although the Commerce was required to adopt rules by June 1, 2010, to define prac-ticability and clarify how stat e agencies and local govern- ments would be evaluated in determining whether they had met this objective, th e agency has not done so. Transitional Housing Operating and Rent Program . The Transitional Housing Op erating and Rent Program (THOR Program) assists indi viduals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless with rentalassistance, housing-related case management services,and other actions. The Commerce is charged with admin-istering the THOR Program an d providing grants to orga- nizations, including counties and cities, who serve eligibleand participating persons. By law, organizations thatreceive more than $500,000 from the THOR Program andother specified sources must apply to the Washington StateQuality Award Program once every three years for anindependent assessment of its quality management,accountability, and performance systems. Preservation Rating Reports . In 2003, finding that the state's investment in its transportation infrastructure repre-sented public assets worth over $100 billion but that many of these facilities were in po or condition, Senate Bill (SB) 5248 was enacted to create stronger accountability toensure that cost-effective maintenance and preservation isprovided for transportation facilities. other man-dates, for the 2003-2005 biennium, SB 5248 requiredcities and towns to provide to the Washington State Trans- portation Commission preserv ation rating information on at least 70 percent of the tota l city and town arterial net- work. After the 2003-2005 biennium, the preservation rat-ing reporting requirement increased at a rate of 5 percentper biennium. According to the Washington StateHouse 96 0Senate 49 0ESHB 1478 115Department of Transportation, the requirement is for 85 percent of the total city and town arterial network. Impact Fees . Counties, cities, and towns that fully plan under the GMA may impose impact fees on develop- ment activity as part of the financing for public facilities.Impact fees: may be imposed only fo r system improvements that are reasonably related to the new development; may not exceed a proportionate share of the system improvements; and must be used for syst em improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development. Impact fees must be expended or encumbered within six years of receipt, unless there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for fees to be held for a longerperiod of time. If, absent such a reason, the county or cityfails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six years, the current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund. Provisions for school impact fees generally authorize the funds to be expended or encumbered within 10 yearsof receipt. Annexation Sales and Use Tax . A city in a county with more than 600,000 persons that annexes an area mayimpose an annexation sales and use tax for qualifyingannexations. The tax is credited against the sales tax, so it is not an additional tax to a consumer. All revenue fromthe tax must be used to pr ovide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area. The revenuesmay not exceed the difference between that which the city deems necessary to provide services for the annexationarea and the general revenue received from theannexation. With limited exceptions, the rate of the tax is 0.1 per- cent for each annexed area with a population greater than10,000, but less than 20,000, and 0.2 percent for anannexed area over 20,000 persons. Effective July 1, 2011,the maximum rate of tax a city may impose under annex-ation sales and use tax provisions is 0.85 percent for anannexed area in which the population is greater than 18,000. To qualify for this maximum rate, the annexedarea also must have been officially designated as a poten-tial annexation area by more th an one city, one of which has a population of at least 400,000 persons. Reclaimed Water and Greywater . By December 31, 2010, and in coordination with the Department of Healthand an advisory committee comp osed of stakeholders that utilize or are potentially impact ed by the use of reclaimed water, the Department of Ecology (DOE) must adopt rulesaddressing all aspects of re claimed water use, including the following: commercial and industrial uses; land applications; direct groundwater recharge; wetland discharge; surface percolation; constructed wetlands; and streamflow or surface water augmentation. National Pollutant Dischar ge Elimination System Permits . The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) sets effluent limitations for discharges of pollutants. \"Pollutant\" is defined in the CWA to include a variety of materials that may be discharged into water through human activities,construction or industrial processes, or other methods. The DOE is the delegated fe deral CWA authority by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The DOE also is the agency authorized by state law toimplement state wate r quality programs. The CWA establishes the National Pollutant Dis- charge Elimination System (NPDES) permit system to regulate wastewater discharges from point sources to sur-face waters. \"Point sources\" are defined generally as dis-cernable, discrete, and confined conveyances from whichpollutant discharges can or do occur. The NPDES permits are required for anyone who discharges wastewater to sur- face waters or who has a si gnificant potential to impact surface waters. The NPDES permits also are required forstorm water discharges from certain industries, construc- tion sites of specified sizes, and municipalities operating municipal separate storm sewer systems that meet specified criteria. The federal CWA and implementing EPA storm water regulations established two phases for the NPDES permitsto control storm water discharges from certain industriesand construction sites, and from municipalities operating municipal separate storm sewer systems. The DOE rules limit the terms of the NPDES permits to five years. A permit holder must apply for a replace-ment permit at least 180 days prior to the expiration of itsexisting permit. Shoreline Management Program . The Shoreline Man- agement Act (SMA) involves a cooperative regulatory approach between local governments and the state. TheDOE and local governments are authorized to adopt nec-essary and appropriate rules for implementing the provi-sions of the SMA. At the local level, SMA regulations aredeveloped in local shoreline master programs (master pro-grams). All counties and cities with shorelines of the stateare required to adopt master programs that regulate landuse activities in shoreline areas of the state. A master program, or a segment thereof, becomes effective when approved by the DOE. In accordance with a schedule established in the SMA, counties and citiesmust develop or amend mast er programs every seven years. Summary: Growth Management Act . The comprehen- sive plan review and revision schedule of the Growth Management Act is modified to require counties and cities to take such action every eigh t years, rather than every seven years, and to reallocate review and revision years forsome jurisdictions.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representative Pearson). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: A notice of a traffic infraction is a determi- nation that a person has comm itted the traffic infraction, and the determination is fina l unless the person contests the infraction. A person who receives a notice of a traffic infraction may either pay the fine or request a hearing tocontest the notice. If the person fails to pay the fine or fails to appear at a requested h earing, the court will enter an order assessing the monetary penalty for the traffic infrac- tion. Monetary penalties impo sed by the court for traffic infractions are payable immediat ely. If payment is still not made within the granted time, the court must notify theDepartment of Licensing (DOL), and the DOL must sus-pend the person's driver's lic ense until the penalty is paid.If a court determines, in its discretion, that a person is unable to pay immediately, th e court must enter into a pay- ment plan with the person if less than a year has passedsince the infraction became due. If the person has previ-ously been granted a payment plan for the same fine or ifthe person is in noncomplianc e with any previous or exist- ing payment plan, the court has the discretion to enter intoa payment plan with the person. If a court administers apayment plan, the fee for the plan may not be more than the lesser of $10 per infraction or $25 per payment plan.A court may contract with outside entities to administer the payment plan. If a person fails to comply with the payment plan, the court must notify the DOL, and the DOL must suspend theperson's driver's license. If a community restitution pro-gram is available in the juri sdiction, the court may substi- tute community restitution for a ll or part of the amount due for the fine. Summary: A form for a notice of traffic infraction print- ed after the effective date of the act must include a state- ment that the person may be able to enter into a payment plan with the court.

By House Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Representatives Rodne, Kirby, Pedersen, Johnson and Kelley; by request of Secretary of State). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Pro- tection Background: Under the Charitable Solicitations Act (CSA), charitable organizations and commercial fund rais-ers that solicit contributions from the public must first reg- ister with the Office of the Secretary of State (OSOS)before conducting any solicita tions. Registration under the CSA is effective for one year or longer, as establishedby the OSOS. The Secretary of the OSOS (Secretary)must send notices to renew registrations to the entities bymail. Certain entities are not considered charitable organi- zations, such as churches, political organizations, andentities that are strictly volunteer-run and raise less than$25,000 in any accounting ye ar. However, those entities exempt from registering must still comply with certainrequirements when maki ng charitable solicitations. The CSA includes disclosure requirements and pro- hibits certain kinds of representations during solicitations.House 97 0Senate 44 3 (Senate amended)House 94 98 0Senate 48 0HB 1488 118The OSOS makes certain information, such as financial disclosures, about charitable or ganizations available to the public. The Secretary may establish a tiered requirementfor financial reporting based on the charitableorganization's revenues. The CSA provides additiona l requirements for com- mercial fundraisers, which are entities that are paid tosolicit funds on behalf of a charity. Certain commercial fundraisers must execute sure ty bonds equal to no less than $15,000. The Secretary may, by rule, reduce theamount of the bond required. Commercial fundraisersmay subcontract with other commercial fundraisers. Theprimary commercial fundraiser must register with the OSOS and must disclose the name of any subcontractingentity that will receive more than 10 percent of the total anticipated fundraising costs. Summary: Various sections of the CSA are reorganized for clarity and readability. Certain terms are changed for consistency. Terms, such as \"gross revenue,\" are defined and other amendments to the CSA are made. Registration . An entity is considered registered 20 days after receipt of the registration form and may com-mence soliciting contributions from the public. V olunteer- run charitable organizations raising less than $50,000 inany accounting year are exem pt from regist ration require- ments.

Charitable organizations that are required to file cert ain federal tax forms do not have to file a copy of the ta x form with the OSOS if the form is available for public inspection under federal tax law. A commercial fundraiser must disclose whether it is using a subcontractor, regardless of whether the subcon-tractor is expected to receive a certain percentage of theanticipated fundraising costs. It is made explicit that Social Security numbers and financial account numbersare not public information. Secretary's Discretion . The Secretary is given discre- tion to: (1) send renewal or other notices electronically; (2) set the principal amount of the surety bond required ofcertain commercial fundraiser s; and (3) establish how long registrations are effective. In-person Collections .

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1489 PARTIAL VETO C 73 L 11 Protecting water quality through restrictions on fertilizer containing phosphorus. By House Committee on Envi ronment (originally Darneille, Clibborn, Jacks and Kenney). House Committee on Environment Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Only commercial fertilizer that has been registered with the Washington State Department of Agri-culture (WSDA) may be distribu ted. Registering with the WSDA includes the creation of a label for each product.Most packaged commercial fertilizers must have, placedon or affixed to the package, a conspicuous label stating in a clear, legible form the product name, the net weight, thebrand, and the grade. Both the registration form submitted to the WSDA and label must identify if the products are waste-derived fertilizers, micronutrient fertilizers, orfertilizer materials containing phosphate. It is unlawful to distri bute misbranded commercial fertilizer. Summary: The sale and application to turf of turf fertil- izer that is labeled as containing phosphorus is prohibited. These prohibitions do not apply if the fertilizer is beingused to establish or repair grass during a growing season,for adding phosphorus to soils with deficient plant-avail-able phosphorus levels, or for application to pasture lands,houseplants, flower or vegeta ble gardens, or agricultural or silvicultural lands. Retailers may not display turf fertilizers labeled as containing phosphorus unless the product is also labeledfor one of the permitted uses. Retailers may continue to display otherwise prohibited turf fertilizers that were instock prior to 2012. Local governments are prohibited from adopting less restrictive ordinances on the use of phosphorous-containing fertilizer.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2013 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that exempted violations of th e prohibitions on the use and sale of certain fertilizers from civil enforcement by the WSDA. VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1489 April 14, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 4, Engrossed Substitute Hous e Bill 1489 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to protecting wa ter quality through restrictions on fertili zer containing phosphorus.\" This bill limits the use, sale, and retail display of turf fertilizer that contains phosphorus , as of January 1, 2013. Section 4 would prevent the Depar tment of Agriculture from en- forcing the bill through the issuanc e of civil penalties. Without this tool, the Department would be unabl e to effectively implement the bill. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 4 of E ngrossed Substitute House Bill 1489. It is unfortunate that the final bi ll did not include the exemption for fertilizers made from bios olids, manure and other organic ma- terials. These products provide a valued and beneficial use of ma- terials that would otherwise need to be managed as waste. Since the bill is not effective until January 2013, I would entertain legis- lation in 2012 to exempt these organic products from the limits established in the bill. With the exception of Section 4, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1489 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O.

By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Pedersen and Rodne; by request of Uniform Laws Commission). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), organized into 11 articles, is a model code drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform StateLaws (NCCUSL) for the purpos e of providing a consistent and integrated framework of rules to deal with commercialtransactions. All 50 states have adopted the UCC. Article 9 of the UCC governs the creation and opera- tion of security interests in various types of personal prop-erty and fixtures. A security interest is the interest of a creditor in property of a debt or used to secure payment of a debt. Article 9 provides methods of creating a securityinterest and the manner in whic h a security interest may be \"perfected.\" Perfection of a se curity interest is the means by which a secured creditor ob tains priority over other creditors who have a security interest in the same collater- al. There are different mech anisms for perfecting a secu- rity interest depending on th e type of collateral involved. One common method of perfection is by the filing of afinancing statement that indicates the debtor, the securedparty, and the property subj ect to the security interest. Article 9 also provides remedies and procedures in theevent that a debtor defau lts on an obligation. In 1998 the NCCUSL adopted revised Article 9, which was a substantial overhaul and expansion of thearticle. Washington enacted revised Article 9 in 2000,which is codified in state law as Article 9A. Last year, the NCCUSL adopted amendments to revised Article 9 andrecommends that states adop t the amendments effective July 1, 2013. According to comments from the NCCUSL,the purpose of these latest amendments to Article 9 are toclarify areas of ambiguity, address problems that havearisen since adoption of the revised Article 9, and correcterrors and conform provisions of the article to amend-ments to other articles of the UCC. In addition to amend- ments to some provisions of the official text of Article 9,the NCCUSL adopted revisions to the Official Comments for many provisions of Article 9 without amending theunderlying text. Summary: Article 9A of the UCC is amended to incor- porate the 2010 amendments to Article 9 adopted by the NCCUSL. The amendments address various aspects of the article. Control of Electronic Chattel Paper . A general test for control of electronic chattel paper is established. Asecured party has control of electronic chattel paper if asystem employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the chattel paper reliably esta blishes the secured party as the person to which the chattel paper was assigned. Thetest for control under current law is designated as a suffi-cient, but not necessary, mean s of establishing control of electronic chattel paper. Perfection of Secu rity Interests . Rules are established regarding the perfection of s ecurity interests that attach within four months after the debtor changes its location toa new jurisdiction. In addition, rules are established gov-erning security interests that a ttach within four months af- ter a new debtor (a successor) becomes bound by asecurity agreement entered into by an original debtor, and the priority contests that may arise when both the original debtor and the successor each have a secured creditor. Sufficiency of Debtor's Name . Standards regarding the sufficiency of a debtor's name on a financing statementare revised. With respect to an individual, the name of the debtor is sufficient if the financin g statement provides the indi- vidual name of the debtor, the surname and first personalname of the debtor, or the name of the individual indicatedon an unexpired Washington driver's license oridentification card. With respect to registered organizations, the name on the financing statement is suffic ient if it is the name of the registered organization stated on the most recent public organic record filed with or issued by the registeredorganization's jurisdiction of organization. With respect to collateral being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, the financing state-ment sufficiently provides th e name of the debtor if it provides the name of the decedent as the debtor and alsoindicates that the collateral is being administered by apersonal representative. With respect to collateral held in a trust that is not a registered organization, the financing statement must indi-cate the name specified in the organic record of the trustand that the collateral is held in trust. Where the organicrecord does not specify a name the financing statementmust indicate the name of th e settler or testator, additional information sufficient to di stinguish the trust from other trusts that may have the same settlers or testator, and anindication that the collateral is held in a trust. Other Changes . Other changes made by the amend- ments include: removing so me types of additional infor- mation that must be include d in a financing statement; allowing a secured party of record to file an informationstatement with the filing office in response to another filed record relating to the financ ing statement; providing addi- tional rules regarding the enfo rceability of contractual pro- visions restricting the assignment of receivables; andproviding that when collateral consists of a mortgage note, there must be a default in the obligation that secures theSHB 1493 121mortgage before the secured party may exercise any right the debtor has to non-judicially foreclose the mortgage. Definitions of the terms modified. Conformi ng amendments are made to the statutory forms for the in itial financing statement and the amendment form. Various other clarifying and con-forming amendments are made , and rules for transition to the amended provisions of the article are provided. Changes Not Included in the Model Act . The defini- tion of \"person related to\" is amended to include state-reg- istered domestic partners and persons who are related bylaw. The Code Reviser is directed to number sections and subsections in Article 9A cons istently with the numbering system used by the NCCUSL for UCC Article 9. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2013 SHB 1493 C 157 L 11 Providing greater transparency to the health professions disciplinary process. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Pedersen, Bailey,Kagi, Clibborn, Ryu, Jinkins, Hinkle, Moeller, Van DeWege, Roberts, Stanford and Kenney). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Overview of the Health Professions Disci- plinary Process . Credentialed health care providers are subject to professional discipline under the UniformDisciplinary Act (UDA). Under the UDA, the discipliningauthority may take action against a provider for a varietyof reasons, including unprofessional conduct, unlicensedpractice, and the mental or physical inability to practice skillfully or safely. The Department of Health is the disci-plining authority for many pr oviders, and various boards and commissions are the disci plining authority for the remainder. The UDA allows (and in some cases requires) individ- uals and organizations to file reports or complaints abouthealth care providers. On ce a disciplining authority receives a complaint, it ma kes a threshold determination as to whether the conduct in the complaint constitutes a violation of the law and whether the disciplining authorityhas the legal authority to take action. If a complaint does not meet this threshold, it is closed. If it does, the disciplining authority conduc ts an investigation. After the investigation, if the evidence supports the complaint, the disciplining authority may institute disci-plinary proceedings against the provider. Disciplinaryproceedings may be resolved in a variety of ways, includ-ing a formal hearing (pursu ant to the Administrative Procedures Act) or a stipulated agreement. Disclosure of Documents Related to Disciplinary Proceedings . A complaint submitted to a disciplining authority is exempt from pub lic disclosure until a determi- nation of whether to invest igate is made. Complaints determined to warrant no cau se of action after an investi- gation must include an explana tion of the decision to close the complaint. Disciplinary files are generally open to public inspection and copying, except for certain informa- tion such as patient information and the name, address,and Social Security nu mber of the provider. Notifications to Complainants . A disciplining author- ity must provide notification to a complainant in several stages of a disciplinary proceeding. For example, the dis-ciplining authority must prov ide a complainant with notice as soon as the initial assessmen t of the complaint is com- plete. Also, the disciplining authority must report theissuance of statements of char ges and final orders to the complainant. Summary: A disciplining authority must: provide a complainant with a reasonable opportunity to supplement or amend the contents of the complaint and must allow the license holder to respond; promptly respond to inquir ies as to the status of the complaint; and provide the complainant or the license holder, follow- ing the investigation or clos ure of the complaint, with a copy of the file relating to the complaint upon request, including any resp onse submitted by the sub- ject of the complaint. Provision of the file is subject to the Public Records Act. The disciplining authority may not disclose any confidential or privileged infor-mation or any information ex empt from public disclo- sure. The complainant or license holder may becharged a fee for copying the file. Prior to any final decision in any disciplinary proceed- ing, the disciplining authority must provide the complain- ant or his or her representative an opportunity to be heard through an oral or written impa ct statement. If the license holder who is the subject of the proceeding is not presentat the proceeding, the discip lining authority must transmit the impact statement to him or her. The license holder must certify to the disciplining authority that he or she has received and read it. The disciplining authority must inform the complain- ant and the license holder in writing of the final disposition of the complaint. If the comp laint was closed prior to a statement of charges or allegations being filed, the com-plainant may, within 30 days of receiving the notice offinal disposition, make a reques t for reconsideration on theHouse 96 1Senate 49 0ESHB 1494 122basis of new information. With in 30 days of receiving the request for reconsideration, the disciplining authority must notify the license holder of the request and provide the license holder with 30 days to respond. The disciplining authority must notify the complainant and the license holder in writing of its final decision on the request for reconsideration, including an explanation of the reasoningbehind the decision. A request for reconsideration mayonly be made once.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1494 C 357 L 11 Concerning vulnerable adult referral agencies.

A disclosure statement must include: the name and contact information of the referral agency; the name of the client; the amount of the fee to be received from the client or, if the fee is received from the provider, the method of computing the fee, an d the time and method of payment; a description of the services that the referral agency generally provides and those to be provided specifi- cally to the client; a provision that the re ferral agency may not request clients to sign waivers of potential liability; a provision that the referral agency works with both the client and the provider and that the client's autho- rization will be needed to disclose confidential health information; a statement regarding the frequency of agency tours of provider facilities and the most recent date of touring a provider that is the subject of a referral; a provision that the client may discontinue the relationship with the referral agency at any time; an explanation of the agency's refund policy; a statement that the client may file a complaint with the Office of the A ttorney General; and if the agency, its employees, or immediate family members have a financial interest with a provider towhich the client is bein g referred, a statement explaining that interest. Intake Forms . Referral agencies must use a standard- ized intake form for each vuln erable adult. Information gathered in the intake form is covered by state health care information confidentiality la ws. The intake form must include at least the following information: recent medical history as relevant to the referral process; known medications and medication management needs; known diagnoses, health concerns, and the reason for seeking supportive housing or care services; behaviors or symptoms that may cause concern or require special care; mental illness, dementia, or developmental disabili- ties; assistance needed for daily living; cultural or language access needs and accommoda- tions; activity preferences; sleeping habits; understanding of the clients financial situation and existence of long-term care insurance and financialassistance; the client's current living situation; geographic location preferences; and preferences regarding ot her issues that are important to the client. Referral Process . The referral agency must provide a referral to a client by either giving the names of specific providers who may meet the vulnerable adult's needs or submitting the name of the client to the provider. Before a referral agency makes a referra l to a provider, the referral agency must obtain informatio n from the provider includ- ing the type of license held by the provider; the provider's authority to care for indi viduals with mental illness, dementia, or developmenta l disabilities; accepted pay- ment sources; level of medi cation management services and personal care services provided; cultural accommoda- tions; primary languages sp oken; activities provided; behavioral conditions that cannot be met; and food prefer- ence accommodations. In ad dition, within 30 days ofSHB 1495 124making a referral, the referral agency must also search the Department of Social and Health Services' website and the Department of Health's website to determine the existence of any enforcement actions against the provider. Exclusions . The regulations for referral agencies do not apply to: home health or hospice agencies providingcounseling to patients on placement options; government entities providing information and assistance to vulnerable adults; professional guardians; providers who make refer-rals to other providers with out charge; social workers, discharge planners or other social service workers helpingvulnerable adults in their re gular employment activities; or persons providing information to another person. Work Groups . The Department of Licensing is required to convene a work group of stakeholders to deter-mine the feasibility of establishing a licensing program forelder and vulnerable adult referral agencies and providerecommendations to the Legisl ature by December 1, 2011. By January 1, 2012, the Department of Social and Health Services and the Department of Health mustconvene a work group of stakeh olders to collaborate in the development of a uniform standard for elder and vulnera-ble adult referral agencies to collect information regarding the enforcement status of providers.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012 SHB 1495 C 98 L 11 Regarding the unfair competition that occurs when stolen or misappropriated informa tion technology is used to manufacture products sold or offered for sale in this state. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy, Rodne, Kirby, Armstrong, Hunter, Hinkle, Chandler, Pettigrew, Carlyle, Springer,Maxwell, Anderson, Clibborn, Kelley and Kenney). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Intellectual Property . Federal and state laws protect certain intellectual property rights increations, such as computer so ftware (programs) and hard- ware (equipment). A federa l copyright gives the owner of an original work that expre sses ideas, such as certain soft- ware, exclusive rights to copy, distribute, and adapt thework. A federal patent may protect a publicly disclosedcomputer-related invention for a period of time. Federaland state trade secret laws prohibit misappropriation oftrade secrets, such as formulas, programs, and techniques.Consumer Protection Act . The state's Consumer Protection Act (CPA) prohibits unfair or deceptive acts orpractices and unfair methods of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce that directly or indirectly affect thepeople of Washington. Either private plaintiffs or the Attorney General may bring civil actions to enjoin future violations of the CPA orto recover damages caused by an unfair act. Private plain- tiffs may recover actual damages and costs, includingreasonable attorneys' fees. Courts also may award privateplaintiffs damages of as much as three times actualdamages, in an amount not to exceed $25,000. \"Personal\" vs. \"In Rem\" Jurisdiction . In order for a court to hear and determine a controversy, it must havejurisdiction over the matter. Often, courts have \"personal\" jurisdiction over a person sued in a civil lawsuit because the person made certain minimum contacts with the state;for purposes of the CPA, this includes transacting business within Washington. Foreign defendants whose ac tions give rise to a law- suit in a Washington court but who have never visited thestate and who have no assets within Washington might notbe subject to personal jurisd iction. Yet state courts may have jurisdiction to enter judgment regarding property located within the state, even if the courts do not have per- sonal jurisdiction over that defendant. Such actions against property are called proceedings \"in rem.\" Summary: A business that manufactures a product while using stolen or misappropriated information technology(\"stolen IT\") in its business operations engages in anunfair act when the product is sold in Washington, eitherseparately or as a component of another product, in com-petition with a product made w ithout using stolen IT. A new cause of action is created to allow private plaintiffs orthe Attorney General to su e businesses that engage in these unfair acts. \"Stolen or misappropriated\" IT is defined as hardware or software that a business acquired, appropriated, or usedunlawfully, unless the hardware or software was not avail- able for stand-alone retail purchase at or before the time itwas stolen. A business uses stol en IT in a business opera- tion if it uses the stolen IT to design, manufacture,distribute, market, or sell products. Notice . Before a plaintiff can file suit, the owners of the stolen IT must provid e written notice to the person allegedly using the stolen IT allowing that person to proveit is not using stolen IT or giving the person 90 days to stopusing it, subject to any extens ions approved by the owner. The notice must state: (1) th e identity of the IT; (2) the identity of the lawful owner; (3) the law allegedly violatedand that the notifier reasona bly believes the person has acquired, appropriated, or used the IT unlawfully; (4) the manner in which the IT is be ing used, if known; (5) the products to which the IT relates; and (6) the basis andevidence supportin g the allegation.House 53 43Senate 32 60 37 (House concurred)SHB 1495 125Jurisdiction . A court may proceed in rem against certain products only when a court is unable to obtain personal jurisdiction over a party who violated the act. Elements of a Claim . A person is injured by the sale of a product if the person establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the person: manufactures products sold or offered for sale in Washington in competition with articles or products made using stolen IT; makes articles or products not manufactured using stolen IT; and suffered economic harm, which may be shown by evidence that the retail price of the stolen IT was at least $20,000. Remedy . If the use of stolen IT continues despite the owner of the stolen IT providing the 90 days' notice, an injured person or the Attorn ey General may bring an ac- tion against a person making products using stolen IT toask the court to enjoin viola tions of the act's provisions, including ordering a person not to sell products inWashington. A plaintiff also may ask for the greater ofactual damages or an amount of no more than three timesthe retail price of the stolen IT. A court may award three times the damages normally allowed when it finds that the defendant willfully used stolen IT. A court also may award costs and reasonableattorneys' fees to the preva iling party in actions brought by an injured person. In addition, the plaintiff ma y add to the action a claim for actual damages against a third party who sells the prod-ucts made with stolen IT, bu t only if a court has already entered judgment against the person making the productsusing stolen IT and: the third party seller received a copy of the written notice at least 90 days before entry of the judgment; the person who made the products in violation of the act did not make an appearance or lacks sufficient attachable assets to satisfy a judgment against him or her; such a person either made the final product or a com- ponent of it equal to 30 percent or more of the product's final value; and the person has a direct contractual relationship with the third party seller. Damages against a third party must be the lesser of the retail price of the stolen IT or $250,000. Before a plaintiff may seek to enjoin products or have a court proceed in rem, he or she must show economic injury, defined as a 3 percent price difference, occurring over a four-month period, between the product made inviolation of the act designed to harm competition and a product that was manufactured without the use of stolenIT.If a court determines that a person who violated the act's provisions lacks sufficient attachable assets inWashington, the court may en join sale of products made using stolen IT, subject to certain exceptions. Exceptions . A person may not sue under this cause of action when: (1) the end produ ct sold or offered for sale in Washington is copyrightabl e; (2) the product consists of merchandise made by or for a copyright owner displayingelements of copyrighted work or of certain materials; (3)the allegation that the IT is st olen is based on a claim that the IT infringes on patents or misappropriates tradesecrets; or (4) the allegation is based on a claim that the useof the IT violates the terms of an open source softwarelicense. A person may avoid liabilit y by proving by a prepon- derance of the evidence that: (1) the person is an end con-sumer or user or acquired the product after sale to an endconsumer or user; (2) the pers on is a business with annual revenues of no more than $50 million; or (3) the persondoes not have a contractual relationship with the alleged violator. A third party may avoid liability by showing that it acquired the products in good faith reliance on a code ofconduct governing its manufa cturers or on written assur- ances from a manufacturer, or pursuant to an agreementwith a manufacturer entered into no later than 180 days after the act's effective date. The code of conduct or assur-ances must contain certain provisions to, for example, en-sure that commercially reasona ble efforts will be taken to confirm the manufacturer is not using stolen IT or to re-quire the manufacturer to cease any theft. If the third partyrelies on an agreem ent with a manufacturer, the third party also must make these commercially reasonable effortsto require the manufacturer to cease theft or to stop acqui-sition from that manufacturer. As an alternative, a thirdparty may avoid liability by showing that it made com- mercially reasonable effort s to implement practices and procedures to require direct manufacturers not to use sto-len IT. A third party may satisfy this by adopting a codeof conduct that prohibits use of stolen IT subject to auditrights or adopting a code of conduct that prohibits use ofstolen IT and undertaking procedures to addresscompliance with that code of conduct. A court may not enforce a damage award against a third party for a period of 18 months from the act'seffective date. Consumer Protection Act . The remedies provided in the act are the exclusive remedies for the parties and theConsumer Protection Act does not apply.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 90 4 Senate 39 8 (Senate amended)House 85 11 (House concurred)ESHB 1497 126ESHB 1497 PARTIAL VETO C 48 L 11 E1 Regarding the capital budget. By House Committee on Capita l Budget (originally spon- sored by Representatives Dunshee and Warnick; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Capital Budget Background: The programs and agencies of state govern- ment are funded on a two-year basis, with each biennium beginning on July 1 of each odd-numbered year. The state omnibus capital appropriatio ns act (capital budget) includes appropriations for the acquisition, construction,and repair of capital assets such as state office buildings,prisons, juvenile rehabilitation centers, residential habili-tation centers, mental health facilities, military readinesscenters, and higher education facilities. The capital bud-get also funds a variety of environmental and naturalresource projects, parks and recreational facilities, public K-12 school construction, and grant and loan programsthat support housing, public infrastructure, communityservice facilities, and art and historical projects. The sources of funding for the capital budget primar- ily are state general obligation bonds, trust revenues, anddedicated fees and taxes. Summary: The 2011-13 Capital Budget authorizes $1.7 billion in new capital projects from sources other than bond proceeds. Reappropriations of $1.0 billion areauthorized for projects approved in prior biennia. Stateagencies are also authorized to enter into a variety of alter- native financing contracts. The 2011 Supplemental Capi-tal Budget reduces 2009-11 capital budget appropriationsby $547,000. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 15, 2011 July 1, 2011 (Sections 7022-7025 and 7027) Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed a proviso directing the Salmon Recovery Funding Board to termi- nate its contract for restoration of the Bear River Estuary. A proviso requiring the Fish and Wildlife Commission totransfer to the City of Olympia its three parcels of property located in downtown Olympia is vetoed. In addition, two sections containing technical errors are also vetoed. VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1497 June 15, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning, without my approval as to Sections 5028; 6001; 7018; and 7031, page 83, lines 32-35, and 7031, page 83, line 36, and page 84, lines 1-3 of Engr ossed Substitute House Bill 1497 entitled:\"AN ACT Relating to the capital budget.\" Section 5028, page 50, Central Wa shington University -- Com- bined Utilities The appropriation of $273,000 erro neously references the State Building Construction Account inst ead of the Central Washington University Building Account. ESHB 1497 is comprised of cash and dedicated fund sources, and does not otherwise include bond ac- counts. Therefore, I am vetoin g Section 5028 so that the fund source can be corrected in the 2012 supplemental capital budget. Section 6001, page 58, Salmon Recovery Funding Board Pro- grams, Termination of Contract for Restoration of Bear River Estuary This proviso language conflicts with the existing statutory pro- cess for Salmon Recovery Funding B oard project review by direct- ing the Board to take action on an existing contract. In addition, the requirement is now moot be cause the Board terminated this contract in May. For these re asons, I am veto ing Section 6001. Section 7018, pages 72-73, Department of Fish and Wildlife Land Transfer This proviso requires the Fish and Wildlife Commission to transfer to the City of Olympia its three parcels of property located in downtown Olympia. The Departm ent of General Administration is directed to obtain an appraisal, and negotiate a contract with the City of Olympia to develop a plan for preparing the land for mixed use retail and market rate housing. This requirement precludes the pos sibility of ot her parties offer- ing competitive bids for these prope rties. Therefore, I am vetoing Section 7018. Section 7031, page 83, lines 32-35, Treasurer Transfers Section 7031, page 83, line 36, and page 84, lines 1-3, Trea- surer Transfers The Legislature's reduction of th e existing transfers from the State Toxics Control Account and the Local Toxics Control Ac- count to the state General Fund was meant to accompany a statu-tory change directing toxics account revenues into the General Fund. Because the offsetting stat utory change was not made, the transfers in Section 7031 would re sult in an unintended loss of $103.5 million to the General Fund . Therefore, I am vetoing Sec- tion 7031, page 83, lines 32-35; and Section 7031, page 83, line 36, and page 84, lines 1-3. For these reasons, I have veto ed Sections 5028; 6001; 7018; and 7031, page 83, lines 32-35, an d 7031, page 83, line 36, and page 84, lines 1-3, of Engros sed Substitute House Bill 1497.

By House Committee on Co mmunity Development & Housing (originally sponsored by Representatives Ormsby, Kenney, Smith, Moeller, Sells, Condotta, Ryu,Billig and Roberts). House Committee on Comm unity Development & Housing House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: Office of Manufactured Housing . The Office of Manufactured Housing (Office), in the Depart- ment of Commerce, provides general assistance to manu-factured/mobile home resident organizations, tenantorganizations, and manufactured/mobile home communi-ty owners. Among its duties, the Office provides technicalassistance to tenants who are participating in the conver- sion of a mobile home park to resident ownership underthe Park Purchase Program an d, under this program, may also provide secured loans wh ere a significant number of the residents are low-income or infirm. A $15 fee collected on the title transfer of manufac- tured/mobile homes is depo sited in the Manufactured Housing Account (MH Account). The MH Accountdirects $5,000 annually to fu nd the cost of registering landlords and collecting fees. The remaining funds areused to fund the Office, except for the funds needed by the Department of Labor and Indust ries: (1) to be the state administrative agency under the United States Departmentof Housing and Urban Development's manufactured hous-ing safety and construction stan dards program; and (2) for the Manufactured Home Installation Training Program. A Manufactured Housing Task Force was created in 1991 to study and make reco mmendations on the structure that the state should use to regulate manufactured housing. The task force terminated on December 31, 1992. Mobile Home Relocation Assistance Program . The Office also administers a Mobile Home Relocation Assis-tance Program (Relocation Assistance Program) thatprovides monetary assistance on a first-come, first-served basis to low-income persons owning mobile homeslocated in mobile home pa rks that are scheduled for closure. If eligible, the mo bile home owner could receive reimbursement of relocation expenses up to $12,000($7,500 for a single-wide home). As of January 2011, theRelocation Assistance Program had a wait list with 12eligible households. The Relocation Assistance Program is funded by a $100 fee on the issuance of a certificate of title for certainmanufactured/mobile homes. This fee is deposited in theMobile Home Park Relocation Fund. The Department ofCommerce is allowed to use up to 5 percent of the feescollected for administration of the Relocation Assistance Program. Manufactured Home Cons truction and Installation Programs . The Department of La bor and Industries (L&I) is the designated state administrative agency for purposesof the United States Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment's manufactured housing safety and con- struction standards program. Under this program, the L&Iis responsible for enforcing th e federal standards at Wash- ington manufacturing sites. It must also provide awarranty dispute mediation program. The L&I also administers the Manufactured Home Installation Training Program (Installation Training Pro- gram). Under the Installation Training Program, persons wishing to be manufactured home installers may apply forcertification. Certification is issued to persons who takethe training, pass the examination, pay the required fees,and meet other qualifications. The L&I may charge fees to cover the costs of the pro- gram. Fees are deposited in the Manufactured HomeInstallation Training Account (Installation TrainingAccount). The Installation Tr aining Account also receives any appropriations, fees received under the warranty dis-pute mediation program, and any penalties imposed. This funding may be used for any of the manufactured housingprograms administered by the L&I under these provisions. Regulation of Homes in Manufactured Housing Com- munities . Under the Manufactured/Mobile Home Land- lord-Tenant Act, owners of manufactured housing communities are prohibited from preventing the entry or requiring the removal of a manufactured or mobile homeor a park model for the sole reason that the home hasreached a certain age. Homes may, however, be excludedor expelled for other reasons including failure to complywith fire, safety, and other local ordinances and state laws. Cities and counties are author ized to adopt residential land use zoning regulations, which may include require-ments relating to manufactured homes and manufacturedhousing commun ities, such as location, design, lot size, foundation construction and other requirements. Age anddimension requirements may not restrict the location of manufactured homes in manufactured housing communi-ties that were legally in exis tence before June 12, 2008. With some exceptions, local jurisdictions may not restrict the entry or require the remo val of recreational vehicles used as primary residences in manufactured housingcommunities. Zoning regulations may also prohibit certain land uses as \"nonconforming uses.\" A state law adopted in 2004allows a local jurisdiction to designate a new manufac- tured housing community as a nonconforming use, butprohibits it from ordering the removal or elimination of anexisting manufactured housing community based upon itsdesignation as a \"nonconforming use.\" Summary: Office of Mobile/Manufactured Home Relocation Assistance . The name of the Office ofSHB 1506 128Manufactured Housing is change d to the Office of Mobile/ Manufactured Home Relocation Assistance. References to providing general assistance to manufactured housingcommunity owners or la ndlords are deleted. The Office of Mobile/Manufactured Home Relocation Assistance must provide, if fu nding is appropriated for this purpose, technical assistance to tenants under the ParkPurchase Program. The Manufactured Housing Task Force is repealed. Manufactured Housing Account . The MH Account is repealed. The $15 fee collected on title transfers is depos- ited in the Installation Trai ning Account for use by the L&I for the state administrative agency function and theInstallation Training Program. Any residual balance inthe MH Account must be tran sferred to the Installation Training Account. Relocation Assistance Program . The 5 percent limit on the Department of Commerce's expenditures foradministration cost under the Relocation AssistanceProgram is eliminated. Regulation of Homes in Manufactured Housing Com- munities with Nonconforming Use Status . A city or coun- ty may not, based on a manufactured housing community'sstatus as a nonconforming use, prohibit the entry or requirethe removal of a manufactured or mobile home, parkmodel, or recreational vehicle that is allowed in a manu- factured housing community under the Manufactured/Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1506 C 200 L 11 Addressing fire suppression efforts and capabilities on unprotected land outside a fire protection jurisdiction. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Chandler, Takko and Johnson).House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Fire Protection Services . State law autho- rizes the creation of several types of fire protection andemergency service providers to serve cities, towns, andcounties. The types of fire protection service providersinclude city or town fire departments, fire protectiondistricts, and regional fire protection service authorities. Each type of fire protection service provider operates within a specified jurisdictio n and each has the authority to tax residents for the services provided. Fire protectionjurisdictions may enter into interlocal agreements among themselves to provide se rvices outside of their jurisdictional boundaries. Residents of every area of the state may establish a local fire protection service or a fire protection district toprovide fire prevention, su ppression, and emergency med- ical services. However, the creation of a service or districtrequires either a public vote or legislative action by the appropriate local government. The inability to create a fire protection service or district may result in some areas ofthe state not being within the jurisdiction of any fire pro-tection service provider. In su ch areas, residents do not have access to publicly funded fire or emergency services. Seller Disclosure Forms . Statutes governing real estate transactions require that a seller provide a disclosurestatement, on a prescribed form, to the buyer as part of aresidential real property sale. The form requires the sellerto disclose matters on various issues, such as sewer andseptic systems, structural co ncerns, and hazards such as flooding, based on the se ller's personal knowledge. Summary: Fire Protection Services on Unprotected Land . \"Unprotected land\" means improved property located outside a fire protec tion jurisdiction. Property owners of unprotected lands are encouraged to form or annex into a fire protection ju risdiction or to enter into an agreement with a fire protection service agency for fireprotection services. Agreem ents must be in writing and include a risk assessment of the property and a capabilities assessment of the district. Property owners of unprotected land who choose not to form or annex into a fire protection jurisdiction do so willingly and with full knowledge that a fire protectionservice agency is not obligated to provide services tounprotected land. Absent a written contractual agreement, a fire protec- tion service agency may initiate fire protection services on unprotected land outside its jurisdiction when: services are specifically requested by a landowner or other fire service protection agency; service could reasonably be believed to prevent the spread of fire onto protected lands; or service could reasonably be believed to substantially mitigate the risk of harm to life or property by pre- venting the spread of fire onto other unprotected lands. The property owner of the unprotected land must reimburse the agency for actual costs that are incurred that are proportionate to the fire itself. If the property owner fails to pay the agency for its services, the agency is enti- tled to pursue payment thro ugh a collection agency or court action.House 96 0Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1509 129Liability . Any fire service protection agency and its firefighters, whether paid or vo lunteer, taking part in fire- fighting efforts outside its ju risdiction or providing emer- gency care, rescue, assistance, or recovery services at an emergency is not liable for civil damages resulting fromany act or omission in rendering services, except for actsor omissions constituting gross negligence or willful orwanton misconduct. Seller's Disclosure Form . The seller's disclosure form must include a statement rega rding whether the property is located within a fire protection district. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1509 PARTIAL VETO C 218 L 11 Concerning the forestry riparian easement program. By House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Blake, Dunsheeand Ryu; by request of Commissioner of Public Lands). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources House Committee on Capital BudgetSenate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Forest Riparian Easement Program (FREP) is a program managed by the Small Forest Land- owner Office (SFLO) in the Department of NaturalResources (DNR) to acquire 50-year easements alongriparian and other sensitive aq uatic areas from small forest landowners who are willing to sell or donate easements to the state. The DNR may purchase easements from smallforest landowners and hold the easements in the name ofthe state. The easements are restrictive only and allowlandowners to engage in activities except as necessary toprotect the riparian functions of the habitat for the term of the easement. The easements are intended to represent 50 percent of the value of the unhar vested trees, plus participation com- pliance costs. Once a contract from the FREP is executed,the DNR is required to reim burse the landowner for the actual costs to establish streamside buffers and timbermarking. The value of the easement is determined by the DNR based on the fair market value of the timber volume cov-ered by the easement. This calculation is made by the DNR after it conducts a timber cruise of the entire pro-posed easement. The data gath ered in the timber cruise is then applied to a stumpage va lue table to calculate the fair market value. Value is calculated only on qualifyingtimber. Qualifying timber is timber that is located withina commercially reasonable ha rvest unit that may not be harvested because of state limitations. Summary: Qualifying Small Forest Landowner . The minimum requirements for participation in the FREP are changed. All landowners applying for the FREP must stillshow that they satisfy the de finition of \"small harvester\" in the tax code; however, in orde r to participate in the FREP, the landowner must be a non-governmental, for-profitlegal entity. Qualifying Timber . In addition to the existing unhar- vested trees that are eligible for compensation from theFREP, certain other forest trees are added. These includeforest trees located within riparian habitats, channel migration zones, and on po tentially unstable slopes or landforms. The DNR must verify, be fore compensation may be received, that any trees located on unstable slopes areaddressed by a forest practic es application, are adjacent to a commercially reasonable harvest area, and have thepotential to deliver sediment into a public resource or threaten public safety. Comp ensation for trees left unhar- vested on unstable slopes may not exceed $50,000 duringany two-year period. Compensation . The value of compensation deter- mined by the SFLO is to be calculated at the time the FREP application was completed and not at the time of the underlying harvest. The DN R must not use more than 50 percent of the funding dedicated to the FREP for determin-ing the volume of qualifying timber left unharvested. The resulting easement may not be recorded by the DNR until all compensation is paid to the landowner. A recipient of funding from the FREP must repay the total amount received if the r ecipient sells his or her land within 10 years to someon e who would not qualify for participation in the FREP. Long-Term Funding . The chair of the Forest Practices Board must invite relevant stakeholders to recommend potential long-term funding so urces for the FREP. These recommendations must be deliv ered to the Legislature by October 31, 2011. The DNR is required to s ubmit to the Governor bien- nially a list of all applications to the FREP. Once a list of applicants is received, the Governor must determine thenumber of applications that are to receive funding and provide that list to the Legislature.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that contained an emergency clause.House 96 0 Senate 45 3 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred) House 97 0Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)EHB 1517 130VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1509 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 7, Engrossed Substitute Ho use Bill 1509 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the forest ry riparian easement pro- gram.\" This bill resolves eligibility requirements for participation and compensation in the Forest Riparian Easement Program and fine- tunes what easements to protec t riparian habitat the program will purchase if funding is av ailable. There is no emergent need for the bill to become effective immediat ely, and therefore the emergency clause in Section 7 of th is bill is unnecessary. For this reason I have vetoed Se ction 7 of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1509. With the exception of Section 7 Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1509 is approved.

By Representatives Jinkins, Hinkle, Green, Harris and Stanford.House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: Oral Chemotherapy Medications . Chemo- therapy is a type of cancer treatment involving drugs that target rapidly dividing cells. Most chemotherapy is deliv-ered via parenteral routes. However, some chemotherapydrugs, such as Melphalan and Busulfan, can be deliveredorally. Some oral chemotherapy drugs are capable of tar-geting cancerous cells, leavin g healthy cells unharmed. Others are biologic agents or hormones. Some oral che-motherapy medications are the standard of care for certaincancer types and do not have parenteral alternatives. Mandated Benefit Sunrise Review . In December 2010 the Department of Health (DOH) completed a sunrisereview of mandated coverage for oral chemotherapydrugs. The DOH concluded that the proposal is in the best interest of the public and the benefits outweigh the costs. However, the DOH also conclu ded that there may be some unintended consequences ass ociated with the proposal, such as less favorable coverage for parenteralchemotherapy drugs and lack of coverage for biologicagents. Summary: Beginning January 1, 2012, health plans (including health plans offe red to public employees and their dependents) that provide coverage for chemotherapymust provide coverage for prescribed, self-administered anticancer medication that is used to kill or slow thegrowth of cancerous cells on a basis at least comparable tochemotherapy medications administered by a health careprovider or facility. This does not prohibit a health planfrom administering a formulary or preferred drug list,requiring prior authorization, or imposing other appropri- ate utilization controls in a pproving coverage for any che- motherapy. Each health plan offering individual or smallgroup products must report its cost experience to theLegislature by November 1, 2013.

By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally sponsored by Anderson, Haler, Pettigrew, Fagan, Sells,Johnson, Orwall, Haigh, Kenney, Kelley and Ormsby). House Committee on Education House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: The Washington Alternate Assessment System (WAAS) is an alternate assessment that is an option only for students w ith significant cognitive challenges. The term \"sig nificantly cognitively chal- lenged\" is a designation applied to a small number of stu-dents, generally 10 percent or less of those eligible forspecial education and related services, participating in thestatewide assessment system. The decision about how a special education student participates in the statewide assessment system is an indi-vidualized educational program (IEP) team decision.There is no limit on the number of students in a district to whom the WAAS may be admi nistered. However, there is a limit upon the number of st udents who successfully pass the WAAS that may be counte d for federal adequate yearly progress purposes. This cap is 1 percent of the total stu-dent population being tested in the required grades for the state and 1 percent of the total student population beingtested in the required grades for each district. The WAAS is a portfolio assessment that is individu- alized by a teacher for each individual student. A taskassessment, by contrast, provides a specified test map,along with items or tasks that provide the same basis forscoring and interpreting results. House 80 17Senate 43 2 (Senate amended)House 79 17 (House concurred)HB 1520 131Summary: The Legislature finds that one of the difficult issues facing states and districts across the country is the inclusion of students with the most significant cognitivedisabilities in their state a ssessment and accountability systems. Assessing academic knowledge and skills of stu- dents with unique and significant cognitive disabilities isnot only challenging and tim e consuming, but also may provide only limited information. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) is tasked with conti nuing to work with teachers and special education programs in the development andimplementation of a process to transition from the current portfolio assessment system to a performance task-based assessment. In the meantime, and within existing resources, the OSPI must also coordinate efforts to: align academic goals in a student's IEP with the cur- rent assessment system by identifying detailed state- wide alternate achievement benchmarks for use byteachers; develop a transparent and reliable scoring process; efficiently use technology; and develop a sensible approval process to shorten the time involved in deve loping and collecting assessment data. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1520 C 201 L 11 Modifying state route number 527. By Representatives Moscoso, St anford and Clibborn; by request of Transportation Commission.House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: A route jurisdiction transfer is the conver- sion of a state highway to a local road or the conversion of a local road to a state highway . From 1991 to 2008, the Transportation Improvement Board received andreviewed these transfer requests. In 2009 review of these requests was transferred to the Washington StateTransportation Commission (Transportation Commis-sion). If the Transportation Commission agrees that the request meets the criteria established in state law, theTransportation Commission forwards a recommendationfor the transfer to the House and Senate TransportationCommittees. On November 19, 2009, the City of Bothell submitted a request to the Transporta tion Commission that 2.51 miles of State Route 527 be tr ansferred to the city. Therequested transfer lies entirely within the City of Bothell and runs between State Route 522 and Interstate 405. OnJuly 13, 2010, the Transporta tion Commission approved a preliminary findings report fo r the request. Although the preliminary recommendation no ted that evaluation under some criteria lends support for this section of road toremain a state highway, it also noted that the overwhelm-ing majority of other criteria suggested that the roadshould not be designated as a state route. On October 20,2010, the Transportation Commission recommended thatthe section of road be transfe rred to the City of Bothell as requested. Summary: A 2.51-mile section of State Route 527 is transferred from the state to the City of Bothell. The trans- ferred section begins at State Route 522 and ends at Interstate 405.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1521 C 202 L 11 Recognizing Washington innovation schools. By Representatives Maxwell, Haigh, Sullivan, Pettigrew, Santos, Kenney, Liias, Seaquist, Fitzgibbon,Carlyle and Jinkins. House Committee on Education Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: In Washington, local school district boards of directors have broad authority to manage and oversee the programs of education offered in their districts. Localdistricts may: create and configure educational and sup-port services; establish schools that serve special popula-tions of students or offer special magnet programs; createpartnerships with community organizations and business-es; enter into inter-local agre ements with other districts or Educational Service Districts to deliver programming andservices; and implement innov ations in staffing, parent involvement, curriculum, and instruction. There are numerous examples of innovative schools and programs offered by local school districts across thestate, but awareness of them by the public or other school districts is limited. There is no central repository ofinformation about innovativ e schools and programs. Summary: The Legislature finds that innovation schoolsaccomplish the following objectives: provide students and parents with a diverse array of educational options; promote active and meaningful parent and commu- nity involvement and partnership with local schools;House 97 0Senate 49 0House 98 0Senate 49 0SHB 1524 132 serve as laboratories fo r educational experimentation and innovation; respond and adapt to diff erent styles, approaches, and objectives of learning; hold students and educators to high expectations and standards; and encourage and facilit ate bold, creative, and innovative educational ideas. Examples of innovation schools are provided. The Office of the Superintende nt of Public Instruction (OSPI) is directed to develop basic criteria and a stream- lined review process to identify and designate WashingtonInnovation Schools. Within available funds, the OSPI alsocreates a logo, certificates, and other recognition strategies to encourage and highlight th e schools. A page on the OSPI website must include r esearch literature, best prac- tices, summary information ab out Washington Innovation Schools, and a link to the schools' websites. The OSPI isencouraged to offer the design and development of thewebpage as a project for an administrator intern.

By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representative Orwall). House Committee on Education Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Background: Graduation Requirements . The State Board of Education establishes minimum statewide grad-uation requirements. Students must earn 19 credits inspecified course areas, complete a culminating project,and prepare a high school an d beyond plan. Beginning with the graduating class of 2012, 20 credits will be required. In addition, students must meet the standard on the state reading and writing asse ssments and take additional math classes if they do not meet the standard on the statemathematics assessment. Beginning with the graduatingclass of 2013, students must me et the standard on the state assessments in readin g, writing, mathematics, and science for graduation. In addition, all students must study theUnited States and Washington Constitutions as aprerequisite to graduation.School districts may establish other local graduation requirements. High school di plomas are issued by school districts to students who m eet state and local graduation requirements. International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB). The IB is designed as an academically challenging series of courses, student work, and examinations whichare usually offered over a two-year period. Students mustcomplete courses in six subjects: primary language, sec-ondary language, individuals and societies, science, math-ematics, and either the arts or a second course in one of the other subjects. Students must also complete a Theory ofKnowledge course, produce an extended essay, participatein a Creativity, Action, and Service activity, and completeinternally and externally-scored assessment tasks. To earn an IB Diploma, st udents must also pass end- of-course examinations in each of their six courses. The IB examinations are offered twice a year. The results ofthe November examinations are issued in January; the results of the May examinat ions are issued in July. There are 16 Washington high schools approved to offer the IB. More than 6,600 Washington studentsenrolled in the IB courses in 2009-10. However, not all students seek the full IB Dipl oma. Some enroll in the IB but do not complete all of the required components or examinations. According to the IB Organization, 339 Washington students earned the IB Diploma in 2008. Summary: Students who fulfill specified requirements toward completion of an IB Diploma are considered to have satisfied state minimum requirements for graduation from a public high school, except that: 1. the requirement for students to meet the standard on state assessments still applies to the IB students; and 2. laws requiring students to study the United States and Washington Constitutions as a prerequisite for gradu- ation still apply to the IB students, but the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction may adopt arule allowing the IB students to meet the prerequisite through non-credit based study. School districts may requir e the IB students to com- plete additional local graduatio n requirements before issu- ing a high school diploma, but are encouraged to waive local requirements for students to pursue an IB Diploma. To receive a high school diploma under the act, students must complete the following aspects of the IB: complete and pass all required IB courses, as scored at the local level; submit and pass all intern al assessments, as scored at the local level; successfully complete all required projects and products, as scored at the local level; and complete the final examinations administered by the IB Organization in all required subjects.House 96 0Senate 47 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1538 on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1538 PARTIAL VETO C 204 L 11 Regarding animal he alth inspections. By House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Buys, Blake,Chandler, Taylor, Orcutt, Hinkle, Haler, Johnson andWarnick). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development Background: The Director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) is authorized to adoptrules that prevent the introd uction or spreading of infec- tious diseases into the state. This includes the authority toadopt rules regarding the in spection and testing of all animals in the state or being imported into the state. TheWSDA may charge a time and mileage fee for livestockinspections and investigations of $85 per hour, plus mile-age. The WSDA has the authority to raise this fee by rule. It is unlawful for a person to bring livestock into Washington without first obta ining a certificate of veteri- nary inspection verifying that the animals meet Washing-ton's health requirements. This requirement does not apply to animals that will be de livered to a feed lot, slaugh- ter plant, or livestock market within 12 hours of importation. Summary: The WSDA is authorized to adopt rules that require the certificate of veterinarian inspection, health papers, permits, or other transportation documents to pro-vide a physical address and a timeline as to when theanimals will be transported directly to that address. Un-less exempted by the WSDA, it is unlawful to transfer ananimal to a location other th an the address designated on the transporta tion documents. The authority of the WSDA to charge a mileage and hourly fee for violation inspec tions is changed to allow the WSDA to collect up to $85 per hour. In addition, the WSDA may adopt, by rule, a fee of no more than 40 centsper head of cattle on all cattle slaughtered in Washingtonor transported out of Washington. The fee must be depos-ited into the newly created Animal Disease TraceabilityAccount, which is housed within the Agricultural LocalFund, and is to be used to carry out animal disease trace-ability activities for cattle and to compensate data and fee collection costs. Failure to pay the fee is a class 1 civilinfraction.The fee must be paid by a ll cattle sellers in Washing- ton, the owners of cattle sl aughtered in the state, and, unless exempted by the WSDA in rule, the owners of cat-tle exported alive from Washin gton. If a livestock inspec- tion occurs, the fee must be collected in the same manneras livestock inspection fees. For livestock that is not inspected, the fee must be paid by the fifteenth day of themonth following transportation out of state. The fee for slaughtered cattle must be collected by the meat processor. The Animal Disease Trac eability Advisory Commit- tee (Committee) is created to serve in an advisory capacity to the WSDA. The Committee mu st meet at least twice a year and work with the WSDA to develop a plan to imple-ment the electronic transfer of livestock traceability data and to consult on other livestock traceability issues. TheDirector of the WSDA must appoint an initial eight mem-bers to the Committee representing various aspects of thelivestock industry to three-y ear terms. The membership of the Committee may be expanded by a unanimous vote of the Committee members. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that required the Director of the Department of Agricul- ture to create an Animal Disease Traceability AdvisoryCommittee. VETO MESSAGE ON SHB 1538 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 5, Substitute House Bill 1538 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to animal health inspections.\" Section 5 of this bill establishes a formal Animal Disease Trace- ability Advisory Committee to serv e in an advisory capacity to the Department of Agriculture for th is program. I am vetoing Section 5 of this bill. I understand the im portance of invo lving livestock growers, feeders, farmers, and business interests in guiding this disease traceability program, but that does not necessitate creat- ing a formal committee in statute. However, along with this veto, I am directing the director of the Department of Agriculture to con- vene an informal advisory group made up of key liv estock industry representatives to assist the de partment as it implements the animal disease trac eability program. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 5 of Substitute House Bill 1538. With the exception of Section 5 Substitu te House Bill 1538 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O.

By Representatives Hunter and Anderson.House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropri- ations & Oversight House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Basic Health Plan . The Health Care Authority (Authority) administers the Basic Health Plan (BHP), which is a health care insurance program thatassists enrollees by providing a state subsidy to offset thecosts of premiums. Residents of Washington withincomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level(FPL) are eligible for enrollment in the BHP. In addition,enrollees must not be: (1) eligible for Medicare; (2)institutionalized; or (3) in schoo l on temporary work visas. Federal Waiver . Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health care services to specified categories oflow-income individuals purs uant to federal standards. States may request waivers fro m federal requirements for experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects. The 2010Supplemental Operating Approp riations Act directed the Authority to seek a waiver from the federal government tosupport some of the enrollees on the BHP. As of January2011, the federal government issued the terms and condi-tions for granting a waiver. Un der the terms of the waiver, the federal government will provide matching funds to Washington for adults under age 65 in the BHP whoseincomes are at or below 13 3 percent of the FPL and who are citizens or eligible qualified aliens. Summary: Starting in March 2011, individuals who are not eligible for federal supp ort under the Medicaid waiver for the BHP are no longer eligible for the BHP. This restriction does not apply to foster parents. The Legislature intends to define eligibility for the BHP after the waiver expires based upon recommenda-tions from the Joint Select Committee on Health Reform Implementation.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 29, 2011E2SHB 1546 C 260 L 11 Authorizing creation of inn ovation schools and innovation zones focusing on arts, scie nce, technology, engineering, and mathematics in school districts. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hargrove, Hunt, Dammeier,Pettigrew, Liias, Smith, Anderson, Fagan, Kretz,Dahlquist, Angel, Zeiger, Jinkins and Finn). House Committee on Education House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: In 1987 the Schools for the 21st Century was established in legislatio n as a pilot program intended to foster change in the pub lic school system. The State Board of Education (SBE), in consultation with a Gover- nor-appointed task force, selected 33 pilot schools which then received funding for 10 supplemental days of stafftime and additional funding fo r training, curriculum devel- opment, and other resources. Pilot schools could also seekwaivers of state laws regarding length of the school year,student-to-teacher ra tios, instructional hour requirements, restrictions on funding for cat egorical programs, and other administrative rules. The Scho ols for the 21st Century law expired in 1995. In 1995 legislation was enacted that authorized any school district to apply for waivers of specified state laws,similar to waivers that had ex isted for the Schools for the 21st Century. A school district may apply to the SBE orthe Office of the Superinten dent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for a waiver in order to \"implement a plan forrestructuring its educational program.\" Another lawallows the SBE to grant waiv ers of the Basic Education program requirements, as necessary to implement a localplan designed to enhance the educational program for eachstudent. Eighty-three school districts have a waiver of the180-day school year under these laws. The SBE alsogrants waivers from credit-b ased graduation requirements; two districts have received these waivers. Laws that require school districts to separately account for funds to support categorical programs such as the Learning Assistance Program, Transitional BilingualInstructional Program, or Highly Capable Program are notaddressed in this waiver process. Summary: The OSPI must establish a process for school districts to apply to have schools designated as InnovationSchools. Groups of schools in one district or all schools inmultiple districts may apply fo r designation as an Innova- tion Zone. A priority is placed on schools focused on thearts, science, technology, en gineering, and mathematics (A-STEM) that actively partne r with the community, busi- ness, and higher education an d that use project-based or hands-on learning. Applications for designation must bedeveloped by educators, pare nts, and comm unities in par- ticipating schools. School districts must ensure that eachHouse 96 2Senate 45 2 (Senate amended)House 75 23 (House concurred)ESHB 1547 135school has substantial opportuni ty to participate in devel- oping an application. The OS PI develops common criteria for reviewing applications an d for reviewing the need for waivers of state laws and rules. Initial applications with proposed innovation plans must be submitted to Educational Service Districts (ESDs) by January 6, 2012. Each ESD reviews applications usingthe common criteria and recommends no more than threeplans, including at least one Innovation Zone. At least two of the three recommended plans must be A-STEM pro- gram models and not more than one may be another pro-gram model. An ESD with more than 350,000 students recommends up to 10 plans for designation, with at leasthalf being A-STEM models and no more than half being other models. Innovation plans must be able to be imple- mented without supplemental state funds. The OSPIdesignates the recommen ded plans for six years, beginning in the 2012-13 school year. An innovation plan must contain a number of elements, including: why designation would enhance student achievement and close the achievement gap; research-based activities and innovations to be carried out; justification for waiver of state statutes and rules that are authorized; justification of any re quest for additional waivers beyond those authorized; a budget for the plan and anticipated sources of funding; evaluation and accounta bility processes that rely on multiple measures of student achievement; district support for waiver of local rules and modifi- cation of collective bargaining agreements if necessary to implement the plan; letters of support from th e district, school staff, and community; and approval of the plan by a majority of the staff assigned to the school or schools. Laws that authorize the SBE or the OSPI to grant waivers from laws and rules pe rtaining to Basic Education requirements, student-to-teacher ratios, and length of the school year are amended to include Innovation Schools or Innovation Zones. In add ition, Innovation Schools and Innovation Zones may apply for waivers of laws pertain- ing to comingling of state funds for categorical programsand flexibility in calculating course credits for high school courses. The SBE and the OSPI must conduct an expedit-ed review of waiver requests, and may deny a request if thewaiver would decrease student achievement, jeopardize adistrict's receipt of state or federal funds, or violate state orfederal laws or rules. Annual progress reports are required from each Innovation School and Innovation Zone, and the OSPImust report biennially to the Education Committees of theLegislature. The report must include recommendationsfor additional waivers of laws and rules as identified ininnovation plans. The OSPI may revoke designation as anInnovation School or Innovation Zone based on a determi-nation that progress is not increasing over time on the mul- tiple measures of evaluation and accountability includedin the innovation plan. The provisions of the act expire June 30, 2019. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1547 PARTIAL VETO C 206 L 11 Concerning the deportation of criminal alien offenders. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Darneille, Hunter, Dickerson,Cody, Hunt, Kagi, Sullivan and Kenney). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Any alien offender who has been sentenced in Washington under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 and who has been found by the United States AttorneyGeneral to be subject to a final order of deportation orexclusion may be placed on conditional release status. Ifplaced on conditional release status, the offender is trans-ferred to the custody of the Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE) division of the U.S. Department ofHomeland Security. An offender may not be released on a conditional release status unless the Secretary of the Department ofCorrections (Secretary) finds that such a release is in thebest interest of the state. Conditional release status may only be allowed with the appr oval of the sentencing court and the prosecuting attorney of the county of conviction. If an offender is serving a sentence for a violent offense, a sex offense, or an offense that is a crime againsta person, he or she may no t be placed on conditional release status. Once an offender is released to the ICE, theDepartment of Corrections (DOC) must issue a warrant for the offender's arrest w ithin the United States which will remain in effect until th e expiration of the conditional release. The unserved portion of an offender's term ofconfinement is tolled when the offender is released to theICE. If the offender is arrested, the DOC must seek extra-dition as necessary, and the offender must be returned toHouse 94 2 Senate 46 1 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 46 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1548 136the DOC for the completion of the unserved portion of his or her term of total confinement. Prior to acceptance of a pl ea of guilty, the state court must determine that the defe ndant has been advised that the potential consequences of conviction include deporta- tion, exclusion from admissio n to the United States, or denial of naturalization. Summary: The placement of an alien offender on condi- tional release status no longer requires the Secretary to find that such placeme nt is in the best interest of the state. The approval of the sentencing court and the prosecutingattorney is no longer needed. If an offender is serving a sentence for a violent offense or a sex offense, he or she may not be placed onconditional release status. Before an offender is placed onconditional release status, the Se cretary is required to enter into an agreement with the IC E that once an alien offender has been released to the IC E and placed on conditional release status, that offender will remain in total confine-ment at a facility operated by the ICE pending theoffender's return to his or her country of origin. A warrant for the arrest of an offender issued upon release of the offender to the ICE remains in effect indefi-nitely. If an offender is arrested after being placed on con-ditional release status, the DOC may, but is notrequired to, seek extradition to have the offender returned to the DOC. The provisions related to conditional release apply to persons convicted before, on, or after the effective date ofthe act. Prior to accepting a defendant's guilty plea, a state court must advise the defendant that he or she may be sub-ject to early release for removal as a consequence of con-viction and that he or she may be able to contest removal. The DOC must provide written notice of rights in removal proceedings to all offenders who are subject toearly release. The notice must be provided as early in theremoval process as feasible. The DOC must work with anonprofit legal services organi zation that is qualified to appear in immigration court to create the written notice. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 29, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the sec- tions requiring a state court to advise a defendant that he or she may be subject to early release for removal as a consequence of conviction, and requiring the DOC toprovide written notice of ri ghts in removal for all offenders who are subject to early release. VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1547 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 2 and 3, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the deportation of criminal alien offenders.\"Section 2 requires the Department of Corrections to provide written notice of rights in remova l proceedings to all offenders in the department's custody subject to potential conditional release under this statute. Ad vising offenders of thes e rights is the respon- sibility of the federa l government at the time removal proceedings are initiated. Section 3 requires a court to adv ise a defendant that he or she may be subject to early release from custody for removal from the United States as a consequence of conviction and that the defen- dant may be able to contest a removal order. Current law and court practices and procedures provid e defendants with adequate notice of potential deportation conse quences of a plea of guilty. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 2 and 3 of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547. With the exception of Sectio ns 2 and 3 Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1547 is approved.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon-sored by Representatives Hunt er, Darneille and Kenney; by request of Department of Social and Health Services). House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Long-term care (LTC) workers provide care to elderly and disabled clients, many of whom are eligible for publicly funded services through the Depart-ment of Social and Health Services' (DSHS) Aging andDisabilities Services Administ ration. These workers provide their clients personal care assistance with varioustasks such as bathing, eating, toileting, dressing,ambulating, meal preparatio n, and household chores. The services may be provided: (1) by LTC workers employed in various regula ted residential settings; or (2) in the client's home by individual providers who contractdirectly with the DSHS or by agency providers who are employees of a licensed home care agency. A paid indi- vidual provider may be a rela tive or a household member, although the parent of a client who is a minor or the client'sspouse may not be a paid individual provider under mostprograms.House 85 11Senate 48 1 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 56 41 (House concurred) SHB 1560 137The term \"long-term care worker\" does not include persons employed in nursing homes, hospitals, hospice agencies, or adult day care or day health care centers. Training/Certification Requirements for LTC Work- ers. Various statutory and administrative training require- ments apply to LTC workers. In Initiative 1029 (I-1029) adopted in November 2008, mandatory training require-ments were increased and home care aide certification wasrequired for certain LTC worker s. This law, as amended in 2009, requires the following: an increase from 35 hours of basic training under administrative rules to 75 hours of basic training, to be completed within 120 days of hire for LTC work- ers hired on or after January 1, 2011. Individual pro-viders must be compensated for training time. Exceptions from the traini ng requirements include: 1. parents caring for only their developmentally dis- abled adult child, who must have 12 hours ofrelevant training within 120 days of becoming an individual provider; and 2. individual providers car ing only for their adult child or their parent and, until 2014, certain respite providers, who must have 35 hours of training within 120 days of becoming anindividual provider; certification as home care aides for all LTC workers hired on or after January 1, 2011, except for sup-ported living providers and individual providers caring only for their adul t child or parent; and increased continuing education requirements for LTC workers beginning July 1, 2011, from 10 hoursrequired in administrative rules to 12 hours. Exemp- tions from continuing education requirements areprovided for individual providers caring only for their adult child and, until 2014, certain respite providers. Individual providers mu st be compensated for training time. Advanced training opportunities must be offered to LTC workers beginning January 1, 2012, and a peer mentorship program must begin on July 1, 2011. As of January 1, 2010, for individual providers repre- sented by an exclusive barg aining representative, all required training and peer mentoring is provided by atraining partnership. As of July 1, 2009, contributions tothe training partnership are made pursuant to a collectivebargaining agreement negotia ted with the Governor. Background Checks for LTC Workers . Under various laws, the DSHS is responsibl e for investigating the suit- ability of applicants or service providers who providein-home services under DSHS pr ograms. These investiga- tions include an examination of state criminal history record information, and und er some statutes applicants must be fingerprinted throug h both the Washington State Patrol and the Federal Bure au of Investigation (FBI).The passage of I-1029 in 20 08, as amended in 2009, requires all LTC workers hired after January 1, 2012, to bescreened through state and federal background checks,including checking against the FBI fingerprint identifica-tion records system and th e National Sex Offenders Registry. Summary: Implementation of the new basic training and certification requirements fo r LTC workers is delayed as follows: The new basic training requirements begin with LTC workers hired on or after January 1, 2014, instead of January 1, 2011. Agency rules are to be adopted by August 1, 2013. The exem ption for respite workers until January 1, 2014, is deleted. The home care aide certification requirement begins January 1, 2014, instead of January 1, 2011. Agency rules are to be adopted by August 1, 2013. The increase to 12 hours of continuing education begins July 1, 2014, instead of July 1, 2011, andadvanced training is offered beginning January 1,2014, instead of January 1, 2012.

By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Represen tatives Cody and Jinkins). House Committee on Health Care & WellnessSenate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Health Care Authority administers the Health Insurance Partnership (HIP). The HIP offers pre- mium subsidies to the empl oyees of small employers who employ mostly low-wage worker s. Specifically, the small employer must: (1) not curren tly offer insurance benefits; (2) have no more than 50 employees; and (3) have at leasthalf of it's workforce compri sed of low-wage workers. To participate in the HIP, the small employer must enroll atHouse 83 13Senate 34 12SHB 1565 138least 75 percent of its employees and contribute at least 40 percent of the cost of premiu ms. In addition, the employer must establish a cafeteria plan that allows employees touse pretax dollars to pay thei r share of the health benefit plan premium. Employees of participating small employ-ers may be eligible for a subsidy for their portion of thepremiums if they are Washington residents and they havea family income that is less than 200 percent of the federalpoverty level. Subsidies are to be based upon a slidingscale depending on income. The law creating the HIP was enacted in 2007, and the HIP was originally due to be gin accepting applications on January 1, 2009. In 2009 the program was suspended untilJanuary 1, 2011, subject to av ailable funding. In August 2009, the federal government approved a five-year grant to the Health Care Authority, through the Office of Finan-cial Management, which would begin funding subsidiesfrom January 1, 2011, through 2014. Enrollment in theplan began on September 1, 2010, and coverage began on January 1, 2011. Summary: The eligibility requirement for the Health In- surance Partnership (HIP) that a small employer must not currently offer health insurance is expanded to also require that the small employer not ha ve offered insurance for the previous six months. The re quirement for participation in the HIP that a small employer establish a cafeteria plan that allows employees to use pretax dollars for health ben-efit plan premiums is eliminated. It is clarified that funding for the HIP may come from federal sources. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1565 C 137 L 11 Concerning the modification and termination of domestic violence protection orders. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Frockt , Rodne, Pedersen, Eddy, Goodman, Roberts, Walsh, Green, Jacks, Fitzgibbon, Reykdal, Kenney, Stanfo rd, Billig and Kelley). House Committee on JudiciarySenate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: A victim of domestic violence (the peti- tioner) may obtain a domestic violence protection orderagainst a respondent. The court may provide several typesof relief, including electronic monitoring, domestic vio-lence perpetrator treatment, and a requirement that therespondent refrain from contacting the petitioner. Viola-tion of a domestic violence protection order is a grossmisdemeanor unless the respon dent has two prior convic- tions for violating a domestic violence protection order orother similar federal or out-o f-state order, in which case the violation is a class C felony. If the court grants a protection order for a fixed time period, the petitioner may apply for renewal of the order.The court must grant a re newal unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent will not resume acts of domestic violence. The court may issue an order exceeding one year or issue a permanent order if it finds that the respondent is likely to resume acts of domestic violence. A temporaryor permanent order may be modified or terminated upon amotion by either the petitione r or respondent. However, the statute does not specify the grounds upon which mod-ification should be granted or assign the burden of proof toone party or the other. In a 2010 case, In Re Marriage of Freeman, the Washington Supreme Court (Court) reviewed the denial ofa respondent's motion for termination of a protection order. The Court determined that a respondent bears the same burden of proof in a motion for termination or mod-ification as is required to ov ercome a petition for renewal. The respondent must prove by a preponderance of theevidence that he or she will refrain from resuming acts of domestic violence. In granting the motion to terminate,the Court considered many f actors, including the passage of time since the order was entered and the relocation ofthe respondent to a geogra phic area far from the petitioner. The Court declined to order the respondent to pay thepetitioner's costs and attorneys' fees. Summary: The Legislature finds that some of the factors articulated in the Court's decision in In Re Marriage of Freeman place an improper burden on petitioners and are not demonstrative of a respon dent's likelihood to resume acts of domestic violence. A procedure is set forth forbringing a motion to modify or terminate a permanent do-mestic violence protection order or an order issued for aperiod of greater than two year s. Standards are established regarding motions by respondents for modification andtermination of permanent domestic violence protection orders and orders issued for a period of greater than twoyears. Service . A motion to modify or terminate an order must be personally served on the nonmoving party nofewer than five days prior to the hearing. When a respondent files a motion for modification or termination, a licensed proces s server, sheriff, or other local law enforcemen t must personally serve the petition- er. If a petitioner files the motion, he or she may achieveservice through another private party. Motion and Affidavit . A respondent's motion for modification or termination must include an affidavit stat-ing the facts in support of modification or termination. The petitioner may file op posing affidavits. UponHouse 56 41Senate 31 18 (Senate amended)House 56 42 (House concurred)SHB 1567 139reviewing the affidavits, the court must dismiss the motion unless there is adequate cause for a hearing. Standard of Proof . If a respondent's motion is for termination, the respondent be ars the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a sub- stantial change in circumstances such that he or she is notlikely to resume acts of domes tic violence. In determining whether there has been a \"substantial change in circum-stances,\" the court may consider the list of providedfactors. The court may not grant a motion solely based on the fact that time has passed withou t violations or the fact that the respondent or petitioner ha s relocated to an area more distant from the other party. Regardless of whether there is a substantial change in ci rcumstances, the court may de- cline to terminate a protection order if it finds that the acts of domestic violence that brought about the order were ofsuch severity that the orde r should not be terminated. If a respondent's motion is for modification, the respondent bears the burden of proving by a preponder-ance of the evidence that mo dification is warranted and would not diminish the protections provided to the peti-tioner. If modifying the protection order would reduce theduration of the order or would eliminate provisions thatrestrain the respondent from harassing, stalking, threaten-ing, or committing other acts of domestic violence, the court must consider the list of provided factors relating towhether there has been a substantial change in circumstances. A petitioner bears no burden of proving that he or she has a current reasonable fear of imminent harm by therespondent in either a motion for modification ortermination. Costs and Attorneys' Fees . The court may require a respondent to pay court cost s and service fees in addition to a petitioner's costs and a ttorneys' fees incurred in responding to a motion.

House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Human Services & CorrectionsBackground: The Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC) provides basic corrections training, law enforce- ment training, and educational programs for criminaljustice personnel, including commissioned officers, cor-rections officers, fire marsha ls, and prosecuting attorneys. An applicant offered a conditional offer of employ- ment as a peace officer or reserve officer must pass apsychological exam and a poly graph test as a condition of continuing employment. The tests must be administeredby the hiring county, city, or state law enforcement agency. The psychological exam must be administered by aWashington licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, and thepolygraph test must be admi nistered by an experienced, accredited polygrapher. The CJTC is authorized to receive criminal history record information that includes non-conviction data foremployment by the CJTC or for certification of peaceofficers. Under certain circumstances, the CJTC may deny or revoke certification of a peace officer. The CJTC mustdeny certification to an office r who has lost certification as a result of a break in law en forcement work of more than two years if the officer failed to pass the psychologicalexam and polygraph test. Summary: An applicant offered a conditional offer of employment as a peace officer or reserve officer must submit to a background investigation, including a check ofcriminal history, as a condition of continuing employment.The results of the background investigation must be usedto determine the applicant' s suitability for employment. The background investigation mu st be administered by the agency that made the conditional offer of employment.The polygraph test must be administered by an experi- enced, accredited polygrapher in compliance with CJTCrules. The CJTC must deny certification to an officer who has lost certification as a result of a break in law enforce-ment work of more than two years if the officer failed tocomply with requirements regarding the background investigation, psychological exam, and polygraph test.

By House Committee on Technology, Energy & Commu- nications (originally spon sored by Representatives Chandler and Morris). House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Electrical generating facilities in Washing- ton may sited through local permitting processes or through the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) certification process. The EFSEC is the permitting an d certificating author- ity for the siting of major en ergy facilities in Washington. An EFSEC site certification authorizes an applicant toconstruct and operate an energy facility in lieu of any otherpermit or document required by any other state agency orsubdivision of the state. The EFSEC's jurisdiction includes the siting of large energy facilities, such as thermal electric power plantswith a generating capacity of 350 megawatts or greater.Energy facilities of any size that exclusively use alterna-tive energy resources, such as wind power, may opt-in tothe EFSEC review and certification process. Summary: Written Notice to the United States Depart- ment of Defense . The EFSEC and local governments must provide written notice to the United States Depart- ment of Defense (DOD) when they receive a siting appli- cation for an energy plant or alternative energy resource facility if the plant or facility is connected to a transmis-sion line of a nominal voltage of at least 115 kilovolts (kV). The EFSEC must post on its website the appropriateinformation for contacting the DOD. Purpose and Contents of the Notice . The purpose of the written notificatio n is to give the DOD the opportunity to identify potential issues relating to the placement andoperations of the plant or f acility before an application is approved. The time period set forth by the EFSEC or alocal government for receiving comments may not extendthe time period for processi ng the application. The notification to the DOD must include the follow- ing: (1) a description of the proposed plant or facility; (2) the location of the site; (3) the placement of the plant or facility on the site; (4) the date and time by which com-ments must be received; and (5) contact information for the EFSEC or the local government permitting agency andthe applicant.

By House Committee on Tech nology, Energy & Commu- nications (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy, McCoy, Crouse, Frockt, Kelley, Short, Jacks, Fitzgibbonand Billig; by request of Utilities & Transportation Com-mission). House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy Background: Utilities and Transpor tation Commission . The Utilities and Transportatio n Commission (UTC) is a three-member commission that has broad authority to reg- ulate in the public interest the rates, services, and practices of privately owned utilities and transportation companies.The UTC regulates these utilities under a \"rate of return\"system, in which a regulated utility is generally allowed tocharge rates to cover its cost s, plus reasonable compensa- tion for the services rendered. The retail sale of electricityis generally subject to regul ation by the UTC, unless a legal exception applies. Electric Vehicles . Electricity can be used as a trans- portation fuel to power electric vehicles. Electric vehiclesare propelled by an electric motor powered by recharge-able battery packs. These vehicles typically have limitedenergy storage capacity, which must be replenished byplugging the vehicle into an electrical source to rechargethe battery. Battery Charging Stations . In 2009 legislation was enacted to support the planning for, and development of,electric vehicle infrastructure in the state, including the deployment of stations to charge electric vehicle batteries.Under this act, a battery ch arging station generally refers to a code-compliant electric assembly designed to charge electric vehicle batteries. A rapid charging station is gen-erally defined as a code-compliant, industrial grade elec-trical outlet that provides faster recharging of electricvehicle batteries. The Utilities and Transportation Commission's Elec- tric Vehicles Work Session . In October of 2010, the UTC held a work session to consider its regulatory role related to electric vehicles. The work session included discussionof regulatory issues relating to the resale of electricity at public charging stations an d whether such activity should be subject to economic regulation by the UTC. Summary: The UTC may not regulate the rates, services, facilities, and practices of any entity that offers battery charging facilities to the public for hire if that entity: (1)is not otherwise subject to the UTC's jurisdiction as anelectrical company; or (2) is otherwise subject to theUTC's jurisdiction as an electr ical company, but its battery charging facilities are not subsidized by any regulatedHouse 94 0Senate 45 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)ESHB 1572 141service.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SHB 1575 C 76 L 11 Clarifying which surgical facilities the Washington state department of health is mandated to license pursuant tochapter 70.230 RCW. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Cody, Green, Van DeWege, Moeller and Jinkins). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Department of Health began licensing ambulatory surgical facilities in 2009. An \"ambulatory surgical facility\" is defined as a distinct entity that primar- ily provides specialty or multis pecialty outpatient surgical services and discharges patients within 24 hours of admis-sion. There are three exemp tions from this definition for: (1) dental offices; (2) hospital-affiliated ambulatory surgi-cal facilities; and (3) outpatient surgical services that are routinely performed in the office of a practitioner that donot require general anesthes ia. In implementing the licensing program, the Department of Health issued aninterpretive statement that limited the licensing require- ment to only those facilities that perform outpatientsurgeries and use general anesthesia. The Medical Quality Assu rance Commission adopted rules in September 2010 that regulate office-basedsurgery. These rules establish standards for the perfor-mance of surgery in a physician's office where the physi-cian uses moderate sedation, deep sedation, or major conduction anesthesia. The ru les do not apply to proce- dures that: (1) use very low levels of sedation or anesthe-sia; (2) are performed in a ho spital or ambulatory surgical facility setting; or (3) use general anesthesia. Summary: For licensing purposes, \"ambulatory surgical facilities\" are defined to include surgical suites that areadjacent to the office of a practitioner if the primary pur-pose of those suites is to of fer specialty or multispecialty outpatient surgical services, regardless of the type of anes- thesia used. The definition fu rther specifies that the surgi- cal suites may share certain features with the office of apractitioner, including a reception area, restroom, waitingroom, and walls. The exemption from ambulatory surgical facility regulation for outpatient surgical services routinely performed in a practitioner's of fice is limited by the condi- tion that specialty and multispe cialty services not be the primary purpose of the office. The exemption is further limited by providing that any surgical services in which the use of general anesthesia is planned must be performed in an ambulatory surgical facility or a hospital. Entities that had been licen sed by the Department of Health as ambulatory surgical facilities as of July 1, 2009,and were later declared not to meet the definition of anambulatory surgical facility are to be deemed as havingHouse 93 0Senate 48 0 House 97 1 Senate 48 0HB 1582 142complied with the survey requirement for their initial license applications as ambula tory surgical facilities.

By Representatives Lytton, Morris, Chandler, Blake, Wilcox, Orcutt, Tharinger, Hinkle, McCune, Pearson andVan De Wege. House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Forest Practices Act establishes four classes of forest practices b ased on the potential for the proposed operation to adversely affect public resources.The Forest Practices Board (Board) establishes standardsthat determine which forest pr actices are included in each class. The different classes determine the level of Depart-ment of Natural Resources (DNR) involvement in the permitting process. The four classes are: Class I forest practices are those determined by the Board to have no direct potential for damaging a public resource. Class II forest practices have a less than ordinary potential for damaging a public resource. Class III forest practices are more substantial than Class II, but less substantial than Class IV . Class IV forest practice activities have the potential for substantial environmental impacts and require compliance with the State Environmental ProtectionAct (SEPA). Class IV forest practices include: activities where forestland is to be converte d to another use; activities on lands likely to be converted to urban development; and activities on lands platted after January 1, 1960. Class IV forest practices are assumed to be related to land uses other than forestry. These forest practices mayrequire a license or permit fro m a local government. The local government assumes lead agency status for purposes of ensuring compliance with the SEPA. Summary: References in the Forest Practices Act to lands that were platted after January 1, 1960, are removed. These lands are no longer defaulted into the Class IV forest practices categorization and are no longer automat-ically assumed to be lands that will be converted to anon-forestry land use.

By House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness (originally sp onsored by Representatives Eddy, Springer and Ryu). House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Mutual aid is a term in organizational theory used to signify a volu ntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. In emergency services, mutual aid is an agreement among emergencyresponders to lend assistance across jurisdictional bound-aries. This may occur due to an emergency response thatexceeds local resources, such as a disaster or a multi- ple-alarm fire. Mutual aid may be ad hoc and requestedonly when such an emergency occurs. It may also be a formal standing agreement for cooperative emergency management on a continuing b asis, such as ensuring that resources are dispatched from the nearest fire station, regardless of which side of the jurisdictional boundary theincident is on. Various state and local governmental enti-ties in Washington are involved in emergency management and preparedness. The Emergency Management Division . The Emer- gency Management Division of the Washington MilitaryDepartment administers em ergency management and disaster relief programs. The Director of the WashingtonMilitary Department (Directo r) is appointed by the Gover- nor and is required to deve lop a comprehensive emergency management plan including an analysis of the natural,technological, or human-caused hazards that could affectthe state. Local jurisdictions are directed to establish com- prehensive local emergency management plans, and sub-mit their plans to the Director for recommendations. Local jurisdictions may also establish and operate joint localemergency management organizations. The Emergency Management Council . The Emergency Manageme nt Council (Council) is a 17-mem- ber Council appointed by the Governor to advise theGovernor and the Director on state and local emergencymanagement matters. The Council includes representa- tives from various state and local agencies, as well asemergency medical personnel and private industry.Among other duties, the Council must ensure theHouse 97 0Senate 45 3House 97 0Senate 48 0 (Senate 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1585 143Governor receives an annu al assessment of statewide emergency preparedness. In th e event of a disaster beyond local control, the Governor , through the Director, may assume operational control over all or any part of emer- gency management functions in the state. In addition to using state and local agencies and employees for emergen-cy response, the Governor and the chief executives or emergency management directors of counties, cities, andtowns have authority to pr ess citizens into emergency management service if the Governor proclaims a disaster. The Washington State Emergency Response Commis- sion. The Washington State Emergency Response Com- mission (SERC) was created in accordance with a federallaw that establishes requirements for federal, state andlocal governments, and private industry regarding emer-gency response planning. The membership of the SERCincludes representatives from private industry, and state and local agencies. The SERC is a subcommittee of theCouncil and deals with hazardous chemical type emergen-cy hazards. Among other pu rposes, the SERC designates and oversees local emergency planning districts or com- mittees and facilitates prepar ation and implementation of emergency planning and preparedness. The Washington State Patrol Fire Protection Bureau . The Washington State Patrol Fire Protection Bureauprovides training to first responders on hazardous materialincidents and is the Incident Command Agency if an inci-dent occurs along any state route or interstate freeway.The terrorism unit offers trai ning and information regard- ing terrorism response and extremist groups. The trainingis meant for all first responde rs, but the terrorism unit also provides information to agen cies and people on these topics. Summary: The Intrastate Mutual Aid System is estab- lished to provide mutual assi stance in an emergency among political subdivisions and federally recognized Indian tribes that choose to participate in the system. Mutual assistance may be requested by any member juris-diction for: (1) response, m itigation, or recovery activities related to an emergency; or (2) participation in drills or exercises in preparation for an emergency. Membership of the Intrastate Mutual Aid Agreement . Member jurisdictions of the Intrastate Mutual Aid System include all political subdivisio ns and any federally recog- nized Indian tribe that has provided a declaration of itsintention to participate in th e system. A member jurisdic- tion that chooses to no longer participate in the Intrastate Mutual Aid System may subm it a notice to the Washing- ton Military Department declaring that it does not want toparticipate in the Intrastate Mutual Aid System. These provisions do not affect other mutual aid agreementspermitted by law, including the Washington State FireServices Mobilization and the Law EnforcementMobilization plans. Request for Assistance . Member jurisdictions of the Intrastate Mutual Aid Syst em may request and receiveassistance from other member jurisdictions for response, mitigation, or recovery activities related to an emergencyor participate in drills or exercises in preparation for anemergency, provided that: Prior to requesting assist ance, a requesting jurisdic- tion must: (1) have determined an emergency exists within its territorial limits; or (2) anticipate undertak- ing drills or exercises in preparation for emergency. The chief executive officer of a requesting jurisdic- tion (or his or her designee) must request assistancedirectly from the chief ex ecutive officer of another member jurisdiction. A ve rbal request for assistance will suffice; however, it mu st be confirmed in writing within 30 days. Assistance requested from another jurisdiction may be withheld or withdrawn at any time and for anyreason. A responding jurisdiction designates in writing all assistance it provides to a requesting member juris-diction at the time so long as it is consistent with the guidelines and procedures de veloped by the Interstate Mutual Aid Oversight Committee (Committee). This document must be delivered to the requesting juris- diction within 30 days after the assistance isprovided. The jurisdiction requesting assistance only has opera- tional control of the assistance provided and may notinterfere with a responding member jurisdiction's right to withdraw assistance. Reciprocity of Professional Qualifications . There is reciprocity for any emergency responder holding a license, certificate, or other permit ev idencing qualification in a professional, mechanical, or other skill, issued by Washington or a political subd ivision. That person is deemed to be licensed, cert ified, or permitted in the requesting member jurisdictio n for the duration of the emergency, drill, or exercise, subject to any limitationsand conditions that the chie f executive officer of the requesting member jurisdictio n has prescribed in writing. Injuries Under the Mutual Aid Agreement . If an emergency responder employee dies or is injured duringthe course of his or her employment while providing emer-gency responder assistance under the Intrastate MutualAid System, such an employee is only eligible for benefitsthat would otherwise be available for death or injuriessustained in the course of employment with the respond-ing member jurisdiction. An emergency responder is notan employee of the requesti ng member jurisdiction and is not entitled to any right, privilege, or benefit of employ-ment from the requesting memb er jurisdiction, including but not limited to, compensa tion, wages, salary, leave, pensions, or health benefits. Mutual Aid Reimbursement . A requesting member jurisdiction must reimburse a res ponding member ju-HB 1586 144risdiction for the true and full value of all assistance pro- vided under the Intrastate Mu tual Aid System. However, a responding member jurisdiction may donate assistanceto a requesting member jurisd iction under the mutual aid agreement. If a dispute regarding reimbursement arises between member jurisdictions, the member jurisdiction assertingthe dispute shall provide written notice to the other juris-diction identifying the dispute. If a resolution is notresolved within 90 days afte r receipt of the dispute notice by the other party, either party may invoke binding arbitra-tion to resolve the reimbursement dispute by giving writ- ten notice to the other party. Within 30 days after receipt of the notice invoking binding arbitration, each party mustfurnish the other with a list of acceptable arbitrators. Theparties shall select an arbitrator. If there is a failure toagree on an arbitrator, each party shall select one arbitratorand the two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator for anarbitration panel. Costs of the arbitration, including com-pensation for the arbitrator's services, must be borne equally by the parties participa ting in the arbitration. Each party bears its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and witness expenses, in connection with the arbitration proceeding. Immunity . For purposes of tort liability or immunity, an emergency responder of a responding member jurisdic- tion is considered an agent of the requesting member juris- diction. A responding ju risdiction providing assistance under the Intrastate Mutual Ai d System is not liable for any act or omission while providing or attempting to pro-vide assistance in good faith. Good faith does not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness. The Intrastate Mutual Aid Oversight Committee . The Intrastate Mutual Aid Oversi ght (Committee) is created as a subcommittee of the Counc il. The Committee consists of a maximum of five members who must be appointed bythe Council chair from Council membership. The chair ofthe Committee is the Washin gton Military Department representative appointed as a member of the Council.Meetings of the Committee must be held at least annually. The Committee must develop and update guidelines and procedures to facilitate implementation of the Intra-state Mutual Aid System.

By Representatives Seaquist, Haler, Jacks, Dammeier, Moscoso, Carlyle, Zeiger, Moeller, Kelley, Dahlquist and Jinkins; by request ofHigher Education Coordinating Board. House Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: A joint study conducted by the Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB), the State Boardfor Community and Technical Colleges, and the Work-force Training and Education Coordinating Board com-pares total supply of workers at three levels of education to the demand for workers educ ated at those levels. The 2009 report found that to prepare Washington residents tomeet employer demand and be competitive in the labormarket by 2016, there was a gap of over 5,000 degrees ateach level: sub-baccalaureate, baccalaureate, andgraduate. In 2009 the HECB examined the system of higher education and proposed a strategic framework to guidefuture investments. The HE CB found that institutions' planned growth for graduate degrees was insufficient tomeet Washington's higher ed ucation goals in all but two regions: the southwest region and the central and south-east region. Completed in December 2009, the SystemDesign Plan offers a framework for making decisionsabout how to reach the goal of increasing educational attainment in Washington. The Washington State University (WSU) and the University of Washington (UW) are the only two publicinstitutions of higher educ ation authorized to award research doctorate degrees in Washington. Eastern Wash-ington University is authoriz ed to award an applied doc- torate in physical therapy. The UW Bothell, the the WSU Vancouver, and the WSU Tri-Cities arebranch campuses of the tw o research universities autho- rized to award baccalaureate and master's level degrees. The HECB has a comprehensive and ongoing assess- ment process to determine the need for additional degreeprograms and locations for degree programs. If the HECBdetermines that there is a need for a change in level ofdegree, an examination of th e viability of the change is conducted. The HECB's recommendation on whether toproceed is then presented to the Governor and theLegislature. Summary: Subject to HECB approval, the UW and the WSU are authorized to develop doctoral degree programsat their branch campuses. The mission of branch campus-es is expanded to include the full range of graduateHouse 97 0Senate 47 0HB 1594 145degrees. The HECB will use its assessment process to determine whether the proposed doctoral level programsare needed and viable. In place of monitoring and evalu-ating the addition of lower di vision institutions, the HECB must monitor and evaluate th e growth of branch campuses and make recommendations to the Legislature as needed.

The JumpStart Coalition is a national organization that promotes financial education and is composed of over 180public and private partners w ith state affiliates, including one in Washington. The JumpStart Coalition has adoptedpersonal financial literacy learning standards for grades K-12, which the Partnership has recommended for adoptionas the EALRs for Washington schools.Summary: All members of the Partnership are appointedfor two-year terms of service except the representativefrom the Department of Financ ial Institutions. Excluding legislative members, the terms of service are staggered sothat half of the members within each category are appoint-ed for a one-year term, and then a two-year term thereafter.Appointments under these provisions must be made byAugust 1, 2011. School districts are encour aged to voluntarily adopt the JumpStart Coalition Na tional Standards in K-12 Personal Finance Education and provide students anopportunity to master them.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1595 C 138 L 11 Regarding graduates of foreign medical schools. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Cody, Appleton andGreen). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: The Medical Quality Assurance Commis- sion (MQAC) is responsibl e for the licensure and discipline of physicians. A physician who graduates from a medical school within the Un ited States or Canada must meet a variety of qualifications, including: graduation from medical school; passage of an examination; and completion of two years of post-graduate medical training.The two years of post-graduate training (which includes internships, residenc ies, and fellowships) must be in a program acceptable to the MQAC. The MQAC only approves programs accredited by the AccreditationCouncil for Graduate Medical Education, the RoyalCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, or theCollege of Family Ph ysicians of Canada. Graduates of foreign medi cal schools (other than those in Canada) must meet the same requirements asgraduates from domestic school s, including the two years of post-graduate medical trai ning. In addition, foreign medical school graduates must pass the examination given by the Educational Council fo r Foreign Medical Graduates and be able to read, write, speak, understand, and beunderstood in English.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1596 C 139 L 11 Concerning requirements th at cities and towns with ambulance utilities allocate fu nds toward the total cost necessary to regulate, operate, and maintain the ambulance utility. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Tharinger, Nealey, Haler, Takko, Walsh and Fitzgibbon). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: The legislative authority of a city or town (city) may establish an ambu lance service utility under limited circumstances. If a private licensed ambulanceservice exists in the city, the legislative authority mayestablish an ambulance utility on ly after first determining that the existing private ambulance service does not adequately serve the city or a substantial portion of the city. The city must then a llow the existing private ambu- lance service at least 60 days to meet generally acceptedmedical standards and reasonable levels of service. If the existing private ambulance servi ce fails to meet this stan- dard within the required tim eframe, the city may either issue a call for bids or establish an ambulance service util-ity. A city that establishes an ambulance service utility is authorized to set and coll ect rates and charges in an amount sufficient to regulate , operate, and maintain the utility. Before establishing rates and charges, the legisla-tive authority must complete a cost of service study andidentify the portion of the total costs that are attributable toavailability of ambulance service and those that are attrib-utable to the demand for ambu lance service. Availability costs relate to the costs of basic infrastructure needed to respond to calls for service. Demand costs relate to theburden placed on the ambulan ce service by individual calls for ambulance service. The fee charged by the utility must reflect a combina- tion of the availability cost and the demand cost, and they must reflect exemptions for persons who are Medicaid-eligible and who reside in a nursing facility, boarding home, adult family home, or receive in-home services. A city operating the ambula nce service utility is obli- gated to support the utility w ith a substantial contribution of emergency medical services (EMS) levy funds andgeneral fund revenues. The EMS levy funds must beapplied to an ambulance servi ce utility in an amount pro- portionate to the percentage of ambulance service costs to the total combined operatin g costs for EMS and ambu- lance services. General fund revenues must be applied asfollows: A city that operated an ambulance service prior to May 5, 2004, must maintain at least 70 percent of its prior local general fund support for ambulance service. A city that operated an ambulance service before May 6, 2004, and that co-mingled general fund dollars andambulance fund dollars may reasonably estimate the portion of general fund dollars applied toward theoperation of the service. It must continue to apply at least 70 percent of that es timated amount toward the support of the ambulance utility. A city that established an ambulance utility after May 6, 2004, must allocate, from its general fund or emer- gency service levy funds or a combination of both, anamount equal to at least 70 percent of the total costs necessary to regulate, operate, and maintain theambulance service as of May 5, 2004, or the date theutility is established. Revenue generated by the utili ty must be deposited in a separate fund or funds to be used only for regulating, operating, and maintaining the utility. Total revenue gen-erated by the utility must not exceed the total costsnecessary for regulating, operating, and maintaining theutility service. Summary: After January 1, 2012, the legislative author- ity of a city or town that operates an ambulance service utility may reduce its allocatio n of general fund revenues to the utility below the level re quired prior to the effective date of the act. However , before reducing its general fund allocation, the city's legisla tive body must hold a public hearing, preceded by at least 30 days' notice provided with ratepay-ers' utility bills. At the public hearing, the legislative body must allow for public comm ent and present the utility's most recent cost of service study, a summary of the utility'scurrent revenue sources, a proposed budget reflecting thereduced allocation of genera l fund revenues, any proposed change to utility rates, and any anticipated impact on the ambulance service utility's level of service.House 95 1Senate 48 0E2SHB July 22, 2011 E2SHB 1599 PARTIAL VETO C 288 L 11 Establishing the pay for ac tual student success dropout prevention program. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives and Ormsby). House Committee on Education House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: A 2007 report entitled The Costs and Ben- efits of an Excellent Education for All of America's Children found that the benefit to taxpayers of a prevented dropout, over the adult working lifetime of the individual,has a present value of appr oximately $236,000 in 2009 dollars. This represents a savings of public expense ofapproximately $10,500 per year for that individual. There are a number of ways to represent high school dropout and graduation rates. According to the Office ofthe Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), in the 2009-10 school year: An average of 4.6 percent of students in each of grades nine through 12 drop out each year. Annual drop-out rates are higher for 12th grade students (7.3 percent) th an for ninth grade students (3.4 percent). For the class of 2010, 76.5 percent of students gradu- ated with a high school diploma within four years of entering high school. If students who took longer than four years to earn a diploma are included, the extended graduation rate for the class of 2010 was 82.6 percent. There are significant di fferences in dropout and grad- uation rates across groups of students and acrossschool districts.The Building Bridges Drop out Prevention and Inter- vention Program (Building Br idges) has provided state grants to local consortia of high schools and community- based organizations. An evaluation of the grant projects in2009 found that key interim measures associated withreduced dropout rates include: increased earned credits towards graduation; increase in the percentage of students on track for on-time graduation; and reduction in school risk behaviors (suspensions). In 2009 the Opportunity Internship Program was created to provide financial incentives for consortia of businesses, high schools, wo rkforce development coun- cils, and others to provide mentoring, internships, and counseling for low-income high school students to encour-age them to pursue postse condary education and high- demand occupations. In 2010 funds were appropriated tothe OSPI to support a national dropout prevention pro-gram called Jobs for America' s Graduates, which includes instruction, employability sk ills, mentoring, job place- ment, and leadership training. The College Success Foun-dation is a Washington non-profit organization that hasreceived state funds to administer various college scholar-ship programs and provide college and career advising,counseling, and community mentor programs for highschool students. In 2009 the K-12 Data Governance group was estab- lished to develop policies, protocols, and definitions forcollecting data from school districts and for adding newcollection requirements throug h the student information system. Summary: The Pay for Actual Student Success Program (PASS) is created to invest in proven dropout prevention and intervention programs and to provide an annual finan-cial award for high schools that demonstrate improvementin dropout prevention indicators. Dropout Prevention Programs . If funds are appropri- ated for this purpose, funds ar e allocated as specified in the budget to support the PASS through the followingprograms: 1. the Opportunity Internship Program; 2. the Jobs for America's Graduates Program; 3. the Building Bridges, to be used to expand programs that have been determined to be successful in reduc- ing dropout rates or to replicate these programs in new partnerships; and 4. individual student support services provided by a college scholarship organization with expertise inmanaging scholarships for lo w-income high potential students, including college and career advising, coun- seling, and community mentor programs. Dropout Prevention Indicators . The OSPI, in consul- tation with the State Board of Education, must annually calculate the following for each high school: 1. the extended graduation rate, which may be statisti- cally adjusted for student demographics in the school; 2. the proportion of students at grade level, calculated based on earned credits and using a standard defini-tion; 3. the proportion of students who are suspended or expelled, not including in- school suspensions; andHouse 63 33 Senate 45 3SHB 1600 148 4. a student attendance measure, beginning in 2012-13, using an indicator adopted by the OSPI and a standard definition of a student absence. The OSPI may add indicators to the list, but must rely on data collected through th e student information system to the maximum extent possib le. The K-12 Data Gover- nance group must establish parameters for the collection of student attendance data and student discipline data. School districts must subm it attendance and discipline data for high school students for purposes of the PASSbeginning in 2012-13. Performance Metric . The OSPI must develop a metric for measuring performance on the dropout preven- tion indicators that assigns po ints and results in a dropout prevention score. The score must be weighted so that nohigh school qualifies for an award without an increase inits extended graduation rate. The OSPI may establish aminimum level of improvement to qualify for a PASSaward. Award . If funds are appropriated for this purpose, each year beginning in the 2011-12 school year, a highschool that demonstrates improvement in its dropoutprevention score compared to a baseline year is eligible to receive a PASS award. The award amount is determinedby the OSPI based on appropriated funds and eligible highschools. The Legislature's inte nt is to provide an award commensurate with the degr ee of improvement and the size of the school. A minimum award amount must beestablished. The OSPI must establish objective criteria toprioritize awards to high schoo ls with the greatest need for assistance if there are not sufficient funds to provide anaward for each school. Hi gh schools receiving awards may be required to demonstrate a community match. Use of Award. Ninety percent of an award is allocated to the high school, and 10 percent is allocated to the schooldistrict. Award funds may be used on a variety of listedactivities, including strategi es to close the achievement gap, graduation coaches, comprehensive guidance andplanning programs, parent en gagement activities, dropout early warning data systems, and early learning programsfor pre-kindergarten students. Award recipients are encour aged to implement drop- out prevention and reengagement strategies in a compre-hensive and systematic manner. Graduation coaches aredefined as staff who work in consultation with counselors and are assigned to identify and provide specified earlyintervention services to students. Support and Accountability . The OSPI regularly informs schools about the PA SS and the activities likely to increase the PASS awards. Within available funds, theOSPI develops strategies for identifying and disseminat-ing successful programs and may offer support andassistance through regional networks. Award funds may be withheld if the OSPI finds that schools or districts have willfully manipulated theirdropout prevention indicators. A non-appropriated HighSchool Completion Account (Account) is established to receive legislative appropriat ions for the PASS, federal funds, gifts, or grants. Expenditures of funds in theAccount are authorized by th e OSPI and are used to make investments in the four spec ified prevention programs and to make PASS awards. This act is null and void if not funded in the State Omnibus Operating Appropriations Act.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the intent section of the act. VETO MESSAGE ON E2SHB 1599 May 10, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 1, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1599 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to establishing the pay for actual student success dropout prevention program.\"To the extent funding is provided in the appropriations act by June 30, 2011, this legislation provides resources to schools and school districts that improve va rious student engagement and suc- cess factors that lead to more high school graduations. The legis- lation sets forth the data used to determine whether schools and districts are eligible for the incentives authorized. Section 1 is an intent section that discusse s various experiences of schools and principles of law, and is not necessary to interpret or implement the substantive provis ions of the bill. For this rea- son, I have vetoed Section 1 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1599. With the exception of Sectio n 1, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1599 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SHB 1600 C 209 L 11 Concerning elementary math specialists. By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Probst, Anderson, Maxwell andRoberts). House Committee on Education House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: Professional Educator Standards Board . The purpose of the Professional Educator Standards BoardHouse 54 42 Senate 40 6 (Senate amended)House 56 41 (House concurred) SHB 1614 149(PESB) is to establish policies and requirements for the preparation and certification of education professionals,ensuring that they: are competent in the professional knowledge and practice for which they are certified; have a foundation of skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary to help students with diverse needs, abili- ties, cultural experiences, and learning styles that meet or exceed the state learning goals; and are committed to research-based practice and career- long professional development.The PESB also serves as an advisory body to the Superintendent of Public In struction on issues related to educator recruitment, hiring, mentoring and support, pro- fessional growth, retention, evaluation, and revocation and suspension of licensure. Teaching Endorsements . A teacher must have an endorsement to his or her te aching certificate in order to teach a particular subject. At the secondary level, endorse-ments are based on specific a cademic subjects (e.g., math- ematics, science, English, etc.). In contrast, a teacher with an elementary education endorsement may teach any academic subject to studen ts in grades kindergarten through 8. The PESB has created a procedure for adding special- ty endorsements that are not required by law for the teach-er to teach that subject. To date, there are five specialtyendorsements: (1) deaf edu cation; (2) environmental and sustainability education; (3 ) teacher of the visually impaired; (4) orientation an d mobility teacher; and (5) gifted education. A number of states, including Michigan, Ohio, Virgin- ia, and Arizona, have create d some form of endorsement in teaching elementary mathematics. In some cases thestate requires this endorsement for teaching certain gradelevels; in other cases the en dorsement is an optional supplement. Summary: The PESB is encouraged to develop standards and adopt a specialty endorsement for an Elementary Mathematics Specialist (Speci alist). A Specialist is a certificated teacher who has demonstrated the followingknowledge and skills: enhanced mathematics content knowledge and skills necessary to provide studen ts, in grades kindergarten through 8, with a deep un derstanding of the essential academic learning requirements and performance expectations in mathematics; knowledge and skills in a variety of instructional strategies for teaching mathematics content; and knowledge and skills in instructional strategies targeted for students st ruggling in mathematics. School districts are encouraged to use Specialists for direct instruction of studen ts using an itinerant teacher model where the Specialist moves from classroom to classroom within the school.School districts may work with local colleges and uni- versities, educator preparation programs, and educationalservice districts to develop and offer training and profes-sional development opportun ities in the knowledge and skills necessary for a teacher to be considered a Specialist.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1614 C 143 L 11 Concerning the traumatic brain injury strategic partnership. By House Committee on Early Learning & Human Servic- es (originally sponsored by Representatives Dickerson, Rodne, Hope, Van De Wege and Kenney). House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: In 2007 Second Subs titute House Bill 2055 was enacted, creating the Wa shington Traumatic Brain Injury Strategic Partnership Advisory Council (Advisory Council) as an advisory coun cil to the Governor, Legisla- ture, and the Secretary of the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). The Advisory Council is made up of a wide variety of individuals appointed by the Governor as follows: the Secretary or the Se cretary's designee from the DSHS; representatives from th e Children's Administration, the Mental Health Division, the Aging and Disability Services Administration, and the Division of V ocational Rehabilitation; the Executive Director of a state brain injury association; a representative from a nonprofit organization serving individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI); the Secretary or designee of the Department of Health; the Secretary or designee of the Department of Commerce; a representative from an organization serving veterans; a representative from the National Guard; a representative of a Native American tribe located in Washington;House 73 24 Senate 46 2SHB 1614 150 the Executive Director of the Washington Protection and Advocacy System; a neurologist who has experience with working with individuals with TBI; a neuropsychologist wh o has experience working with persons with TBI; a rehabilitation specialist, such as a speech patholo- gist, vocational rehabilitatio n counselor, occupational therapist, or physical therapist who has experience working with persons with TBI; two individuals with TBI; two family members of individuals with TBI; and two members of the public who have experience with issues related to the causes of TBI.The initial appointments to the Advisory Council were to be made by September 2007. The initial terms were to run for three years and were staggered. The Advisory Council annually elects a chairperson. Duties of the Advisory Council include: collaboration with the DSHS to develop a compre- hensive statewide plan to address the needs of individuals with TBI; providing recommendations to the DSHS on criteria to be used to select pr ograms facilitating support groups for individuals with TBI and their families; by December 2007, submitting a report to the Legislature and Governor on:1. the development of a comprehensive statewide information and referral network for individuals with TBI; 2. the development of a statewide registry to collect data regarding individuals with TBI; and 3. efforts of the DSHS to provide services for individuals with TBI; by December 2007, reviewing the preliminary com- prehensive statewide plan developed by the DSHS tomeet the needs of indi viduals with TBI; and submitting a report to the Legislature and the Governor containing comments and recommenda-tions regarding the plan.The Traumatic Brain Inju ry Account (Account) is funded by $2 of the fee imposed for certain traffic infrac- tions. Moneys in the Accoun t may only be spent after appropriation and may be used only to provide a publicawareness campaign and services relating to TBI, forinformation and referral services, and for costs of requiredDSHS staff providing support to the Advisory Council.The Secretary of the DSHS has the authority to administerthe funds. Summary: Composition of the Advisory Council . The composition of the Advisory Council is changed. Some members are to be appointed by the Governor and some members will be representatives from state agencies.Added to the members who must be appointed by the Governor are the following: an individual with expert ise in working with children with TBI; and a physician who has experience working with persons with TBI. Changes are made to the agency representatives who shall be members: a representative from the Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery Services is added; and a designee replaces the Executive Director of the State Brain Injury Association. If any of the agencies is renamed, reorganized, or eliminated, the Director or Secretary of the agency that assumes the responsibilities of the previous agency must designate a substitute representative. The provisions regarding st aggered appointments are removed. Duties of the Advisory Council and Reporting Re- quirements . In collaboration with the DSHS, the Advisory Council must develop and revise as needed a Comprehen-sive Statewide Plan to addr ess the needs of individuals with TBI. The Advisory Co uncil must, in collaboration with the DSHS, develop and submit a report to theLegislature and the Governor regarding: identification of the ac tivities for the Ad visory Coun- cil in the implementatio n of the Comprehensive Statewide Plan; recommendations fo r the revisions to the Comprehensive Statewide Plan; and recommendations for a council staffing plan for council support. The initial report is due on January 15, 2013, and every two years thereafter. In response to the re commendations from work performed in collaboration with the Advisory Council, the DSHS must include in the Comprehensive Statewide Plan a staffing plan for adequate support activities of the Advi- sory Council for positions fu nded by the Account. The requirement for the DSHS to designate a staff person toprovide support for the Advisory Council is changed torequire the DSHS to designate at least one staff person. The Comprehensive Statewide Plan must address the needs of individuals impacted by TBI, not just those indi- viduals with TBI. In creating the plan, the feasibility ofestablishing agreements with tribal governments should be considered. Timelines . The timelines set forth in the enabling Legislation are removed, such as those regarding initial appointments to the Advisory Council, preliminary reports regarding recommendations for a Comprehensive State- wide Plan, and the developmen t of a statewide referral and information network.HB 1618 151Authority and Duties of the Department of Social and Health Services . The requirements are removed that the DSHS must secure funding to develop housing for indi- viduals suffering with TBI by leveraging federal andprivate fund sources, expand support group services withan emphasis on individuals with TBI returning from active military duty, establish traini ng and outreach to first responders and emergency me dical staff for care for individuals with TBI, and improve awareness of healthinsurance coverage options. The DSHS no longer is required to issue a yearly re port to the Governor and Leg- islature which contains a summary of actions taken by theDSHS to meet the needs of individuals with TBI and rec-ommendations for improvemen ts in services to address the needs of individuals with TBI. The DSHS has the authority to accept and expend or retain any gifts, bequests, contributions, or grants fromprivate persons or private and public agencies to carry out the purpose of the program. Instead of ins tituting a public awareness campaign using funds from the Account, the DSHS must conduct apublic awareness campaign. The DSHS is not required toconduct the public awareness campaign by a specific date. The DSHS expressly must provide funding from the Account for programs that fac ilitate support groups to in- dividuals with TBI injuries and their families. These pro-grams are no longer required to be funded solely from the Account. Traumatic Brain Injury Account . Moneys in the Account may be used only af ter appropriation and only to support the activities in the Statewide Traumatic Brain In- jury Comprehensive Plan to provide a public awarenesscampaign, information and referral services, and costs ofrequired staff of the DSHS providing support to theAdvisory Council.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1618 C 30 L 11 Addressing public utility dist ricts and deferred compensa- tion and supplemental savings plans. By Representatives Sells, Crouse, Dunshee, McCoy, Liias, Kristiansen and Pearson. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Public utility districts (PUDs) are created by and for the communities th ey serve. Public utility districts may provide water, electricity, conservation, and telecommunications services depending on the needs oftheir customers. Washington has 28 public utility districts that serve more than 2.2 m illion customers. Each PUD is governed by a board of three elected commissioners whoserve staggered six-year terms. If a PUD employee or official is not a member of the state retirement system, the district may contract for anyone or more of the following and pay the applicable pre- miums out of operation revenue from district properties: individual annuity contracts; or retirement income policies or group annuity con- tracts, including prior servi ce, to provide a retirement plan.Public utility districts may continue to make these premium payments after an employee retires if the employee was employed on or after August 6, 1965. Aretired employee, however, must not be paid more than acurrent employee. This practice is known as deferredcompensation. Public utility districts have general author-ity to participate in the state's deferred compensation planthrough the Department of Retirement Services, subject tofederal and state requirements. Summary: The authority of PUDs providing water or electric utilities is modified to expressly allow any deferred compensation or supplemental savings retirementplan to be established and ma intained by a PUD for eligi- ble employees and officials. The term contribution includes contributions made: on behalf of an eligible employee and equal to the amount the employee agrees to in compensation reduction; and by the PUD, separate from amounts otherwise intended for earnings. Public utility district employees and officials are also eligible for membership and participation in any public employee pension system. Contributions must be deposited in a designated account or held in trust as a public retirement fund. Alter- natively, contributions must be remitted to an insurer. Contributions may be deposited or invested in a banking institution or an investment or insurance company. Public utility districts, including employees or offi- cials and commissioners, are not liable for activity relatedto individual account plan s in which an individual participant self-manages his or her retirement account.

By Representatives Hunter, Bailey, Seaquist, Hinkle, Moeller and Carlyle. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Plans 3 of the Washington State Retire- ment Systems, those in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS), and the School Employees Retirement System (SERS) arehybrid plans\u2014they have both a defined benefit or guaran-teed benefit portion and a defined contribution portion.Employer retirement contributions are made to the PERSPlan 2/3 pension fund to support the future defined benefitpayments, and employee cont ributions are made to an individual defined contribution member account. Upon employment, a new member of the PERS, SERS, or TRS faces a series of choices. First, a memberhas 90 days to choose between membership in Plan 2 orPlan 3. If the member does not choose, he or she perma-nently defaults into Plan 3. A new member of Plan 3 must also choose an employee co ntribution rate. The Depart- ment of Retirement Systems has established several con-tribution rate options between the minimum rate of 5percent up to a maximum of 15 percent. If an employeedoes not choose a contribution ra te, he or she defaults into the minimum 5 percent rate. New members of Plan 3 must also choose a invest- ment option for their member contributions. If they do notchoose an option, they are de faulted into having their member contribution invested by the State Investment Board (SIB), which means that they effectively own asmall portion of the common fu nd in which the assets for the guaranteed benefits of the Washington State Retire- ment Systems are invested , known as the Commingled Trust Fund. Many other investment options are availablefor members that do not defau lt, including retirement strat- egy funds tailored for individuals with projected retire-ment dates between the years 2000 and 2055. In general,the retirement strategy funds are diversified asset alloca-tion portfolios designed for members who want to leaveongoing investment decisions to experienced portfoliomanagers. The asset mix of the retirement strategy fundsare adjusted by the managers over time to the allocationdeemed appropriate for the targeted retirement date. Summary: The default investment option for new mem- bers of the Plans 3 of the Public Employees' Retirement System, the Teachers' Retirement System, and the SchoolEmployees Retirement System is changed from shares inthe common pension fund invested by the State Invest-ment Board to an offered retire ment strategy fund with the retirement date closest to the retirement target date of the member.

By House Committee on General Government Appropria- tions & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representa-tives Takko, Angel, Morris and Armstrong). House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy Background: One-number Locator Service . A single statewide telephone number ex ists for referring excavators to the appropriate one-number locator service. A one- number locator service is operated by nongovernmentalentities and is a means by which a person can notify utili-ties of excavation and request field marking ofunderground facilities. All owners of underground facilities within a one- number locator service area are required to subscribe toone-number locator service. If no one-number locator service is available, notice of a proposed excavation must be provided to the owners of underground facilities known to or suspected of having unde rground facilities within the area of proposed excavation. The notice must be commu- nicated to the owners of un derground facilities not less than two business days but not more than 10 business daysbefore the scheduled date for commencement of excava- tion, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If a transmis- sion pipeline company is no tified that excavation work will occur near a pipeline, a representative of the companymust be present and consu lt with the excavator on-site prior to excavation. An underground facility means any item buried or placed below ground for use in connection with thestorage or conveyance of water, sewage, electronic, tele-phonic or telegraphic communications, cablevision, elec-tric energy, petroleum products, gas, gaseous vapors,hazardous liquids, or other substances and including, butnot limited to, pipes, sewers , conduits, cables, valves, lines, wires, manholes, attachments, and those parts ofpoles or anchors below gro und. An underground facility also includes gas or hazard ous liquid pipelines, as well as distribution systems owned and operated for the sale,delivery, or distribution of natural gas at retail. Penalties . A civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation applies when a person fails to notify theHouse 96 0Senate 48 0E2SHB 1634 153one-number locator service and causes damage to under- ground facilities. Some civil penalties collected are deposited into the State Gene ral Fund and other penalties are paid into the Pipeline Safe ty Account. Any excavator who willfully or maliciously damages a field markedunderground facility is liable for treble the costs incurred in repairing or relocating th e facility. Any excavator who fails to notify the one-number locator service and causesdamage to a hazardous liquid or gas pipeline is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.Any excavator who excavates within 35 feet of a transmis-sion pipeline without a valid excavation confirmation codeis guilty of a misdemeanor. Utilities and Transp ortation Commission . The Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) regulatesutilities and transportation services in the state to ensurefair pricing, availability, reliability, and safety. The UTCregulates intrastate pipelines , while the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safe ty Administration (PHM- SA) regulates interstate pipe lines. Since 2003 the UTC has been the lead inspector of all interstate pipelines in the state, certified by the PHMS A to make inspections based on federal regulations. Summary: Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act . Various provisions regarding underground facilities are adopted, to be known and c ited as the Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act (Damage Prevention Act). Effective Date . The Damage Prevention Act takes effect January 1, 2013. Failure to Subscribe to a One-number Locator Ser- vice. Failure of a facility operator to subscribe to a one- number locator service constitut es willful intent to avoid compliance with the Da mage Prevention Act.

Before commencing any excavation, an excavator mustmark the boundary of the excavation area with white paintapplied to the ground of th e worksite and then provide notice of the scheduled commencement of excavation toall facility operators through a one-number locatorservice. If boundary marking is infeasible, an excavator must communicate directly with affected facility operators to ensure that the boundary of the excavation area is accu-rately identified. If an excav ator intends to work at multi- ple sites or at a large project, the excavator must takereasonable steps to confer w ith facility operators to enable them to locate underground facilities reasonably inadvance of the start of exca vation for each phase of the work. Responsibility to Mark Underground Utilities by Facility Operator . Upon receipt of the notice, a facility operator must, with respect to the facility operator's locat- able underground facilities, provide the excavator withreasonably accurate information by marking their loca-tion. If a facility operator's underground utilities are unlo- catable or identified but unlo catable, the facility operatormust provide the excavator w ith available information as to their location. If an underground facility in volves service laterals, the facility operator is required to designate the presence of service laterals, if the servic e laterals: (1) connect end users to the facility operator's main utility line; and (2) arewithin a public right-of-way or utility easement and the boundary of the excavation area . The service lateral facil- ity operator may comply with the requirement to designate service laterals through seve ral methods, including plac- ing marks indicating the presence of underground facili-ties, arranging to meet excavat ors at worksites to provide available information, or by providing copies of the best reasonably available records. A facility operator's goodfaith attempt to comply const itutes full compliance, and no person may be found liable fo r damages or injuries result- ing from such compliance, apart from liability for arrang-ing for repairs or relocation of underground facilities. If the underground facility involves service laterals conveying only water, a facility operator is not required todesignate the presence these service laterals if their pres-ence can be determined from other visible water facilities, such as water meters, water valve covers, and junction boxes in or adjacent to the bo undary of an excavation area. Responsibility to Maintain Markings by Excavator . Once marked by a facility operator, an excavator is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the facilityoperator's markings of unde rground facilities for the lesser of: (1) 45 calendar days from the date that the excavator provided notice to a one-number locator service; or (2) theduration of the project. An excavator that makes repeated requests for location of underground facilities due to itsfailure to maintain the accuracy of a facility operator'smarkings may be charged by the facility operator forservices provided. Exemptions from Standard One-number Locator Service Requirements . Under certain conditions, the following excavation activitie s are exempt from standard one-number locator service requirements: an emergency excavation; an excavation of less than 12 inches in depth on private noncommercial property; the tilling of soil for agricultural purposes less than 12 inches in depth within a utility easement, and 20 inches in depth outsid e of a utility easement; the replacement of an official traffic sign installed before January 1, 2013; road maintenance activities involving excavation less than six inches in depth below the original road gradeand ditch maintenance activ ities involving excavation less than six inches in depth; the creation of bar holes le ss than 12 inches in depth, or of any depth during emergency leak investigations; or E2SHB 1634 154 construction, operation, or maintenance activities by an irrigation district on rights-of-way, easements, or facilities owned by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation in federal reclamation projects. If an excavator in the course of performing an exempt- ed excavation contacts or da mages an underground facili- ty, the excavator must still notify the facility operator and a one-number locator service, and report the damage usingthe UTC's damage informat ion reporting tool (DIRT). Bar hole is defined as a hole made in the soil or pave- ment with a hand-operated bar for the specific purpose oftesting the subsurface atmosphe re with a combustible gas indicator. Reporting of Damage to Underground Utilities . Facil- ity operators and excavators who observe or cause damageto an underground facility mu st report the damage to the UTC within 45 days, or sooner if required by law, using the UTC's virtual private DIRT report form, or other simi-lar form. The UTC must use re ported data to evaluate the effectiveness of the Damage Prevention Program. A non-pipeline facility operator conducting an exca- vation, or a subcontractor conducting an excavation on thefacility operator's behalf, that strikes the facility operator'sown underground facility is no t required to report that damage to the UTC. Construction or Excavation within 100 Feet of a Transmission Pipeline . When planning construction or excavation within 100 feet, or greater distance if requiredby local ordinance, of a right-of-way or utility easementcontaining a transmission pi peline, the state and any unit of local government must notify the pipeline company ofthe scheduled commencement of work. Any unit of local government that issues permits under the State Building Code Act, when permitting con-struction or excavation within 100 feet, or greater distance if required by local ordinance, of a right-of-way or utility easement containing a transmission pipeline must: (1)notify the pipeline company of the permitted activity when it issues the permit; or (2) re quire the applicant consult with the pipeline company as a condition of issuing the permit. The UTC is directed to assist local governmentsin obtaining hazardous liqui d and gas pipeline location information and maps. Damage Prevention Account . The Damage Preven- tion Account (Account) is crea ted in the custody of the State Treasurer. All receipts from moneys directed by lawor the UTC must be deposited to the Account. Only the UTC or a designee of the UTC may authorize expendituresfrom the Account. Expenditures from the Account may beused only for educational programming designed toimprove worker and public sa fety relating to excavation and underground facilities and for grants to persons who have developed educational programming for improvingworker and public safety relating to excavation and underground facilities. Safety Committee . The UTC is directed to contract with a statewide, nonprofit entity whose purpose is toreduce damages to undergr ound and above ground facili- ties, promote safe excavation practices, and review com- plaints of alleged violations of the Damage PreventionAct. The purpose of the cont ract is to create a 13-member Safety Committee to: (1) ad vise the UTC and other state agencies, the Legislature, an d local governments on best practices and training to prevent damage to undergroundutilities, and policies to enhan ce worker and public safety; and (2) review complaints a lleging violations involving practices related to underground facilities. The SafetyCommittee must consist of members who represent abroad range of underground utility stakeholders. In reviewing complaints of alleged violations, the Safety Committee must appoint at least three and not morethan five members as a Review Committee. The ReviewCommittee must include the same number of membersrepresenting excavators and facility operators and also include a member representing the insurance industry.One member representing facility operators must also be arepresentative of a pipeline company or a natural gas company. Any person may bring a co mplaint to the Safety Committee regarding an alleged violation. Before review- ing a complaint alleging an underground utilities violation, the Review Committee must not ify the person making the complaint and the alleged violator of its review and of theopportunity to participate in the review process. The Safety Committee may provide written notifica- tion to the UTC, with suppor ting documentation, that a person has likely committed a violation of the Damage Prevention Act, and recommen d remedial action that may include a penalty amount, training, or education. The con-tract must not obligate funding by the UTC for activitiesperformed by the nonprofit entity or the Safety Commit- tee. The UTC authorization to contract with a nonprofit entity expires December 31, 2020. The UTC Enforcement of Safety Committee's Review of Violation . The UTC may enforce civil penalties when it receives written notification from the Safety Committeeindicating that a violation of Damage Prevention Act haslikely been committed by a person subject to regulation by the UTC, or involvin g the underground facilities of such a person. If the UTC receives written notification from the Safe- ty Committee that a violatio n has likely been committed by a person who is not subj ect to regulation by the UTC, and in which the unde rground facility involved is also not subject to regulation by the UTC, the UTC may refer thematter to the Attorney Genera l for enforcement of a civil penalty. The UTC must prov ide funding for such enforce- ment. The court may award the state all costs of investi-gation and trial, including a reas onable attorneys' fee. Any costs and fees recovered by the Attorney General must beESHB 1635 155deposited by the UTC in the fund that paid for such enforcement. The UTC Enforcement of Pipeline Facilities . The UTC may investigate and enfo rce violations relating to pipeline facilities without initial referral to the SafetyCommittee. If the UTC's inves tigation relates to a Safety Committee's review of an alleged violation, the UTC mayimpose penalties and require tr aining or education or a combination of training an d education. The UTC must consider any recommendation by the Safety Committee regarding enforcement and remedial actions involving analleged violation relating to pipeline facilities. Civil Penalties . Any person who violates any provi- sion of the Damage Prevention Act that does not involve a hazardous liquid or gas underg round facility is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for an initial viola-tion, and not more than $5,000 for each subsequentviolation within a three-year period. Any person who willfully damages or removes a per- manent marking used to identify an underground facilityor pipeline, or a temporary marking prior to its intended use, is subject to a civil pe nalty of not more than $1,000 for an initial violation, and not more than $5,000 for each subsequent violation within a three-year period. All penalties recovered in such actions must be deposited in the Account. The UTC Reporting Requirements . By December 1, 2015, the UTC must report to the Legislature on the effec- tiveness of the Damage Prevention Program and includean analysis of damage data reported as required by the act. Authority of the UTC over Consumer-owned Utilities . Nothing in this act may be co nstrued to classify a consum- er-owned utility to be under the authority of the UTC. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2013 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section specifying that nothing in this act may be construed to classify a consumer-owned utility to be under the authority of the UTC. The Governor 's veto statement expressed concern that this section coul d be read to exempt consum- er-owned utilities from enfo rcement under the act, and thereby prevent the UTC from taking enforcement action on underground utility damage caused byconsumer- owner utilities. VETO MESSAGE ON E2SHB 1634 May 5, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to section 24, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to underground utilities.\" This bill strengthens our law for preventing damages tounderground pipelines and other ut ilities during excavation. The bill provides the Utilities and Transportation Commission with the authority to take enforcement acti on for violations, to require re- porting of damage to underground u tilities, and to de velop a stake- holder process to review vi olations and encourage better excavation practices. The bill provides a comprehensive damage prevention program fo r underground utilities. Pursuant to the House floor coll oquy on this bill, section 24 was intended to ensure that the bill would not result in regulation by the Utilities and Tr ansportation Commission of consumer-owned utilities such as electric cooperatives, muni cipal utilities and pub- lic utility districts, except when such a utility damages an under- ground facility subject to this bill, in which case the Commissionwould have the authority to enforc e the provisions of this act. While the House floor colloquy cl arifies legislat ive intent, the language in Section 24 could be read to exempt consumer-owned utilities from enforcement under th e bill, and thereby prevent the Commission from taking enforcement action on underground util-ity damage caused by consumer-o wner utilities. Since the lan- guage in this section does not c hange the statut ory independence of consumer-owned utilities in setting their rates and determiningtheir services, the section is not necessary. For these reasons, I have veto ed section 24 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634. With the exception of secti on 24, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1634 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor ESHB 1635 C 370 L 11 Concerning the administratio n of exams for and issuance and renewal of certain drivers' licenses and identicards. By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Upthegrove, Sullivan, Dammeier, Orwall,Warnick and Moscoso). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: An applicant for a new or renewed driver's license must successfully pass a driver licensing examina- tion to qualify for a driver's license. The Department of Licensing (DOL) is required to give examinations at loca- tions and times that are reasonably accessible. Thedriver's license examinatio n includes a written examina- tion that tests an applicant's knowledge of traffic laws and a driving examination that t ests an applicant's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The DOL may waive parts of the examination under cer tain conditions; for example, the DOL may waive the examin ation for a person renew- ing a license unless the DOL determines the person is notqualified to hold a driver's license. The DOL is responsible for overseeing the commer- cial driver training school program. Driver trainingschools, in addition to school districts, provide trafficHouse 93 4Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred) ESHB 1636 156safety education courses, which must be completed by an individual under the age of 18 before he or she can receivea driver's license. Driver training schools are licensed bythe DOL, and driver training schools must be annuallyapproved by the DOL. The DOL sets standards andrequirements for the driver training schools, including standards for curriculum and licensing driver trainingschool instructors. The DOL has standards and processesin place to suspend, revoke, and deny licenses to drivertraining schools. The Office of Superintendant of Public Instruction (OSPI) is responsible for overseeing traffic safety educa-tion courses provided by school districts. A person must receive a motorcycle endorsement to operate a motorcycle on public highways. A person mustpass both a knowledge test and a riding test to receive anendorsement. The DOL may waive the riding portion of the test for a person who completes a private motorcycleskills education course that has been approved by the DOL. Summary: Driver training schools licensed by the DOL and school districts that offer a traffic safety education program under the supervision of the OSPI are authorized to administer driver licensing examinations. In addition, motorcycle training schools that are under contract withthe DOL are authorized to administer the motorcycleendorsement examination. The DOL is required to adopt rules to oversee the driv- er training schools' administration of the driver's licenseexamination. Certain provision s are required to be includ- ed in the rules, su ch as oversight provisions. In addition, driver training schools are requ ired to enter into a contract with the DOL before a school may administer the driver's license examination, and the co ntract must contain certain provisions. The OSPI is required to wo rk in consultation with the DOL to develop standards for the administration of thedriver licensing examinations by school districts that are comparable to the standards required of driver training schools. In addition, school di stricts are required to enter into a contract with the DOL before a district may admin-ister the exams, and the contract must contain certainprovisions. If the DOL does not offer driver licensing examina- tions as a routine part of its licensing services within adepartment region because ad equate testing sites are of- fered by driver training scho ols or school districts, the DOL is required to administ er driver licensing examina- tions by appointment to app licants 18 years of age and older in at least one licensing office within each region. The DOL is required to include certain stakeholders in facilitating communication arou nd the transition to driver training schools and school districts administering the driver licensing examination.Liability for government entities, including school districts, and driver training schools is limited in connec-tion with administering the dr iver licensing examination. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1636 C 264 L 11 Concerning services performed by amateur sports officials. By House Committee on Labor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsored by RepresentativesUpthegrove, Nealey, Ormsby, Green, Maxwell, Sullivan, Cody, Moscoso and Billig). House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Unemployment benefits may be paid and unemployment contributions (taxes) may be owed depending on whether services are deemed to be employ- ment covered by the Employment Security Act. If so, ben-efits and taxes also depend on whether an exception test for independent contractors or an exclusion for certain ser- vices or persons applies. A \"services referral agency\" is a business that offers the services of an individual to perform specific tasks fora third party. Personal serv ices performed for a third party pursuant to a contract with a services referral agency are deemed to be employment fo r the agency when the agency is responsible for the payment of wages for those services.The Washington Court of Appeals recently concluded thatsuch services are not employment if: (1) the agency isresponsible only for promptly forwarding fees to an indi-vidual once the agency receives fees from the third party;and (2) the individual is no t otherwise entitled to payment. Summary: For unemployment compensation purposes,services performed by certain amateur sports officials, on a contest-by-contest basis, for interscholastic and recre-ational sports contests are excluded from employment.This exclusion does not apply to services for a state orlocal governmental entity, an Indian tribe, or certain nonprofit organizations. These services also are not considered employment for services referral agencies if an agency is not responsi-ble for payment to an offici al unless and until the agency is paid or reimbursed by a third party. House 97 1 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 95 1 (House concurred)HB 1640 157\"Amateur sports official\" is defined as a person who serves as a neutral participant in a sports contest where the players are not compensated.

By Representatives Green, Hinkle, Cody and Moeller.House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Background: A respiratory care practitioner (RCP) works with patients who have deficiencies and abnormal-ities affecting the cardiopulmo nary system and associated systems. A RCP must be licensed and registered in orderto practice, unless exempted, and must be under the orderand qualified medical direction of a physician. The practice of respiratory care covers an array of pro- cedures, including: (1) the administration of prescribedmedical gases; (2) postural drainage, chest percussion, andvibration; and (3) the inserti on of devices to draw, analyze, infuse, or monitor pressure in blood as prescribed by aphysician or an advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP). Summary: The types of practitioners under whose order and direction a RCP may practi ce are expanded to \"health care practitioners\" care to include: physicians; osteopathic physicians and surgeons; and the following professions acting within the scope of their respective licenses: (1) podiatric physicians andsurgeons; (2) ARNPs; (3) na turopaths; (4) physician assistants; and (5) osteopat hic physician assistants. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011HB 1649 C 9 L 11 Concerning reciprocity and statutory construction with regard to domestic partnerships. By Representatives Jinkins, Pedersen, Kenney, Sells, Appleton, Hurst, Haigh, Moeller, Hunter, Tharinger, Hunt, McCoy and Hasegawa. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: To enter into a state-registered domestic partnership, the two persons involved must: (1) share a common residence; (2) be at least 18 years old; (3) not be married to someone other than the other person and not be in a state-registered domestic partnership with anotherperson; (4) be capable of cons enting to the domestic part- nership; (5) not be nearer of kin to each other than secondcousins or be related in other ways; and (6) either be of the same sex or, if of different sexes, have one of thosepersons be 62 years old or older. A legal union of two persons of the same sex, except for a same-sex marriage, that is validly formed in another jurisdiction and that is subs tantially the same as a state- registered domestic partnership is recognized as adomestic partnership in this state. In Washington law, a section addressing rules of construction provides that for the purposes of interpreting the code, the terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband,wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family must beinterpreted as applying equally to domestic partnerships,to the extent the interpre tation does not conflict with federal law. Summary: A legal union of two persons, including a marriage, that was validly fo rmed in another jurisdiction and that is substantially equivalent to a Washington state-registered domestic partnershi p must be recognized as a valid domestic partnership in this state. The section regarding statutory interpretation is amended to explicitly state that it applies to any legislation hereafter enacted by the Legislature or by the peopleunless the legislation expressly states otherwise.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011House 94 0 Senate 48 0 House 98 0 Senate 49 0 House 58 39Senate 28 19SHB 1663 158SHB 1663 PARTIAL VETO C 198 L 11 Removing the requirement that institutions of higher education purchase from correctional industries. By House Committee on Higher Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Parker, Ormsby, Probst,Billig, Schmick, Fagan, Angel and Ahern). House Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: As agencies of Washington, institutions of higher education are subject to various laws related to gen- eral administration that include purchasing of equipment.Higher education institutions are required to purchasematerial, supplies, services , and equipment from correc- tional industries (inmate work programs) at the Depart- ment of Corrections (DOC) unl ess an institution of higher education satisfactorily demonstrates to the Director of theOffice of Financial Management (OFM) that the cost ofcompliance is greater than the value of benefits. Legislation enacted in 2004 required the Council of Presidents and the State Board for Community and Tech-nical Colleges (SBCTC) to: convene a correctional indus- tries business development ad visory committee and work collaboratively with correctional industries to reaffirmpurchasing criteria, update the approved list of productsthat higher education institutions must purchase, anddevelop recommendations on ways to continue to buildcorrectional industries' business with institutions of higher education; develop a plan to increase higher educationinstitution purchases from the DOC to be submitted to theLegislature by January 30, 2005; and establish targets forpurchases of 1 percent by May 30, 2006, and 2 percent byJune 30, 2006. In 2009 the OFM granted ex emptions to all six public baccalaureate institutions an d the SBCTC (on behalf of the community and technical colleges) from purchasing atleast 2 percent of their products from correctionalindustries. In 2010 an analysis conducted by the OFM found that on average, higher education institutions purchase about 9percent of their products from correctiona l industries. Summary: Public higher education institutions are no longer required to seek an exemption from the OFM with regards to purchasing fro m the DOC, and they must endeavor to assure the DOC has notifications of bid oppor-tunities with the goal of me eting or exceeding the two percent purchasing target. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section of the act which eliminat es the emergency clause. VETO MESSAGE ON SHB 1663 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 2, Substitute House Bill 1663 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the purchasing authority of institutions of higher education.\" This bill removes highe r education institutions from the require- ment to seek approval from the Office of Financial Management to be exempted from certain purchas ing from the Department of Cor- rections. Section 2 of this bill is an emerge ncy clause that is not necessary. Higher educ ation institutions hav e been exceeding the minimum 2% purchase target from Correctional Industries, and there is no need for the bill to go into effect immediately. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 2 of Substitute House Bill 1663. With the exception of Section 2, Substitute House Bill 1663 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SHB 1691 C 265 L 11 Concerning embalmers. By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Representatives Kirby, Anderson, Springer, Eddy, Ryu, Morris and Stanford). House Committee on Business & Financial ServicesSenate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: A person has the right to control the dispo- sition of his or her own remains. This can be accom-plished by executing a written document signed by thedecedent in the presence of a witness that expresses thedecedent's wishes regarding the place or method of dispo- sition. In addition, a person may control the disposition of his or her remains by maki ng a prearrangement with a licensed funeral establishmen t or cemetery authority. Prearrangements that are prepaid or that are filed with a licensed funeral establishment or cemetery authority arenot subject to cancellation or substantial revision by survivors. House 95 0 Senate 44 5 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred) HB 1694 159If the decedent has not made a prearrangement or giv- en directions for the disposition of his or her remains, then the right to control the dispos ition of the remains is given to the following people in the order named: the surviving spouse or state registered domestic partner; the surviving adult children; the surviving parents; the surviving siblings; and a person acting as a representative of the decedent under the signed authorization of the decedent. The responsibility for the re asonable costs of the prep- aration, care, and dispositio n of remains devolves jointly and severally upon all kin of the same degree of kindred in the order listed, and on the decedent's estate. If a funeralestablishment or cemetery author ity is unable to locate the next of kin or the legal representative of the decedent'sestate after a good faith effort then the most responsibleperson available may author ize the disposition of the decedent's remains, and the cemetery authority or funeralestablishment may not be held criminally or civilly liable for burying or cremating the remains. If or when a govern-ment agency provides funds for the disposition of humanremains and elects to provide funds for cremation only, the cemetery authority or funera l establishment may not be held civilly or criminally lia ble for cremating the remains. Counties are responsible for providing for the disposi- tion of the remains of any indigent person whose body isunclaimed by relatives or a church organization. Remainsof persons that will be buried at the public expense are required to be surrendered to a physician or surgeon.These bodies must be used for the advancement of ana-tomical science. Preference is given to medical schools inthis state for their use in the instruction of medical students. Embalmers are regulated by the Department of Licensing. In order to be licensed, an applicant mustcomplete the required edu cation in mortuary science, complete an embalmer inte rnship, and successfully pass an examination. Summary: The list of persons who have the right to control the disposition of remains if or when the decedent has not provided directions is revised as follows: The designated agent of the decedent is listed as the person with the first right to control the disposition. The designated agent must be indicated in a written document signed and dated by the decedent in thepresence of a witness. The direction of the desig-nated agent is sufficient to direct the type, place, and method of disposition. The categories for su rviving adult children and surviving siblings are change d to give the right to the majority of the children or siblings, rather than all children or siblings. The decedent's court-appo inted guardian is added as the last in the list of pe rsons who have the right to control the disposition. A cemetery authority or funeral establishment is not liable for cremating any human remains if or when the funds for the disposition of th e human remains are provid- ed by a charitable organization or government agency(regardless of whether funds are provided for cremationonly). A public agency required to provide for the disposi- tion of human remains at pu blic expense may surrender the remains to an accredited educational institution offer- ing funeral services and embalming programs. The bodiesmust be used in training embalming students under thesupervision of a licensed embalmer. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1694 C 31 L 11 Regulating unauthorized insurance. By Representatives Stanford and Kirby; by request of Insurance Commissioner. House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: Surplus Lines Insurance . Generally, an insurance company may not engage in the business ofinsurance in the state unless the insurance company isauthorized to do so by th e Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). \"Surpl us lines\" insurance coverage is an exception. Surplus lines insurance is coverage that cannot be procured fro m authorized insurance companies. Often, surplus lin es policies cover risks that do not fit normal underwriting patterns or fit standardinsurance policies. Unlike insurance offered by an autho-rized insurer, surplus lines in surance is not subject to rate and policy form oversight. If coverage cannot bepurchased from an authorized insurer, the coverage may be purchased from an unauthorized insurer through alicensed surplus lines broker if: a diligent effort is made to find the coverage from authorized insurers; and the purpose for using an unauthorized insurer is something other than secu ring a lower premium rate than would be accepted by any authorized insurer. The surplus lines broker must execute an affidavit set- ting forth the facts regarding the diligent effort and theHouse 97 0 Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)HB 1694 160purpose for using an unauthor ized insurer when insurance is purchased from an unauthori zed insurer. The affidavit must be filed with the OIC within 30 days after the purchase of the insurance. Licensing requirements regarding surplus lines brokers include: background checks, including fingerprints; minimum bonding amounts; record-keeping; and reporting. Capital Requirements for Unauthorized Insurers . A surplus lines broker must not knowingly place surplus lines insurance with an insu rer that is not financially sound. The surplus lines brok er must determine and doc- ument the financial condition of the unauthorized insurer before placing insurance with the insurer. The surpluslines broker may not place insurance with: any foreign insurer unless the insurer has at least $1.5 million in capital and $6 million of capital and surplus; any alien insurer unless the insurer has $15 million of capital and surplus and meet s specific requirements regarding the manner in which alien insurers must hold funds; any group including incorporated and individual insurers unless the group maintains a trust fund of $50 million as security and meets specific require- ments regarding the manner in which the group must hold funds; or any insurance exchange created by the laws of a state unless the exchange maintains capital and surplus of$50 million in the aggregate and meets other specific requirements for exchanges. Surplus Lines Premium Tax . A surplus lines broker must pay a premium tax of 2 percent on surplus lines insurance transacted by the broker. The tax is credited tothe State General Fund. If a surplus lines policy coversrisks or exposures that are only partially located in this state, the tax is computed upon the proportion of the risksor exposures located in this state. In 2010 the federal Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (House Resolution 4173) included provisions that addressed surplus linesregulation. The federal law: provides definitions; precludes any state other than the home state of an insured from taxing premiums on surplus lines insurance. allows states to enter into a compact to allocate taxes on risks that involve more than one state; limits the regulation of the placement of surplus lines insurance to the requiremen ts of the insured's home state, including the licensure of surplus lines brokers; prohibits a state from im posing a due diligence search on a surplus lines broker when the broker is seeking to procure insurance for an exempt commercial purchaser and certain criteria are met; prohibits states from collecting any fees relating to licensing of a surplus lines broker unless the state haslaws or regulations that provide for participation bythe state in a national un iform national database for the licensure of surplus lines brokers; prohibits a state from imposing eligibility require- ments on surplus lines insu rers domiciled in the United States unless the st ate has adopted nationwide uniform requirements, forms, and procedures, includ-ing alternative nationw ide uniform eligibility requirements; and prohibits states from preventing a surplus lines broker from placing surplus lines insurance with certain surplus lines insurers. Summary: Insured's Home State . \"Insured's home state\" is defined: for a business, as the state where an insured maintains its headquarters and where the insured's high-level officers direct, control, and coordinate the business activities of the insured; for an individual, as the individual's principal residence; or as the state to which the greatest percentage of the insured's taxable premium for that insurance contractis allocated if the entire insured risk is located out ofthis state. If more than one insured from an affiliated group are named insureds on a single insurance contract issued by an unauthorized insurer, the insured's home state is the homestate of the member of the affiliated group that pays thelargest percentage of premium. Surplus Lines Premium Tax . For property and casual- ty insurance, if this state is the insured's home state, the tax is computed upon the entire premium without regard towhether the policy covers risks or exposures that are locat- ed in this state. For all other lines of insurance, the tax iscomputed upon the proportion of the premium that is prop- erly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this state. Exemption for Certain Commercial Purchasers . A person is an \"exempt commercial purchaser\" if the person: employs or retains a qualified risk manager to negotiate insurance coverage; has paid aggregate commercial property and casualty insurance premiums exceeding $100,000 in the previous year; and meets additional financial criteria. A surplus lines broker seeking to procure from or place insurance with an unauthorized insurer for anSHB 1697 161exempt commercial purchaser is not required to satisfy the diligent effort requirement if the: surplus lines broker or referring insurance producer placing the surplus lines insurance discloses that the insurance may or may not be available from the admitted market and that insurance may providegreater protection with more regulatory oversight; and exempt commercial purchaser subsequently requests the surplus lines broker or referring insurance producer in writing to procure or place such insurance from an unauthor ized insurer.

By House Committee on Early Learning & Human Servic- es (originally sponsored by Representatives Roberts,Seaquist, Goodman, Orwall, Dickerson and Kenney). House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: The Department of Social and Health Services, Children's Administration (CA) is required to monitor children who are pla ced in out-of-home care or who reside with their parents on in-home dependencies.Case workers conduct visits with children to ensure they are safe and receive quality care. Case workers are required to conduct private, face-to-face visits withchildren on a monthly basis an d are authorized to conduct unannounced visits. Legislation enacted in 2009 established supervising agencies as part of a two-ph ase process to reform child welfare services. A supervis ing agency is defined as an agency licensed by the stat e or a federally recognized Indian tribe that has ente red into a performance-based contract with the CA to provide case management for thedelivery of child welfare services. During phase one of theprocess, the CA is required to consolidate and convert contracts to performance-based contracts. In phase two, supervising agencies will pe rform case management in selected demonstration sites. Summary: The CA and supervising agencies must randomly select no less than 10 percent of the caregiverscurrently providing care (both out-of-home placementsand in-home dependencies) to receive one unannouncedface-to-face visit in the caregiver's home per year. Nocaregiver will receive an un announced visit for two con- secutive years. If the caseworker makes a good faith effortto conduct the randomly selec ted unannounced visit and is unable to do so, that month's visit to the caregiver need not be unannounced. The CA and the supervising agencies areencouraged to group visits to caregivers by geographicarea so that in the event an unannounced visit cannot be completed, the caseworker ma y complete other required monthly visits located in that vicinity.

By Representatives Lytton, Morris, Van De Wege, Blake and Liias; by request of Department of Fish and Wildlife. House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: Citing dwindling recreational fishing opportunities for salmon and marine bottomfish in thePuget Sound, Washington created the Puget Sound Recre-ational Salmon and Marine Fish Enhancement Program (Program) in 1993 to improv e recreational fishing through various means. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Respon- sibilities . The Program requires the Washington Depart- ment of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to develop a short-term program of hatchery-based salmon enhancementusing freshwater pond sites for the final rearing phase and to solicit support from cooperative projects, regionalenhancement groups, and other organizations. TheWDFW is required to conduct comprehensive research onresident and migratory salmon production opportunities,marine bottomfish production limitations, and methods for artificial propagation of marine bottomfish. The WDFW's long-term resp onsibilities include fully implementing enhancement ef forts for Puget Sound and Hood Canal resident salmon and marine bottomfish, iden-tifying opportunities to reestablish salmon runs into areaswhere they no longer exist, and encouraging naturally spawning salmon populations to develop to their fullest extent. The WDFW also must fully use hatchery programsto improve recreational fishing. Improving Fishing . The Program requires the WDFW to develop new locations for freshwater rearing of delayed-release Chinook salmon, with a goal to increaseproduction and planting of delayed-release salmon to 3million fish per year by 20 00. In addition, the WDFW must: coordinate with the Department of Ecology and local governments to streamline the siting process for new enhancement projects; develop a public-awareness program emphasizing economic benefits of the Program; increase efforts to document the effects of predators on fish resources and explore opportunities to con- vince the federal government to amend federal law to allow for balanced management of predators, including predatory birds; invite Indian tribal fi shing interests and non-Indian commercial fishing groups to help develop plans forselective fisheries targeting hatchery-produced fishand minimizing catch of naturally spawned fish; initiate talks on the feas ibility of altering rearing pro- grams at hatcheries run by the WDFW to achieve higher survival and greater production of Chinook and Coho salmon; coordinate the sport fi shing program with the wild stock initiative to ensure the programs arecompatible; develop plans for increased recreational access to salmon and marine fish resources, including propos-als for new boat launching ramps and pier fishingaccess; and contract with private consultants, aquatic farms, or construction firms to achieve the highest benefit-to-cost ratio for recreati onal fishing projects. Marine Bottomfish Programs . The WDFW is required to research, develop methods, and implement programs for the artificial rearing and release of marinebottomfish species, with primary emphasis on lingcod,halibut, rockfish, and Pacific cod. The WDFW also must do research to evaluate improved enhancement tech-niques, hooking mortality rat es, methods of mass marking, improvement of catch models, and sources of marinebottomfish mortality as applied to real-world recreationalfishing needs. Assistance from Nondepartmental Sources . The WDFW must seek recommendations from people who areexperts on planning and operation of programs forenhancement of recreational fisheries and fully use the expertise of the University of Washington College of Fish- eries (now known as the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences) and the Washington Sea Grant to developresearch and enhancement programs. Oversight Committee . The Program is overseen by a seven-member oversight comm ittee (Committee) consist- ing of members representing sport fishing organizationsand is administered by a coordinator (Coordinator). Account . A portion of each saltwater and combina- tion fishing license fee is de posited into the Recreational Fisheries Enhancement Account for use on Programprojects. Audit . The State Auditor's Office released an audit in 2010 of the WDFW's delayed-release Chinook salmonprogram, concluding that the WDFW has not met the stat-utory goal to release 3 mil lion delayed-release Chinook annually because of factor s including limited hatchery capacity, water quality prob lems, and discontinuation of saltwater net pens. Summary: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Responsibilities . The WDFW and the Committee must adaptively manage the Prog ram to maximize benefits to the Puget Sound recreational fishery, consistent with available revenue, Fish and Wildlife Commission (Com-mission) policies, tribal co -manager agreements, and lim- itations of the Endangered Species Act. The WDFW'sresponsibilities are changed, and they include: using aEHB 1703 163program of hatchery-based salmon enhancement and soliciting support from cooperative projects, regionalenhancement groups, and others to improve fishing; con-ducting comprehensive research on salmon and marinebottomfish production limitatio ns and methods for artifi- cially propagating depleted marine bottomfish; and facili-tating continued fishing o pportunity improvement as measured by angler trips expended. The Coordinator must assist the Committee in devel- oping recommendations for go als and objectives to assess the effectiveness of the Program. The Director of theWDFW (Director) and the Comm ittee must work together to approve goals and objectives, report to the Commissionon goals, reach consensus regarding Program activitiesand expenditures, and make a joint report to the Legislature. Improving Fishing . The WDFW must use artificial rearing of salmon to improve fishing. It must seek todevelop and implement methods to increase recreationalangling opportunities, by means such as: using artificial salmon rearing techniques; optimally using hatche ry salmon through expanded recreational mark-selective fisheries; utilizing recreational salmon and marine fish enhancement program fund s for catch monitoring; considering new catch-and-release recreational fish- eries using gear and me thods known to minimize hooking mortality; and providing public in formation about angling opportunities and fishing methods. Marine Bottomfish Programs . The WDFW may research and implement programs for artificial rearing and release of bottomfish speci es. A primary emphasis must be on marine bottomfish species of importance in the rec-reational fishery. The WDFW may use artificial habitatsto restore and mitigate degrad ed rockfish habitats and enhance recreational opportunities. Assistance from Nondepartmental Sources . The WDFW may seek recommendations from outside sources,such as the University of Washington. Provisions Repealed . Provisions are repealed relating to: (1) freshwater rearing of delayed-release Chinook salmon; (2) additional research by the WDFW into infor- mation that can be applied to real-world recreational fish- ing needs; (3) siting process es for enhancement projects; (4) public awareness of the Program; (5) management ofpredators; (6) participation by fishing interests in plansthat target hatchery-produced fish; (7) coordination of sport fishing programs with wild stock initiatives; (8)increased recreational access to salmon and marine fishresources; and (9) contracting with private entities toreduce costs of recreational fishing projects.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 EHB 1703 C 140 L 11 Addressing fiscal notes fo r legislation that uniquely affects school districts. By Representatives Dammeier, Haigh, Anderson, Probst, Parker, Alexander, Zeiger and Smith. House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Fiscal Notes . A fiscal note is an estimate of the fiscal impact of proposed legislation. Fiscal notes are prepared by the executive branch for use during thelegislative process. For legi slation that has a fiscal impact on state agencies, fiscal notes are prepared under a processcoordinated by the Office of Financial Management(OFM). Pursuant to instru ctions issued by the OFM, affected agencies estimate the bill's impacts on state reve- nues and expenditures and work with the OFM to producethe fiscal note. For legislation that affects counties, cities,and other units of local government, the Department ofCommerce produces local government fiscal notes, whichare also subject to coordination by the OFM. School Districts . Washington has 295 school districts, each governed by a locally elected school board. Schooldistricts deliver the state's K-12 educational programunder the supervision of the Office of the Superintendentof Public Instruction (OSPI). In addition to providing educational services, school districts are municipal corpo-rations subject to many of the various laws that apply tolocal governments generally. Summary: When it is practicable to do so within avail- able resources, the OSPI must prepare school district fiscalnotes for proposed legislation that uniquely affects school districts. Where practicable, the school district fiscal notemust show the fiscal impact of the proposed legislation on each school district. Where it is not practicable to showthe impact on each school distri ct, the school district fiscal note must show the fiscal impact of the legislation on arange of representative school districts. The schooldistrict fiscal note must set forth any assumptions used inselecting the representative di stricts and in the fiscal note generally.

By Representatives Kirby and Bailey.House Committee on Business & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: The Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) regulates insurance transactions in Washington.This includes group disability insurance policies that are issued or delivered in Washington. The OIC ensures thatthe rates and forms comply w ith the requirement of the Insurance Code. There are ce rtain standard provisions for group disability policies. Under state law, a grou p disability policy may only insure members of specified types of groups and thedependents of the members. The group is the policyholderand is required to pay the pr emiums on the policies. An insured person may be able to contribute funds to the premiums. A person must be a member to be insuredunder the group policy. These groups are: employee groups; credit union groups; debtor groups; associations which have: (1) been in active existence for at least one year; (2 ) a constitution and bylaws; and (3) been organized and maintained in good faithfor purposes other than that of obtaining insurance; labor union groups; public employee associations; trustee groups; insurance producer groups; the Washington State Patrol; financial institutions; and corporations with at least 500 subscribers that exist for the primary purpose of assisting subscribers insecuring medical, hospital, dental, and other healthcare services. While used in the Insura nce not defined phrases. Disability income insurance is generally considered to beinsurance that provides pa yment when the insured is unable to work due to illness or injury. Benefits are usually provided on a monthly basis so thatindividuals can maintain their standard of living and con-tinue to pay their regular expenses. Accident-only insur-ance is generally considered to be insurance that pays the insured a stated benefit in the event of injury or death due to accidental means. It does not provide benefits related to sickness or natural causes. Dental-only coverage andvision-only coverage solely provide benefits related to dental and vision conditions, respectively. Summary: Disability income insu rance, accident-only coverage, dental-only coverage, and vision-only coverage may be offered under a group policy to a group other thana group listed in statute if the Insurance Commissioner(Commissioner) finds that: the issuance of the group policy is not contrary to the best interest of the public; the issuance of the group policy would result in economies of acquisition or administration; and the benefits are reas onable in relation to the premiums charged. Group coverage for disa bility income insurance, accident-only coverage, dental -only coverage, and vision- only coverage under a policy issued in another state may not be offered by this type of group in this state unless: the other state has requir ements substantially similar to those in the act; and the Commissioner or th e insurance co mmissioner of the other state has determined that those requirements have been met.

House Committee on Education Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: In 2008 a comprehens ive set of initiatives was enacted in legislation, d esigned to enhance the rigor and relevance of secondary career and technical education (CTE) programs and to align and integrate CTE instruc-tion more closely with academic subjects, high demandfields, industry certification, and postsecondary education. The Legislature initially pr ovided $2.75 million per year to support such activities as: requiring all preparatory CTE programs to lead to industry certification or offer dual high school and college credit;House 97 0 Senate 47 0ESHB 1716 165 expanding state support for middle school CTE pro- grams, especially in science, technology, and engineering; providing support for schools to develop or upgrade programs in high demand fields and offer pre-apprenticeships; developing model CTE programs of study leading to industry credentials or degrees; assisting school districts with identifying academic and CTE course equivalencies; pilot-testing programs to integrate academic, career and technical, basic skills, and English as a second language instruction; and developing performance measures and targets for accountability. Summary: Within existing resources, the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction must convene a working group to develop a st atewide strategic plan for secondary CTE. The plan must include a vision statement, goals, and measurable annual objectives for continuous improvementthat are consistent with thos e required under the federal Carl Perkins Act for secondary CTE programs. The planmust also recommend activities that: can be accomplished within current resources; should receive top priority for additiona l investment; and could be phased-in over the next 10 years. The working group must examine at least the following issues: proposed changes to high school graduation require- ments and ways to assure that students continue to have opportunities to pursue CTE pathways; the relationship between CTE courses and the Common Core Standards; ways to improve access to high quality CTE in a variety of school settings; ways to improve the transition from K-12 to college; methods for replicating innovative middle and high schools; and a framework for transferrable and articulated certifi- cations between secondary and postsecondary CTE so that students receive credit for knowledge andskills already mastered. Membership of the work ing group is specified. A progress report is due to the Education Committees and the Quality Education Coun cil by December 1, 2011, with a final strategic plan due December 1, 2012.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1716 C 289 L 11 Regulating secondhand dealers who deal with precious metal property.

House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Mental Health Courts . Counties may operate mental health courts, which have a special docket designed to reduce recidivism and symptoms of mental ill- ness for nonviolent, mentally ill offenders. Mental healthcourts aim to increase the likelihood of a mentally illoffender's successful rehab ilitation through treatment, periodic reviews, and other rehabilitation services. Mini-mum requirements for participat ion in mental health court are that the offender: (1) would benefit from psychiatric treatment; (2) does not have a prior conviction for aserious violent or sex offense; and (3) is not currentlycharged with a sex offense, a serious violent offense, an offense during which the offender used a firearm, or anoffense during which the offender caused substantial orgreat bodily harm or death to another.

By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Rodne, Schmick, Haler, Smith, Wilcox, Johnson, Klippert, Kristiansen, McCune, Short, Ross and Warnick). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: The common-law theo ry of \"respondeat superior\" allows an employer, including state and local governments in Washington, to be held vicariously liablefor an employee's tortious act under certain circumstances.Generally, the employee must commit tortious conduct in the scope of his or her employment, although Washingtoncourts have held that an employer may be held liable forconduct that occurs when an employee does a mix of work and personal business. In the case of Rahman v. State , the Washington Supreme Court held that the state may be vicariouslyliable for injuries suffered by a third-party passenger in astate vehicle driven by a state employee for work purpos-es. The plaintiff in Rahman was the wife of a state agency intern injured when her hu sband, Mohammad Shahidur Rahman, failed to negotiate a curve while driving from Olympia to Spokane. Althou gh Rahman was driving for work purposes, state rules prohibited him from bringing non-employee passengers. The majority ruled that courtprecedents and sound policy weighed in favor of holdingthe state vicariously liable because Rahman was in the service of the state's business at the time of the accident. The dissent argued that the state should not be liable because Rahman was not authorized to transport non-employees, and thus he acted outside the scope of hisemployment. The dissent cont ended that the policy under- lying respondeat superior\u2014an employer's control over anemployee\u2014is absent when the employee is not acting with actual or apparent authority and the employer has nocontrol over the employee. Summary: The Legislature intends to overrule the Washington Supreme Court's decision in Rahman v. State by modifying the application of the legal doctrine of respondeat superior. State and local governments are not liable for injuries suffered by a third-party occupant of a vehicle owned, leased, or rented by the government if, at the time theinjuries occurred, the third-part y occupant was: (1) riding in or on the vehicle with a government employee who hadexplicitly acknowledged in writing the government'spolicy on use of such vehicles; and (2) not expresslyauthorized by the government to be an occupant of thevehicle. Third-party occupa nts are people who occupy a government vehicle who are not government officers,employees, or agents. Local governments include cities, counties, or other subdivisions of the state and any munic-ipal corporations, quasi-municip al corporations, or special districts within the state. A private employer is not liable for any injury suffered by a third-party occupant of a vehicle owned, leased, orrented by the employer when the third-party occupant wasriding in or on the vehicle with an employee who hadexplicitly acknowledged in writing the employer's policy on use of such vehicles, unless: (1) the employer specifi-cally and expressly authorized the occupancy; or (2) thethird-party occupant was acting on behalf of or for thebenefit of the employer, and the employer knew or impliedly approved or acquiesced.

By House Committee on Envi ronment (originally spon- sored by Representatives Frockt, Kenney, Roberts, Fitzgibbon and Stanford). House Committee on Environment Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Background: Coal tar sealants are used to protect and maintain asphalt pavement for driveways and parking lots.Asphalt pavement develops cracks over time, and sealantsare used to help protect the pavement surface. Polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemicalsthat are formed during the in complete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, or other organic substances. Coal tar sealantscontain PAHs. Summary: After January 1, 2012, no person may sell, at wholesale or retail, a coal tar pavement product that is labeled as containing coal tar. The terms coal tar and coal tar pavement product are defined. After July 1, 2013, a person may not apply a coal tar pavement product on a driveway or parking area. The Department of Ecology (DOE) may issue a notice of corrective action to a person who sells or applies a coaltar pavement product in violation of the act. A city or county may adopt an ordinance to provide for the enforcement of the requirements of the act. A cityor county adopting an ordinance for enforcement hasjurisdiction concurre nt with the DOE. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011ESHB 1725 C 290 L 11 Addressing administrative ef ficiencies for the workers' compensation program. By House Committee on Labor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsored by Representatives Sells,Reykdal, Ormsby, Kenney and Upthegrove; by request ofDepartment of Labor & Industries). House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: The Department of Labor and Industries (Department) administers the workers' compensation program. Employers must either insure through the StateFund or may self-insure if qualified. For State Fundemployers, participation in a retrospective rating (retro) plan is available for employers or group of employers thatmeet specified requirements. Participation in retro allows an employer or a group of em ployers to assume a portion of industrial insurance risk and receive premium refunds or be assessed additional premiums based on claim losses. The Department issues various notices under the workers' compensation program. Some of these noticesmust be sent by registered or certified mail. The Director of the Department establishes a fee schedule of the maximum charges to be made by a medicalprovider. The fee schedule is not a \"rule\" under theAdministrative Procedure Act. Direct practice is a type of primary health care in which providers enter into ag reements with patients to provide primary care services for a monthly fee. State lawregulates direct practice. Legislation enacted in 2011requires injured workers to generally seek care from a provider that is part of a medical provider network. Anemployer or provider may not require an injured worker topay for the worker's medical care. Summary: Industrial insurance notices and orders, other than claim closure orders, may be sent electronically ifrequested by the employer, worker, beneficiary, or otherperson affected. Persons choosing to receive electroniccorrespondence and legal notices must receive informa-tion to assist them in ensuri ng that all electronic docu- ments and communications are received. Correspondenceand notices sent electronically are considered received onthe date sent. Orders and notices required to be served by registered or certified mail may be serv ed by any method for which receipt can be confirmed or tracked. The billing or payment instructions and policies asso- ciated with a fee schedule do not constitute a \"rule\" underthe Administrative Procedure Act. The Department must report to the appropriate com- mittees of the Legislature by December 1, 2011, on chang-es needed to ensure that an injured worker may receiveHouse 98 0Senate 49 0 House 67 30 Senate 36 12 (Senate amended)House 64 32 (House concurred)HB 1726 170care from a direct primary care provider and that the injured worker is not paying directly for medical services for the workplace injury or disease. The report must pro-vide a timeline for rule deve lopment with a goal to have changes in place by July 1, 2013. The report must also include: data required from direct care providers neces-sary to establish premium rates, experience modificationfactors, and retro adjustments; medical cost or paymentinformation that may be required from retro participants;any requirements for direct care providers to participate inthe medical provider network and ensure the Departmenthas information to efficiently manage worker claims; andany other issues or barriers to direct care providerparticipation in the worker s' compensation system. Payment by an employer for direct primary care services does not disqualify the employer from participat-ing in retro, any related group sponsor from promoting aretro plan, or any related pl an administrator from adminis- tering a retro plan. The retro employer, group sponsor, orplan administrator must provide any medical cost orpayment information required by the Department. Beforethe retro adjustment for the plan year beginning January 1, 2012, the Department must determine the information needed and any changes to the retro premium and claim cost calculation to maintain appropriate and equitable retro refunds when employers pay for direct care services. The retro changes apply beginning with the January 1,2012, plan year. Rule-making by the Department withrespect to retro and direct primary care services is granted. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1726 C 291 L 11 Addressing the recommendations of the vocational rehabilitation subcommittee fo r workers' compensation. By Representatives Sells, Roberts, Ormsby, Reykdal, Kenney, Miloscia, Moeller an d Upthegrove; by request of Department of Labor & Industries. House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: One of the primary purposes of Washing- ton's Industrial Insurance Act (Act) is to assist injured workers to become employab le at gainful employment. The Department of Labor and Industries (Department)pays, or directs self-insurers to pay, the costs of vocationalrehabilitation services when these services are necessaryand likely to enable the injure d worker to become employ- able at gainful employment. In 2007 legislation wasenacted creating a vocational rehabilitation pilot programfor plans approved between January 1, 2008, and June 30,2013. After an assessment and determination that a worker is eligible for vocational reha bilitation services, a vocational rehabilitation plan is developed. The plan must be com-pleted within 90 days of commencing. A worker has twooptions: Option 1: The worker may participate in the plan. Option 2: The worker may decline further vocational services and receive an award equal to six months oftime-loss benefits, and the claim is closed. A workermust select Option 2 within 15 days of the Department's approval of the plan. When the worker begins de velopment of the plan, the employer has 15 days to make a return-to-work offer. A valid return-to-work offer te rminates development of the vocational plan and time-loss benefits. The 2007 legislation also directed the Department to create a V ocational Rehabi litation Subcommittee (Sub- committee). Among other ta sks, the Subcommittee was charged with recommending any additional statutory changes, as well additional changes or incentives for injured workers to return to work with their employer of injury. A worker who suffers the loss of two major limbs or the loss of total eyesight or paralysis is entitled to what is referred to as a statutory pension. These persons areentitled to a pension without regard to whether they are permanently incapacitated fro m performing work in any gainful occupation, which is otherwise required to receive a pension. Summary: Explicit authority is given to the Department to provide vocationa l services to a worker who suffered the loss of, or complete use of, two major limbs or total eyesight when, in the Depart ment's discretion, these services will substantially improve either the worker's quality of life or ability to function in an employment set-ting, regardless of whether these services are necessary orreasonably likely to make the worker employable at anygainful employment. The se rvices must be completed before the worker's entitlem ent to a pension. These workers are not entitled to Option 2 benefits. The 15-day period to select Option 2 begins when the Department approves the plan or a determination is madethat the plan is valid following a dispute. In addition, the Department may approve the election of Option 2 benefitswithin 25 days of the approval of the plan or a determina-tion that the plan is valid if the worker provides a writtenexplanation that the worker was unable to meet the 15-daydeadline. The Department may extend the time an employer has to make a valid return-to-work offer for up to 10 additional days if the employer made an offer within 15 days that metHouse 96 1Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur) Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 1 (House concurred)SHB 1728 171some but not all requirements to be valid. To be valid, the offer must be for bona fide employment with the employer of injury consistent with the worker's documented physical and mental restrictions. A worker who elects Option 2 is not entitled to further time-loss or pension benefits, except upon a showing of aworsening in condition that makes the closure of the claiminappropriate. In this case, the Option 2 selection isrescinded and the amount paid to the worker is assessed asan overpayment. A closed claim may not be reopened forthe sole purpose of allowing the worker to seek vocational assistance. Clarification is made that the Department makes the determination whether voca tional rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable atgainful employment. Other cl arifications are made and erroneous cross-references are deleted. These provisions expire June 30, 2013. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1728 C 237 L 11 Requiring businesses where f ood for human consumption is sold or served to allow persons with disabilities to bring their service animals on to the business premises. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy, Rodne, Green, Goodman, Kagi and Kenney). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Under Washington's Law Against Discrim- ination, it is an unfair practic e to discriminate in places of public accommodatio n on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sexual orienta tion, sex, veteran or military status, the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical dis-ability, or the use of a traine d dog guide or service animal. \"Service animal\" means any anim al that is trained for the purposes of assisting or accommodating a disabledperson's sensory, mental, or physical disability. The prohibition against di scriminating in providing public accommodations applies to \"any place of publicresort, accommodation, assemb lage, or amusement\" and includes restaurants, hotels, motels, inns, stores, markets,shopping malls, theaters, cinemas, concert halls, arenas,parks, fairs, arcades, libraries, schools, governmentoffices, and hospitals. Under federal law, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimi nation on the basis of dis- ability in employment, st ate and local governmentservices, public accommoda tions, commercial facilities, transportation, and teleco mmunications. The United States Department of Justic e's regulations implementing the ADA defines \"service animal \" to mean any dog that is individually trained to do wo rk or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a phys-ical, sensory, psychiatric, inte llectual, or other mental dis- ability. Other species of animals, whether wild ordomestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals.There is an exception for miniature horses, which may beconsidered service animal s in some circumstances. The ADA requires privately owned businesses that serve the public to allow peop le with disabilities to bring their service animals into the public areas of the business premises unless the business can demonstrate that makingsuch modifications would fu ndamentally alter the nature of its goods, services, faciliti es, privileges, advantages, or accommodations. Summary: Food establishments are prohibited from dis- criminating on the basis of th e use of a service animal by a person with a disability only with respect to animals cov-ered under the current federal regulatory definition of the term. A service animal is defi ned as any dog that is indi- vidually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. With the exception ofminiature horses, other speci es of animals are not consid- ered service animals. A food establishment must makereasonable modifications to permit the use of a miniaturehorse by an individual with a disability, as long as thehorse has been individually trained to do work or performtasks for the benefit of the in dividual with a disability. \"Food establishment\" means any places of business that sells or serves food for human consumption that has aNorth American Classification Sy stem Code in the provid- ed list, which includes indust ries in the following areas: super markets and other grocery stores; conveniencestores; meat markets; fish and and buffets; snack andnon-alcoholic beverage bars; and drinking places.

By Representatives Jinkins, Rodne, Haler and Dunshee.House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: Local governments, a term that includes counties, cities, and special purpose districts, are autho- rized to incur general indebt edness and to issue bonds for financing activities and purpos es determined by the local government. A local government that is authorized and elects to issue bonds must determine sp ecific provisions pertaining to the bonds, including the issue amount, terms,conditions, interest rate or rates, and other issuance details. City use limitations for bond proceeds specify that moneys received from the sale of bonds or warrants mayonly be used for the purpose for which they were issued. Additionally, no expenditure of the proceeds may be made for that purpose until the bonds have been duly authorized. If any unexpended fund balance remains from the pro- ceeds after the accomplishment of the purpose for whichthe bonds were issued, the re maining funds must be used for the redemption of the bond or warrant indebtedness. Ifa city or town budget contains an expenditure program tobe financed from a bond issu e that has not been autho- rized, the city or town is prohibited from making or incur-ring a related expenditure un til the bonds have been duly authorized. Summary: If an ordinance or resolution approving the issuance of bonds authorizes an officer or employee of the local government to serve as its designated representative and to accept, on behalf of the local government, an offer to purchase those bonds, the acceptance of the offer must be consistent with the terms of the ordinance or resolution. Additionally, a county that d esignates a representative for bond-related purposes must do so in a manner that isconsistent with its adopted debt policy. The ordinance or resolution approving the issuance of bonds must establish specifi c provisions related to the bonds, including the issue am ount, date or dates, denomi- nations, and other terms and conditions considered appropriate by the issuing local government. City use limitations for bond proceeds are modified to allow expenditures of bond proceeds prior to the bonds be-ing duly authorized. Additio nally, if any unexpended fund balance remains from the proceeds after the accomplish-ment of the purpose for which the bonds were issued, theremaining funds must be used for principal of or intereston the indebtedness, consistent with applicable federal taxlaw. If a city or town budget contains an expenditure pro- gram to be partially or wholly financed from a bond issuethat has not been authorized, th e city or town is authorized to make or incur expenditures of amounts anticipated to bereimbursed with the proceed s from the issuance and sale of the bonds, consistent with any applicable federal tax law requirements. A general indemnification clause is included. All bonds previously issued and any reimbursement previous-ly made with bond proceeds by a local government that areconsistent with specified prov isions are validated, ratified, and confirmed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1731 C 141 L 11 Concerning the formation, operation, and governance of regional fire protection service authorities. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Takko, Kagi and Reykdal).House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: A Regional Fire Protection Service Authority (Authority) may be created for the purpose of conducting specified fire protection functions at a regionallevel. An Authority may be created by the merger of twoor more adjacent fire prot ection jurisdictions, including fire protection districts, citie s, port districts, and Indian tribes. The creation of an Authority requires voterapproval. An Authority is governed by a board charged with executing the Authority's servic e plan, which provides for the design, financing, and development of fire protectionservices. Board membership is determined by the serviceplan and is limited to elected of ficials. Provisions govern- ing authorities do not provide for the election of any newofficials specific to an Authority and are silent on othermatters relating to officials serving on the board. The board of an Authority is empowered to exercise general operational and administrative powers including: levying and imposing taxes; exercising eminen t domain powers; and exercising other powers and duties as are reasonably necessary to carry out its purposes.All powers, duties, and functio ns of a participating fire protection jurisdiction may be transferred by resolution to the Authority. A \"participating fire protection jurisdiction\" is a fire protection district, city, town, Indian tribe, or port districtHouse 96 1 Senate 46 02E2SHB 1738 173that is represented on the governing board of an Authority. State law authorizes each of these jurisdictions, other thana tribe, to levy property taxes. However, the levies of aparticipating fire protection ju risdiction are limited so that statutorily designated amounts, less the amount of a levyimposed by the Authority, are not exceeded. Summary: A definition of an \"elected official\" for Authority purposes is establis hed. An Authority's service plan may create one or more regional fire protection service authority commissioner (commissioner) positions. The governing board of an Authority is determined by the Authority's service plan. However, only elected offi-cials of a participating fire protection jurisdiction andelected commissioners of th e Authority are eligible to serve on the Authority's governing board. Rather than being set forth in an Authority's service plan, provisions governing a commissioner's compensa-tion, qualifications, ability to serve as a volunteer fire- fighter, polling places for elections, and commissionervacancies are as provided in statutes pertaining to com- missioners of fire protection di stricts (districts). Addition- al information about these pr ovision is summarized below. Compensation: A commissioner may be compen- sated $90 per day, not to exceed $8,640 per year (amount adjustable for inflation), plus necessary expenses incurred in attend ing meetings of the board or when otherwise engage d in district business. Qualifications: Any voter residing in the district is eligible for the position. Ability to serve as a volunteer firefighter: A commis- sioner is eligible to serve in that capacity if the board unanimously adopts a resolution to that effect. Polling places for elections: Polling places may be located outside the boundaries of the district, as deter-mined by the auditor of the county in which the district is located. Vacancies: If a commissioner is absent from three consecutive meetings with out being excused by the board, the position is deemed vacant. An Authority's service pl an may create commissioner districts, that are approximate ly equal in population. If commissioner districts are created, only a voter who resides in a district is eligible to serve as a commissioner for the district, and only voters of that district may vote ina nominating primary election. However, all voters of theproposed Authority may vote at a general election to elect a commissioner of the district. For purposes of calculating permissible property tax levy rates, a fire protection district, city, town, or port dis-trict that is annexed into an Authority is a \"participating fire protection jurisdiction, \" and its property tax levy authority is therefore subject to the same limitations as afire protection jurisdiction that is represented on the governing board of an Authority. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2E2SHB 1738 C 15 L 11 E1 Changing the designation of the medicaid single state agency. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Cody and Jinkins; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Background: State medical assistance programs pay for health care for low-income state residents, primarily through the Medicaid program. The majority of these pro-grams are administered by th e Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). Most of these programs arejointly funded with state and federal matching funds. Fed- eral law requires each state that participates in Medicaid todesignate a single state agency responsible for administra-tion and supervision of the state's Medicaid program. In Washington, that agency is the DSHS. The Health Care Authority (Authority) administers state employee health benef it programs through the Public Employees Benefits Board as well as health care programstargeted at low-income indi viduals, such as the Basic Health Plan and the Community Health Services Grants. In addition, the Authority co ordinates initiatives related to state purchased health care, such as the Prescription DrugProgram and the Health Technology Assessment Program. Summary: The Authority is designated as the single state agency for the administration and supervision of Washing- ton's state Medicaid program. The Authority is to be led by a \"director,\" rather than an \"administrator.\" The direc- tor is authorized to administ er the medical assistance pro- grams and the State Children's Health Insurance Programand is responsible for the disbursement of funds that thestate receives in relation to those programs. The director may appoint any co mmittees and commissions needed to comply with federal laws an d funding requirements. All responsibilities related to th e administration of the Medic- aid program are transferred to the Authority. Severalresponsibilities that had been shared between divisions ofthe DSHS will be shared between the Authority and theDSHS. All employees of the Medicaid Purchasing Adminis- tration (MPA) within the DSHS are transferred to theAuthority. All rules, appor funds,House 92 3Senate 46 2SHB 1761 174and pending business of the MPA are also transferred to the Authority. The Authority is authorized to conduct adjudicative proceedings for: (1) an ap plicant or enrollee who is aggrieved by a decision of the Authority; or (2) a currentor former enrollee who is ag grieved by a claim that he or she owes a debt for overpayment. (This authority is sub-stantially similar to the adju dicative proceeding authority of the DSHS.) Procedures and standards are established toallow for the severance of applications for review of deci-sions made by both the Authority and the DSHS intomultiple proceedings. The Authority is authorized to charge fees, collect overpayments, and file liens. In addition, the Authority may collect from tort feasors or their insurer in any case inwhich assistance is paid due to negligent conduct toward an enrollee. (This authority is substantially similar to the DSHS's authority to collect overpayments and secure reimbursements.) The DSHS's responsibiliti es regarding coordination with health insurers for health benefits for recipients ofmedical services are transferred to the Authority. The Authority is authorized to collaborate with other state or local agencies and no nprofit entities to carry out its responsibilities. The DSHS and the Authority must determine financial and functional eligibility for people applying for long- term care services through a single process in a single location. It is specified that the Disproportionate Share Hospital payment methodology provisions do not create a right orentitlement for any hospitals. References to several expired duties are eliminated, including reporting on children's Medicaid mental healthbenefits and amending the state Medicaid Plan to includepersonal care services in the categorically needy program. The DSHS and the Authority must provide a prelimi- nary report to the Governor and Legislature by December10, 2011, and a final implementation plan by December 1,2012, regarding the role of the Authority in purchasing mental health, chemical dependency, and long-term careservices. Several items must be addressed in the reports including improvement of prevention efforts, approachesto service delivery, assurances of long-term care servicesin the least restrictive environment, measurements of costsavings, measurement of outcom es and satisfaction, desig- nation of a single point of entry for eligibility determina-tions, and collaboration with local governments. The DSHS and the Authority must consult with stakeholdersand cooperate with the Join t Select Committee on Health Reform Implementation wh ile developing these recommendations.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 SHB 1761 C 211 L 11 Limiting private activity bo nd issues by out-of-state issuers. By House Committee on Capita l Budget (originally spon- sored by Representatives Dunshee and Ormsby; by request of Washington State Housing FinanceCommission). House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance Background: Tax-Exempt Private Activity Bonds . The federal tax code classifies state and local bonds as eithergovernmental bonds or private activity bonds. Govern-mental bonds are for projects that benefit the general pub-lic and are issued by government entities. Private activitybonds are issued for the benefit of private entities. Gener-ally, the interest on state and local governmental bonds isexempt from federal taxation, and the interest on most pri-vate activity bonds is not tax exempt. However, when pri- vate activity bonds are used for projects that also have asubstantial public benefit, the bonds may qualify for fed-eral tax exempt status. Qua lifying activities include hous- ing, manufacturing, education, and environmentalfacilities. Because interest earned by investors on thesebonds is not subject to the fede ral income tax, investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate, and this lower ratereduces the costs of the project to the issuer and the projectdeveloper. Tax-exempt private activity bonds are not obligations or pledges of the full faith and credit of the state or itspolitical subdivisions. Tax-exempt private activity bondsare non-recourse bonds. The repayment of the bond is theresponsibility of the user of the bond proceeds. State Bond Cap Allocation . Federal law limits the total dollar amount of certain tax-exempt private activity bonds that may be issued annually in a state. Each state's\"bond cap\" is calculated acco rding to a federal formula. For 2011 Washington's bond cap is $638.8 million. Theallocation of the state's bond cap is determined by statute follows: pe rcent; 20 percen t; a \"remainder/redevel- opment\" category, 8 percent. The Department ofHouse 54 43 House 53 42 Senate 44 0 (Senate amended)House 53 35 (House concurred)175Commerce (Commerce) administers the state's Bond Cap Allocation Program (BCAP). The BCAP authorizes theissuance of tax-exempt private activity bonds, reviews andapproves projects for complia nce with federal and state law, and monitors bond issuan ces to ensure that the state does not exceed the annual total. Tax-exempt private activity bonds not subject to the bond cap are those used for capital projects owned by501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, such as health carefacilities, higher education buildings and facilities, and local community facilities such as YMCAs, job training facilities, and museums. Using Tax-Exempt Private Activity Bonds for Wash- ington Projects . Project developers pursuing use of tax- exempt private activity bonds mu st work with a bond issu- ing authority (authority). In Washington there are fivestatewide authorities and a number of local authorities.The statewide authorities are the Washington StateHousing Finance Commission, the Washington EconomicDevelopment Finance Authority, the Washington StateHigher Education Facilities Authority, the Washington State Health Care Facilitie s Authority, and the Tobacco Settlement Authority. These statewide authorities are lim-ited by law to financing projec ts within the state. Exam- ples of local authorities incl ude the industrial development corporations of the Port of Bellingham and Spokane County, and the Seattle, Tacoma, and Vancouver HousingAuthorities. An authority assesses a given project and financing options. If the project qualif ies for tax-exempt private activity bonds and is in a cate gory that is subject to bond cap allocation, the authority applies to the BCAP for approval to issue bonds ag ainst the bond cap for that category. State law prescribes the process and criteria forrequesting and granting such approval. Under federal law, tax-exempt private activity bonds may not be issued for a pr oject until approved by each government having jurisdiction over the area in which the facility is to be located. A public hearing and approval by the elected body is the standard meth od for obtaining public approval. Out-of-State Bond Issuing Authorities . Three states\u2014Wisconsin, Missouri , and Colorado\u2014have laws allowing in-state bond is suing authorities to finance projects in all 50 states. The most recent is the WisconsinPublic Finance Authority (PFA), established in legislationenacted in 2010. The PFA is authorized to is sue tax-exempt and taxable bonds for projects located with in or outside Wisconsin and may apply to any unit of govern ment, within or outside the state, for an allocation of the tax-exempt private activitybond cap. Before issuing bonds on any economic devel- opment, housing, health, or education facilities in Wiscon- sin, the PFA must receive approval from the WisconsinHousing and Economic Development Authority or theWisconsin Health and Educational Facilities Authority.The Wisconsin law is silent on state-level approvals orrequirements the PFA must seek or meet in other states inorder to issue bonds. However, the law does prohibit thePFA from issuing bonds to finance a capital improvementproject until a political subdiv ision within whose boundar- ies the project is to be locate d has approved the financing. Summary: An issuer of private activity bonds, formed or organized under the laws of another state and proposing toissue bonds for a project within Washington, is required to provide specific information to the relevant Washingtonstatewide issuing authority and receive its approval toproceed to public hearing. The following info rmation must be received by the authority at least 120 days pr ior to the public hearing for the proposed bond issuance: (1) a copy of the proposednotice of public hearing; (2) the maximum stated principalamount of the bond; (3) th e facility description and loca- tion; (4) the finance plan; (5) the bond issuer's name; (6) the facility owner or princi pal user; (7) how the project will meet Washington's pu blic policy objectives and requirements, and those of the authority; and (8) paymentof a project review fee established by the authority. If the authority finds that the facility and information submitted are consistent with the state's laws, publicpolicy, and best interests, then the authority must authorize the relevant government unit in writing to proceed with thepublic hearing. If the author ity finds the facility and infor- mation submitted inconsistent with the state's laws, publicpolicy, and best interests, the public hearing may not pro-ceed and the bonds may not be issued by the out-of-stateissuer. Each statewide bond issuing authority that is notified by an out-of-state bond issuer of a proposal to issue bonds in Washington must report to the appropriate legislativecommittees documenting: the number, description, cost, and location of a proposed project; whether the projectwas approved by the issuing authority; and its reasons fora disapproval. Reports must be submitted annually from2011-2014, and every five years after. Commerce is prohibited from making an allocation of the state bond cap to a bond issuing authority formed or organized under the laws of another state.

By Representatives Hasegawa, Kenney, Orcutt, Frockt and Stanford. House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Economic Development, Trade & Innovation Background: State Procurement . The Department of General Administration (DGA) establishes overall state policy for state purchasing, and contracts with individualsand companies outside of state government to providegoods and services to the state. Under delegated authority, other state agencies and the in stitutions of higher educa- tion also contract for goods and services. The state's pur-chasing authority is generally organized into categoriesbased on the type of service. Among these categories are: Purchased goods and services . These goods and ser- vices are those provided by a vendor to accomplish routine, continuing, and necessary functions. Personal services . This term refers to professional or technical expertise provided by a consultant toaccomplish a specific study or project. Information services . These services include data processing, telecommunica tions, office automation, and computerized in formation systems. Printing services. This term refers to the production of the state's printed materials.Except in specific circ umstances, Washington law does not provide preferences to bidders who are in-state. The statutory exceptions include: Ferries . In Washington, the Department of Transpor- tation's bid documents for jumbo ferries must include a requirement that the vessels be constructed withinWashington, with exceptions for certain equipment and systems. Washington-grown food for schools . School districts are authorized to implemen t policies to maximize the purchases of Washington-gro wn food. Such policies may include permitting a percentage price preference for Washington-grown food. In-state printing . Printing for state agencies must be done within Washington, unless the work cannot be executed in state or the lowest in-state bid exceeds the customary charges in the private sector. In addition to these in-state preferences, the DGA is required to identify other stat es that provide in-state pref- erences to their own bidders. If a bidder from one of those states submits a bid for a state contract in Washington, the GA may add a percentage increase to that bidder'sproposal. This increase is u sed only to evaluate the bid and is not paid to any supplier whose bid is accepted. Legal Challenges to In-State Preference Laws . State procurement laws that give preference to domestic goods or prohibit purchasing foreign goods have been challengedon one or more grounds. These include arguments thatsuch laws are: (1) invalid exercises of state power underthe Commerce Clause of th e Constitution of the United States; (2) preempted by federal statute or in violation ofinternational agreements on government procurement; or (3) in violation of Equal Protection/Privileges andImmunities clauses of the United States Constitution. Summary: All state purchasing agencies, including insti-tutions of higher education, must establish and implement a plan to increase the number of small businesses annually receiving state contracts for goods and services. The Department of General Administration (DGA) must develop a model plan for state agencies to increase: the number of small businesses registering in the state's common vendor registration and bid notification system; the number of such registered small businesses annu- ally receiving state contracts for goods and services purchased by the state; and the percentage of total state dollars spent for goods and services purchased from such registered smallbusinesses. All state agencies are authorized to adopt the model plan developed by the DGA. Any state purchasing agency not adopting the DGA model pl an must establish and im- plement a plan consistent with the goals required under the DGA model. State purchasing agencies must give technical assistance to small businesses including: providing opportunities for the agency to answer ven- dor questions about the bid solicitation requirements in advance of the bid due date; and holding a debriefing after the contract award to assist vendors in understanding how to improve his or herresponses for future procurements. State purchasing agencies must maintain records of contracts awarded to register ed small businesses to track outcomes regarding the effects of the technical assistance on the number of small businesses annually receiving statecontracts for goods and services purchased by the state.All other state agencies are encouraged to maintain suchrecords of contracts awarded to registered smallbusinesses. Subject to appropriated funds in 2012, by November 15, 2013, and November 15 every two years thereafter,state purchasing agencies must submit a report to theLegislature regarding the effects the technical assistance ishaving on the number of small businesses annually177receiving state contracts for goods and services purchased by the state. Subject to appropriated fu nds in 2012, the DGA, in consultation with the Departme nt of Information Services, the Department of Transportation, and the Department ofCommerce, must develop and implement a web-basedinformation system in order to track the effects the techni- cal assistance is having on the number of small businessesannually receiving state contracts for goods and servicespurchased by the state. On ce the web-based information system is funded and developed, the DGA must make theinformation system available to all state purchasingagencies by December 31, 2013. The act amends the minimum threshold dollar amounts for informal procurem ents which must be placed on the state's online bid notification system. Defines \"state purchasing and \"small business.\"Votes Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed section 5 of the act because it errone ously created a conflict with another state agency procuremen t statute, thus effectively eliminating the ability of st ate agencies to make small purchases without complying with competitive bidding and notice requirements applic able to larger purchases. VETO MESSAGE ON HB 1770 May 16, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 5, House Bill 1770 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to enhancing small business participation in state purchasing.\" I am vetoing Section 5 because it inadvertently eliminated the ability for agencies to make purchases up to three thousand dol- lars based on buyer experience and knowledge of the market and is therefore in conflict with RCW 43.19.1906(2). For this reason I have vetoed Section 5 of House Bill 1770. With the exception of Section 5, House Bill 1770 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire GovernorESHB 1774 C 292 L 11 Concerning dependency matters. By House Committee on Early Learning & Human Ser- vices (originally sponsored by Representatives Goodman,Pettigrew, Orwall, Kenney, Roberts, Kagi and Moscoso). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Early Learning & Human ServicesSenate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Placement of Dependent Children . At the dispositional stage of a dependency matter, if the court orders that the child be pl aced in out-of-home care, the Children's Administration (CA) has the authority to placethe child: with a relative; with another suitable person if the child or family has a preexisting relationship w ith that person and the person has completed all re quired criminal history background checks and otherwise appears to be suit- able and competent to provide care for the child; or in a foster family home or group care facility. The CA may place a child with a non-relative only if the court finds that such a pl acement is in the child's best interest. Reinstatement of Parental Rights . A child may peti- tion the juvenile court to rein state the previously terminat- ed parental rights of his or her parent if the following requirements are met: the child was previously found to be a dependent child; the child's parent's rights were terminated pursuant to a dependency proceeding; the child has not achieved his or her permanency plan within three years of a final order of termination; and the child is at least 12 years old at the time the peti- tion is filed. The court may hear a petition filed by a child younger than 12 years old if the court findsgood cause. After a petition is filed, the court must hold a threshold hearing to consider the parent's fitness and interest in rein- statement of parental rights. If the court finds that the best interests of the child would be served by reinstatement, the court is to hold a hearing on the merits of the petition. The court must c onditionally grant the petition if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child has not achieved his or her permanency plan and is not immi-nently likely to achieve his or her permanency plan andthat reinstatement of parental rights is in the child's best interests. In determining wh ether the child has or has not achieved his or her permanen cy plan or whether the child is likely to achieve his or he r permanency plan, the Depart- ment of Social and Health Services (DSHS) must provideto the court information relate d to any efforts to achieveHouse 74 23Senate 48 1 (Senate amended)House 74 22 (House concurred) ESHB 1774 178the permanency plan including efforts to achieve adoption or a permanent guardianship. In a recent Washington Court of Appeals case, In Re the Interest of J.R. , a 15-year-old child filed a petition to have his mother's parental ri ghts reinstated. When the child was age 5, his mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. Two and a half months after the relin-quishment, the court ordered th at the child be placed in a guardianship with his grandmother and another relative.The guardianship was in place for 10 years until the court terminated the guardianship upon the guardian's request. Shortly thereafter, the child pe titioned to have his mother's rights reinstated. At the threshold hearing, the state arguedthat J.R.'s petition did not meet the statutory criteria because he achieved permanency when he was placed in adependency guardianship within three years of the orderterminating parental rights. The juvenile court stated that although the reinstatement of his mother's parental rights might be in J.R.'s best interests, he did not meet the criteriaestablished for reinstatement petitions. Upon appeal, theCourt of Appeals affirmed the juvenile court and held that only dependent children whose permanent plans were notachieved within three years of a final order of terminationcould petition for reinstatement of parental rights. Thecourt held that J.R.'s pet ition was appropriately dismissed by the juvenile court. Guardians Ad Litem in Adoption Cases . In adoption proceedings, the court must appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) for any alleged parent under 18 years of age.Among other duties, the GAL must report to the courtwhether any written consent by the parent to relinquish thechild for adoption was made voluntarily. The county inwhich a petition is filed in an adoption proceeding mustpay the fees of a court-appointed GAL or attorney. In some cases, the child being adopted has been the subject of earlier dependency proceedings, which means the state has terminated the pare nt's parental rights to the child. In a dependency proceeding, the court determines ifa child should be considered a dependent of the state because of abuse, neglect, ab andonment, or because there is no parent, guardian, or custodian capable of caring forthe child. Once a child is foun d dependent, the court peri- odically reviews the case an d makes determinations about the parent's progress in correc ting parental deficiencies. If the parent fails to take corre ctive measures needed for the child to safely return home, th e court can eventually termi- nate the parent's parental rights. The parent has the rightto an attorney in dependency proceedings. Investigators and GALs in Family Law Cases . In dis- solution cases in which there are minor children, the court must establish a parenting plan setting forth, among otherthings, each parent's reside ntial time with the children. The court may order an investigation and report concern-ing parenting arrangements, may appoint a GAL, or both.The investigation and report may be made by a GAL, thestaff of the court, or a professional social service organiza-tion experienced in counseling children. Some family lawcourts have full- or part-tim e investigators that work for the court. The term \"investigator\" is used in the statutesbut not defined. In counties with a court- appointed special advocate (CASA) program for family law cases, the court mayappoint a GAL from the CASA program. The GALs andCASAs must comply with cer tain training requirements developed by the Administrative Office of the Courts.Generally, the court must sp ecify the hourly rate a GAL may charge and specify the maximum amount the GALmay charge without additional court approval. The court must specify rates and fees in the order appointing theGAL or at the earliest date th e court is able to determine the appropriate rates and fees. Summary: Placement of Dependent Children . The DSHS or a supervising agen cy, when considering out of home placement of a child at the dispositional stage of a dependency, may consider placement of the dependent child with a person with whom the child's sibling or half- sibling is placed or with the adoptive parent of the child'ssibling or half-sibling as long as the person or adoptiveparent passes the criminal background check and is other- wise competent to provide ca re for the dependent child. Reinstatement of Parental Rights . A child may peti- tion the juvenile court to rein state the previously terminat- ed parental rights of his or her parent if the following requirements are met: the child was previously found to be a dependent child; the child's parent's rights were terminated pursuant to a dependency proceeding; the child has not achieved his or her permanency plan, or the child achieved a permanency plan, but it has not since been sustained; three years have passed since the final order of termi- nation was entered; and the child is at least 12 years old at the time the peti- tion is filed, unless the court finds good cause to accept a petition for a child younger than 12 years old. Guardians Ad Litem in Adoption Cases . If the child in the adoption proceeding is a dependent child of a minor parent, and the miner parent is represented by an attorney or a GAL in the dependency proceeding, the court mayrely on the parent's depend ency attorney or the GAL to report to the court regarding the voluntariness of any writ- ten consent to adoption or petition for relinquishment signed by the parent. When a GAL is appointed in an adoption case, the court must direct who shall pay the GAL's fee. If the courtorders the parties to pay the GAL fee, the fee must beestablished under the same procedures that GAL fees areestablished in family law cases. Investigators . The term \"investigator\" is defined to mean a person appointed by th e court as a full- or part-timeE2SHB 1776 179assistant to the court or any other third-party professional ordered or appointed by the court to provide an opinion, assessment, or evaluation regarding the creation or modi-fication of a parenting plan. It is made explicit that the court may appoint an investig ator in family law cases to make recommendatio ns to the court. Investigators who are not supervised by a GAL or by a CASA program must comply with the trainingrequirements applicable to the GALs or the CASAs. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 E2SHB 1776 C 359 L 11 Regarding licensing requiremen ts for child care centers located in publicly owne d or operated buildings. By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally spon sored by Representatives Eddy, Dickerson, Carlyle, Maxwell, Fitzgibbon, Roberts, Pedersen, Hudgins, Ryu, Kenney and Stanford). House Committee on Early Learning & Human ServicesHouse Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: The Department of Early (DEL) regulates child care in Washington. Th e DEL licenses three catego- ries of child care providers: family homes, child carecenters, and school-age centers. Separate sets of licensingrules are used to regulate e ach type of provider. Some features related to each provider type include: Family home child care providers care for children up to 11 years of age in a home setting. Child care centers provide care for children up to 12 years of age. These centers operate in commercial, privately owned, school, or faith-based facilities. School-age centers care for children ages 5 through 12. These centers usually operate in a school setting, but can be located in commercial, privately owned, orfaith-based facilities. The DEL's licensing rules operate in accordance with accepted fire and building code standards that apply to any given facility type. These co des may vary by geographic location and are determined by various jurisdictions. The DEL has a process in place to waive some licensingrequirements in some cases. School boards are authoriz ed to establish and maintain preschools and to provide before- and after-school careand vacation care in connec tion with schools in theirdistricts. School boards may establish regulations govern-ing preschools and before- and after-school care. Summary: The DEL is required to use an interagency process to address health and safety requirements for child care programs for school-age children operated in build- ings that contain public or pr ivate schools that safely serve children during times that school is in session. The DELis required to consult with the State Fire Marshal as part ofthe interagency process.

By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Pedersen, Upthegrove, Takko, Blake, Rodne, Smith, Carlyle, Fitzgibbon,Springer, Angel and Kenney). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Background: The Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (SMA) governs uses of state shorelines. The SMA enun- ciates state policy to provide for shoreline management byplanning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriateuses. The SMA prioritizes public shoreline access andenjoyment and creates preference criteria that must beused by state and local gove rnments in regulating shore- line uses. Preferred shoreline uses, as specified in theSMA, are uses that are consistent with the control of pol-lution and the prevention of da mage to the natural environ- ment, or are unique to or dependent upon use of the state'sshoreline. The SMA involves a cooperative regulatory approach between local governments and the state. At the locallevel, the SMA regulations are developed in city and coun- ty shoreline master progra ms (master programs) that regulate land use activities in shoreline areas of the state.Master programs must be consistent with guidelinesadopted by the Department of Ecology (DOE). Masterprograms, and segments of or amendments to, becomeeffective when appr oved by the DOE. Summary: Floating homes that were permitted or legally established before January 1, 2011, must be classifiedunder the SMA as a conforming preferred use. Applicable terms are defined. A \"floating home\" is a single-family dwelling unit cons tructed on a float that is moored, anchored, or otherwise secured in waters.Although a floating home may be capable of being towed,a floating home may not be a vessel. \"ConformingHouse 95 0Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)House 62 35Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 71 25 (House concurred)E2SHB 1789 180preferred use\" means that applicable development and master program regulations may only impose reasonable conditions and mitigation that will not effectively precludethe maintenance, repair, re placement, and remodeling of existing floating homes and moorages by rendering thoseactions impracticable.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Goodman, Pedersen, Roberts and Miloscia). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on JudiciarySenate Committee on Transportation Background: Gross Misdemeanor Driving Under the In- fluence . The misdemeanant driv ing under the influence (DUI) law contains a complex system of mandatory mini- mum penalties that escalate b ased on the number of \"prior offenses\" the offender has within seven years and the of-fender's blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC) forthe current offense. \"Prior offenses\" is defined to includeDUI-related convictions an d convictions for certain offenses, such as reckless driving, when the charge wasoriginally filed as DUI. There are criminal and administrative consequences for DUI. Criminal penalties include jail time, driver'slicense suspension, monetary fines, alcohol assessmentand treatment, and ignitio n interlock requirements. Administrative consequences include license suspension and ignition interlock requir ements, whether or not the person is ever charged or convicted. Felony DUI . A conviction for DUI is a class C felony if the driver has: (a) four or more prior offenses within 10years; or (b) any prior convi ction of a DUI-related vehic- ular homicide or vehicular assault, or a comparable out-of-state conviction. License Suspension and Ign ition Interlock Require- ments . Regardless of whether a driver is convicted of DUI, the Department of Licensing (DOL) will suspend aperson's driver's license if the person's BAC is .08 orhigher or if the person refused to take the BAC.Depending on the circumstances, the administrative li-cense suspension may range from 90 days to two years.Therefore, it is possible for a person to first have his or herlicense suspended administrati vely and then have his or her license suspended based on a criminal conviction forthe same incident. After the suspension period expires and the person is eligible to reinstate his or her regular license, the person must drive with an ignitio n interlock device (IID) for either one year, five years, or 10 years, depending onwhether the person was previously restricted. Fees Imposed on Offenders . In addition to other monetary penalties, a fee of $125 is imposed on personsconvicted, sentenced to a lesser charge, or given a deferredprosecution as a result of an arrest for DUI, vehicularhomicide, or vehicular assault. The stated purpose of the fee is to fund the state to xicology laboratory and the Washington State Patrol for grants and activities toincrease the conviction rate and decrease the number ofDUIs. The court may suspend a ll or part of the fee if it finds that the offender is not able to pay. The clerk of the court collects the fee and distributes it as follows: 40 percent is distributed between the state and local government, based on existing statutes dividing the noninterest portion of fees collected by the courts; 60 percent is forwarded to the State Treasurer to be deposited in the following ways : (a) 15 percent in the Death Investigations Account to fund the state's BAC testing programs; and (b) 85 percent in the State Patrol Highway Account to fund activities to increase the conviction rate and decrease the incidences of DUI. DUI Victim Impact Panels . The court may order a person convicted of DUI to a ttend a victim impact panel (VIP). There is nothing in statute that requires a VIP to be conducted by certain entiti es or organizations. Some courts, such as King County District Court, have adoptedminimum standards for VIPs. Specialty Courts . A specialty or therapeutic court, which may be created within su perior court, often requires the offender to undergo trea tment, counseling, and educa- tional programs. Some superior courts have establisheddrug courts and mental health courts. At least five coun-ties have specialty courts for offenders convicted of DUI. Summary: Prior Offenses . The definition of prior offenses is expanded to incl ude a conviction for vehicular assault or vehicular homicide, based on driving in a reck- less manner or driving with the disregard for the safety of others, if the original charge was filed as a vehicularassault or vehicular homicide, based on DUI. Felony DUI . The offense of DUI becomes a felony DUI if the person has ever previously been convicted of felony DUI in Washington. Ignition Interlock Requirements . When calculating the time a person is required to have an IID installed, theHouse 58 40Senate 47 2 (Senate amended)House 65 32 (House concurred)ESHB 1790 181DOL must give a person day-for-day credit for the time period, starting from the date of the incident, during which the person kept an IID installed. A person convicted of negligent driving in the first degree must install an ign ition interlock device for six months on all vehicles operated by the person if the personhas any prior offense within seven years. A person con-victed of reckless driving who has any prior offense withinseven years must install an ig nition interlock device for six months if the original charge was filed as a DUI. A personconvicted of reckless driving, whether or not the person has any prior offenses, must install an ignition interlockdevice for six months if the original charge was filed asvehicular assault based on DUI or vehicular homicidebased on DUI. Fees Imposed on Offenders . The $125 fee imposed on offenders is increased to $2 00. Of the total amount, $175 must be distributed in the same manner as the current feeis distributed, and $25 of the fee must be deposited into the Highway Safety Account to be used solely for funding Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC) grants toreduce statewide collisions caused by DUI. Grant recipi-ents may include DUI courts and jurisdictions implement- ing victim impact panel registries. DUI Courts . Counties may establish and operate DUI courts. A jurisdiction seeking state funds for a DUI courtmust first exhaust all federa l funding available to support a DUI court and provide a dollar-for-dollar match of statemoneys. State money must be used to supplement, notsupplant, other funds. The DUI courts already in exis-tence as of January 1, 2011, are not required to match statefunds until June 30, 2014. Minimum requirements arecreated for DUI courts established under the act. Victim Impact Panels . The WTSC may develop and maintain a registry of qualified VIPs. When a courtrequires an offender to atte nd a VIP, the court may refer the offender to a VIP listed on the registry. To be listed on the registry, the VIP must meet certain minimum standardscreated by the act. Other Provisions . When a court imposes alcohol monitoring on a person under the ignition interlock license law, the monitoring must be for the period of time of themandatory license suspension. Language is added to the sentencing enhancement statute applicable to vehicular homicide convictions tomake it explicit that the enha ncement is mandatory, must be served in total confinemen t, and must run consecutively to all other sentencing provisions.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Da mmeier, Sullivan, Hinkle, Green and Ormsby). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Legislation enacted in 2007 created a new insurance law allowing dire ct patient-provider primary health care practices. The di rect practices were explicitly exempted from the definitio n of health care service contractors in the insurance la w. Direct practices furnish primary care services in exchan ge for a direct fee from a patient. Services are limited to primary care, including screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for thepurpose of promotion of health, and detection and man-agement of disease or injury. Direct practices are alsoallowed to pay for charges asso ciated with routine lab and imaging services. Direct practices are prevented fromaccepting payments for services provided to direct carepatients from regulated insura nce carriers, all insurance programs administered by the Washington State HealthCare Authority (Authority), or self-insured plans. Direct practices may accept payment of direct fees directly orindirectly from non-employer third parties, but are prevented from selling their dire ct agreements directly to employer groups. School districts and educational service districts may bargain with their employees ov er \"basic benefits,\" a lim- ited group of benefits defined as including medical, dental,vision, group term life, and group long-term disabilitybenefits. The benefits may be provided through contractswith private carriers, contracts with the Authority,self- insurance, or ot her self-funded mechanisms. Summary: Direct agreements are added to the definition of \"optional benefits\" for school and educational servicedistrict employees that may be determined through collec- tive bargaining. School and educational service districtboards are authorized to make direct agreements availableto employees among the other employee benefits offeredto employees through contracts with private carriers, theAuthority, or through self -insurance or self-funding. Direct practice agreements made available by school dis-tricts must comply with requirements of state laws ondirect agreements.

House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: Motions to Seal Records . The \"official juvenile court file\" is the lega l file of the juvenile court containing petitions, inform ation, motions, memoran- dums, briefs, findings of the court, and court orders. Thesocial file is the juvenile court file which contains therecords and reports of a probation counselor. Juvenilerecords are a combination of the official juvenile court file, the social file, and the records of any other juvenile justiceor care agency regarding a particular case. In order to request that his or her juvenile records be sealed, a person must file a motion with the superior court. Courts do not have the author ity to issue an order sealing the record of an adjudication for a sex offense. The court may order the following records to be sealed: class A offenses where the person has spent five consecutive years since the last date of release from confinement, full-time residential treatment, or entry of disposition in the co mmunity without being convicted of any offense or crime; and class B, class C, gr oss misdemeanor, and misde- meanor offenses and diversions where the person hasspent two consecutive years since the last date of release from confinement, fu ll-time residential treat- ment, or entry of disposition in the community without being convicted of any offense or crime. In addition, the court may not order juvenile records sealed if there is: a proc eeding pending against the mov- ing party seeking his or her conviction for a juvenile or criminal offense; a proceeding pending seeking the forma- tion of a diversion agreement with that person; and full restitution that has not been fully paid. If the court grants the motion to seal, the order to seal covers the juvenile court file, the social file, and otherrecords relating to the case as are named in the order. The order to seal means the proceedings in the case are treatedas though they never occurred and the subject of therecords may reply accordingly to any inquiry about the events contained in the record. Fair Credit Reporting Act . The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) generally requires that credit reporting agen- cies, also known as consumer reporting agencies, follow reasonable procedures to pr otect the confidentiality, accu- racy, and relevance of credit information. To accomplishthis, the FCRA establishes a framework of fairinformation practices for pe rsonal information maintained by credit reporting agencies that includes the right to access and correct data, data security, limitations on use,requirements for data destru ction, notice, consent, and accountability. Consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from making a consumer report that contains informationregarding records of arrest, indictment, or conviction of acrime where more than seven years has elapsed since the date or disposition, release, or parole. Pardons . Under the Washington State Constitution, the authority to pardon an in dividual rests with the Gover- nor. The Governor may gran t a full or conditional pardon. The Governor may also commute a death sentence to oneof life imprisonment. The Clemency and Pardons Board(Board) may receive and cons ider petitions from individ- uals, organizations, and the Department of Corrections forreview and commutation of sentences and pardoning of offenders in extraordinary cases. The Board makes rec-ommendations regarding a request for pardon orcommutation to the Governor. Summary: Fair Credit Reporting Act . Consumer report- ing agencies are prohibited from making a consumerreport containing juvenile re cords where the subject of the records is 21 years or older at the time of the report. This prohibition does not apply where a consumer report isused in connection with: (1 ) a credit transaction involving or may reasonably be expected to involve $50,000 ormore; (2) the underwriting of life insurance involving, or that may reasonably be expected to involve, $50,000 ormore; or (3) employment of an individual at an annual sal- ary that equals or that may re asonably be expected to equal $20,000 or more. No arrests, indictments, or convictionsof an adult may be included in a report where more thanseven years has elapsed sinc e the date of disposition, release, or parole. Joint Legislative Task Force . A joint legislative task force is convened to determ ine how to cost-effectively restrict public access to juvenile records when a person hasmet the statutory requirements for sealing those records.The cost effective measures to be considered should allow a person to seal his or her ju venile records without filing a motion to seal. The task force must also determine how torestrict access to diversion records and any other issuesthat may arise during the work of the task force. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives each appoint two members fromthe largest caucuses of their respective chambers. Onemember from each chamber co-chairs the task force. Thelegislative members convene the first meeting of the taskforce. In addition to the legislative members, the task force must include representatives of the following entities: The Administrative Office of the Courts; The Judicial Informa tion Systems Data Dissemina- tion Committee;HB 1794 183 The Association of Counties, specifically county clerks; The Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys; The Washington State Patrol; The Juvenile Law section of the Washington State Bar Association; The Washington Defender's Association; The Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration; and The Juvenile Court Administrators Association. Staff support for the task force must be provided by Senate Committee Services and the Office of Program Research. Pardons . Where the subject of juvenile records has received a full and unconditio nal pardon, the proceedings for which the pardon was granted are treated as if theynever occurred. An agency, in response to an inquiryregarding such records, must reply that no information can be given about the existence or nonexistence of records concerning the pardoned individual. All records maintained by any court or law enforce- ment agency must be automatically destroyed within 30days of being notified by th e Governor's office that the subject of those records has received a full and unconditional pardon. The provisions regarding th e juvenile records after a pardon has been granted apply retroactively andprospectively.

By Representatives Ladenburg, Klippert and Kelley; by request of Board For Judicial Administration. House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: Generally, a person commits Assault if he or she: (a) attempts, with unl awful force, to inflict bodily injury upon another; (b) unlawfully touches anotherperson with criminal intent; or (c) puts another person in apprehension of harm. The crime is divided into four degrees depending on the manner in which it was committed or the amount of harm caused to the victim. For instance, an assault that would normally be considered Assault in the fourth degree(a gross misdemeanor offense) may be elevated to Assaultin the third degree (a serio usness level III, class C felony offense) if the assault was committed against a certainclass of persons. For example, an assault against a fire-fighter performing his or her official duties at the time ofthe assault is automatically Assault in the third degree.Similar provisions exist for assaults against transit opera-tors, school bus drivers, law enforcement officers, andhealth care providers. An offender convicted of Assault in the third degree may receive a maximum sentence of five years in prison,a maximum fine of $10,000, or both imprisonment and afine for the class C felony offense. Assault in the fourthdegree is a gross misdemeanor offense punishable by asentence of up to one year in jail or a maximum fine of$5,000, or both imprisonment and a fine. Summary: An assault that would normally be Assault in the fourth degree may be elev ated to Assault in the third degree. If the assault offe nse was committed against a judicial officer, court-related employee, county clerk, orcounty clerk's employee, who was performing his or herofficial duties at the time of the assault or as a result of thatperson's employment with the judicial system. A \"court-related employee\" includes bailiffs, court reporters, judicial assistants, court managers, courtmanagers' employees, and any other employee, regardless of title, who is engaged in equivalent functions.

The plan set targets forHouse 56 41Senate 41 7 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur) Conference Committee Senate 26 20House 65 31House 97 0Senate 0E2SHB 1795 184additional degree and certificate attainment totaling 31,800 additional certificates and degrees annually. In 2010 the Governor appointed a Higher Education Task Force (Task Force), composed of Washington busi-ness and education leaders, to develop a plan to addressthe need for increasing the number of Washington resi-dents with college degrees. The Task Force recommend-ed: increasing college degre es including in high demand fields such as science, t echnology, engineering, and math; providing universities with increased flexibility to set tuition based upon tuition levels in the Global Challenge States; expanding financial assistance to low- and middle- income students through an endowment and taxincentive; and holding public univers ities accountable for graduat- ing more students, and improving student transfer andawarding of academic credits. Tuition Setting Authority . Between 1999 and 2009, governing boards of each in stitution of higher education and the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) were granted authority to increasetuition rates for resident un dergraduate students within caps set by the Legislature in the state omnibus operating appropriations act (operating budget). Prior to 1999tuition was set in statute as do llar amounts for each public institution. Between 1999 and 2009 tuition levels authorized by statute varied. Tuition amounts (or percenta ge increases) specified in statute have referred only to the \"tuition\" portion of tuition and fees. Public colleges and universities are authorizedto assess additional fees such as services and activities fees and technology fees within statutory limits. In 2009 the Legislature directed that increases in tuition for resident undergraduates may not exceed 7percent per year, except in 2009-2011. Guaranteed Education Tuition Program . Most states have a form of a \"529 Plan\" operated by a state or educa- tional institution designed to help families set aside fundsfor future college costs. They are named after section 529of the Internal Revenue Code which created these types ofsavings plans in 1996. Wash ington's Guaranteed Educa- tion Tuition (GET) Program was created in 1998 asWashington's prepaid college tuition program. The GET Program allows purchasers to buy tuition units at current prices for use at a later date. These funds are invested bythe State Investment Board and the purchaser is guaran-teed that one year's worth of units purchased now will beworth one year's worth of publ ic university tuition in the future. One hundred GET units are equal to one year ofresident undergraduate tuition and state-mandated fees atthe most expensive public university in Washington. Performance . In July 2010 the National Governor's Association (NGA) release d recommendations on thecommon higher education measu res that states should col- lect and report publicly. The Task Force in Washingtonrecommended adoption of the NGA metrics: outcome metrics: degrees awarded, graduation rates, transfer rates, and time and credits to degree; and progress metrics: enrollment in remedial education, success in remedial education, success in first-year college courses, credit accumulation, retention rates, and course completion. The Task Force also recommended developing a pro- gram to incentivize four-year public baccalaureate institu- tions to meet degree production, retention, and highdemand degree targets. A limited financial incentive isprovided for making measured progress. This is similar tothe Student Achievement Initia tive of the SBCTC adopted by the community and technical college system inWashington. The Student Achievement Initiative is a performance funding system to incentivize colleges to employ strate- gies that promote student success. The SBCTC identifiedkey academic benchmarks that students must meet tosuccessfully complete degrees and certificates, known asAchievement Measures which are: building towards college level skills (basic skills gains, passing pre-colle ge writing or math); first year retention (ear ning 15 and then 30 college level credits); completing college level math (passing math courses required for either technical or academic associate degrees); and completions (degrees, certificates, and apprenticeship training).Between the 2006-2007 baseline year and 2008-2009, the first performance year, the colleges served 4 percent more students but increased student achievement by 19 percent with the greatest gains occurring in all points. For public baccalaureate institutions, legislation enacted in 2008 required the establishment of pilot perfor-mance agreements. The purpose is to develop a six-yearplan that aligns higher education policy goals and desiredoutcomes with resources. Performance agreements mayaddress a variety of elements including benchmarks and goals for long-term degree production, recruitment andretention, quality, timeline ss of student progress, and costs, among others. Othe r accountability provisions include reporting data to the HECB and the Office ofFinancial Management (OFM). Summary: Tuition Policy Tuition-setting authority is granted to the four-year coll eges and universities for all students for eight years, through the 2018-19 academic year. Beginning in the 2015-16 through 2018-19 academ- ic years they are granted tuition-setting authority within limits based on a state funding baseline year and fundingfor similar higher education institutions in the GlobalChallenge States. In the 2019-20 academic year, tuition-E2SHB 1795 185setting authority for resident students at public baccalaureate institutions reverts to the Legislature. The University of Washingt on is required to enroll at least the same number of resident freshman undergraduatestudents each academic year as enrolled in 2009-10. Tuition for community and technical college students is set by the Legislature in the operating budget. TheSBCTC may authorize differential tuition models. Student Financial Aid . Instead of 3.5 percent, public baccalaureate institutions that increase tuition above tuition increases assumed in the operating budget mustremit 5 percent of operating f ees back to students in the form of financial aid. Pu blic baccalaureate institutions that do not increase tuition beyond levels assumed in theoperating budget must remit 4 percent of operating fees inthe form of financial aid. All of the increases in theamount required to be retain ed by public baccalaureate institutions for purposes of the institutional financial aid fund must be specifically ta rgeted for financial aid pro- grams for needy students, such as need-based institutionalemployment or need-based tuition and fees scholarship orgrant programs, and not be used for any of the other pur-poses such as short and long term loans and financial aidfor high school students enrolled in dual credit programs. To offset increased tuition, public baccalaureate insti- tutions must provide financial assistance to State NeedGrant-eligible students, resi dent low- and middle- income students via a specific form ula depending on tuition price as a percentage of median family income in variousincome brackets up to 125 percent of the median familyincome. This applies when a public baccalaureate institu-tion raises tuition beyond levels assumed in the operatingbudget. Financial assistance may be provided via variousmethods with sources from tu ition revenue, locally held funds, tuition waivers, or local financial aid programs. Colleges and universities must collaborate with student associations to make every effort to communicatethe American Opportunity Tax Credit and other credits tostudents and report on the effectiveness of these methods.Public baccalaureate institutio ns must report on: methods of providing financial assi stance; impacts of tuition increases on resident students including debt burdens,excluding private loans; and devise plans to mitigate for negative effects on the student population. The key pur-pose of the annual report is to provide information to theLegislature on impacts to students and educational access,affordability, and quality as a result of granting flexible tuition setting authority. Data on student impacts must be disaggregated by income bracket for both the reports by public baccalaure-ate institutions related to im pacts on tuition increases and also for data gathered to report on outcomes. The HECB, in consultation with four-year colleges and universities and the SBCTC, must develop State NeedGrant award criteria and methods of disbursement basedon level of need, and not solely rely on a first-come, first- served basis. Accountability . Higher education institutions must report by December 1 annually on performance data thataligns with the National Governor's Association Complete to Compete metrics with additions that include: graduate and professional degrees; Science, Technology, Engineer-ing, and Mathematics participa tion; student debt load; and disaggregation of measures based on various studentdemographics, including socio-economic status andincome level, among others. Each four-year public baccalaureate institution must develop a performance plan and include a minimum set ofexpected outcomes, and higher education institutions must display accountability data on the OFM website. The Joint Legislative Au dit and Review Committee must conduct a performance audit in calendar year 2018 tounderstand the impact of institutional tuition-settingauthority on student access, af fordability, and institutional quality, and provide recommendations on whether tocontinue the authority beyond the 2018-19 academic year. Dual Enrollment . Running Start students may be charged up to 10 percent of tuition and fees in addition toother mandatory fees. All public colleges and universitiesmust make every effort possible to communicate availablewaivers to eligible low-inco me Running Start students. Transfer and Prior Credit Policy . Public baccalaureate institutions must award junior standing to a Washingtoncommunity and technical coll ege graduate who has earned a transferable associate of arts or sciences degree. A grad-uate who has earned the direct transfer associate of arts de-gree must be deemed to have met the lower divisiongeneral education requirements when transferring to afour-year college or univers ity and four-year colleges must award a student junior standing when accepting transferstudents from other Washingt on four-year colleges and universities. All public colleges and un iversities must develop a minimum of one degree within the arts and sciences disci-plines that can be completed within the equivalent of 90quarter upper division credits by any student who enters acollege or university with junior status and lower divisiongeneral education requirements completed. Communityand technical colleges must identify and publish in their admissions materials college level courses that are recog-nized by all four-year colleges and universities as transfer-able to those colleges and univ ersities. Publication of the list of courses must be easily identified and accessible on the college's website. A credit for prior learning work group is established. Regulatory Relief . Performance ag reements for pub- lic baccalaureate institutions are repealed. Procurement thresholds are aligned when higher edu- cation agencies contract with consultants at $10,000 for informal contracts that do not require documented2SHB 1803 186evidence of competitions an d $100,000 for formal con- tracts that require documented evidence of formal compe- tition. Purchase of equipmen t maintenance agreements is permitted for periods of longer than one year. The OFM is required to work with state agencies and the council of presidents to convene and interagency work group to develop and implement improved administrationand management practices that enhance the efficiency andeffectiveness of operations th roughout higher education campuses and report progress to the Legislature byNovember 15, 2012, and November 15, 2013. Until June 30, 2011, the following provisions are removed for public higher education institutions: short-term restrictions on meeting in private spaces; short-term prohibitions on personal service contracts; short-term prohibitions on equipment purchases over $5,000; short-term prohibitions on out-of state travel; short-term prohibitions on hiring for new or vacant positions; and short-term restrictions on salary and wage increases for academic personnel. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 June 6, 2011 (Section 26) Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed sections 13 through 24, as their content is addressed in other enact- ed legislation. The vetoed sections relate to: (1) compet- itive solicitation requiremen ts for personal services contracts and other purchases that are less than $100,000;(2) the requirement that no payments may be made in advance for equipment mainte nance services to be per- formed in excess of one y ear; and (3) various spending freezes that expire on June 30, 2011, such as hiring,personal service contracts, equipment, out of state travel and training, and board member travel allowances. Section 25, which relates to exempting higher education institutions from prohibitio ns on wage and salary increases granted with non-state funds, is vetoed. VETO MESSAGE ON E2SHB 1795 June 6, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 13 through 25, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1795 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the highe r education opportunity act.\" Sections 13 and 14 exempt highe r education from the require- ments of competitive solicitation for personal services contracts and other purchases that are le ss than $100,000. Current law re- quires competitive solic itation for personal service contract great- er than $20,000 and for other purchases greater than $35,000. Section 15 exempts higher educati on from the requirement that no payments may be made in adv ance for equipment maintenanceservices to be performed in exce ss of one year. Other legislation requires a study and the establishm ent of a policy regarding these practices for all of state gover nment, including higher education institutions. Sections 16 through 24 exempt higher education from various spending freezes, such as hiring, personal service contracts, equipment, out of state trav el and training, and board member travel allowances t hat were imposed during the 2009-2011 bienni- um. These freezes expire on June 30, 2011. Due to the length of the regular legislative session and spec ial session, sections 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 have no operative effect because the restrictions expire before the law takes effect. Section 25 would exempt, through June 30, 2011, higher educa- tion institutions from prohibiti ons on wage and salary increases granted with non-state funds. These prohibitions on wage and sal- ary increases are reinstated for the 2011-13 biennium in SB 5860for all of state government. In addition, the underlying statute al- ready provides an exemption for higher education to the wage and salary freeze if increases are needed for recruitment and retentionpurposes. For these reason, I am vetoing Sections 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1795. Hi gher education instituti ons are still prohibited from granting wage and salary in creases using tuition funding for the 2011-13 biennium, unless in creases are necessary for recruitment and retention. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 13 through 25 of Engrossed Second Substit ute House Bill 1795. With the exception of Sections 13 through 25, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1795 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor 2SHB 1803 C 83 L 11 Modifying the Columbia river basin management program. By House Committee on Capita l Budget (originally spon- sored by Representatives Chandler, Van De Wege, Blake, Kretz and Warnick; by request of Department of Ecology). House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy Background: Columbia River Basin Water Supply Management Program . In 2006 legislation was enacted creating the Columbia River Basin Water Supply Devel- opment Program and directing the Department of Ecology (DOE) to aggressively pursue the development of watersupplies to benefit both in stream and out-of-stream uses. The Columbia River Basin Water Supply Develop- ment Account . The Columbia River Basin Water Supply Development Account (Devel opment Account) is autho- rized to receive direct appropriations, payments made pur-suant to voluntary regional agreements, and funds fromother sources. Expenditu res from the Development Account may be used to: assess, plan, and develop new storage; improve or alter operations of existing storageHouse 79 17Senate 32 13 E2SHB 1808 187facilities; implement conservation projects; or any other actions designed to provide access to new water supplieswithin the Columbia River Basin. Two-thirds of the fundsplaced in the Development Account must be used tosupport the development of new storage facilities. Theremaining one-third must be used for other purposes listedin statute. Water supplies secured through the development of new storage facilities made po ssible with funding from the Development Account must be allocated as follows: two-thirds of active storage must be available for appropriation for out -of-stream uses; and one-third of active storage must be available to augment instream flows managed by the DOE. Summary: The Columbia River Basin Water Supply Development Account . The Development Account is intended to fund projects using tax exempt bonds. Inaddition to the projects already allowed by statute, expen-ditures from the Developmen t Account may be used to develop pump exchanges. Two-thirds of the funds placedin the Development Account mu st be used to support the development of new stor age facilities and pump exchanges. Pump exch anges are defined. Two-thirds of the water made available through reop- eration of Sullivan Lake fu nded from the Development Account must be used to supply or offset out-of-streamuses in Ferry, Douglas, Lincol n, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, and Stevens counties. At least one-half of this quantitymust be made available for municipal, domestic, andindustrial uses. New Columbia River Basin Accounts . The Columbia River Basin Taxable Bond Water Supply DevelopmentAccount (Bond Account) and the Columbia River Basin Water Supply Revenue Recovery Account (RevenueAccount) are created. The Bond Account and RevenueAccount are allowed to accept direct appropriations, mon-eys directed pursuant to voluntary regional agreements, orfunds from other sources. The Revenue Account is alsoallowed to accept revenue from water service contracts.The Bond Account is intended to fund projects using taxable bonds. Expenditures from the Bond Account and the Reve- nue Account may be used for the same purposes autho-rized under the Development Ac count. Two-thirds of the moneys placed in the Bond Account and the RevenueAccount must be used to su pport the development of new storage facilities and pump ex changes. The remaining one-third must be used for the other purposes specified inthe act. Funds may not be expended from the Bond Account or the Revenue Account for the construction of a new storagefacility until the DOE evaluates certain criteria, includingthe water uses to be served by the facility and the benefits and costs to the state.With certain exceptions, net water savings achieved through conservation measu res funded by the Bond Account or Recovery Account must be placed in trust inproportion to the state funding provided to implement aproject. The DOE may enter into wa ter service contracts with applicants receiving water fro m the program to recover all or a portion of the cost of developing the water supply.Costs recovered under water service contracts do notinclude staff time. With the applicant's concurrence, the DOE may receive power revenue generated by the watersupply developed by the DOE through water service con-tracts. The DOE may deny an application if the applicant does not enter into a water service contract. Provisions are created to address how water supplies secured through the developm ent of new storage facilities, made possible with fundin g from the Bond Account and Revenue Account, must be allocated. Aggregating Projects . The DOE is required to evalu- ate options for aggregating projects to achieve instreamand out-of-stream allocations required by statute. TheDOE must report its findings to the Legislature bySeptember 15, 2011. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 E2SHB 1808 C 77 L 11 Creating the launch year program. By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representatives Lytton, Dammeier, Maxwell, Dahlquist, Sullivan,Reykdal, Liias, Finn, Sells, Or wall, Rolfes and Kenney; by request of Governor Gregoire). House Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education Background: Dual Credit Programs . In November 2010 the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) released a report regarding student participation in dual credit programs. An analysis of students' schedules for the 2009-2010 school year, as reported in the ComprehensiveEducation Data and Research System show that 10.9 per-cent of all high school courses taken can earn dual credit.Whether or not a student will be able to leave high schoolwith a full year of postsecondary credit varies dependingon the subject matter and program requirements in eachapprenticeship program or institution of higher education.A variety of education programs allow high schoolHouse 97 0 Senate 47 0E2SHB 1808 188students to earn postsecond ary course credit while also earning credit toward high school graduation. Running Start . Running Start students have the oppor- tunity to study on a college campus while acquiring credits that count toward both high school and college graduation.If the student passes the college course, he or she receivesthe same amount of credit as any other college student tak-ing the course. The students do not pay tuition for Run-ning Start classes. Rather, for a full-time Running Startstudent, a school district re tains 7 percent of the basic education allocation and prov ides the remainder to the higher education institution. A Running Start student maybe charged some fees. College in the High School . College in the high school permits students to complete college level work while staying on their high school campuses. High school teachers typically form a re lationship with a college or university and receive adjunct, extension, or lecturerstatus. They work with a professor to align a particularhigh school course with a college level course published inthe college catalog. The colle ge course is then taught to high school students by the high school teacher during theregular school day. Students usually pay a fee for thisprogram which varies based on the area of study. Otherfunding, fees, and eligibilit y requirements are negotiated by participating schools through a local contract. Tech Prep . Tech Prep is a cooperative effort between K-12 schools, community and technical colleges, and thebusiness community to develop applied integrated,academic, and technical programs. These professionaltechnical courses are taught on high school campuses by high school instructors. The instructors work with localcolleges to assure the courses are taught at the collegelevel and articulate to the colle ge program. Each of the state's 22 Tech Prep consor tia have developed competen- cy-based agreements between high schoolsand colleges that help studen ts transition from high school into postsecondary professional technical programs.Through Tech Prep articula tion agreements, colleges award credit to students wh o successfully complete col- lege-equivalent courses and programs with a \"B\" or betterwhile still in high school. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Programs . Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB ) programs allow students to take col- lege level courses while stay ing on their high school cam- puses. For both of these programs, students complete courses taught by high schoo l teachers and then must pass a standardized examination at the end of the courses. Students pay the exam fees. Whether college credit is awarded depends upon a student's score on the exam. ForAP, students score from zero to five points. Minimum scores to qualify for college cr edit vary by college and by subject area. Running Start for the Trades . Running Start for the Trades began in 2006 with the purpose of expandingapprenticeship opportunities for high school students.High schools work closely w ith local apprenticeship pro- grams to prepare students to enter apprenticeships imme-diately after graduation. Depending upon the program,students may earn direct entr y into an apprenticeship pro- gram or enhance their chances of entry into a program. Higher Education Coordinating Board . The Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) is a 10-membercitizen board appointed by the Governor and confirmed bythe Senate. Established by law, the HECB provides vision, leadership, and coordination for the state's public collegesand universities. The HECB administers state and federalfinancial aid. State Board for Community and Technical Colleges . The State Board for Community and Technical Colleges(SBCTC) is governed by a nine-member board appointedby the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. TheSBCTC is responsible for prov iding leadership and coor- dination for Washington's public system of 34 communityand technical colleges. Summary: Within existing resources, all public high schools in the state must work toward the goal of offering a sufficient number of high school courses to give students the opportunity to earn the equivalent of one year's worth of postsecondary credit toward a certificate, apprentice-ship program, technical degree, or associate or baccalaure-ate degree. All public high schools must inform students and their families about the opportunities these coursesprovide to earn postsecondary credit and get an advancestart on their career and postsecondary education, if theyearn the qualifying score on the proficiency exam orthrough the demonstrated competencies. By December 1, 2011, and biennially each June there- after, institutions of higher education must develop a master list of postsecondary courses that can be fulfilledby taking the AP, IB, or other recognized college level pro-ficiency exam and achieving a qualifying score or bymeeting demonstrat ed competencies. Each institution must publish on its website and in its admissions materialsits own list of courses that qualify for credit for lowerdivision general education requirements. The qualifyingexam scores and demonstrat ed competencies must be included in the list. Each institution must recogn ize at least one year of course credit that may be earned through qualifying scoreson proficiency exams or demonstrated competencies. Inso doing, the institutions mu st maximize the application of the credits toward lower di vision general education requirements. Each institution of higher ed ucation must also provide a list of such courses to the HECB and the SBCTC in aform that the OSPI is then able to distribute to school dis-tricts. The HECB must annually publish on its website theagreed-upon list of high school courses qualifying forpostsecondary credit and the exam scores and demonstrat-ed competencies meeting postsecondary requirements. This is to be referred to as the Launch Year Act.SHB 1811 189Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1811 C 239 L 11 Allowing for informed telephonic consent for access to housing or homelessness services. By House Committee on Co mmunity Development & Housing (originally sponsored by Representatives Springer, Roberts and Stanford). House Committee on Comm unity Development & Housing Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: The Homeless Housing and Assistance Act of 2005 required the Department of Commerce (Depart- ment) to develop a management information system forthe homeless population. Legislation enacted in 2006added additional specifications, including: requiring the Department to implement the Washing- ton Homeless Client Ma nagement Information System (HMIS) by December 31, 2009, and to update it at least annually; specifying that the HMIS include in formation from the Washington homeless cen sus, state agencies, and organizations providing se rvices to the homeless population; allowing data to be collected only after having obtained informed, reas onably time limited written consent from the homeless individual; requiring information to be collected in a manner consistent with federal in formed consent guidelines regarding human research; and directing that the HMIS serve as an online information and referral system. The HMIS is an electronic r ecord system that enables information-gathering about and continuous case manage- ment of homeless persons across agencies. Homeless ser- vice providers collect inform ation about thei r clients and input it into the HMIS, so that it can be matched withinformation from other providers in the state to get accu-rate counts of homeless client s and the services they need. The statewide HMIS is designed to meet United StatesDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, HealthInsurance Portability and Acco untability Act, and state requirements, as well as local provider needs. Individually identifiable client data is only accessible to individuals authorized by the Department to access thedatabase. Each client must sign a form consenting ordenying the collection of his or her personallyidentifying informa tion for the HMIS.Summary: Personally identifying information about homeless individuals collected for the HMIS, which maycurrently be obtained only with written consent, may nowalso be collected over the telephone. If collected over thetelephone, written consent must be obtained at the first time the individual is physically present at an organizationwith access to the HMIS. Safeguards to protect priv acy rights consistent with federal requirements on data collection must be in place whether the information is colle cted in person or over the telephone. The Department must adopt policies fordestroying paper documents containing personally identi-fiable information. These po licies must not conflict with any federal data requirements.

House Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: The Western Governors University (WGU) is a private, not-for-profit, online degree-granting univer- sity. The WGU offers undergraduate and graduate degreeprograms in business, teacher education, information tech- nology, and health professions, including nursing. Theuniversity was founded in 1997 by a group of 19 westerngovernors, including Governor Mike Lowry. The WGUenrolled its first student in 1999. While the WGU receives grants from state and federal agencies as well as corpora-tions and foundations, it does not rely on direct state orfederal funding for its operations. The WGU is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The WGU is nationally accredited by the Distance Education andTraining Council, the Nationa l Council for the Accredita- tion of Teacher Education, the Commission for Collegiate Nursing Education, and the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics an d Information Management Education. The WGU degrees are competency-based rather than credit-based. Each student is assigned a mentor and grad-uation specialists are available to support student success.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Orcutt, Sells, McCune, Rolfes,Angel and Hurst). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: All real and personal property in this state is subject to property tax e ach year based on its value unless a specific exemption is provided by law. The coun- ty assessor determines assessed value for each property. Property subject to property tax is assessed at its true andfair value. In most cases, this is the market value in theproperty's highest and best use. The values are set as ofJanuary 1. These values are then used for determiningproperty tax bills to be colle cted in the following year. County assessors establish new assessed values on a regular revaluation cycle. Th e length of revaluation cycles vary by county. In the 2009 assessment year, 17 counties revalued property every four years, one county every threeyears, and one county every two years. For these counties,a proportionate share of the county properties are revaluedduring each year of the cy cle while the other individual property values within the county remain unchanged dur- ing the intervening years of the revaluation cycle. Twentycounties in Washington revalu e annually based on market value statistical data.When the assessor changes th e property value, the assessor provides the property owner with a notice of thechange. These revaluation notices are mailed within 30 days of the completed appraisal. If the value of the realproperty appraised has not changed, then a revaluationnotice does not need to be sen t to the taxpayer. Generally, in counties using two-, three- , or four-year revaluation cycles revaluation notices are only sent to taxpayers in the revaluation year and not in the intervening years. County boards of equalizat ion provide the first level of appeal for property owners who dispute the assessedvalue of their properties. Th is petition must be filed with the board of equalization on or before July 1 or within 30 days of the date the value change notice was mailed, orwithin a time limit of up to 60 days if an extended period has been adopted by the coun ty. Some exceptions to the filing deadline are allowed: de ath or serious illness of the taxpayer or his or her immediate family; the taxpayer wasabsent from the address wher e the taxpayer normally receives the assessment or va lue change notice; incorrect written advice regarding fi ling requirements received from board of equalization staff, county assessor's staff, orstaff of the county property tax advisor; a natural disastersuch as flood or earthquake; or delay or loss related to the delivery of the petition by the postal service. Summary: A county board of equalization must waive the property tax valuation ap peal deadline if a request is made within a reasonable time after the normal filing deadline under the following circumstance: the taxpayer's property was in the revaluation area, the taxpayer was not sent a property value change notice, and the property valuedid not change from the previous year. This change first applies to taxes levied for collection in 2012.

By House Committee on Labor & Workforce Develop- ment (originally sponsored by Representatives Eddy,Smith, Morris, Probst, Sells, Springer, Warnick, Liias,Stanford and Maxwell). House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development House Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Background: The Washington Aerospace Training and Research Center was established in 2010 and is located on Paine Field in Everett. Offerings include customizedtraining programs, as well as certificate programs. Thiscenter is operated by Edmonds Community College pursu-ant to a contract with the Aerospace Futures Alliance. The Spokane Aerospace Technology Center is sched- uled to open in 2011 and w ill be located at the Spokane International Airport. This center will offer various train- ing programs, includin g the Spokane Community Colleges' aviation maintenance program. The Aerospace Futures Alliance of Washington (Alliance) is an aerospace association of large and smallaerospace companies. Th e Alliance is a nonprofit corporation. The Higher Education Coordinating Board provides strategic planning, coordination, monitoring, and policyanalysis for higher education. It also administers various state and federal financial aid programs. Summary: The Aerospace Training Student Loan Pro- gram (Loan Program) for eligible students at certain aerospace training or educa tional programs is established. An aerospace training or educational program (train- ing program) is a course in th e aerospace industry offered by the Washington Aerospace Training and ResearchCenter or the Spokane Aerospace Technology Center. Thetraining program must have an advisory committee that includes at least one member representing aerospaceemployers and at least one member from organized labor representing aerospace workers. An eligible student is one who is registered for a train- ing program. An eligible stude nt also must be making sat- isfactory progress as defined by the training program andhave a declared intention to work in the aerospace industry in Washington.House 74 23 Senate 36 12 (Senate amended)House 72 25 (House concurred)SHB 1854 192The Higher Education Coordinating Board (Board) is required to administer the Loan Program, which must be designed in consultation with representatives of aerospace employers, aerospace workers, and the training programs. The Board has the following powers and duties: to select and screen eligible students to receive student loans, in coordina tion with representatives of the training programs; to consider an eligible student's financial need; to issue low-interest student loans; to establish an annual loan limit equal to training costs minus other financial aid; to define repayment terms; to collect and manage repayments; to solicit and accept gr ants and donations for the program; and to adopt rules.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1854 C 271 L 11 Concerning the annexation of territory by regional fire protection service authorities. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Upthegrove, Rolfes, Finn, Hunt,Hope, Fitzgibbon, Stanford, Kenney and Ormsby). House Committee on Local Government House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & ElectionsBackground: A regional Fire Service Protection Author- ity (Authority) may be created for the purpose of conduct- ing specified fire protection f unctions at a regional level. An Authority may be created by the merger of two or moreadjacent fire protection jurisdictions, including fireprotection districts, cities, port districts, and Indian tribes. The fire protection jurisdic tions proposing to create an Authority must convene a planning committee to developand adopt a service plan (plan) for the Authority. The plan must provide for the design, financing, and developmentof fire protection and emergency services. The planningcommittee must also recomm end statutorily authorized sources of revenue and a financing plan for fundingselected fire protection and emergency services andprojects. Once adopted by the planning committee, the plan must be forwarded to the pa rticipating jurisdictions' gov- erning bodies to initiate an election process. The votersmay approve or reject a sing le ballot measure that both approves the formation of the Authority and the plan. Therequired margin for voter approval depends on the revenuesources proposed by the plan. If the plan does not autho-rize benefit charges or 60 percent voter-approved taxes,the ballot measure must be approved by a simple majority.If, however, the plan authorizes the Authority to imposebenefit charges or 60 percent voter-approved taxes, theballot measure must be approv ed by 60 percent of the voters. Except as otherwise prov ided in the plan, the following are transferred to an Authority on its creation date: all powers, duties, and functions of a participating jurisdiction pertaining to fire protection and emergency services; all written material of a participating jurisdiction pertaining to fire protection and emergency services; all real, personal, and tangible property employed by the participating jurisdiction in carrying out fireprotection and emergency services; and all funds, credits, and other assets held by the partici- pating jurisdiction in connection with police services.Except as provided otherwise in the plan, any appro- priations made to a participating jurisdiction for carrying out fire protection and emergency services are transferredand credited to the Authority. As of the date of an Authority's creation, all employ- ees of a participating jurisd iction are transferred to the Authority. A transferred empl oyee is entitled to the same rights, benefits, and privile ges he or she enjoyed while employed by the participating jurisdiction. Collective bar-gaining agreements remain effe ctive, and if any or all of the participating jurisdictions provide for civil service in their fire departments, the collective bargaining represen-tatives of the transferring employees and the participatingjurisdictions must negotiate regarding the es tablishment of a civil service system within the Authority.House 80 16Senate 47 0SHB 1858 193A \"participating fire protection jurisdiction\" is a fire protection district, city, town, Indian tribe, or port district that is represented on the governing board of an Authority.State law authorizes each of these jurisdictions, other thana tribe, to levy property taxes. However, the levies of aparticipating fire protection ju risdiction are limited so that statutorily designated amounts, less the amount of a levyimposed by the Authority, are not exceeded. Summary: A process through which an Authority may annex an adjacent fire protection jurisdiction is estab- lished. The annexation is initiated when the governing body of a fire protection jurisdiction adopts a resolutionrequesting annexation and f iles it with the governing board (board) of an adjacent Authority. Except as other-wise provided in its service plan, the board may adopt aresolution amending its plan to establish terms and condi- tions of the requested annexa tion, and submit the resolu- tion and the plan amendment to the requesting jurisdiction. An election to authorize the annexation and related plan amendment may be held if the governing body of therequesting jurisdiction adopts a resolution approving the annexation and the related plan amendment. Only voters in the fire protection jurisdic tion proposed to be annexed are eligible to vote on the single ballot measure approvingthe annexation and the plan amendment. Unlike a ballot measure pertaining to the creation of an Authority, the required margin for voter approval of aballot measure pertaining to annexation of a fire protectionjurisdiction does not depend on the revenue sources autho- rized by the plan. Regardless of whether the plan autho-rizes imposition of benefit charges or 60 percentvoter-approved property taxes, the annexation is authorized if a simple ma jority approves the ballot measure. As of the effective date that a fire protection jurisdic- tion is annexed into an Authority, its powers, duties, andfunctions, written materials, an d employees relating to fire protection and emergency services transfer from theannexed fire protection juri sdiction to the Authority. Generally, the annexation is ef fective on the date specified in the ballot measure. For purposes of calculating permissible property tax levy rates, a fire protection district, city, town, or port dis-trict that is annexed into an Authority is a \"participating fire protection jurisdiction, \" and its property tax levy Authority is therefore subject to the same limitations as a fire protection jurisdiction that is represented on the governing board of an Authority. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SHB 1858 C 240 L 11 Concerning the department of social and health services' authority with regard to semi-secure and secure crisisresidential centers and HOPE centers. By House Committee on Early Learning & Human Servic- es (originally sponsored by Representatives Roberts,Parker, Kagi, Dickerson, Good man, Lytton, Jacks, Probst, Walsh, Carlyle, Kenney and Ormsby). House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Background: The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) contracts with vendors who provide a variety of residential programs specific to older youth incrisis who need shelter and assistance. These residential options include secure and semi-secure Crisis ResidentialCenters (CRCs), HOPE centers, and Responsible LivingSkills Programs. Separate rules govern each program. Some providers operate more than one program withinone physical facility. Crisis Residential Centers have operated in Washing- ton since 1980 to serve youth who are homeless, thosewho seek shelter including runaway youth, and thosetransported by law enforcement or the DSHS. The CRCsconsist of both semi-secur e facilities and secure facilities. Secure CRCs were established in 1995. Secure CRCs aredesigned to prevent youth from leaving without parentalor staff permission for a short period of time while theyreceive support to stabilize during a period of crisis. Secure CRCs include some facilities located within or adjacent to a juvenile deten tion facility, but do not allow for in-person contact between youth in the CRC and juve- niles being held in the dete ntion facility. Some secure CRCs are community-based. In 1999 the Legislature p assed the HOPE Act, which established services for older street youth without familysupport and for whom foster placements have not beensuccessful. HOPE centers are facilities where youth canstay for up to 30 days while they are evaluated for services.The Responsible Living Skills Program provides long-term residential placement for older youth and otherservices to help youth gain independent living skills. Summary: The DSHS is required to allow co-location ofsecure and semi-secure CRCs and HOPE centers, andmust adopt rules to allow licensing of these co-locatedfacilities. The DSHS is required to permit and license co-located facilities only if th e entity operating the facility designates a particular number of beds for each type ofcenter in the building. Yout h in co-located facilities may not be placed in secure fac ilities, except as authorized in statute. The DSHS must contract for a continuum of short-term stabilization services an d collaborate with service providers in a manner that a llows facilities to be located in a geographically representa tive manner. The DSHS is authorized to contract for the operation of HOPE centerHouse 88 9Senate 47 2SHB 1861 194beds and Responsible Living Skills Programs with the goal of facilitating the coor dination of services provided for youth by such programs and those provided by CRCs. The DSHS is authorized to adopt rules regarding flexible payment structures, center specific licensing waivers, orother appropriate measures to increase utilization and pro- vide flexibility, while continuing to meet the statutorygoals of each program.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Armstrong, Clibborn, Hargrove,Liias, Billig and Schmick). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Washington owns the former Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad (PCC ), which consists of three branches. The Washington State Department of Transpor- tation (WSDOT) purchased the rights of way and rail inthe P&L Branch and PV Hooper Branch of the PCC inNovember 2004. The purchase of the CW Branch and the remaining rights in the othe r two branches was completed in May 2007. The WSDOT contracts with private rail-roads to operate each of the branches. The PCC operatesthe PV Hooper Branch, the Eastern Washington GatewayRailroad operates the CW Branch, and the Washingtonand Idaho Railway operates the P & L Branch. TheWSDOT oversees the facilities and regulatory portions of the operating leases. The PCC Rail Authority, which is anintergovernmental entity fo rmed by Grant, Lincoln, Spokane, and Whitman counties, oversees the businessand economic development po rtions of the operating leases. Real property acquired by the WSDOT as part of the state freight rail program may be sold or leased immedi-ately after purchase to a county rail district, a county, aport district, or any other public or private entity autho-rized to operate rail service.

Certain employee benefit pl ans are exempt including Keough plans, retirement accounts, and other employeebenefit plan for a participan t and his or her spouse. Collection Agency Licenses . Washington law requires collection agencies to be licensed. State law prohibits collectio n agencies from conducting certain practices in attempting to coll ect on debts. A collection agency includes any person who: directly or indirectly so licits claims for collection, or who collects or attempts to collect claims owed or due to another person; furnishes or attempts to sell a collection system; or attempts to collect his or her own claims using a ficti- tious name other than his or her own name. Collection agencies do no t include people who: solicit claims for only one employer, if the efforts are done in the name of the employer and the individual is an employee of the employer; collect under their true names related to the operation of businesses such as savings and loan associations, real estate brokers, and banks; or prepare or mail periodic statements of accounts due if all payments are made to those people.Collection agencies that operate without a license or commit acts or practices prohibited by statute may be found to violate the Consumer Protection Act (CPA).Under the CPA, a debtor may sue in an attempt to enjoin action of or recover dama ges from a collection agency. Subject to certain except ions, prohibited practices include sending notice to a debtor that represents orimplies that a claim exists unless it indicates in clear andlegible type the name and ad dress of the collection agency and the name of the original creditor to whom the debtor owed the claim, if such name is known to the collection agency or employee. If the notice is the first notice to the debtor or if the collection agency is attempti ng to collect a different amount than indicated in hi s or her first notice to the debtor, the collection agency must provide an itemizationof the claim, including the amount owing on the original obligation at the time it was received by the collection agency for collection or by assignment, subject to certain exceptions, and any charge or fee that the collection agency is attempting to collect on his or her own behalf or on the behalf of a customer or assignor. Special Proceedings . Creditors, including collection agencies, may sue a debtor in an attempt to have a court enter a legal judgment that the debtor owes a certainamount of money to the collection agency. State statutesallow collection agencies to request \"special proceedings\"as a means to help enforce debts that have been reduced tojudgment. During a special proceeding, collection agen-cies or their lawyers typicall y meet with the debtor subject to judgment in the superior or district court where the judgment was entered in order to assess the extent of the debtor's assets that could be used to repay the judgment. Acollection agency may request a special proceeding within 10 years after entry of a judgment for $25 or more, unlesstime is extended. Some courts issue a bench warrant for the debtor's arrest if the debtor fails to appear for a special proceeding as ordered. Collection agenci es also may submit affidavits to the judge swearing that ther e is a danger of the debtor HB 1867 196absconding, and the judge may order the sheriff to arrest the debtor and force him or her to appear before the judge. Once a bench warrant is issued , the judge may require that the debtor enter into a bond, also known as paying \"bail,\"guaranteeing that he or she will attend future proceedings as directed until the procee dings are terminated. Some courts require bail amounts equal to the amount of thejudgment against the debtor. If the debtor fails to appearas required, he or she forfeits the bond. Summary: Various amounts of personal property exemp- tions from collection are modi fied. The exemption for: clothes and jewelry of an individual and his or her family is raised to $3,500; private libraries including electronic media is raised to $3,500; household goods, applia nces, furniture, and home and yard equipment is increased to $6,500 for the individual or $13,000 for the community; a motor vehicle is raised to $3,250 in value.

Law enforcement and prosecutors may employ a minor to aid in an investiga tion of Communication with a Minor for Immoral Purposes , Commercial Sexual Abuse of a Minor, Promoting Commercial Sexual Abuse of aMinor, and Promoting Travel for Commercial Sexual Abuse of a Minor. The minor must be the alleged victim,and either the aid must be limited to telephone or electron-ic communication, or the inv estigator must be authorized by the one-party consent laws. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: August 1, 2011 ESHB 1886 C 360 L 11 Implementing recommendations of the Ruckelshaus Center process. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Takko, Angel, Bailey and Tharinger). House Committee on Local Government House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development Senate Committee on Ways & MeansBackground: Growth Management Act . The Growth Management Act (GMA) is th e comprehensive land use planning framework for coun ty and city governments in Washington. Enacted in 1990 and 1991, the GMA estab-lishes numerous requirements for local governments obli- gated by mandate or choice to fully plan under the GMA(planning jurisdictions) and a reduced number of directives for all other counties and cities. The Department of Commer ce provides technical and financial assistance to jurisdictions that must implementrequirements of the GMA. The GMA directs planning jurisdictions to adopt internally consistent comprehe nsive land use plans that are generalized, coordinated land use policy statements of thegoverning body. Comprehens ive plans must address spec- ified planning elements, each of which is a subset of acomprehensive plan. Comprehensive plans are imple-mented through locally adop ted development regulations, both of which are subject to recurring review and revisionrequirements prescribed in the GMA. All jurisdictions are required by the GMA to satisfy specific designation mandates for natural resource landsand critical areas. All loca l governments, for example, must designate, where approp riate, agricultural lands that are not characterized by urban growth that have long-termsignificance for the commercial production of food or oth-er agricultural products. Plan ning jurisdictions have fur- ther requirements under the GMA and must also adoptdevelopment regulations that conserve these agricultural lands and other designated natural resource lands. All local governments must also designate and protect environmentally sensitive critical areas. These protection requirements obligate local governments to adopt devel- opment regulations, also known as critical areas ordinanc-es (CAOs), meeting specified criteria. As defined bystatute, critical areas include: wetlands, aquifer rechargeareas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, fre-quently flooded areas, and ge ologically hazardous areas. With regard to the requirement to protect critical areas and to designate and conserve natural resource lands,neither of these two requirements is given priority over theother in the GMA. Washington State Conservation Commission . The 10- member Washington Stat e Conservation Commission (Commission) assists and guides Washington's 47 conser-vation districts as they wo rk with local communities to conserve renewable natural resources. Duties of theCommission include: informing district supervisors of activities and experiences in other districts; securing cooperation and assistance of federal, state, and local agencies for district operations; administering and distri buting allocated funds; and reviewing and commenting on state and local plans, programs, and activities.House 87 9Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 82 15 (House concurred)ESHB 1886 199State Environmental Policy Act . The State Environ- mental Policy Act (SEPA) establishes a review process for state and local governments to identify possible environ-mental impacts that may result from governmental deci-sions. Any governmental action may be conditioned ordenied pursuant to the SEPA if the conditions or denials are based upon policies identified by the appropriate gov-ernmental authority and incorporated into formallydesignated regulations, plans, or codes. Local governments and state agencies must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for legislation andother major actions having a pr obable significant, adverse environmental impact. The EIS includes detailed infor-mation about the environmental impact of the project, anyadverse environmental effects th at cannot be avoided if the proposal is implemented, an d alternatives to the proposed action. Specific categorical exemptions from an EIS and other requirements for actions meeting specified criteriaare specified in the SEPA. Categories of governmentactions that are not consider ed as potential major actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment arealso defined in administrative rules. Recent Legislative Action . Legislation enacted in 2007 (Substitute Senate Bill 5248, enacted as chapter 253,Laws of 2007) temporarily prohibited counties and cities from taking certain actions pertaining to CAOs. As spec-ified in SSB 5248, between May 1, 2007, and July 1, 2010,counties and cities were prohibited from amending oradopting CAOs as they specific ally applied to agricultural activities, a term defined in th e legislation. Counties and cities subject to the temporary prohibition were required toreview and, if necessary, revise their CAOs as they specif-ically applied to agricultura l activities to comply with requirements of the GMA by December 1, 2011. The 2007 legislation also charged the William D. Ruckelshaus Center (Center) with conducting a two-phased examination of the co nflicts between agricultural activities and CAOs adopted under the GMA. The exam-ination, which was directed to begin by July 1, 2007, was to be completed in two distinct phases. In the first phase,the Center was directed to conduct fact-finding and stake- holder discussions related to stakeholder concerns, desiredoutcomes, opportunities, and barriers. In the secondphase, the Center was directed to: facilitate stakeholder discussions to identify policy and financial options or opportunities to address the issues and desired outcomes identified in the first phase; and seek to achieve agreement among participating stake- holders and to develop a co alition to support changes or new approaches to protecting critical areas during the 2010 legislative session.Various reporting requirem ents were established for the Center in SSB 5248, and a final report of findings and legislative recomme ndations was to be issued by theCenter to the Governor and the appropriate committees ofthe House of Representatives and the Senate by September1, 2009. Legislation enacted in 201 0 (Substitute Senate Bill 6520, enacted as chapter 203, Laws of 2010) extended thetemporary prohibition established in SSB 5248 on adopt-ing or amending certain CAOs one additional year. The2010 legislation also granted jurisdictions subject to this extended temporary prohibitio n one additional year before being required to review and, if necessary, revise theirCAOs as they apply to agricultural activities. Finally, SSB6520 granted the Center one additional year to issue it'sfinal report. That report was delivered to the Governor and the Legislature in October of 2010. Summary: I. Establishment and Administration of Pro- gram . The V oluntary Stewardship Program (Program) is established. The Program must be designed to protect and enhance critical areas on land s used for agricultural activ- ities through voluntary actions by agricultural operators. The Washington State Conservation Commission (Commission) is charged with administering the Program. In fulfilling its administra tive duties, the Commission must complete numero us tasks, including: establishing policie s and procedures for implementing the Program; administering funding fo r counties to implement the Program; establishing a technical panel and, in conjunction with the technical panel, reviewing and evaluating work plans submitted unde r provisions of the Program; designating, based upon county nominations, priority watersheds for the Program; and providing administrative support for a Commission- appointed statewide adviso ry committee established to advise the Commission on the Program. Other administrative duties related to the Program are specified. For example, the Commission, Department of Commerce (Commerce), the Department of Ecology, andother state agencies as directed by the Governor mustcooperate and collaborate to implement the Program, and develop materials to assist lo cal watershed groups in the development of required work plans. The Commissionalso must, according to a specified schedule, determinewhich watersheds and state agencies have received ade-quate funding to implement th e Program in participating watersheds. Additionally, by August 31, 2015, and everytwo years thereafter, the Comm ission must report to the Legislature and participating counties on the participating watersheds that have received adequate funding toestablish and implement the Program. The statewide advisory co mmittee, which is charged with advising the Commission and other agencies in the development and operation th e Program, must be appoint- ed by the Commission from no minations made by county,ESHB 1886 200agricultural, and environmen tal organizations. At least two representatives from each of these organizations must serve on the committee and the Commission, in conjunc- tion with the Office of the Go vernor, and must invite par- ticipation by two representatives of tribal governments.The Director of the Commiss ion (Director) must serve as the non-voting chair. Term of office, delegate, and otherprovisions governing the statewide advisory committeeare established. II. County Option - Program is Alternative to Certain Requirements of the Gr owth Management Act . As an alternative to protecting critical areas used for agriculturalactivities through critical ar ea development regulations mandated by the Growth Management Act (GMA), thelegislative authority of a coun ty may elect to protect these critical areas through the Progr am. A county choosing this alternative has six months from the effective date of the act to: elect to have the count y participate in the Program; identify watersheds that will participate in the Program; and nominate watersheds for consideration by the Commission as state priority watersheds. Prior to adopting an ordinance or resolution to partic- ipate in the Program, the county must confer with tribes and environmental and agricultu ral interests. The county also must provide notice to property owners and otheraffected and interested in dividuals, tribes, agencies, businesses, school districts, and organizations. Subject to funding provisions, once a county elects to participate in the Program, the Program applies to all unincorporated property with in a participating watershed upon which agricultur al activities occur. Counties electing to partic ipate in the Program are eligible for state funding to implement the Program, sub-ject to the availability of stat e funding. These counties are not required to implement th e Program in a participating watershed until adequate funding is provided. III. General Requirements - Development Regula- tions that Protect Critical Areas . With limited exceptions, counties have two years following the effective date of the act to review and, if necessary, revise their developmentregulations adopted under the GMA to protect criticalareas as they specifically appl y to agricultural activities. If the county is not pa rticipating in the Pr ogram, this review and revision requirement ap plies to all unincorporated areas. If the county is par ticipating in the Program, the review and revision requirem ent applies only to water- sheds that are not participa ting in the Program. Subse- quent reviews and revisions of these developmentregulations must occur according to applicablerequirements of the GMA. IV . Program Operation - Designated Watershed Groups and Work Plans . Once the Commission makesfunds available to a county participating in the Program, the county, within 60 days, must: acknowledge receip t of the funds; and designate a watershed grou p and an entity to adminis- ter funds for each waters hed for which funding has been provided. The wate rshed group must include broad representation of wa tershed stakeholders and representatives of agricultural and environmental groups, and participating tribes. Designated watershed groups must develop a work plan to protect critical are as while maintaining the viabili- ty of agriculture in the wate rshed. The work plan must include goals and benchmarks for the protection and enhancement of critical areas. In developing and imple-menting the work plan, the watershed group must satisfyspecified requirements, including: reviewing and incorpora ting applicable water quality, watershed management, farmland protection, and species recovery data and plans; seeking input from tribes, agencies, and stakeholders; developing goals for participation by agricultural operators; creating measurable benchmarks to protect and enhance critical area functions and values; designating an entity or entities to provide Program- related technical assistance; and conducting periodic eval uations, instituting adaptive management, and providing related reports according to specified schedules. A designated watershed group must submit the work plan to the Director for appr oval. Upon receipt of a work plan, the Director must submit the work plan to a technical panel for review. The technica l panel is to be comprised of the directors or director designees of delineated state agencies. The technical panel has 45 days after the Direc- tor receives the work plan to review and assess the plan. If the technical panel determines that the proposed work plan will protect critical areas while maintaining andenhancing the viability of agriculture in the watershed, itmust recommend approval of the work plan and the Direc-tor must approve the work pl an. If the technical panel determines that the proposed work plan will not meet thecriteria for approval, it must identify its reasons for the determination and the Director must advise the watershedgroup of the reasons for the disapproval. The watershedgroup may modify and resubmit its work plan for reviewand potential approval. Provisions governing work plansthat are not approved by the Director, including require-ments for a review by the statewide advisory committee,are established. The approval of a work plan triggers additional requirements. Within five ye ars of the receipt of funding for a participating watershe d, the watershed group must report to the Director and th e county on whether it has metESHB 1886 201the work plan's protection and enhancement goals and benchmarks. If the watershed group, the Director, and the statewide advisory committee co ncur on the success of the plan, the watershed group must continue implementing the work plan. If the watershed group determines that protec- tion goals and benchmarks have not been met, it must pro-pose an adaptive management plan, to be approved ordisapproved by the Director, to achieve the unmet goalsand benchmarks. If the watershed group determines thatenhancement goals and benchmarks have not been met,the watershed group must de termine what additional vol- untary actions are needed to meet the benchm arks, identify funding necessary to implement these actions, andproceed with the associat ed implementation. Similar work plan evaluation and reporting measures are required within 10 years af ter receipt of funding for a participating watershed and every five years thereafter.Provisions for watersheds with adaptive management plans that are not approved by the Director and watershedsthat, as determined by the watershed group, do not meetprotection goals and benchmarks are established. V . Remedial Actions/Triggers . If any of the following events occur, a participating county must select andimplement remedial actions: The watershed group work plan is not approved by the Director; The goals and benchmarks for protection specified in a work plan have not been met; The Commission determ ines that the county, the Commerce, the Commission, or the departments of Agriculture, Ecology, or Fish and Wildlife havereceived insufficient funding to implement the Program in the watershed; or The Commission determines that the watershed has not received adequate fu nding to implement the Program. The remedial action options, which must be taken within 18 months of a \"tri ggering\" event, include the following, of which the county must complete one: develop, adopt, and implement a watershed work plan approved by Commerce that meets specified critical areas and agricultural requirements. The Commerce must consult with other stat e agencies before approv- ing or disapproving the plan and its decision is sub- ject to appeal before the Growth Management Hearings Board (Board); adopt qualifying development regulations previously adopted under the GMA by another jurisdiction forthe purpose of protecting critical areas in areas used for agricultural ac tivities. The \"secondary\" adoption of these regulations is subj ect to appeal before the Board; adopt development regulations certified by the Commerce as protective of critical areas in areas usedfor agricultural activities. The Commerce's certifica- tion decision is subject to appeal before the Board; or review and, if necessary, revise its development regulations to protect critical areas as they relate toagricultural activities. VI. Withdrawal from the Program . A county electing to participate in the Program may withdraw through an adopted ordinance or resolution. A withdrawal may occurfrom the Program at the end of three years, five years, oreight years from receipt of funding, or at any time after 10years from receipt of funding. A county that withdraws a participating watershed from the Program must, within 18 months, review and, if necessary, revise its development regulations that protectcritical areas in the app licable watershed as they specifically apply to agricultural activities. VII. Regulation Review and Revision Requirements of the GMA . A county that partic ipates in the Program and is achieving related benchmarks and goals is generallynot required to update deve lopment regulations that pro- tect critical areas as they spec ifically apply to agricultural activities in the participatin g watershed. Exceptions to this provision are specified. Additionally, unless thewatershed group and the Director agree that Program-related goals and benchmarks have been met, countieselecting to participate in th e Program must, beginning 10 years from receiving Program funding, review and, ifnecessary, revise development regulations to protect criti- cal areas as they specifically apply to agricultural activi-ties in a participating waters hed according to a recurring schedule established in the GMA. VIII. Miscellaneous Provisions . Miscellaneous provi- sions related to the establ ishment and implementation of the Program are specified. For example: Agricultural operators implementing an individual stewardship plan consistent with a work plan are pre- sumed to be working toward the protection of critical areas. An agricultural operator participating in the Program may withdraw from the Program and is not requiredto continue voluntary measures after expiration of anapplicable contract. Definitions pertaining to the establishment and implementation of the Program are specified. Decisions pertaining to work plans and county deci- sions whether to participate in the Program are notsubject to requirements un der the State Environmen- tal Policy Act mandatin g the completion of an environmental imp act statement.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Billig, Johnson, Fitzgibbon and Ormsby). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Rural Mobility Grant Program (Program) was established in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in 1993. TheProgram was significantly expanded in 2003, and the2009-2011 State Omnibus Transportation AppropriationsAct contained a total of $17 million divided equallybetween competitive grants, for providers of ruralmobility service in areas no t served or underserved by transit agencies, and formula grants for transit systemsserving small cities and rural areas, which must be distrib-uted in a manner similar to past disparity equalizationprograms. According to the WSDOT, the purpose of the compet- itive portion of the Program is to establish, preserve, andimprove rural public transpor tation. Funding in the Pro- gram is prioritized for services in rural counties, which aredefined as counties without an urbanized area, as definedby the 2000 census. The following types of organizationsare eligible for competitive grant funding: rural public transit agencies; nonprofit organizations; private for-profit transportation service providers; tribal governments; and other general or local governments. Summary: The Rural Mobility Grant Program Account (Account) is established, and the State Treasurer is required to transfer $2.5 million every quarter to the Account from the Multimodal Transportation Account. The earnings attributable to the funds in the Account are required to be received by that Account. The Rural Mobility Grant Program (Program) is established in statute, with the designated purpose of aid-ing small cities and rural areas. Fifty percent of the money appropriated for the Program must go to noncompetitive grants for transit systems ser ving small cities and rural areas in a manner similar to past disparity equalization programs. The other 50 percent of the money appropriatedfor the Program must go to co mpetitive grants to providers of rural mobility services in areas underserved by transit agencies. The WSDOT is requ ired to provide an annual report to the Transportation committees of the Legislature on the status of grant projects funded by the Program, andmay establish an advisory co mmittee to assist with the Program. The WSDOT is required to implement a pilot project during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium to provide enhancedtransit opportunities to agri cultural workers through the establishment of vanpool programs. The pilot projectmust, at a minimum, provide appropriate vehicles,insurance, and maintenance and may charge a fee, asdetermined by the WSDOT, to riders.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1899 C 273 L 11 Changing penalty amounts for public records violations. By House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs (originally sponsored by RepresentativesMiloscia, Overstreet, Hurst, Taylor, Hunt, Armstrong,McCoy and Condotta). House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: The Public Records Act (PRA) requires that all state and local government agencies make all public records available for public inspectio n and copying unless they fall within certain statutory exemptions. The provisions requiring public records disclosure must be interpreted liberally, and the exceptions narrowly, in order to effectuate a general policy favoring disclosure. Responding to PRA Requests . An agency must respond to requests for pub lic records promptly. Within five business days of a request, an agency must: provide the record; or acknowledge receipt of the request and provide a reasonable estimate of the time that is required to respond to the request; or deny the request. The agency may take additio nal time to clarify the in- tent of the request, to locat e the requested information, to notify third persons or agenci es affected by the request, or to determine whether the requested information is protected by an exemption. Judicial Remedies . A person who is denied a public record, or who believes an ag ency's time estimate is unrea- sonable, may appeal the agency decision in the superiorcourt of the county in which the record is maintained. In such court actions, the agency has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the agency actionwas valid. If the person prevai ls in the action, he or she must be awarded all costs of maintaining the action,including reasonable attorney f ees. In addition, it is within the court's discretion to asses s a monetary penalty against the agency and award the proceeds to the prevailing party.House 97 1 Senate 49 0ESHB 1902 203The penalty must be an amount of not less than $5, and not more than $100, for each day the person was unlawfullydenied the opportunity to in spect or copy the requested records. Summary: The lower range of the daily monetary penalty that may be assessed by a superior court against an agency for violation of the PRA is revised. The per-day penaltymay range from a minimum of $0 up to a maximum of$100 for each day the agency has unlawfully failed to provide the records, subject to the discretion of the court. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1902 C 163 L 11 Concerning a business and occupation tax deduction for amounts received with respect to child welfare services. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Kagi, Goodman and Stanford). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. This tax is imposed on the gross receipts of business activities conducted with-in the state. Nonprofit organizations pay B&O tax unlessspecifically exempted by stat ute. Exemption from federal income tax does not automa tically provide exemption from state taxes. Nonprofit health or social welfare orga-nizations are allowed a deduction under the B&O tax forpayments from governmental entities for providing healthor social services. Examples in clude: health care; mental health, family, drug, and al coholism counseling and treat- ment; services for the sick, elderly, and disabled; daycare;vocational training and employment services; legal and serv ices for low-income home- owners and renters. The B&O tax deduction by health orsocial welfare organizations is provided only for payments made directly by federal, state, or local governments. The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) contracts with multiple private providers for thepurchase of various child welfare services, including vol-untary and in-home services, out-of-home care, case man-agement, and adoption services. These services areintended to: (1) resolve pr oblems which may result in families in conflict, or neglect, abuse, exploitation, orcriminal behavior of children; (2) care for dependent,abused, or neglected children; (3) assist parents andchildren in conflict; and (4) promote the welfare ofchildren by strengthening their own homes or providing,where needed, adequate care of children away from theirhomes. In 2009 Second Substitute House Bill 2106 was enacted which, among other things, requires the DSHS to consolidate and convert its ex isting child welfare services to performance-based contacts . The DSHS has chosen a lead-agency model to address the legislative directive toreduce the number of contra cts. The DSHS has approxi- mately 1,600 separate contr acts for services. Under the lead-agency model services may be provided directly bythe lead agency or through subcontracts and agreementswith service providers. Summary: A deduction from the business and occupa- tion (B&O) tax is provided to nonprofit health or social welfare organizations for amounts received as compensa-tion for providing child welfar e services provided under a government funded program. A deduction from B&O tax is provided to taxpayers for amounts received from a government for distribution to a nonprofit health or social welfare organization for theprovision of government funded child welfare services. The deduction applies to amounts received starting August 1, 2011. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SHB 1903 C 295 L 11 Requiring background checks for all child care licensees and employees. By House Committee on Educ ation Appropriations & Oversight (originally sponsored by Representatives Orwall, Goodman, Roberts, Reykdal, Kagi, Kenney andKelley). House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Edu cation Appropriations & Oversight Senate Committee on Human Services & CorrectionsSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Early Learning (DEL) oversees and regulates child care licensing in Washington. In this capacity, the DEL conducts background checks tofind and evaluate any history of arrests, convictions, neg-ative actions, or other info rmation that raises concern about an individual's characte r, suitability, or competence to care for or have unsupervised access to children in care. Background Check Process . The DEL conducts back- ground checks in coordination with the Department ofSocial and Health Services Central Background CheckCentral Unit (BCCU), the Washington State Patrol (WSP),House 96 2Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House (House refused to concur)Senate 47 0 (Senate receded) House 95 2Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 95 2 (House concurred)2SHB 1903 204and the Federal Bureau of In vestigation (FBI). The DEL field staff begin the process by entering data into an elec- tronic system. The BCCU then submits that data to the WSP, which interfaces with the FBI. The BCCU process- es and stores the information it receives and submits theresults to the DEL. The DEL field staff review the BCCUresults and then complete a character and suitability deter- mination to conclude whether an applicant is qualified or disqualified to have unsupervised access to children incare. Background check results are released to theapplicant and to the requesting agency. Arrests and Convictions . Arrest and conviction infor- mation is collected via the WSP and the FBI. The WSPbackground check pulls inform ation regarding arrests and convictions that occur in W ashington. The FBI finger- print-based background checks provides informationregarding arrests and convic tions that occur across the United States. Fingerprint-based background checks areonly required of the DEL app licants who have not resided in Washington for three years prior to the date of applica-tion. Fingerprint-based checks are conducted at theexpense of the licensed child care provider or licensee.Licensed providers are not authorized to pass the cost onto employees or prospective employees, unless theemployee is determined to be unsuitable based on his orher criminal history. Negative Actions . Negative actions are defined as a court order, court judgment, or an adverse action taken byan agency, in any state, federal, tribal, or foreign jurisdic-tion, which results in a fi nding against the applicant reasonably related to the indi vidual's character, suitability, and competence to care for or have unsupervised access tochildren in child care. Negative actions may include: a decision issued by an administrative law judge; a final determination, de cision, or finding made by an agency following an investigation; an adverse agency acti on, including termination, revocation or denial of a licen se or certification, or if pending adverse agency action, the voluntary surren- der of a license, certification, or contract in lieu of the adverse action; a revocation, denial, or restriction placed on any professional license; or a final decision by a disciplinary board. Summary: Portable Background Registry . The DEL is required to establish and main tain an individual-based, or portable, background check clearance registry by July 1, 2012. Effective July 1, 2012, those who have not beenpreviously qualified by th e DEL to have unsupervised access to children in care must be fingerprinted and obtaina criminal history record check. Existing licensees andtheir employees who have b een qualified by the DEL to have unsupervised access to children must submit a newbackground check application, on a form prescribed the DEL, within one year follo wing the creation of the portable background check re gistry. If DEL concludes theapplicant is qualified to have unsupervised access tochildren in care, the DEL is required to issue a backgroundcheck clearance card or certificate to the applicant. Thisclearance card, or certificate, is valid for three years andmust be accepted by potential employers as proof that the applicant has successfully completed a background check.A copy of the background check clearance card orcertificate must be kept on-site. Fees . New applicants, licensed child care providers, or a combination of both ma y pay for the cost associated with a background check, which includes: (1) a fee estab- lished by the WSP for the criminal history check (includ-ing fingerprints); and (2) a fee established by the DEL tocreate and maintain the background check clearance regis-try. Effective July 1, 2011, licensed child care providers are required to pay the DEL a one-time fee established bythe DEL. The DEL is requir ed to consider the cost of developing and administerin g the registry when setting fees, and shall not set fees es timated to generate revenue beyond estimated costs. Account . Fee revenues must be deposited in the new- ly created Individual-Based/Portable Background CheckClearance Account (Account) and may only be expendedfor the costs of developing and administering the registry.The Account is created in the custody of the State Treasur-er. Only the DEL Director or designee may authorizeexpenditures from the Account. The Account is subject toallotment procedures, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. Redetermining Character, Suitability, Competence . The DEL must investigate and redetermine an applicant orlicensee's background clearance if the DEL receives acomplaint or information fro m individuals, law enforce- ment, or other government agencies. Background checkclearance card or certificate holders are required to reportnon-conviction and convictio n information to the DEL within 24 hours of the even t. Child care agencies are required to report to the DEL any knowledge of thefollowing information regard ing any individual working in a child care agency: criminal charges or convictions; charges that might be reasonably related to the indi- vidual's suitability to provide care for or have unsupervised access to children or care; and negative actions. If that individual lacks the appropriate character, suit- ability, or competence to prov ide child care or early learn- ing services, the DEL is authorized to invalidate the background card or certificate or suspend, modify, orrevoke any license. Background Check Coordination . The DEL, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Educa-tional Service Districts are re quired to develop and report a proposal to coordinate their common background check2SHB 1909 205activities. These agencies sh all submit their proposal to the Legislature no later than December 15, 2011. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SHB 1909 C 274 L 11 Promoting innovation at community and technology colleges. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Reykdal, Haler, Seaquist,Carlyle, Hasegawa and Kenney). House Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Strategic Technology Plan . In 2006 and 2007 the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) analyzed te chnology application and practices at community and technical colleges. Thepurpose was to learn how technology could be used toadvance student learning, improve student services, andcreate greater administrative efficiencies. In all threeareas, the SBCTC found a need for greater uniformityacross the 34 colleges in the system and the P-20 educationsystem. In 2008 the SBCTC adopted the Strategic Technology Plan (Technology Plan). Th e SBCTC defines the Technol- ogy Plan as a roadmap for how the community and techni-cal college system can levera ge 21st century technologies to support student achievement. Certificates of Participation . Institutions of higher education may finance the acquisition, construction, andrenovation of facilities using st ate bonds. Bond proceeds for these projects are appropriated in the omnibus capitalappropriations act (capital budget). In addition to financ-ing through state bonds, higher education institutions areauthorized to enter into financ ing contracts, such as Certif- icates of Participation (COPs) , which are a type of security sold for a particular purpos e and backed by any compo- nent of fees and revenues the university derives from itsownership and operation of its facilities. The COPs mustbe authorized in the capital budget and, once authorized, the institution is allowed to begin the construction or purchase process. The COPs are not subject to appropriation by the Legislature, do not obligate State General Fund revenuesto be used for their comple tion, and do not count toward the state debt limit. Summary: Up to 3 percent of operating fees at commu-nity and technical colleges ar e transferred to the Commu- nity and Technical College Innovation Account (Account)to be used to implement th e SBCTC's Technology Plan. The SBCTC approves the amount to be transferred eachyear. The SBCTC must approve projects under theTechnology Plan to improve student achievement, studentservices, and increase system-wide administrative effi-ciencies. The SBCTC is required to develop a technicaland operational business plan and bring large enterprise resource planning projects to the Legislature for approval. The community and technical colleges are required to engage in substantial busin ess process reengineering and adopt system wide approaches to admission, financial aid, student identification number s, student transcripts, and other system wide processes. In addition, when pursuingan enterprise resource planning solution, the communityand technical colleges must consider: opportunities for coordination and consolidation with other higher educa-tion institutions; adopting technology solutions that arealready used at other higher education institutions; the short and long term costs of those solutions; and technical flexibility to support co st efficiencies. The Account is created in the custody of the State Treasurer. Expenditures from the Account must beapproved by the Director of the SBCTC or his or herdesignee. Expenditures from th e Account may be used for two purposes: (1) paying off debt from financingcontracts, such as certificates of participation authorizedby law; or (2) for projects that implement the TechnologyPlan as approved by the SBCT C. The Account may retain its interest earnings. The requirement for community and technical colleg- es to round tuition and fees to the nearest dollar amount is removed.

This includes assist- ing businesses with workforce training and infrastructure needs, identifying and locating suitable business sites, andresolving problems with government licensing and regulatory requirements. Associate development organizations (ADOs) are lo- cal organizations designated by each county to serve as theDepartment's primary partner in local economic develop- ment activities in their county . The ADO's role is broad and is defined by statute and the needs of each community. Broadly, an ADO provides advocacy and leadership,building relationships with its partners in state and local governments, community groups, and local businesses.Specifically, ADOs are an integral part of the state's eco-nomic development plan that provides direct technicalassistance and funding for ec onomic activities in every county. An ADO's econom ic development activities can be organized into the following categories: recruitment of new bu sinesses into Washington; retention and expansion of existing businesses; business start-up assistance; community asset building; and regional planning and collaboration. The Department maintains a contracted partnership with 34 ADOs, serving 39 coun ties. As part of the con- tract, the ADOs are required to submit annual performance reports to the Department. Summary: The Department is required to establish pro- tocols to be followed by th e ADOs and Department staff for the recruitment and retention of businesses, including protocols relating to the sh aring of information between the ADOs and the Department. The protocols establishedmay not require the release of proprietary information orthe disclosure of informatio n that a client company has requested remain confidentia l. The Department must require compliance with the protocols in its contracts withADOs. The Department is required to provide ADOs with business services training th at includes the fundamentals of export assistance and the services available from pri-vate and public export assistance providers in the state.The ADOs must provide or facilitate the provision of export assistance to busi nesses through workshops or one-on-one support. Additional specificity dir ecting the ADOs to provide business-related assistance and work with partnersthroughout the county in which they deliver these services is added. The ADOs serving counties with a population greater than 1.5 million (King County ) must include the following additional information in performance reports: the number of small businesses that received reten- tion and expansion services, and the outcome of those services; and the number of businesses located outside the bound- aries of the largest city in its region that received recruitment, retention, and expansion services, and the outcome of those services. \"Small business\" is defined as an in-state business, including a sole proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity that is owned and oper ated indepen- dently from all other businesses and has either: (1) 50 orfewer employees; or (2) a gross revenue of less than $7million annually as reported on its federal income tax return or its return filed wi th the Department of Revenue over the previous three consecutive years.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Shea, Taylor and McCune). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington State Patrol (WSP) oper- ates the Washington weigh stations and has Port of Entry stations at Kennewick, Spokane, Ridgefield, and BowHill. These weigh stations use weigh-in-motion scales and transponder readers to electronically screen trucks as thetruck approaches the weigh station. If the checks aresatisfactory, the truck is cleared to bypass the weighstation, but if unsatisfactory, th e truck is required to stop at the weigh station. The WSP also operates interior scalesthat are staffed on a random or as necessary schedule. The Director of the Department of Agriculture (Director) may establish points of inspection for vehiclestransporting animals on the public roads of this state todetermine if the animals be ing transported are accompa- nied by valid health certificates, permits, or other docu-ments. Vehicles transporting animals on the public roadsof this state are subject to inspection and must stop at anyposted inspection point estab lished by the Director, with emphasis on livestock being brought in from outside the state. The Director or appointed officers are authorized tostop a vehicle transporting an imals upon the public roads of this state at a place other than an inspection point ifthere is reasonable cause to believe the animals are beingtransported in violation of state laws. Summary: Commercial vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 40,000 pounds or more and transportingcattle are required to stop at a Port of Entry. ThisHouse 98 0 Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)SHB 1923 207requirement does not apply to the operator of a vehicle in possession of a pasture permit or cattle consigned to apublic auction or sales yard. It is clarified that motorvehicles must follow the existi ng rules and regulations that apply to weigh stations or a Port of Entry when open. The requirements and penaltie s apply only in counties located east of the Cascade m ountains with a population of at least 450,000 and an adja cent county with a population of at least 13,000 but less than 15,000. Based on the crite- ria, the requirements and pe nalties would presently apply to Spokane and Pend Oreille counties. A penalty of $1,000 is established for failure to comply, and all of the fines collected must be depositedinto the Motor Vehicle Fund. The funds must be used for road maintenance purposes. The WSP must provide a one-time written notification of these requirements to affected carriers known to havepreviously entered the State of Washington in the countiesidentified. The notification requirement is not a defense for a driver from enforcement action if found in violation. The notification must be provided prior to August 1, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SHB 1923 C 294 L 11 Requiring the denial of a concealed pistol license applica- tion when the applicant is ineligible to possess a firearmunder federal law. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Goodman, Reykdal, Hunt, Pedersen, Roberts and Hunter). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Judiciary Background: State and Federal Firearms Prohibitions . Both state and federal law prohibit certain categories of persons from possessing firearms. Although there is sub-stantial overlap in the categories of prohibited persons,there are a number of differences, with the result that fed-eral law generally restricts a broader range of persons thanstate law. Examples of persons who are prohibited frompossessing firearms under federal law, but not state law,include a person who: is subject to a qualified domestic violence order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate part ner or child of an intimate partner; was dishonorably discharged from the armed forces; has renounce d citizenship; and is an unlawful user of controlled substances. Federal law also prohibits a nonimmigrant alien from possessing firearms unless the person meets one of several exceptions. Exceptions includ e nonimmigrants who: pos- sess a valid state-issued hunting license; enter the United States for a competitive target shooting event or sports orhunting trade show; are certain diplomats or foreign offi-cials, if the firearms are for official duties; or havereceived a waiver from th e U.S. Attorney General. Concealed Pistol Licenses . In Washington it is gener- ally unlawful for a person to carry a concealed pistolunless the person has a valid concealed pistol license. Inorder to obtain a concealed pistol license, a person mustapply with the local law enforcement agency and undergoa fingerprint-based backgrou nd check to determine eligi- bility. A person who applies fo r a concealed pistol license must be eligible to possess a firearm under state law andmeet other requirements. The local law enforcementagency must issue the concealed pistol license if the per-son meets these requirements, ev en if the person is prohib- ited under federal law from po ssessing a firearm. As a result, concealed pistol licenses must contain a warning in-dicating that federal and state laws on the possession offirearms differ and the state license is not a defense to fed-eral prosecution for possession of a firearm in violation offederal law. Prior to issuing the license, the law enforcement agen- cy must conduct a background check through the NationalCrime Information Center, the Washington State Patrolelectronic database, the Department of Social and HealthServices database, and other agencies or resources asappropriate. Law enforcement agencies are not requiredto conduct a check through the National Instant CriminalBackground Check System (NICS) although in practicemany law enforcement agencies do conduct a NICS check. Summary: A law enforcement agency must deny an application for a concealed pist ol license if the applicant is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law.Law enforcement agencies must conduct a NICS back-ground check of the applicant to determine the applicant's eligibility for a concealed pistol license. An applicant for a concealed pistol license who is not a United States citizen must provide the following addi-tional information on the application: country of citizen- ship; United States issued alien number or admission number; and claimed basis for being exempt from federalrestrictions on firearms possession by aliens.

By House Committee on Tr ansportation (originally sponsored by Representative Finn).House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: A registered owner may apply for a horse- less carriage license plate for a motor vehicle that is at least 40 years old. The origin al registration fee is $35, and the plates are valid for the life of the motor vehicle, are not required to be renewed, may not be transferred to any oth-er motor vehicle, and must be displayed on the rear of the motor vehicle. There are approximately 9,000 horselesscarriage vehicles registered. A registered owner may apply for a collector vehicle plate for a motor vehicle that is at least 30 years old. Theowner may receive a collector pl ate that is assigned by the Department of Licensing (DOL) or the owner can providean actual Washington state-issued license plate designatedfor general use in the year of the vehicle's manufacture.The original registration is $35, and the plates are valid for the life of the vehicle, are not required to be renewed, maybe transferred from one vehicle to another vehicle if theplate was provided by the owner, and must be displayed onthe rear of the motor vehicle. There are approximately111,000 collector vehicles registered. These vehicles may only be used for participation in club activities, exhibitions, to urs, parades, and occasional driving. Law enforcement officers, when stopping a motor vehicle, in many cases will run a \"wants and warrants\" on the registered vehicle's license plate to receive informationon the registered owner and vehicle. Summary: Any person who knowingly provides a false or facsimile collector license plate for a collector vehicle is subject to a traffic infractio n. The person must also pay for the cost of a vehicle license plate. The DOL must provide a method by which law enforcement officers may readily access vehicle informa-tion for collector vehicles by using the collector vehiclelicense plate number.

By Representatives Ryu, Kenney, Moscoso, Ladenburg and Roberts. House Committee on Co mmunity Development & Housing Senate Committee on Econom ic Development, Trade & Innovation Background: Local Improvement Districts . Cities and towns are granted broad authority to create a local improvement district (LID) fo r the purpose of construct- ing, reconstructing, or repairing a wide range of publiclyowned structures, facilities, and infrastructure, including: specified types of public buildings; community facilities for recreation, entertainment, and cultural activities; bridges and trestles; dikes and embankments; parks and playgrounds; street lighting systems; infrastructure for public transportation systems; and water and sewer system infrastructure. A LID may be created by an ordinance passed by the city or town council in accord ance with specified statutory procedures. The passage of the ordinance must be in response to either a petition or resolution proposing the creation of the district, with the petition or resolutionsubject to a public hearing. Under certain circumstancesthe proceedings necessary to establish a LID must beinitiated by the petition of the affected property owners. The costs of creating a LID are financed, in whole or in part, through special assessments on property that isspecially benefited by the improvement. Innovation Partnership Zones . In 2007 legislation was enacted directing the Department of Community, Tradeand Economic Development (now the Department ofCommerce) to design and im plement an Innovation Part- nership Zone (IPZ) Program through which the statewould encourage and support research institutions, work- force training organizations, and globally competitivecompanies to work cooperatively in close geographicproximity to create commerci ally viable products and jobs. Using specified criteria, the Department of Commerce with the advice of the Economic Development Commis-sion designates the IPZs for a period of four years. An IPZmay renew its designation through a reapplication process,and may lose its designation for failure to meet perfor- mance standards. The IPZs are eligible for funds asprovided by the Legislature or at the discretion of theGovernor. There are 12 IPZs in Washington.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 HB 1953 C 354 L 11 Concerning county and city real estate excise taxes. By Representatives Springer, Asay, Takko, Upthegrove, Haler, Fitzgibbon, Ange l, Smith and Sullivan. House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Background: County legislative authorities may impose an excise tax on each sale of real property in unincorporat-ed areas of the county. Simila rly, city and town legislative authorities may impose an excise tax on each sale of realproperty within their corporate limits. The rate of this realestate excise tax (REET) I ma y not exceed 0.25 percent of the selling price. Revenues generated from REET I mustbe used for financing qualifying capital projects and forhousing relocation assistance. Revenue from REET I may not supplant other funds reas onably available for these capital projects. In 2010 134 cities and 20 countiesimposed REET I. Counties, cities, and towns that are required to fully plan under the Growth Management Act (GMA) mayimpose an additiona l REET on each sale of real property. The tax rate may not exceed 0.25 percent of the sellingprice (REET II). Counties, cities, and towns that haveopted, but are not required, to fully plan under the GMA may impose REET II with vo ter approval. With some exceptions, revenues genera ted from REET II may only be used for financing capital proj ects specified in the capital facilities element of a compre hensive plan adopted under the GMA. Furthermore, revenue from REET II may notsupplant other funds reasonably available for these capital projects. In 2010 132 cities and 19 counties imposedREET II. Capital projects that may be funded by REET I and REET II revenues include streets, roads, highways, side-walks, street and road ligh ting systems, traffic signals, bridges, domestic water systems, storm and sanitary sewersystems, and parks. Additio nal eligible uses of REET I funds include recreational facilities, law enforcement facilities, fire protection facilities, trails, libraries, judicialfacilities, and flood control projects. Summary: Each year through cale ndar year 2016, a city, town, and county may use the greater of $100,000 or 35 percent of real estate excise tax (REET) I revenues, but notexceeding $1 million, to pa y for the maintenance and operation expenditures of existing capital facilities. Each year through calendar year 2016, a city, town, and county may use the greater of $100,000 or 35 percentof REET II revenues, but not ex ceeding $1 million, to pay for the maintenance and opera tion expenditures of existing capital facilities. Additionally, counties may use REET IIrevenues for the payment of existing debt service on anycapital project authorized under REET I. The use of reve-nues for payment of existing de bt service is subject to the same fiscal limitations as REET revenues used formaintenance and operation expenditures.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Ka gi, Jinkins, Frockt and Kenney). House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Family Policy Council . The Family Policy Council (FPC) was established to modify public policy and programs to empower co mmunities to support and respond to the needs of in dividual families and children, and to improve the responsive ness of services for children and families at risk by facilitating greater coordination andflexibility in the use of funds by state and local serviceagencies. Duties of the FPC . The FPC is required to: establish boundaries for community networks; develop technical assistance and training programs to assist communities in de veloping networks; approve the structure, purpose, goals, plan, and performance measures of each network; identify prevention and early intervention programs and funds which could be transferred to a community network and report findings to the Governor and Legislature; reward exceptionally successful community networks; seek opportunities to maximize federal and other funding that is consistent with the plans approved by the FPC; and monitor the implementation of programs contracted by participating state agencies. Community Networks. The FPC partners with approx- imately 42 community public health and safety networks. Networks are required to: review state and local public health data related to risk factors, protective factors, and at-risk children and youth; prioritize risk factors and protective factors to reduce the likelihood of children an d youth becoming at-risk; develop long-term comprehensive plans to reduce the rate of at-risk children and youth; comply with the Department of Health and local boards of health to provide data and determineoutcomes; and coordinate their efforts with anti-drug use efforts and organizations.Council for Children and Families . The Council for Children and Families (CCF) was established to increase educational programs and ser vices to prevent child abuseand neglect in partnership between communities, citizens, and the state. The CCF is authorized to contract with public or private nonprofit organizations , agencies, schools, or with qualified individuals for the establishment of a range of community-based programs and services designed toreduce child abuse and neglect. The CCF is also charged with: facilitating the exchange of information between groups concerned with families and children; consulting with the applicable agencies, commis- sions, and boards to help determine the probable effectiveness, fiscal soundness, and need for proposed educational and service programs for the prevention of child abuse and neglect; establishing fee schedules to provide for the recipi- ents of services to reimburse the State General Fundfor the cost of services received; and accepting and dispersing funds from the Children's Trust Fund.Adverse Childhood Experiences . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted a long-term, large-scale study to examine the relationshipbetween adverse childhood experiences and critical out-comes later in life. The stud y findings have indicated that particular experiences early in life are major risk factorsfor the leading causes of illness, death, and poor quality oflife. The CDC defines an adverse childhood experience as any of the following conditions in a household of a child under age 18: recurrent physical abuse; recurrent emotional abuse; sexual abuse; an alcohol and/or drug abuser in the household; an incarcerated household member; someone who is chronica lly depressed, mentally ill, institutionalized, or suicidal; mother is treated violently; one or no parents; and emotional or physical neglect. In 2010 the first Washingt on data regarding adverse childhood experiences became available through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).According to the Department of Health, the BRFSS is thelargest, continuously conduc ted, telephone health survey in the world. It enables the CDC, state health departments, and other health agencies to monitor modifiable risk fac- tors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. According to the 2010 FPC report, Adverse Childhood Experiences and Population He alth in Washington: the Face of a Chronic Public Health Disaster, adverse child-hood experiences have been common in Washington. Thedata have indicated a need for \"integrated approaches toprevent adverse childhood ex periences, and intervene211early on [in the lives of] ch ildren... better identification and treatment of the effects of adverse childhood experi- ences among persons and systems interacting withchildren....\" The FPC concluded that \"...development ofmore integrated approaches will likely contribute to improved treatment of affected persons, and better integra- tion of research priorities, preventive social and educa- tional services and legal venues.\" Reinvesting in Youth Program . In 2006 House Bill 1483 (HB 1483) was enacted, requiring the Juvenile Reha-bilitation Administration (JRA) to establish a Reinvesting in Youth Program that awards grants to counties for imple-menting research-based early intervention services thattarget juvenile justice-invo lved youth and reduce crime. Under the bill, the Washington State Institute for PublicPolicy and the JRA were requ ired to develop the guide- lines for the implementation of the program. The JRA was also required to form a tech nical advisory group to assist in the implementation of the program. Summary: Family Policy Council and Council for Chil- dren and Families . The FPC and the CCF are eliminated effective June 30, 2012. Community networks are preserved. Adverse Childhood Experiences . A definition for \"Adverse Childhood Experience\" is provided in statute. Private-Public Initiative . The Secretary of the Depart- ment of Social and Health Services (Secretary) and the Director of the Department of Early Learning (Director) must actively participate in the development of a nongov-ernmental private-public initiative (Initiative) which focuses on coordinating inve stments, positive develop- ment of children, and preven ting and mitigating the effects of adverse childhood experiences. The Secretary andDirector must convene and co-chair a planning group, with 12 to 15 members, to work with private partners to develop a strategy for reaching the goals of identifying,preventing, and mitigating the harm of adverse childhoodexperiences, and recommenda tions to advance the Initia- tive. The planning group must represent a diversity ofinterests, including early learning coalitions, community public health and safety netw orks, organizations that work to prevent and address child ab use and neglect, tribes, pub- lic agencies involved in inte rvention or prevention of ad- verse childhood experiences, philanthropic organizations,and organizations focused on community mobilization. The planning group must submit a report on its prog- ress and recommendations to the appropriate legislativecommittees no later th an December 15, 2011. The Initiative must advise the Secretary regarding the approval of blended funding projects recommended by thecommunity networks. Authority of the Department of Social and Health Ser- vices . The Secretary is authoriz ed to enter into contracts on behalf of the Department of Social and Health Services(DSHS), provide funding to the Initiative, and accept gifts,grants, or other funds to prevent or reduce adversechildhood experiences. Duties Transferred to the Department of Early Learn- ing. Beginning July 1, 2011, the CCF and the Department of Early Learning (DEL) must develop a plan for transi-tioning to the DEL the work of the CCF, including publicawareness campaigns. The CCF and the DEL must partic-ipate in the development of the Initiative to streamline efforts around the prevention of child abuse and neglectand avoid duplication of efforts. The Executive Director of the CCF and the Director of the DEL must consult with the planning group convenedunder this act to develop st rategies to maximize Washing- ton's leverage and match of federal child abuse and neglectprevention moneys. No later than January 1, 2012, theCCF and the DEL must report to the Legislature regardingits transition plan. The duty to fund eviden ce-based and research-based home visitation programs is transferred from the CCF to the DEL.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Fitzgibbon, Armstrong, Liias,Nealey, Clibborn, Billig, Frockt and Reykdal). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Each April, transit agencies in Washington are required to submit six-year transit development plans for that year and the ensuing five years, as well as system reports identifying public transportation services providedin the previous year and objectives for improvements.Similar reports are due to the Federal TransitAdministration in September of each year. Based on information that is submitted in the system reports, the Washington State Department of Transporta-tion (WSDOT) must prepare an annual report that summa- rizes individual public transp ortation systems. This report is due September 1 of each year to the transportationcommittees of the Legislature and each state municipality. During 2010 the Joint Transportation Committee was directed to conduct a study to identify the state role in public transportation and to develop a statewide blueprintto guide public transportatio n investments. The ensuing report, titled Indentifying the State Role in Public Transportation , made a number of recommendations relating to the state's role, that include: integrating public transportation into regional and statewide planning; developing and promoting policies to encourage the use of all public transportation modes; assessing the adequacy of funding sources and devel- oping new funding strategies to address statewide concerns; aligning report and da ta collection to provide a comprehensive and useful picture of transit; and establishing a consistent set of measures to assess public transportation systems. Summary: The due dates for both the six-year transit development plans and the sy stem reports are changed from April 1 to September 1. The due date for the annual summary report on the status of public transportation systems prepared by the WSDOT is changed from September 1 to December 1.The WSDOT is also required, if such information is avail- able, to include information about other modes of public transportation, how those mode s impact the transportation system, and how public transportation helps the state meetthe transportation system policy goals.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1967 May 16, 2011 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 3, Engrossed Substitute Ho use Bill 1967 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to modifying provisions related to public transportation system planning.\" Section 3 of the bill would require new state facilities located within a public transportation syst em to be sited in areas ade- quately accessible by transit service. Access to public transporta- tion is a priority when siting stat e buildings. However, it is not always feasible or ne cessary for each state building to be served by public transportation, depending on the nature of the agency orinstitution and who it serves. Ther efore, I am vetoing Section 3 of this bill. However, I have aske d the Department of General Admin- istration to consult with transit agencies to assess the access to public transportation when siting state buildings. For these reasons I have veto ed Section 3 of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1967. With the exception of Section 3, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1967 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor EHB 1969 C 275 L 11 Concerning the exemption of flood control zone districts that are coextensive with a county from certain limitations upon regular property tax levies. By Representatives Hasegawa and Springer.House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Flood Control Districts . Flood control zone districts may be establ ished in a county for the purpose of operating or main taining flood or storm water control. A flood control zone district is an independent taxing authority and may receive funding from a variety ofsources, including: property tax receipts; rates, charges,and assessments; and debt proceeds. A flood control zonedistrict may impose annual, nonvoter-approved regularproperty tax levies of up to $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value. Property Tax Levy . The state Constitution limits regular property tax levies to a maximum of 1 percent ofthe property's value ($10 per $1,000 of assessed value).V oters within a taxing district may vote to tax themselveshigher than this 1 percent limit with an excess levy. State statutes establish individual district rate maxi- mums and aggregate rate maxi mums to keep the total tax rate for regular property ta xes within the constitutional limit. For example, the state le vy rate is limited to $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value, county general levies arelimited to $1.80 per $1,000 of assessed value, county roadlevies are limited to $2.25 per $1,000 of assessed value,and city levies are limited to $3.375 per $1,000 of assessedvalue. These districts are known as \"senior\" districts.Junior districts such as fire, library, hospital, and floodcontrol districts each have specific rate limits as well. Thetax rates for most of these senior and junior districts mustfit within an overall rate limit of $5.90 per $1,000 of assessed value. State statutes contain schedules specifying the preferential order in which the various junior taxingdistrict levies will be prorated in the event that the $5.90 limit is exceeded. Under th is prorating system, senior districts are given preference over junior districts Property Tax \"Gap\" . A few regular property tax levies are not placed into the $5.90 aggregate rate limit: emer-gency medical service, conservation futures, affordablehousing, metropolitan park districts, county ferry districts,criminal justice, fire district s, and county transit. How- ever, these districts are subject to reduction if the rates forthese districts, the state proper ty tax, and the districts sub- ject to the $5.90 limit togeth er exceed the constitutional limit of $10 per $1,000 of market value. These districtsare in what has been called the \"gap,\" the $0.50 centsremaining after subtracting th e $3.60 state levy and the $5.90 in local regu lar levies from the statutory $10 limit. As noted earlier, flood control zone districts are catego-rized as \"junior districts\" and, therefore, are subject to thestatutory provisions that include districts within the $5.90aggregate rate limit. Howeve r, in the statutory schedule determining the order of proration, flood control districtsare in the second tier of junior districts to get prorated. Inthe latest tax year, the King County Flood Control Zone District was subject to prorationing. Summary: For taxes levied for collection in 2012 through 2017, a flood control district in a county with apopulation of 775,000 or more with boundaries coexten-sive with a county may place up to 25 cents of the district's50 cent levy outside the $5.9 0 limit to avoid prorationing. The levy for such flood contro l districts is still within the constitutional $10 limit. Sh ould the $10 limit be exceed- ed, a flood control district will be the first levy to beHouse 64 34Senate 44 5 (Senate amended)House 70 27 (House concurred) ESHB 1981 214prorated. Flood control zone districts with a population of less than 775,000 are moved from the second tier to thethird tier of prorationing under the $5.90 limit. The act expires January 1, 2018. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESHB 1981 C 47 L 11 E1 Addressing public employee postretirement employment and higher education employ ees' annuities and retirement income plans. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Representatives Bailey and Carlyle). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The various plans of the Washington State Retirement System each contai n rules prescribing the cir- cumstances under which a retired employee may return to employment within a retirem ent system-covered position and continue to receive retirement benefits. Between 2001and 2007, the rules for the Pu blic Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and Teachers' Retirement System (TRS)Plan 1 underwent a series of changes, including the addi- tion of rules that permitted PERS and TRS Plan 1 mem- bers to work for up to 1,500 hours per year for three years (or certain part-time equivalents) without suspension ofretirement benefits. For the Plans 2 and 3 of PERS andTRS, as well as for the School Employees' Retirement System (SERS) and the Public Safety Employees' Retire- ment System (PSERS), upon returning to employment into a retirement system-cover ed position, a retiree gener- ally is able to receive retirem ent benefits for the first 867 hours of employment each year. Separation From Service . A member must separate from service in order to qua lify for a retirement allowance. Separation from service is defined in the PERS and TRSto mean that the member has no oral or written agreement to resume work with his or her employer after entering retirement. After entering retirement status, a membermay begin his or her retirement allowance on the first dayof the month following the mont h that he or she applies for retirement benefits. The date that retirement benefitsbegins is referred to as a member's \"accrual date.\" Length of Separation From Service . Members of the PERS, TRS, SERS, or PSERS who re-enter employment with an eligible employer w ithin one month of retiring are subject to a benefit reduction. The reduction is equal to 5.5 percent of the monthly benefit for every eight hoursworked that month and is applied until such time as theretiree remains absent from eligible employment for atleast one full calendar month. Retirees from the PERS, TRS, SERS, or PSERS who have been separated from service for one calendar monthafter their accrual date may work up to 867 hours percalendar year without a re duction in pension benefits. Retirees from TRS Plan 1 who have been separated for oneand one-half month, or retirees from PERS Plan 1 whohave been separated from service for three calendar months, and whose hiring meets specific approval andrecord-keeping requirements, may work up to 1,500 hoursper calendar year without a reduction in pension benefits.Once the 1,500-hour limit is exceeded, pension benefitsare suspended until the beginning of the next calendaryear. The number of years a PERS Plan 1 or TRS Plan 1 retiree may work for 1,500 hours without a reduction inbenefits is limited. Each re tiree from these two plans may only work for a lifetime cu mulative limit of 1,900 hours beyond 867 hours per calendar year. False Claims . Both PERS and TRS have provided sanctions for filing false stat ements to the Department of Retirement Systems (DRS) since 1947. A person(employer or employee) who files a false record or falsestatement to the DRS in any attempt to defraud the retire-ment systems for a claim related to separation from serviceor qualification for retirement is guilty of a grossmisdemeanor. Higher Education Retirement Plan . State institutions of higher education are authorized to offer the HigherEducation Retirement Plan (HERP) to faculty and otheremployees whose positions ar e designated as eligible by their respective boards. The HERPs are administered byeach institution, unlike the ot her state retirement systems that are administered by the DRS. The HERPs providedefined contributions, typically 5 percent of pay from eachof the employer and employee until age 35, 7.5 percent of pay from each until age 50, and the employer matching up to 10 percent of pay from age 50 until retirement. The HERP also has a guaranteed defined benefit, called the HERP Supplement al Benefit, which pays a monthly supplemental allowanc e to insure that the HERP member receives a total benef it worth about 50 percent of the average of a member's highest two consecutive yearsof salary. The value of the member's defined contribu-tions, calculated as if they had been invested in a model portfolio, are subtracted from any HERP SupplementalBenefit obligation. The HERP Supplemental Benefitcosts are paid out of institution operating budgets, and arelargely not pre-funded. Current and projected HERPSupplemental Benefit obligations have grown in recentyears. Positions covered by the HERP are not considered to be Washington State Retirement System-covered forpurposes of the post-retirement employment rules in thePERS, SERS, or PSERS.House 75 22Senate 42 5 (Senate amended)House 71 27 (House concurred)EHB 2003 215Summary: State institutions of higher education may offer the Higher Education Retirement Plan (HERP), instead of the Public Em ployees' Retirement System (PERS) Plans 2 or 3, only to employees exempt from civil service. The HERP Supplemental Be nefit is eliminated for employees that enter the plan after July 1, 2011, and employees offered participatio n in HERP on or after July 1, 2011, have the option of joining the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) Plan 3 or Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) Plan 3. State funding for the HERPs is limited to 6 percent of salary. The PERS and TRS Plan 1 provisions permitting retirees to receive benefits while employed in retirement system-covered positions for up to 1,500 hours per year are eliminated beginning January 1, 2011. (Retirees inPERS and TERS Plans 1 may continue to work up to 867hours per year without a reduction in pension benefits.)Positions covered by the HERP are added to those includ-ed in the post-retirement empl oyment pension restrictions TRS, School RetirementSystem (SERS), and PSERS. A reference to the defunc t Public Pension Commis- sion is replaced with the Select Committee on Pension Policy among the legislative committees responsible for periodically reviewing the HERPs and adjustingcontribution rates. Higher education institutions responsible for payment of HERP Supplemental Benefits are required to contract with and provide data to the Office of the State Actuary foractuarial valuations every two years beginning June 30,2013, and experience studies of the HERPs at least once in every six-year period, with th e first being due by June 30, 2013. A 0.25 percent of pay employer contribution rate isinitiated for HERP-covered em ployees beginning January 1, 2012, to a new supplemental benefit fund. The contri-bution rate increases to 0.5 percent of pay beginning July1, 2013. This fund is invested by the State InvestmentBoard. Upon completion of the first actuarial valuation bythe State Actuary (no later than June 30, 2013), the Pension Funding Council (PFC), may make changes to the0.5 percent contribution rate. The PFC is authorized torecommend legislation, upon accumulation of sufficientfunding in the Supplemental Benefit Fund, to transfer responsibility for benefit pa yments to the new fund and adjust contribution rates to reflect the transfer ofresponsibility.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 January 1, 2012 (Sections 10 and 19)EHB 2003 C 33 L 11 E1 Concerning premium payments for children's health coverage for certain families who are not eligible for federal children's health insurance coverage. By Representatives Pettigrew, Hunter, Ryu and Kenney. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) operates the Apple Health for Kids program, which provides medical coverage for childrenunder age 19 in families with incomes at or below 300 per-cent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Apple Health forKids includes three programs for financing this coverage.The joint state-federal Medi caid program provides cover- age for children with family incomes at or below 133 per- cent of the FPL. The joint state-federal Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) prov ides coverage for children with family incomes above 133 percent and at or below300 percent of the FPL. The state-funded Children'sHealth Program (CHP) provid es coverage for children with family incomes at or below 300 percent of the FPLwho are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP due to theircitizenship status. Children with family inco mes greater than 200 per- cent of the FPL are required to pay premiums for healthcare coverage. The premiums are based on family income and may not exceed the premium limitations in the federalSocial Security Act. Summary: Children in families with incomes greater than 200 percent of the FPL who are not eligible for the federally-funded CHIP are required to pay premiums at a level set every two years that is no greater than the averagestate-only per capita cost of coverage in the state-fundedCHP.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Representative Hunter). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Licensing (DOL) per- forms several functions, incl uding providing information to law enforcement, licens ing and regulating drivers, registering vehicles and vessels, licensing and regulating 30 different professions, and issuing business licensesthrough the Master Licen se Service (MLS). The Department of Revenue (DOR) is the state's primary taxcollection agency. The DOR oversees approximately 60different taxes. The MLS program was established in the mid-1970s to serve as a one-stop licensing service for businesses. A\"master license\" refers to the single document designed for public display issued by a li censing center and certified by the DOL. The master license application may be used to: open or reopen a business; change ownership of a business; open a new business location; change business locations; register or change a trade name; hire employees; obtain a Minor Work Permit; add licenses to an ex isting business location; obtain optional insurance coverage for the business owner; hire people to work in or around your home; or apply for a Washington State Unified Business Identifier number or tax registration number. The DOL administers the MLS program and issues over 100 state licenses. In addition, the MLS program may be used to apply for over 200 state endorsements and over 70 city licenses. The DOL collects a $15 handling fee for each new master license issued and a $9 license renewal fee. Allreceipts must be deposited into the appropriated MasterLicense Account (Account). Expenditures from theAccount may be used only to administer the MLSprogram. The MLS provisions do not apply to certain regulated business and professional activities, including those regu-lated under the Consumer Loan Act, credit unions, banks and trust companies, mutual savings banks, savings andloan associations, and those regulated under the insurance statutes. Summary: The Master License Service (MLS) program is transferred from the Department of Licensing (DOL) to the Department of Revenue (DOR). All powers, duties,and functions of the DOL pert aining to the administrationof the MLS program are transferred and references instatute to the DOL are replaced with the DOR. All funds,credits, or other assets held in connection with the MLSprogram are assigned to the DOR. Any appropriationsmade to the DOL for carryin g out the MLS program are transferred and credited to the DOR. All employees of the DOL primarily engaged in the MLS program are transferred to the jurisdiction of the DOR. All employees classified under the state civil ser-vice law are assigned to the DOR to perform their usual duties upon the same terms as formerly, without any lossof rights, subject to any actio n in accordance with the laws and rules governing state civil service. All classifiedemployees of the DOL assigned to the DOR whose posi-tions are within an existing bargaining unit description atthe DOR become a part of th e existing bargaining unit at the DOR and are considered an appropriate inclusion ormodification of the ex isting bargaining unit. All rules and all pending bu siness before the DOL per- taining to the MLS program must be continued and acted upon by the DOR. All exis ting contracts and obligations remain in full force and must be performed by the DOR. To ensure a seamless transfer of the MLS program and to prevent any disruption of service, the DOR is authorizedto contract with the DOL for support. Any contract entered into must be for a duration no longer than neces-sary to fully and effectivel y transfer the MLS program from the DOL to the DOR. The DOR must set the amount of the MLS handling fees by rule. The MLS handling fees may not exceed $19for each master application and $11 for each renewalapplication filing. The ru le-making process for setting master application and trade name registration fees is thesame as the process for any rule setting fees pursuant tolegislative standards. The DOR is authorized to increase handling and renewal fees fo r the purposes of making improvements in the MLS program. Improvements areidentified as including technology and customer service,expanded access, and infrastructure. Definitions for purposes of the Business License Center Act are modified to include references to localgo vernment and \"participatin g local government.\" The DOR is authorized to issue and renew licenses and regis-trations for local government s participating in the MLS program. A single set of rules govern ing the confidentiality and disclosure of licensing in formation, similar to the standards applied by the DOR for excise tax information,is provided along with the conditions in which the DOR is not prohibited from disclosing such information. Amisdemeanor offense is established for the disclosure ofcertain confidential licensing information. If the violatoris a current state employee or officer, future employmentwith the state is prohibited for two years.HB 2019 217The criterion for which the DOR may not issue or renew a master license to a person is expanded. Expenses incurred by the DOL in carrying out licens- ing and regulatory activities associated with for-hire vehi- cles and limousines are suppo rted through the Highway Safety Account. In addition, commercial te lephone solic- itation, whitewater river outf itters, and body art, body piercing, and tattooing are ad ded to the list of programs covered by the Business and Professions Account. The DOR and the Secretary of State may enter into agreements designating the DOR as the Secretary ofState's agent for issuing legal entity renewals. The DOR is provided the authority to issue a warrant, the amount of which may be come a lien up on the title to real and personal property, and compute interest for anyunpaid registration assessments and delinquency feesrelated to manufactured or mobile home communities.This acts to replace the DOL' s authority to send delinquent accounts to a collection agency and to sue landlordsdeemed noncompliant. Any person feeling aggrieved by actions taken against him or her by the DOR is allowed the opportunity torequest a review of the DOR's action held as a briefadjudicative proceeding. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 HB 2019 C 334 L 11 Concerning the deposit of the additional cigarette tax. By Representative Dunshee. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The cigarette tax is added directly to the price of cigarettes before the sales tax is applied. The cigarette tax is due from th e first person who sells, uses, consumes, handles, possesses, or distributes the cigarettesin the state. The cigarette tax rate is $3.025 per pack of20 cigarettes. The taxpayer pays the cigarette tax bypurchasing cigarette tax stamps that are placed oncigarette packs. Since July 1, 2009, all cigarette taxes have been deposited in the State General Fund, except for the $0.60per pack tax that is deposited in the Education LegacyTrust Account. Summary: Beginning July 1, 2010, the $0.60 per pack cigarette tax that is deposited in the Education Legacy Trust Account is deposited in the State General Fund. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: May 12, 2011 ESHB 2020 C 49 L 11 E1 Funding capital projects. By House Committee on Capital Budget (originally sponsored by Representative Dunshee). House Committee on Capital Budget Background: The programs and agencies of state govern- ment are funded on a two-year basis, with each biennium beginning on July 1 of each odd-numbered year. The stateomnibus capital appropria tions act (capital budget) includes appropriations for the acquisition, construction,and repair of capital assets such as state office buildings,prisons, juvenile rehabilitatio n centers, residential habili- tation centers, mental health facilities, military readiness centers, and higher education facilities. The capitalbudget also funds a variety of environmental and naturalresource projects, parks and recreational facilities, publicK-12 school construction, and grant and loan programsthat support housing, public infrastructure, communityservice facilities, and art and historical projects. Thesources of funding for the ca pital budget primarily are state general obligation bonds, trust revenues, anddedicated fees and taxes. Washington periodically issues general obligation bonds to finance projects authorized in the capital andtransportation budgets. General obligation bonds pledgethe full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state towardspayment of debt service. Legislation authorizing the issu-ance of bonds requires a 60 percent majority vote in boththe House of Representatives and the Senate. Bond autho- rization legislation generally specifies the account or accounts into which bond sale proceeds are deposited, aswell as the source of debt service payments. When debtservice payments are due, the State Treasurer withdrawsthe amounts necessary to make the payments from theState General Fund and deposits them into bond retirement funds. The State Finance Committee, composed of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the StateTreasurer, is responsible fo r supervising and controlling the issuance of all state bonds. Summary: The 2011-13 Capital Budget appropriates $1.1 billion in new state general obligation bonds to support projects in the 2011-13 biennium. State bondreappropriations of $1.1 billio n are authorized for projects approved in prior biennia. The 2011 Supplemental CapitalBudget reduces state bond a ppropriations by $33 million. The State Finance Committee is authorized to issue state general obligation bond s to finance $1.1 billion inHouse 87 5Senate 38 10House 67 29Senate 2021 218projects in the 2011 Supplemental and 2011-13 Capital Budgets. The State Treasurer is required to withdraw fromstate general revenues the amounts necessary to make theprincipal and interest pa yments on the bonds and to deposit these amounts into the Bond Retirement Account.A June 30, 2013, expiration date is added to several bondauthorizations that remain unissued.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 15, 2011 SHB 2021 C 362 L 11 Limiting the annual incre ase amounts in the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Pettigrew, Darneille, Seaquist,Carlyle, Hunter and Cody; by request of GovernorGregoire). House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The basic retirement allowance of a mem- ber of Plan 1 of the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS Plan 1) or the Teachers' Retirement System (TRSPlan 1) is equal to 2 percent of the member's average finalcompensation, calculated on the members' highest consec-utive two years of compensatio n, for each year of service. Retirement benefits are available to members after 30years of service at any age, w ith 25 years of service at age 55, and with 5 years of service at age 60. Retirees' benefits may be eligible for an annual increase from a benefit generally referred to as the\"Uniform\" cost of living adjustment (COLA), or \"UniformCOLA.\" The Uniform COLA was created in 1995, and isan automatic, annual, service-based COLA paid everyJuly 1. The Uniform COLA is payable on the first calen-dar year in which the recipient turns age 66 and has beenretired for one year. The Uniform COLA is a fixed dollar amount multi- plied by the member's total ye ars of service. The dollar amount of the Uniform COLA is currently $1.88 andincreases by 3 percent every year on July 1. The statute specifies that members do not have a contractual right tofuture increases to the Uniform COLA. For a memberwith 30 years of service, the Uniform COLA would havemost recently increased the member's benefit by $56.40per month. There are two minimum benefits in place for members of PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1. The basic minimumbenefit is a fixed dollar am ount per month multiplied by the member's total years of service. The basic minimumbenefit is currently $42.63 and increases on July 1 everyyear by the dollar amount of the Uniform COLA. Amember with 25 years of servic e is therefore eligible for a minimum benefit of $1,065.75 per month, and, with 30years of service, the minimum benefit is $1,278.90 permonth. The other minimum benefit provides a benefit of $1,000 per month and was established in 2004 formembers of PERS 1 and TRS 1 who have either at least 25years of service credit and have been retired for at least 20years, or at least 20 years of service credit and have been retired for at least 20 years. The $1,000 minimum monthlybenefit, which is also subject to reductions if the memberselects the enhanced cost-of-l iving adjustment or survivor benefit options, is increased annually by 3 percent peryear. Summary: Public Employees' and Teachers' Retirement Systems Plan 1 (PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1) members benefits are no longer increased through the UniformCOLA above the amount in effect on July 1, 2010, unlessa retiree qualifies for the basic minimum benefit. Mem-bers of PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 that qualify for the minimum benefit formulas in the plans will continue to receive the Uniform COLA. The minimum contribution rates for PERS Plan 1 un- funded liability is reduced from 5.25 to 3.5 percent, and for TRS Plan 1 unfunded liability from 8.0 to 5.75 percent. The alternative minimum benefit, commonly referred to as the \"$1,000 minimum be nefit,\" is increased to $1,500 and after the increase continues to be indexed by 3 percentper year. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: June 30, 2011 ESHB 2065 C 34 L 11 E1 Regarding the alloca tion of funding for students enrolled in alternative learning experiences. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Representative Hunt). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Alternative learning experience (ALE) programs are public school alternative options that are pri- marily characterized by learning activities that occur awayfrom the regular public school classroom. The require-ments and expectations of ALE activities are detailed in awritten student learning plan developed and supervised by a public school teacher. The regulatory requirements for ALE programs are in the Washington administrative rules. The ALE studentsHouse 84 10Senate 46 1 House 52 45Senate 28 17ESHB 2065 219are funded on the basis of hours towards a student learning plan, which is in contrast to the \"seat time\" requirementsfor basic education funding in non-ALE programs, where school districts claim basi c funding only for enrolled students who are expected to physically attend school eachday for a specified number of hours. The ALE programs are different than home-based instruction. An ALE is a pu blic school learning experi- ence which is planned and supe rvised by a public school teacher. Home-based educatio n is planned and supervised under the authority of the parent, not the school district.Home-based students may en roll part-time in public school classes and programs, including ALE. Alternative learning expe rience program enrollment has increased significantly over time. Although ALE enrollment was incons istently reported in the early years of the program, survey data and research reports suggestthat total enrollment has incr eased over 450 percent since 1995. Survey reports es timate 1995 ALE enrollment at about 5,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students, as com-pared to February 2011 enrollment of approximately28,826 FTEs. Alternative learning experience student FTEs are funded at the same general apportionment rate as non- ALE students. Total funding for ALE programs isestimated at approximately $150 million per school year. Alternative learning experien ce students generally fall into three major categories of ALE program offerings:digital and online programs, parent partnerships, andcontract-based learning programs. Digital or Online Learning Programs . Digital, online learning programs are defined and authorized in statute.Students often enroll as non-resident students in geograph-ically removed school districts that offer virtual programs.Many schools offer online learning courses, but claimenrollment for only the hours the student is in an on-siteclassroom. Online learning only becomes an ALE whenthe student is engaged in learning away from school, andthe school district is using the time the student engages in this away-from-school learning as part of the FTE claimed for basic education apportionment. There are about 7,923student FTEs in these programs as of February 2011. Parent Partnership Programs . Parent partnership pro- grams offer a significant role for parents in the develop-ment and provision of public education. These programsare not specifically defined or authorized in statute. Manystudents in parent partnership programs may have beenreceiving home-based instruction prior to enrolling in the ALE program. However, parent partnerships are nothome-based instructio n because the school district is ulti- mately responsible for student learning, not the parent.Although there are a variety of different program modelsin the parent partnership category, with districts requiringvarying degrees of in-person contact time in a classroomsetting, all programs operate outside the standard seat- time requirements for fundin g required in the non-ALEsetting. There are about 12,187 student FTEs in theseprograms as of February 2011. Contract-based Learning Programs . Contract-based learning is usually limited to secondary students, and is often used for credit retrieval or credit acceleration. Con-tract-based ALE programs are not specifically defined orauthorized in statute. Many alternative middle and highschools offer some form of co ntract-based learning, as do a smaller number of comprehensive high schools; how-ever, not all alternative hi gh schools are ALE programs. Many contract-based programs offer flexibly-structuredprograms for students not succeeding in a general educa-tion high school format. Th ere are about 8,716 student FTEs in these programs as of February 2011. A number of studies of ALE programs in Washington have been done. The earliest known report on ALE wasconducted by the Office of Superintendent of PublicInstruction (OSPI) in 1999. It provides a review of ALE programs prior to mainstream use of the Internet as a tool for distance learning, and al so during a time when ALE programs were just becomi ng available in grades K-8. Additionally, the Joint Legislative Audit and ReviewCommittee did an extensive review of all ALE programsin 2005, including analysis of the use of parent stipends.The OSPI performed a study in December of 2009,analyzing just the digital and online aspects of ALE. Summary: The Legislature finds that there is ample evi- dence of the need to reexamine and reconsider the method by which the state funds ALE programs, and the state doesnot have a legal obligation to provide basic instructionusing any particular delivery method or program. A definition of ALE progra ms is established which includes the following components: The ALE program is provided in whole or in part outside the classroom setting. The ALE program is supe rvised by a certified teacher of the district or under contract. The ALE program is provided according to a written learning plan under district policy and the OSPI rules. Additionally, the ALE definition includes online programs defined under current law, programs with significant participation and pa rtnership with parents, and contract-based learning programs. The use of parent stipends in ALE programs is prohib- ited, but districts may purchase materials in a studentlearning plan as long as they remain the property of the district. Instructional experiences and services madeavailable to ALE students in the student learning planmust be \"substantially similar\" to what is available to allstudents in the district. Beginning in the 2012-13 school year, state funding for students in ALE online pr ograms is limited to those offered by an online provider approved by the OSPI underthe process in statute. Defi theEHB 2069 220operating definitions used by the OSPI in approving online providers. The definition of online courses ischanged to specify that more th an half of the instruction in these courses is provided remotely, via the Internet orother computer-based method. School districts mustaward credit for online high sch ool courses that meet the district's graduation requirements and are affected by anapproved online provider. Funding is reduced by an aggregate amount of 15 per- cent for ALE programs for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. The OSPI is tasked with determining the methodology for achieving the savings, so long as noparticular ALE program receives less than a 10 percentreduction or more than a 20 percent reduction in funding. School districts are exempt from minimum staffing requirements for certificated instructional staff for thatportion of the student popul ation participating in ALE programs.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 September 1, 2011 (Sections 9 and 10) EHB 2069 C 35 L 11 E1 Concerning hospital payments. By Representative Cody.House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medical assistance is available to eligible low-income state residents and their families from the Department of Social and Health Services, primarily through the Medicaid program. Pursuant to Engrossed Seco nd Substitute House Bill 2956 (hospital safety net assessment), hospital providerassessments are imposed on mo st hospitals and proceeds from the assessments are deposited into the HospitalSafety Net Assessment Fund (Fund). Money in the Fundmay be used for various increases in hospital payments.Inpatient and outpatient paym ent rates were restored to levels in place on June 30, 20 09. Beyond that restoration, hospitals reimbursed unde r the prospective payment system (PPS) received a 13 percent increase in rates fornon-psychiatric inpatient services and a 36.83 percentincrease in rates for outpatient services. The sum of $49.3 million per biennium may be expended from the Fund in lieu of State General Fund payments to hospitals. Summary: Starting July 1, 2011, the inpatient and outpa- tient rate increases for medical assistance services provided by PPS hospitals are reduced. The inpatient rateincrease is reduced from 13 pe rcent to 3.96 percent, and the outpatient rate increase is reduced from 36.83 percent to 27.25 percent. The sum of $199.8 million may be expended from the Fund in lieu of State General Fund payments to hospitalsin the 2011-13 fiscal biennium.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 HB 2070 C 5 L 11 E1 Determining average salary for the pension purposes of state and local government employees as certified by their employer. By Representative Seaquist. House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: In the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS), the School Employees' Retirement System (SERS), thePublic Safety Employees' Retirement System (PSERS), the Washington State Patrol Retirement System (WSPRS), and the Law Enforcement Of ficers' and Fire Fighters Retirement System (LEOFF) Plans 1 and/or 2, benefits arecalculated by multiplying a member's years of eligible service by 2 percent of the member's final average com- pensation. For members of th e PERS Plan 1, for example, final average compensation is the average level of annual pay received from plan-eligible employment over thehighest consecutive two-year period. For members of thePERS Plan 2, final average compensation is calculated ina similar fashion but over the highest paid consecutive five years of plan-eligible employ ment rather than two years. Most of the Plans 1 and 2 use similar methods of calculat-ing average final compensatio n, although the terminology differs slightly by retirement system. The PERS, TRS, and SERS Plans 3 are a \"hybrid\" plan design in which employer contributions are made tosupport a defined benefit, and employee contributions aremade into individual defined contribution accounts. APlan 3 member's defined benefit is based upon the numberof qualified years of service the member has workedmultiplied by 1 percent of th e average final compensation. A member's final average co mpensation in the Plan 3 is computed using the same form ula used for members of the Plan 2, using a five-year average final compensation. A retirement system member whose salary is reduced during the two- or five-year period prior to retirement dueto a reduced schedule, leave without pay, or other reasonswill receive a smaller retire ment allowance due to theHouse 63 32Senate 34 11 (Senate amended)House 71 25 (House concurred)House 52 44Senate 26 20ESHB 2082 221lower final average compensation. A member may purchase up to two years of service credit for time spent onleave without pay; however, there are no provisions topurchase an increase of a me mber's final average compen- sation in the event that the member works a reduced schedule. During the 2009-11 fiscal biennium, Chapter 430, Laws of 2009 (Senate Bill 61 57) was enacted. Under this legislation, the average final compensation of a PERSmember who is a state empl oyee includes any compensa- tion that is forgone by the member during the 2009-11fiscal biennium as a result of reduced work hours, volun- tary leave without pay, or temporary furloughs, providedthat the reduced compensation is part of the employer'sefforts to reduce expenditures. As part of the enactment ofChapter 32, Laws of 2010, first special session (EngrossedSecond Senate Bill 6503), the 2009 law was extended to members of the LEOFF, TRS, PSERS, and WSPRSemployed by the state. Summary: Pensions from specified Washington retire- ment systems based on salaries earned during the 2011-13 biennium will not be reduce d by compensation forgone by a member employed by either the state or local govern-ments due to reduced work hours, mandatory leave with-out pay, temporary layoffs, or reductions to current pay ifthe measures are an integral part of a state or localgovernment employer's expenditure reduction efforts.

By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Kenney and Moscoso). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Disability Lifeline Program . Prior to 2010, an individual with a low income could be eligible for the General Assistance-Unemployable Program if he or shemet income criteria and was: (1) pregnant and not eligible for Temporary Assistance fo r Needy Families (TANF); or (2) incapacitated from gain ful employment because of physical or mental infirmity li kely to continue for at least 90 days in duration. A pers on with an infirmity primarily due to a drug or alcohol addi ction was not eligible for the General Assistance-Unemployable Program. In 2010 Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill (E2SHB 2782) was enacted. Under that act, the General Assistance Program was renamed the Disability Lifeline(DL) program. The eligib ility requirements and condi- tions that were in place for the General AssistanceProgram remained the same. A time limit of 24 months in a 5-year period was established for DL benefits. This timelimit was retroactive, and applied to persons alreadyreceiving benefits. Since th e passage of E2SHB 2782, the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) hasbeen restrained by court or der from implementing the time limit provisions and the cash assistance grant has beenreduced. The maximum monthly grant amount for aclient, as of April 2011, is $197. An individual is noteligible to receive DL benefits if he or she refuses without good cause to participate in needed treatment or other program services. Good cause includes an emotional orphysical disability that prevents participation or theunavailability of treatment. The DL-UnemployableProgram makes up the largest category of DL recipients. Under E2SHB 2782, the DSHS was required to adopt medical criteria for DL in capacity determinations to ensure that the eligibility de cisions were consistent with statutory requirements and based on clear, objectivemedical information. The st andard for incapacity is not intended to be as stringent as the federal SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI) disab ility standards. Clear and convincing reasons are required for any eligibility decision which rejects uncontroverted medical opinion. Medical Care Services . Medical Care Services are a limited scope of medical care offered to DL benefits recip-ients and recipients of drug and alcohol addiction services. Disability Lifeline Expedited . Persons eligible for DL and who have been determined to be likely eligible for federal SSI benefits are elig ible for the DL Expedited Program. Under E2SHB 2782, the DSHS was required toimplement the Early SSI Transition Project, beginning inthree counties: King, Pierce, and Spokane. In the transi- tion project, potentially eligib le persons are systematically screened and evaluated for SSI benefits and provided casemanagement services to support the transition to SSI and Medicaid benefits. Housing V oucher Program . The Department of Commerce (COM) and the DSHS are required to jointlydevelop a Housing V oucher (HV) Program. The COMadministers the HV Program an d must identify the current supply of private and public housing, including acquisi- tion and rental of existing ho using stock. The COM must also develop funding strategies and design the HVHouse 90 4Senate 40 4ESHB 2082 222Program to maximize the ability of the DSHS to recover federal funding. Under E2SHB 2782, homeless applicants assessed as needing chemical dependency or mental health treatment,or both, are required to agree as a condition of eligibility to accept a HV in place of a cash grant if a voucher is avail-able. The dollar value of th e HV is established by the DSHS and may differ from the value of the cash grant.Persons receiving a HV will also receive a $50 cash stipend per month. Persons who refuse to accept a HV , butare otherwise eligible for DL benefits, remain eligible for medical care services benefits. Referral to the Division of V ocational Rehabilitation . The Economic Services Admini stration must work jointly with the Division of V ocational Rehabilitation (DVR) todevelop an assessment tool to determine whether the programs offered by the DVR could assist persons receiv-ing DL benefits in returning to the work force. The assess- ment tool was to be comple ted and in use no later than January 1, 2011. By December 10, 2011, the DSHS mustreport on the use of the tool and the success of DVRprograms in returning pe rsons to the work force. Referral to the Department of Veterans Affairs . During the application process for DL benefits, the DSHSmust inquire as to whether the applicant has ever served in the United States Military. For any applicant who has served, the DSHS must confer with a veteran's benefitspecialist with the Washington Department of VeteransAffairs to determine whether th e applicant is eligible for any benefits or programs offered by either the state orfederal government. Access to Chemical Dependency Treatment . If the DSHS or an entity that has contracted with the DSHS to provide medical care services to DL program clients deter-mines that chemical dependency treatment is necessary toimprove a client's health stat us for transition to employ- ment or transition to federa l disability benefits, the DSHS or the contracting entity must give the client high priority to enroll in chemical depend ency treatment within funds appropriated for chemical dependency treatment. Thefirst priority goes to pregnant women and parents. Study of Terminations from DL Benefits . By Decem- ber 1, 2012, the Washington State Institute for PublicPolicy (WSIPP) is to analyze and report on the experienceof persons terminated from DL benefits. Summary: The Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program and the Pregnant Women Assistance Program . All components of the DL pr ogram are terminated effec- tive October 31, 2011, and statutory references deleted.The Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Programs areestablished effective November 1, 2011. The DSHS is toprovide financial assistance under the Aged, Blind, orDisabled Assistance Program to persons who meet eligi-bility requirements provided in the act. Clients must meetincome, resource, and incapacity standards, which include having a medical or mental hea lth impairment that is likelyto meet federal SSI disability standards. A person is ineligible for the Aged, B lind, or Disabled Assistance Program if there has been a final determination that he orshe is not eligible for federal SSI. Effective November 1, 2011, the Pregnant Women Assistance Program is established for persons who meetTANF income and resource stan dards but are ineligible for the TANF program for reasons other than failure to coop-erate. Persons eligible for these programs are eligible to receive assistance in the form of a cash grant. Essential Needs and Housing Support Program . Effective November 1, 2011 , the Essential Needs and Housing Support Program (ENHS) is created. Individualswho are eligible for medical care services, and who are notrecipients of alcohol and addiction services or the Aged,Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program, must be referredto the ENHS. No cash grant is awarded under the ENHS. The DSHS must review the cases of individuals who are not recipients of alcohol and addiction treatmentservices or recipients of the Aged, Blind, or DisabledAssistance Program and have received medical care ser-vices for 12 months, and annua lly thereafter, to determine whether they are likely to be eligible for the Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program. Grants to Local Govern ments and Community-Based Organizations for the ENHS . Distribution of Funds. The COM is required to distribu te funds for the ENHS. The first distribution of funds must be completed by Septem-ber 1, 2011. Funding is to be provided to the designated essential needs support and ho using support entities. The amount of the distribution is designated in the biennial state omnibus operating appropriations act. The COMmust approve the expenditure plans submitted by thedesignated entities. During the 2011-2013 biennium, the funding for housing support is to be used for clients who are homeless. A contingency fund is established for clients who are atsubstantial risk of losing stab le housing. After July 2013, the designated housing support entity must give first prior- ity to serving clients who ar e homeless and second priority clients who would be at substantial risk of losing stablehousing. The appropriations by the Legislature for the ENHS are to be based on the forecasted program caseloads, andthe Caseload Forecast Council must provide a courtesyforecast for the medical care services recipients who arehomeless. The COM may adjust funding betweencounties to reflect caseload changes. The designated entities must begin to provide essen- tial needs and housing support on November 1, 2011. Theessential needs and housing support entities must partner with other public and private organizations to maximizethe beneficial impact of funds distributed and shouldattempt to leverage other sources of public and privatefunds to serve clients. The COM must not use more thanESHB 2088 2235 percent of the funding for administrative expenses. Essential needs and housing su pport entities must not use more than 7 percent of th e funding for administrative expenses. The COM, in collaboration with the DSHS, must develop a mechanism to al low the COM and essential needs and housing support en tities to verify a person's eligibility for services. Th e COM must require Housing Support entities to enter data into the Homeless Client Management Information System and, in collaborationwith the DSHS, report annually to the Legislature. The first report regardin g recipients served and referred is due December 31, 2011, and must describe theactions taken to achieve th e objectives of the act and efforts made to partner with other entities to leveragepublic and private funds. The COM must review data submitted by the essential needs and housing support entities and make recommen- dations for program improvements and administrativeefficiencies. The COM may change designated entities ifperformance or other aspects of the ENHS do not meet therequirements of the COM. Civil Liability . The COM, counties, and essential needs and housing support entiti es are not civilly or crim- inally liable and may not be subject to any cause of actionregarding decisions related to the type of housing arrange- ments supported with funds under this act as a result ofgood faith actions. Rights to enforce statutory orcontractual duties and obligations remain. Medical Care Services . Persons are eligible for med- ical care services if they are incapacitated from gainfulemployment for a minimum of 90 days. To be eligible, aperson must have countable income at or below $339.Additionally, persons who qualif y for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled Assistance Program or the Alcohol and DrugAddiction Services are eligible for the Medical CareServices Program. Chemical Dependency . The provision related to DL terminations due to time limits is removed from the statuethat specifies priority populations for drug and alcoholtreatment. Disability Lifeline Housing V oucher Program . The statute authorizing the DL HV Program is repealed. Study of Terminations from DL Benefits . The statute directing a WSIPP study regarding persons terminatedfrom the DL program is repealed. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 15, 2011 July 22, 2011 (Section 6) November 1, 2011 (Section 8)ESHB 2088 C 13 L 11 E1 Creating the opportunity scholarship board to assistmiddle-income students and invest in high employerdemand programs. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally sored by Goodman, Lytton, Stan ford, Dahlquist, Ladenburg, Wylie and Rivers). House Committee on Ways & Means Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: There are various kinds of student financial aid; some is privately suppor ted, some is federally sup- ported, and some is supporte d by the state, such as the State Need Grant (SNG). The SNG program helps the state's lowest-income undergra duate students pursue edu- cation. Students may use the grants at eligible institutions,including public two- and fo ur-year colleges and universi- ties and many accredited independent colleges, universi-ties, and career schools in Washington. Grants areawarded to individuals with family income up to 70 percent of the median family income. Past legislation has create d public-private partnership scholarship programs. As an example, the GET Ready forMath and Science Program w as enacted in 2007. The Higher Education Coordinating Board contracted with aprogram administrator, and the administrator solicitedfunds from private contributors . The state then matched those contributions, and the administrator awardedconditional math and science focused scholarships. Summary: The Opportunity Scholarship and Opportuni- ty Expansion programs are created to mitigate the impact of tuition increases, increase the number of baccalaureate degrees in high employer demand and other programs, andinvest in programs and students to meet labor market demands. The scholarships are funded by a combinationof private and state moneys. The expansion awards arefunded with voluntary contributions of high technologyresearch and development tax credits. Opportunity Scholarship Board . These two programs are overseen by the Opport unity Scholarship Board (Board), made up of seven persons appointed by theGovernor. With respect to tw o of these appointments, the Governor is to consider nam es from a list provided by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate.Four of the persons appointed by the Governor are to beselected from a list of nominees provided by the privatesector donors to the Op portunity Scholarship and Opportunity Expansion programs. Upon request, theGovernor may request that the donors submit an additionallist or lists. House 53 36Senate 43 2 (Senate amended)House 56 40 (House concurred)ESHB 2088 224The Board will identify eligible education and training programs for purposes of the opportunity scholarship, select institutions of higher education to receive opportu- nity expansion awards, and make recommendations with respect to funding sources for opportunity expansion awards. The Board's oversight and guidance of theprograms must be consistent with legislative priorities. Together, with the program administrator, the Board mustset annual fund raising goals and solicit funds. Program Administrator . The Higher Education Coor- dinating Board (HECB), or its successor, contracts with aprogram administrator, defined as a college scholarshiporganization that is a private nonprofit entity with exper-tise in managing scholarships and college advising. The program administrator sets up and manages the scholar- ship and endowment account s, staffs the Board and administers the Opportunity Scholarship Program. Theprogram administrator is pa id an administrative fee as determined by the Board. Opportunity Scholarships . Scholarship recipients must: (1) be accepted into a high employer demandprogram, deemed an eligible education program by the Board; (2) declare an intentio n to obtain a baccalaureate degree (whether starting at two- or four-year school); (3)have a family income at or below 125 percent of themedian family income; and (4 ) have received their high school diploma or General Educational Development(GED) in Washington. Gene rally, the annual amount of a scholarship is $1,000 or the dollar difference betweentuition fees charged in the 2 008-09 academic year and the academic year for which a scholarship is being distributed,but the amount may be an amount necessary to cover alleligible expenses, as dete rmined by the administrator. Opportunity scholarships ar e issued from one of two accounts set up and managed by the program administra-tor, either the Scholarshi p Account or the Endowment Account. These scholarships are funded by a combinationof private contributions and state match moneys. At least 50 percent of all private contributions must be deposited into the Scholarship Account until total receipts in that account reach $20 million, after which the Boarddetermines the distribution between scholarship andEndowment Accounts, carefully balancing the need for a long-term funding mechanis m and short-term needs of students and families. State match, which must be appro- priated by the Legislature, is earned for private contribu- tions made after the effective date of the act and must bepaid beginning the later of January 1, 2014, or the firstyear in which state revenues are 10 percent higher thanthose received in fiscal year 2008. These state matchpayments are capped at $50 million annually. Scholarships may be issued from principal and earn- ings in the Scholarship Ac count, and disbursement from this account must commence in December 2011 as long as at least $5 million in state ma tch has been received in the Scholarship Account. By contrast, the principal in the Endowment Account may not be invaded. Add itionally, scholarships may be issued from the Endowment A ccount only after: state match has been paid to both the Scholarship Account and the Endowment Account; state appropriations to the SNG meet or exceed such appropriations made in 2011-13; andeligibility for the SNG is maintained at a minimum of 70percent of the median family income. Additionally, prog- ress must have been made toward reaching global chal-lenge state funding goals, meaning that the state mustdemonstrate progress toward th e goal of total per-student funding levels, from state appropriations plus tuition, of atleast the 60th percentile of total per-student funding at similar public institutions of higher education inWashington's global challe nge states. (Washington's global challenge states are California, Colorado,Maryland, New Jersey, Connec ticut, Virginia, Minnesota, and North Carolina.) Opportunity Expansion Program . Opportunity expan- sion moneys are awarded to public institutions of higher education that propose programs designed to increase thenumber of baccalaureate degrees produced in high em- ployer demand and other programs of study. These pro- grams must have a strong em phasis on serving students who received their high school diploma or GED in Wash-ington or are adult Washington residents who are returningto school. This program w ill initially be funded through voluntary contributions of th e existing high tech research and development (R&D) tax credits. The Department ofRevenue (DOR) reports the am ount contributed to the State Treasurer, and the Legislature appropriates thefunds. Reporting Requirements . The following reports are required: The Office of Financial Management must report annually, by December 1, regarding the percentage of Washington households with incomes in the middle- income bracket or higher. The HECB must report re garding the increase in the number of degrees in high employer demand or other programs of study over the average of the preceding10 academic years. The Workforce Training and Education Board must include in its comprehensiv e plan specific strategies to reach the goal of increasing the percentage of Washington households liv ing in the \"middle-income bracket\" or higher. The DOR must report to the State Treasurer on the amount of R&D tax credits voluntarily contributed to the Opportunity Expansion Program. By December 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the Board and the program admi nistrator must report to the HECB, the Governor, and the Legislature withrespect to the Opportunity Scholarship and Expansion programs.ESHB 2115 225 In 2018 the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Com- mittee must evaluate and report upon the Opportunity Scholarship and Expansion programs. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 6, 2011 ESHB 2115 C 6 L 11 E1 Concerning legislative review of performance standards for the statewide student assessment. By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Haigh and Dammeier). House Committee on Education Background: It is the responsibility of the State Board of Education (SBE) to identify the scores that students must achieve on the statewide student assessments in order tomeet the state standard of performance for purposes ofschool accountability and, in th e case of high school stu- dents, for graduation. The SBE sets these performancestandards in consultation with the Office of the Superin- tendent of Public Instru ction (OSPI) and considers recommendations of techni cal and advisory groups. The initial performance stan dards for the high school assessment and any changes to them must be presented to the education committees of the Legislature by November30 of the school year in whic h the changes take effect, and the Legislature must be permitted to take statutory actionif desired before the chang es are implemented. For the elementary and middle school assessments, the Legisla-ture must merely be advise d of the initial performance standards and any changes. In the spring of 2011 the OSPI is administering two new mathematics end-of-course assessments. In the caseof a newly developed assessment, it is not technicallypossible to set the performance standards until the actualrange of student scores is known, which will not occuruntil late spring of the 2010-11 school year. Summary: Rather than requiring the SBE to submit initial high school performance standards to the education committees by November 30 of the school year in which they take effect, the Legislature must be advised of theinitial performance standards. For all grade levels of the statewide student assess- ment, the SBE must provide an explanation and rationalefor initial performance standard s and any changes. If the SBE changes any performance standards, the OSPI mustrecalculate the results from the previous 10 years ofadministering that assessment and post a comparison ofthe original and recalculated r esults on the agency website. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: May 31, 2011 SHB 2119 C 24 L 11 E1 Requiring another one-time sum due by beneficiaries for reporting certain notices of default. By House Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Representatives Orwall, Hope, Eddy, Hunter,Rodne and Pedersen). House Committee on Ways & Means Background: During the 2011 Regular Session, Second Substitute House Bill 1362 (2SHB 1362) was enacted which makes numerous changes to the deeds of trust fore- closure process. There is a mechanism in 2SHB 1362 that provides funding for increasing the number of housing counselors and attorneys available to assist individuals atrisk of default, establishing a foreclosure mediation pro-gram, enforcing new consumer protection requirements,and conducting homeowner prepurchase and postpurchaseoutreach and education prog rams. Although the fore- closure mediation program and other provisions do nottake effect until July 22, 2011 , the provisions creating the funding mechanism took effect April 14, 2011. Second Substitute House B ill 1362 provides that no later than 30 days after April 14, 2011, certain beneficia-ries must remit to the Depa rtment of Commerce (COM) a lump sum payment of $250 per owner-occupied residen-tial real property for which the beneficiary has issued anotice of default during the th ree months prior to April 14, 2011. That remittance period covers the number of prop-erties receiving notices of default during the period ofmid-February through mid-April. In addition, 2SHB 1362 provides that beginning October 1, 2011, and every quarter thereafter, certainbeneficiaries must remit to the COM a lump sum paymentbased on the number of properties for which a notice ofdefault is issued during the previous quarter. The October1, 2011, remittance requirem ent covers the period from July 1 through September 30, 2011. There is no remittance re quirement for the period between mid-April and June 30, 2011. The reporting and remitting re quirements do not apply to financial institutions and lo an servicers that have issued fewer than 250 notices of default in the preceding year orto association beneficiaries.

Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 7, 2011 EHB 2123 C 37 L 11 E1 Addressing the workers' compensation system. By Representatives Green and Condotta; by request of Governor Gregoire. Background: Under the state's industrial insurance laws, employers must insure thro ugh the State Fund adminis- tered by the Department of Labor and Industries (Depart- ment) or may self-insure if qualified. Workers who, in thecourse of employment, are injured or disabled from anoccupational disease are entitle d to benefits. Workers receive medical, temporary time-loss, and vocationalrehabilitation benefits, as well as benefits for permanentdisabilities. The law provides that a worker may not waiveindustrial insurance benefits by an agreement and that any such agreement is void. The Workers Compensation Advisory Committee (WCAC) is a 10-member committee tasked with studyingaspects of the workers' compensation system. Workersand employers are represented on the WCAC. Temporary Time-Loss . Workers temporarily unable to work receive time-loss be nefits. The amount of the time-loss is 60 to 75 percent of the worker's wages,depending on the worker's family status and number ofdependents, and subject to minimum and maximumamounts. Return to Work . An employer may request that a worker receiving time-loss bene fits be certified by a phy- sician or Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP)to be able to perform light du ty or transitional work. The physician or ARNP must decide whether the worker isphysically able to perform the work. If so, the worker's time-loss benefits end. Permanent Disabilities . A worker who suffers speci- fied catastrophic injuries or other condition permanently incapacitating the worker from performing any work at any gainful occupation is enti tled to permanent total dis- ability (TPD or also referred to as pension) benefits. Theworker may choose benefits at the same rate as temporarytime-loss benefits or may select from other options. If apermanent partial disability (P PD) results from an injury, a worker receives one-time compensation under a statuto-ry schedule. If the award is more than three times theaverage monthly wage, however, payment is mademonthly and interest is paid at the rate of 8 percent on the balance. If a worker receives a pension award following a PPD award, any portion of the PPD award that exceeds theamount that would have been paid if the TPD award had been paid in the first instan ce is deducted from the work- er's TPD benefits. This prov ision has been interpreted to result in no deduction of PPD awards in many cases. Ifamounts are deducted, the worker has a choice of whetherthe deduction is from the worker's monthly benefit amountor from the pension reserve for the worker. The deductionfrom the monthly benefit amount is capped at 25 percentof the monthly amount or one-sixth the total overpayment,whichever is less. Cost-of-Living Adjustment . Workers receiving time- loss or a pension and certain survivors receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on July 1 of each year. TheCOLA begins the first July 1 after injury. The COLA isbased on the average monthly wage, and the formuladepends on whether the worker began receivingcompensation before, or on or after July 1, 1971. Premiums and Funds . State Fund employers pay into the Accident Fund, which pays for time-loss, PPD, andpension benefits, and the Medical Aid Fund, which paysfor medical and vocational re habilitation benefits. Work- ers also pay into the Medical Aid Fund. The Departmentclassifies industries by risk and sets basic premium rates.The basic premium rate is adju sted by an experience rating for each employer. The rates must be the lowest necessary to maintain the actuarial so lvency of the Accident and Medical Aid Funds in accordan ce with recognized insur- ance principles, and must be designed to attempt to limitfluctuations in premium rates. The WCAC advises theDepartment on appropriate levels of a contingencyreserve, and when surplus funds exist, the circumstancesunder which the Department should give premiumdividends, or similar measures, or temporarily reducerates. Safety and Health Investment Projects Program . Beginning in 2008, the state omnibus operating appropri-ations act (operating budget) has appropriated funds fromthe Medical Aid Fund to the De partment for the Safety and Health Investment Projects (SHIP) Program. By the termsof the operating budget provisos, priority must be given toprojects fostering accident prevention through cooperation between employers and employees or their representa-tives. Under rules adopted by the Department, grants maybe awarded to trade and business associations, laborunions, employers, and other groups. Summary: Stay-at-Work . Legislative findings are made that long-term disability and the cost of injuries are significantly reduced when injured workers remain atwork. A State Fund employer may receive a wage subsidy and other reimbursements un der certain circumstances for employing a worker at light du ty or transitional work. ToHouse 63 24Senate 36 9EHB 2123 227be eligible, an employer must submit a request for the sub- sidy or other reimbursement within one year of the date thework was performed. Wage subsidies and reimbursements are payable only if the physician or Advanced RegisteredNurse Practitioner (ARNP) has restricted the worker fromperforming the worker's usual work and the physician orARNP has released the worker to perform the workoffered. Wage subsidy. The wage subsidy is 50 percent of basic, gross wages paid for the work for a maximum of 66 work days in a consecutive 24-month period, up to amaximum of $10,000. No subsidy is paid for compensa-tion other than wages or salary, such as tips, health care,other specified payments, or any other payments. No sub- sidy is payable for a day in which the worker does notwork. Reimbursement. The employer is also eligible for reimbursement for the following: Training or instruction - tuition, books, fees, and materials, up to $1,000. Clothing - up to $400. No reimbursement is avail- able for any clothing th at an employer normally provides to its workers. The clothing becomes the worker's property. Tools or equipment - up to $2,500. The reimburse- ment does not apply to any tools or equipment pur- chased before offering the wo rk to the worker or for tools or equipment that the employer normally pro- vides. The tools and equipment are the property of the employer. Payments made for wage subsidies and reimburse- ments through willful misrepr esentation are subject to a penalty of the amount paid plus 50 percent. An employer's experience rating is not affected by wage subsidies. A dis-pute about the validity of the work offered or the worker's ability to perform is an app ealable order. The reimburse- ments are paid out of a newly created Stay-at-WorkAccount, which is funded by assessments of State Fundemployers for the costs of the payments and a reserve.Employers may collect up to one-half the assessment fromworkers. Claim Resolution Structur ed Settlement Agreements . General. Certain injured workers may resolve their claimswith a claim resolution stru ctured settlement agreement (agreement). Beginning Janu ary 1, 2012, when settle- ments may first be agreed to , workers must be age 55 or older. Beginning January 1, 2015, workers must be age 53or older, and beginning January 1, 2016, workers must beage 50 or older. The agreement may not settle medicalbenefits or reverse or set aside an order allowing a claim.The parties may initiate agreements after 180 days fromthe receipt of the claim by the Department or self-insurer.The order allowing the claim must be final and binding. The agreement must provide a periodic payment schedule equal to at least 25 pe rcent, but not more than 150percent, of the average monthly wage except that the firstpayment may be up to six times the average monthlywage. A third party administrator of a self-insuredemployer must disburse payment pursuant to theagreement. Process. All agreements must be approved by the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board). If theworker is unrepresented, an industrial appeals judge (IAJ)with the Board must schedule a conference with the parties within 14 days of submittal fo r purposes of reviewing the agreement terms and ensuring the worker has an adequate understanding of workers' co mpensation benefits and that an agreement may alter the benefits. The IAJ may approvean agreement only if the agr eement is in the best interest of the worker. The IAJ must consider the following best interest factors, with no fact or being determinative: nature and extent of the worker's injuries and disabilities; theworker's age and life expectancy; the worker's other bene-fits and the effect of an ag reement on those benefits; and the marital and domestic partnership status of the worker.Within seven days of the conference, the IAJ must allowor reject the agreement. Ther e is no appeal from this deci- sion. If a worker is represented by an attorney, the partiessubmit the agreement di rectly to the Board. The Board must approve the agreement within 30 days unless it finds that: (1) the pa rties have not entered into the agreement knowingly or willi ngly; or (2) the agreement (a) is the result of a material misrepresentation of law orfact, (b) is the result of hara ssment or coercion, or (c) is unreasonable as a matter of law. A party may revokeconsent to the agreement within 30 days after the Boardapproves the agreement. An agreement is not subject toappeal. Other provisions. For a State Fund claim, the parties are the worker, the employer, and the Department of Laborand Industries (Department). An employer is not a partyif the claim costs are no long er included in the calculation of the employer's experience factor, or the employer can- not be located, is no longer in business, or fails to respond or declines to participate. For a self-insured claim theparties are the worker and employer. An unrepresentedworker may request the self-insured ombudsman toprovide assistance or be present during negotiations. Withrespect to medical benefits, the agreement may providethat the claim remain open for future treatment or that further specific treatment may be provided. In addition,the worker may apply as unde r current law to reopen the claim for medical benefits. The Director of the Department (Director) must approve subjecting any industri al insurance funds to any responsibility or burden. An agreement may not bind an employer not signatory to the agreement. Agreementsmust be signed by the parties or their representatives andclearly state the parties understand and agree to the terms.EHB 2123 228The Department must mainta in copies of agreements and must furnish copies upon request to any party actively negotiating a subsequent ag reement with the worker. To the extent the worker is entitled to any benefits, the benefits must be paid until the agreement is final. Attorneys' fees are limited to 15 percent of the total amount to be paid to the worker. The Board hears any disputes regardin g attorneys' fees. Certain penalties and prohibitions apply. If a party fails to comply with an ag reement, any other party may petition the Board within on e year from the failure to comply. If the Board finds noncompliance, it must ordercompliance and impose a penalty of up to 25 percent of theamount unpaid. If the Department determines an employ-er has engaged in a pattern of harassment or coercion, theemployer may be subject to penalty or corrective action,and may be removed from the retrospective rating pro-gram or be decertified as a self-insurer. Consideration ofan agreement when making an employment decision isprohibited. The Department and Board must adopt rules to implement the provisions. On December 1, 2011, and annually thereafter through December 1, 2014, the Department must report to the Leg-islature on the implementation of agreements. In 2015,2019, and 2023, the Department must contract, in consul-tation with the Workers Co mpensation Advisory Commit- tee (WCAC), for an independent study of agreements.The studies must evaluate th e quality and effectiveness of agreements, provide information on the impact of agree- ments to State Fund and self-i nsured employers, and eval- uate worker outcomes. Stud ies must be submitted to the Legislature. Safety and Health Investment Projects Program . The SHIP Program is placed in statute. The Director may pro-vide funding from the Medical Aid Fund, by grant or con-tract, for projects for State Fu nd workplaces. The funding authority includes projects to : prevent workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities; create early return-to-workprograms; and reduce long -term disability through the cooperation of employers and employees or their repre-sentatives. Organizations that may receive awardsinclude: trade and business associations; employers andemployees; labor unions; em ployee organizations; joint labor and management groups; and education institutionsin collaboration with State Fund employer and employeerepresentatives. Funds may not be used for: lobbying orpolitical activities; supporti ng, opposing, or developing legislative or regulatory initiatives; any activity not designed to reduce workpla ce injuries, illnesses, or fatali- ties; or reimbursing employers for the normal costs ofcomplying with safety and health rules. Funds must be distributed as follows: 25 percent - projects designed to develop and implement innovative and effective return-to-work programs for injured workers; 25 percent - projects that specifically address small business needs; and 50 percent - projects that foster workplace injury and illness prevention by addressing priorities identified by the Department in cooperation with the Washington Industrial Sa fety and Health Act Advisory Committ ee and the WCAC. Permanent Total and Permanent Partial Disability Awards . If a pension is awarded after a permanent partial disability (PPD) award, all PPD compensation must be either deducted from the worker's monthly pension bene-fits or deducted from the pension reserve. Any interestpaid is not deducted. Deductions from monthly pensionbenefits are not capped. This provision applies to pension determinations on or after July 1, 2011. Interest paid on monthly PPD awards is eliminated. Cost-of-Living Adjustments . Cost-of-living adjust- ments (COLAs) are suspended for July 1, 2011, with no \"catch up.\" The COLA is th e percentage change in the average monthly wage for the preceding year. (The newCOLA formula applies regardless of when the worker firstbegan receiving benefits.) The first COLA occurs thesecond July 1, rather than the first July 1, after the date ofinjury or disease manifestation. Rainy Day Fund . An Industrial Insurance Rainy Day Fund (Rainy Day Fund) is created. Before proposingpremium rates, the Director must determine whether the assets of the Accident and Medical Aid Fund combinedare at least 10 percent, but not more than 30 percent, in excess of funded liabilities, an d if so, must transfer any excess to the Rainy Day Fund. However, the Director maynot transfer funds if a transfer would threaten the Depart-ment's ability to meet indust rial insurance obligations or result in total assets of the Rainy Day Fund combined withAccident and Medical Aid Fu nds assets to exceed 30 per- cent of the Accident and Medical Aid Funds' liabilities. The WCAC must create a Finance Subcommittee made upof three members representing business and three mem-bers representing labor. The Finance Subcommittee mustprovide recommendations for any changes to the 30 per-cent cap on total assets ex ceeding liabilities to the Legislature by December 1, 2011. When adopting rates the Director may transfer mon- eys from the Rainy Day Fund into the Accident or MedicalAid Fund if a transfer is necessary to reduce a rate increaseor aid businesses in recoveri ng from or during economic recessions. The Director may also transfer moneys at any time liabilities increase so that total liabilities exceedassets. Fund transfer decisions are announced as part of rule-making and are not review able by any court or tribu- nal.HB 3225 229The Director must separately account for moneys from the Accident and Medical Aid Funds. Rainy Day Fund assets may not be used for any purposes other thanindustrial insurance. Earnings from the Rainy Da y Fund are deposited into the Rainy Day Fund and the State Investment Board mayinvest moneys in the Rainy Day Fund in the same manner as other industrial insurance funds. Fraud . The Department is directed to continue to apply best practices to address employer fraud and toapply these same best practi ces to address worker and provider fraud. These practices include participating in a national information exchange with other workers' com-pensation insurers to avoid du plication of claims and ben- efits, increasing public awareness of fraud and how toreport fraud, establishing crite ria for periodic review of pension recipients to determine whether they can be gain-fully employed, and identifying provider billing patternsto target potentially abusive practices. The Department's fraud activities must include approaches to prevent, educate, and ensure compliance byproviders, employers, and workers. The Department must provide a report to the Governor and appropriate legislativ e committees by December 1, 2012, that describes the Depa rtment's efforts and out- comes and makes recommendati ons for statutory changes to address barriers to addressing fraud. Performance Audit of Claims Management System . The Joint Legislative Aud it and Review Committee (JLARC), in consultation with the Department and theWCAC, must conduct a performance audit of the workers'compensation claims manageme nt system, including self- insured claims. The JLARC may contract with an inde-pendent expert. The audit mu st evaluate the extent to which the Department: (1) makes fair and timely deci- sions and resolves complaints in a timely, fair, and effec-tive manner; and (2) communicates in a timely,responsive, and accurate manner. The audit must also:determine if current claims management organization andservice delivery models are the most efficient available;analyze organization and delivery for retrospective ratingplan participants as compared to nonparticipants; anddetermine whether current initiatives improve service delivery, and meet other specified criteria. The JLARCmust make recommendations regarding administrative changes to improve efficiency and any needed legislative changes. Progress reports to the Legislature are due by Decem- ber 1, 2012, and December 1, 2013, and the audit resultsare due by June 30, 2015. Occupational Disease . In consultation with the WCAC, the Department must contract with an indepen- dent entity with research expe rience in workers' compen- sation issues to study occupational disease claims. Thestudy must include an examin ation of the frequency andseverity of occupational disease claims, the impact ofclaims on long-term disability and pension trends, thedefinition of occupational di sease, including a comparison to other jurisdictions, and the statute of limitationscompared to other jurisdic tions. The study must be submitted to the appropriate committees of the Legislature by December 1, 2012.

By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Schmick, Cody,Hinkle and Frockt). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term CareBackground: Enacted in 2010, th e federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPAC Act), along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, provides for a wide variety of changes in health care andhealth insurance over a number of years. Soon after enactment of the PPAC Act, the Governor's Health Care Cabinet (Cabinet) began coordinating healthreform efforts among the state agencies and conveningwork groups to assist the Cabinet in understanding theadministrative and policy impa cts. In addition, the Realization Committee, established in December 2009 bythe Office of the Insuranc e Commissioner, has been functioning as a forum for the consideration of health insurance exchanges and in surance market reforms. In 2010 the State Omnibus Operating Appropriations Act (Engrossed Substitute Se nate Bill 6444) established a Joint Select Committee on He alth Reform Implementation (Joint Select Committee) to review policies related to health reform. The Joint Select Committee met four timesduring the 2010 legislativ e interim and formed three advisory groups on workforc e, exchange and insurance reforms, and low-income covera ge. In addition to receiv- ing reports and recommendations from these advisorygroups, the Joint Select Committee received updates andrecommendations from other state agencies working onaspects of health reform, in cluding the Governor's Office, the Office of the Insurance Co mmissioner, the Health Care Authority, and the Department of Social and HealthServices. The authorization for the Joint Select Committee expires June 30, 2011. Summary: The Joint Select Committee on Health Reform Implementation (Joint Select Committee) is con- tinued. The Joint Select Committee membership will con- sist of the chairs of the he alth committees of the Senate and the House and eight add itional legislative members, four from the Senate and four from the House, appointed by the leadership of the two largest caucuses of the Senate and the House. The Governor will be invited to appoint a non-voting liaison member. The chairs of the Senate and House health care com- mittees will serve as co-chairs. The co-chairs may directthe formation of advisory co mmittees to focus on specific topic areas, including insurance regulation, access to andexpansion of public and private programs, cost contain-ment, and workforce issues. Interested stakeholders and experts may be invited to advise the Joint Select Committee. The co-chairs must establis h an advisory committee to provide advice and recommenda tions to the Department of Social and Health Services and the Health Care Authority in the development of an im plementation plan to coordi- nate the purchase and delivery of acute care, long-termcare, and behavioral health services. The Joint Select Committee expires on or before June 30, 2014. House 93 0Senate 48 0E2SSB 5000 231Votes on Final Passage: E2SSB 5000 C 167 L 11 Mandating a twelve-hour impound hold on motor vehicles used by persons arrested fo r driving under the influence. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators Haugen, Er icksen, Hatfield, Schoesler, Shin, Conway, Tom, Sheldon and Kilmer). Senate Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on TransportationHouse Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Transportation Background: Law enforcement officers may impound a vehicle for a number of reaso ns, including when the oper- ator of a vehicle is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). There is no requirement that officers impound a vehicle driven by a person arrested for DUI. When a vehicle is impounded, the tow truck operator must notify the legal and registered owners of theimpoundment, the right of redemption, and the opportuni-ty for a hearing to contest th e validity of the impoundment or the amount of towing and storage charges. An impounded vehicle may be redeemed only by a registeredowner of the vehicle, a legal owner (such as a lien holder),or a person who has permission of a registered owner, andonly upon payment of all costs associated with theimpound. If, in a hearing contesting the impoundment, the impound is found to be in violation of the impound laws,the person or agency that authorized the impound is responsible for costs associat ed with the impound, the filing fee, and reasonable damages for loss of use of thevehicle. However, if the im pound is based on driving with a suspended license and the impound is found to beimproper, the law enforcement officer and the agencyemploying the officer are not liable for damages for loss ofuse of the vehicle if the offi cer relied in good faith and without gross negligence on th e Department of Licensing's driving records. In a 2002 Washington supreme court case, All Around Underground v. The Washington State Patrol, the Court held that a Washington State Patrol rule requiringimpoundment of the vehicle operated by a person arrestedfor having a suspended licen se exceeded statutory author- ity because the impoundment st atute requires officer dis- cretion in whether or not to impound. While the case wasdecided on statutory grounds, the majority opinion notedthat courts have generally fo und that in order to satisfyconstitutional requirements, impoundment must be rea- sonable, which includes taking into account whether rea-sonable alternatives to impo undment exist. Under both the state and federal Const itutions, seizures of property must be reasonable. Summary: The Legislature finds that protecting the pub- lic from an intoxicated person operating a vehicle is theprimary reason for impounding the vehicle driven by aperson arrested for DUI. When a law enforcement officer arrests a person for DUI, the officer must impound the vehicle. When thedriver of the vehicle is a registered owner of the vehicle,the impounded vehicle may not be redeemed until 12hours after the vehicle arrives at the tow truck operator'sstorage facility, unless there are two or more registeredowners or there is a legal owner of the vehicle. If there aretwo or more registered owners or a legal owner, the regis-tered owner or the legal owner who is not the driver of thevehicle may redeem the vehicle upon impound. When thedriver of the vehicle is not a registered owner, the regis-tered owner may redeem th e vehicle once impounded. The law enforcement officer directing the impound must notify the driver of the vehicle that a registered owner or alegal owner who is not the driver may redeem the vehicle. If the police officer who directed that a vehicle be impounded is presented with exigent circumstances and has waited 30 minutes afte r contacting the police dis- patcher requesting the register ed tow truck operator, the officer may leave the vehicle after placing inside it thecompleted impound order and inventory and securing thevehicle. The officer and the government or agencyemploying the officer are not liable for damages or theft of the vehicle or its contents, or for the actions of any personwho removes the vehicle prior to the arrival of the tow truck operator, as long as the officer has secured thevehicle and followed the specified procedures. If the vehicle subject to impoundment is a commercial or farm transport vehicle, the police officer must attempt,in a reasonable and timely manner, to contact the owner ofthe vehicle and may release it to the owner as long as he orshe was not in the vehicle at th e time of the stop and arrest. Registered tow truck operators that release an im- pounded vehicle in compliance with these impoundrequirements are not liable for injuries or damages sus-tained by the vehicle operator or by other parties that may result from the vehicle operator's intoxicated state. If animpoundment is found improper, the arresting officer andthe officer's government employer are not liable for dam-ages for loss of use of the vehicle if the officer had reason-able suspicion to believe the operator was driving or controlling a vehicle while unde r the influence of alcohol or drugs. A farm transport vehicle is defined. The act is to be known as Hailey's Law.House 92 5 Senate 47 1 (Senate amended)House 90 5 (House concurred)ESB 5005 232Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 July 1, 2011 (Section 6) ESB 5005 C 299 L 11 Concerning exemption from immunization. By Senators Keiser, Honeyford, Pflug, Becker, Regala, Carrell, Hobbs, Nelson, Rockefeller, Shin and Chase. Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Before the first day of school, students at Washington's public and private schools (preschool through 12th grade) and children attending licensed daycare must provide proof of immunization against certainvaccine-preventable diseases as determined by the Wash- ington State Board of Health (BOH). However, a parentor guardian may exempt a child for one of several reasonsincluding if a physician advises against a specific vaccinefor a child, parents certify that the vaccine conflicts withtheir religious beliefs, or pa rents certify that they have philosophical or personal objections to the child's immunization. Under BOH rules, the required immunization sched- ule includes vaccinations against 11 diseases. Nearly allstates allow medical and relig ious exemptions from their school immunization requiremen ts. According to a 2005 Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention report, 20 states allow exemptions based on philosophical or personal objections. Summary: Modifications are made to the certification, that a parent or guardian must present, to exempt a child from school immunization requirements. The form usedto certify the exemption for either medical, religious, or personal objections must incl ude a statement, signed by a health care practitioner, that the parent or guardian hasbeen informed of the benefits and risks of the immuniza- tion to the child. Health care practitioners may sign forms at any time before the enrollm ent of the child in a school or licensed day care. Photocopies of the signed form or aletter from the health care practitioner are allowed in lieuof the original form. A health care practitioner is defined as a licensed phy- sician, licensed naturopath, licensed physician assistant, oradvanced registered nurse practitioner. A parent or legal guardian who exempts his or her child from immunization requ irements because of reli- gious beliefs is not required to have the form signed by a health care practitioner if they belong to a church withteachings that preclude a health professional from providing medical trea tment to the child. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5011 C 87 L11 Concerning the victimization of homeless persons. By Senators White, Kohl-Welles, Murray, Chase, Nelson and McAuliffe. Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: Under the Sentencing Reform Act, a stan- dard sentence range is estab lished by comparing the seri- ousness level of an offense to an offender score derived from the offender's criminal history and convictions forother current offenses. A sentence which is outside thestandard sentence range is referred to as an exceptionalsentence. A court may impose an exceptional sentenceabove the standard sentence range if: the state gives notice of its intention to rely on one or more of 28 statutory aggravating factors; a jury determines that the existence of one or more aggravating factors have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and, the court finds that substantial and compelling reasons justify an exceptional sentence. Summary: A new statutory aggravating circumstance is created which would permit the court to impose an excep- tional sentence above the standard sentence range if the of-fense was intentionally comm itted because the defendant perceived the victim to be homeless. This aggravating cir-cumstance must be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \"Homeless\" is defined as a condition where an indi- vidual lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime resi- dence and who has a primary ni ghttime residence that is a supervised, publicly or privat ely operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations; a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a reg- ular sleeping accommodation for human beings; or, a pri-vate residence where the individual stays as a transientinvitee.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 47 0 House 92 1 (House amended)House 95 0 (House reconsidered)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 35 11House 66 29 (House amended)Senate 34 12 (Senate concurred) Senate 49 0 House 92 1SSB 5018 233SSB 5018 C 88 L 11 Including wound care management in occupational therapy. By Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senato rs Keiser, Conway, Shin, Schoesler, Hobbs, Kline and McAuliffe).Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Background: Occupational therapy uses activity-based treatment to maximize the independence and functioningof persons with physical in jury or illness, psychosocial dysfunction, disability, or lim itations due to aging. Some examples of occupational therapy include exercises,teaching skills and adapting environments to enhance cog- nitive, perceptual, motor, sensory integrative and psychomotor functioning. An occupational therapist is a person licensed by the Board of Occupational Therapy Practice (Board) to prac-tice occupational therapy. An occupational therapy assis- tant is a person licensed by the Board to assist in thepractice of occupational therapy under the supervision ofa licensed occupational therapist. Statutory provisions do no t list wound care as within the scope of practice of occu pational therapist or occupa- tional therapy assistants. The Board issued an informalopinion stating occupational therapy includes wound care management, and has considered adopting an official in-terpretative statement that o ccupational therapy includes wound management and sharp debridement (the removalof dead or contaminat ed tissue from a wound). Summary: Wound care is explicitly made part of the scope of practice of an occupational therapist. An occupa-tional therapist may provide wound care management un-der the direction of a physicia n or other authorized health care provider. The referring provider must examine thepatient prior to the referral. Wound care management is defined as the part of oc- cupational therapy treatment that facilitates healing; pre- vents edema, infection, and excessive scar formation; andminimizes wound complications. Wound care includesassessment, application of dr essings and topical medica- tions, cleansing, and sharp debridement. An occupationaltherapist may not delegate wound care management. In order to be authorized to perform wound care, except sharp debridement, an occupational therapist must submit an affidavit to the De partment of Health attesting to his or her education and training, which includes a min-imum of 15 hours of mentored training in a clinical setting. The education and training requirement may also be satisfied if the occupational th erapist is certified as a hand therapist by the Ha nd Therapy Certification Commissionor as a wound care specialis t by the National Alliance of Wound Care or its equivalent.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESSB 5020 C 89 L 11 Protecting consumers by assuring persons using the title of social worker have graduated with a degree in social workfrom an educational program accredited by the council on social work education. By Senate Committee on Hu man Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Murray, Regala, Kohl-Welles, Prentice and Chase). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Classifications of Social Workers Licensed by the Department of Health (DOH) . Licensed advanced social workers and licensed independent clinical social workers are licensed by DOH to provide mental health- related counseling, often in an independent practice setting. Persons who are licensed through DOH aslicensed advanced social wo rkers and licensed indepen- dent clinical social workers must meet certain require-ments, including graduation from an approved master's ordoctoral level social work program. Classifications of Social Workers Through the State's Department of Personnel (DOP) . State agencies in Washington employ persons who are classified by DOP associal workers. Rather than provide only direct mental health-related counse ling services to clients, social work- ers in state agencies may also refer clients to professionalsin various fields, including counseling, who provide the service directly. Minimum qualif ications of an entry level social worker under DOP's classification system are: (1) amaster's degree in social services, human services, behav- ioral sciences, or an allied field; or (2) a bachelor's degreein social services, human services, behavioral sciences, oran allied field and one year of social service experience. Summary: A person may only use the designation of social worker if the person is licensed by DOH as a socialworker, or has graduated with at least a bachelor's degreefrom a social work educational program accredited by theCouncil on Social Work Education. The provisions of this act do not apply to: persons employed in Washington on the effective date of the act with the jo b title of social worker, so long as the person remains employed with the same agency;Senate 48 0 House 97 0234 persons employed by the state of Washington with the job title of social worker , so long as the person remains employed with the state; individuals employed by the government of the United States while engaged in the performance of duties prescribed by the laws of the United States; or persons providing services as an educational staff associate who are certified by the WashingtonProfessional Educator Standards Board. References to the term soci al worker throughout the RCW are modified to reference the educational require- ments for a qualified social worker depending on the setting or persons being served as follows: a person must have a master's or other advanced degree in social work to use the designation of social worker when: providing services to those with men- tal illness, and supervisin g court-ordered contact between a child who has been sexually abused by a parent and the offending parent; a person must have a bachelor's degree in social work to use the designation of social worker when providing rehabilitative services in nursing homes; a person must have a bachelor's degree in social work or meet the federal qualifications for a social workerin order to use the designation of social worker whenproviding services to those in home health or hospice care; and job titles previously design ated as social worker but for which there is no ed ucational requirement in social work have been removed and are replaced withthe term department employee. For purposes of mandatory reporting of abuse, the term social worker includ es anyone who has a bachelor's degree in social work or who is engaged in a professional capacity working with vulnerable adults during the regular course of his or her employment. Engaging in the improper practice of social work is an unfair trade practice and un fair method of competition under the Consumer Protection Act.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012ESSB 5021 C 145 L 11 Enhancing election campaign disclosure requirements to promote greater transpar ency for the public.

Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Background: Initiative 276, passed by the voters in 1972, established disclosure of campaign finances, lobbyistactivities, financial affairs of elective offices and candi-dates, and access to public records. It also created thePublic Disclosure Commission (PDC), a five-member,bi-partisan citizen commission, to enforce the provisionsof the campaign finance disclosure law. In 1992 the Fair Campaign Practices Act was enacted following passage of Initiative 134. Initiative 134imposed campaign contributio n limits on elections for statewide and legislative office, further regulated indepen-dent expenditures, restricted the use of public funds forpolitical purposes, and required public officials to report gifts received in excess of $50. Provisions for reporting po litical advertising and elec- tioneering communications were enacted by the Legislature in 2005 and amended in 2010. Summary: Reporting Requirements . The definition of \"electioneering comm unication\" is amended to reflect a lower reporting threshold of the fair market value of $1,000. The threshold amount triggering mandatory electronic filing for candidates and politic al committees is lowered to $5,000. Political Committees . Naming Requirements .

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2012 SSB 5023 C 244 L 11 Addressing nonlegal immigration-related services. By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Prentice, McAuliffe, Litzow, Shin, Kline,Pflug, Fraser, Chase and Ro ckefeller; by request of Attorney General). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Immigration Assistant Practices Act (IAPA) requires that those who charge money to assist individuals with immigration matters must register asimmigration assistants with the Secretary of State unlessthat person is a lic ensed attorney. Immigration assistants may complete forms on behalf of another, but are prohib-ited from selecting the forms or selecting responses on the individual's behalf. Further, immigration assistants are not required to have specific training. In many Spanish speaking countries the term notario publico means attorney, but translates into English as notary public. The same translation problem occurs withother languages too. Persons seeking immigration helpoften seek assistance from persons advertised as notariopublicos because they believe these people are attorneys when in reality they are not. Often these notario publicos are improperly providing legal advice that delays or ruinsthe individual's chances of obtaining legal status. Summary: The term immigration assistant is removed. A definition for the practice of law is provided which does not include translation services. It is clarified that persons, other than those licensed to practice law in this state or otherwise permitted to practicelaw or represent others unde r federal law in an immigra- tion matter, are prohibited from engaging in the practice oflaw in an immigration matter for compensation. They are also prohibited from engaging in the following acts orpractices for compensation: (1) advising or assistinganother person in determining the person's legal or illegalstatus for the purpose of an immigration matter; (2) select- ing, assisting another in selec ting, or advising another how to answer questions on a gove rnment agency form related to immigration matters; (3) sel ecting, assisting another in selecting, or advising another in selecting a benefit, visa,or program to apply for in immigration matters; (4) solic-iting to prepare documents for another in a judicial oradministrative proceeding in an immigration matter; (5) explaining, advising, or otherwise interpreting the mean-ing or intent of a question on a government form in animmigration matter; (6) charging a fee for referring some-one to a licensed attorney; and (7) selecting, drafting, orcompleting documents to suppor t or establish a benefit for another in an immigration matter. Persons, other than those licensed to practice law in this state or otherwise permitted to practice law or repre-sent others under federal law in an immigration matter, are also prohibited from engaging in the following acts regardless of whether compensation is sought: (1) repre- senting that he or she is a lawyer, nota publico, notario, immigration assistant, immigr ation consultant, immigra- tion specialist, or using any other designation or title that implies that the person is a pr ofessional with legal skills in the area of immigration law; and (2) representing, in anylanguage, in any manner, that he or she can provide servic-es in an immigration matter, if such services wouldconstitute the practice of law. Persons who are not attorneys or otherwise permitted under federal law to represent immigrants may, for com- pensation (1) translate word s on government forms that the immigrant presents to the person providing translation; (2) secure existing documents, such as birth and marriage certificates; and (3) offer other immigration related servic-es that are not prohibited by the act or other law or that donot constitute the practice of law. Notary publics licensed in Washington who are not licensed attorneys may not use the term notario publico,notario, immigration assistant, immigration consultant,immigration specialist, or other designation conveying orimplying that he or she possesses professional legal skillsin the areas of immigration law, when advertising notary public services. The state Supreme Court's Practice of Law Board (Board) is requested to evaluate (1) the specific servicesnon-attorneys may provide to immigrants that do not rise to the level of the practice of law; (2) the level of access to those services and quality of those services; and (3) the level of need for non-legal services compared to legal ser-vices in immigration matters.

A violation of any of the se prohibitions is considered unprofessional conduct. Persons injured by a violation of the IAPA may bring a civil action to recover either $1,000 or actual damagescaused by a violation, whichever is greater. The act is renamed the Immigration Services Fraud Prevention Act. The act takes effect 180 days after final adjournment of the legislative session in which it is enacted.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: October 20, 2011 SSB 5025 C 300 L 11 Concerning making requests by or on behalf of an inmate under the public records act ineligible for penalties. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Se nators Hargrove, Becker, and Holm quist Newbry; by request of Attorney General). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Background: Upon request, an agency must make its public records available for public inspection and copying unless the records fall within a specific statutory exemp- tion. Within five business da ys of receiving a request, the agency must either provide the record, acknowledge receipt of the request and provide a reasonable time esti-mate of the time required to respond, or deny the request. A person whose request has b een denied, may petition the court to determine whether th e agency was correct in its denial. If the court determines that the agency was not cor-rect, the person requesting the record must be awarded allcosts, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred in bringing the court action. The court may also award thepetitioner a penalty award of not less than $5 and not more than $100 for each day the pe titioner was denied the right to inspect or copy the public records requested. The court may prohibit the examination of a specific public record if, upon motion by the agency or agency rep-resentative, the court finds that such examination wouldclearly not be in the public in terest and would substantially and irreparably damage any person or a vital governmentfunction. The court may also prohibit all or part of a pub-lic records request, as well as future requests, by a personserving a criminal sentence if the court finds: the request was made to harass or intimidate an agency or its employees; fulfilling the request would likely threaten the security of correctional facilities; fulfilling the request would likely threaten the safety or security of staff, inmates, family members of staff, family members of other inmates, or any otherperson; or fulfilling the request may assist criminal activity. Summary: Unless the court finds that an agency acted in bad faith in denying a public records request, a court may not award penalties to a person who was serving a criminalsentence in a state, local, or privately operated correctional facility on the date the public records request was made.

By Senators Pridemore, Swecker, Chase and Nelson.Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on Local Government Background: Water-sewer districts provide water and sewer services to incorporated and unincorporated areas. Districts are established through a petition, public hearing,and voter approval process and are each managed by aboard of three or five elected commissioners who servestaggered six-year terms. District powers include the authority to purchase, con- struct, maintain, and supply waterworks to furnish water to inhabitants within and ou tside of the district, and to develop and operate systems of sewers and drainage. Inaddition, a district has broad authority to create facilities,systems, and programs for the collection, interception, treatment, and disposal of wastewater, and for the controlof pollution from such wastewater . A district is prohibited from engaging in the private sa le of real property if the appraised value exceeds $2,500. The sale of real property by a district is subject to the following requirements: subject to specified exceptions, the sale price must be at least 90 percent of the property's appraised value; the district must obtain a written appraisal not more than six months prior to the date of sale;Senate 44 5House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 42 4 (Senate concurred) Senate 45 4House 94 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)2SSB 5034 237 the appraisal must be made by three disinterested, licensed real estate brokers or professionally designated real estate appraisers; the appraisal must be si gned, filed, and made avail- able to the public in accordance with specified requirements; and notice of a district's inte ntion to sell the property must state the appraised value. Summary: A district may engage in the private sale of real property provided the estimated value is $5,000 or less. In conducting such a sale, a district's board of com-missioners is authorized to determine the estimated value based upon the advice of br okers and appraisers, as the board deems appropriate. Formal written appraisals arenot required. The sale price must be de termined through a formal property valuation process if the estimated value of the sale property exceeds $5,000. This process must includeeither a written broker price opinion from three real estatebrokers or an appraisal by one professionally designatedreal estate appraiser.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SSB 5034 C 214 L 11 Concerning private infr astructure development. By Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy (originally sponsored by Senators Kilmer, Kastama, Shin,Hatfield, Zarelli, Conway and Hewitt). Senate Committee on Economic Development, Trade & Innovation Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy House Committee on Local Government House Committee on EnvironmentHouse Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Background: Wastewater systems collect, treat and dis- pose of sewage or surface water run-off. They range insize from on-site sewage systems (OSS) serving singlehomes to large urban systems serving thousands of cus-tomers. OSS, which are regu lated by the Department of Health, are generally installed and operated by private in-dividuals and organizations. Large wastewater systems,which are regulated by the Department of Ecology, areinstalled and operated by local government entities, including cities, counties, and special purpose districts. The state Growth Management Act requires certain counties to designate urban gr owth areas (UGAs) and planfor provision of urban services, including wastewaterservices. The Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) regulates utilities and transpor tation services to ensure fair pricing, availability, reliability, and safety. The UTC hasjurisdiction over companies providing electricity and nat-ural gas, certain telecommunications service, water, solidwaste collection, commercial ferry service, transportationof household goods, certain auto transportation service,and transportation of petroleum via pipeline. Some UTC-regulated entitie s, including natural gas companies, certain auto tr ansportation companies, solid waste collection companies, hou sehold goods carriers, and commercial ferries must obtain certificates of public con- venience and necessity (certif icates) from the UTC to law- fully operate in the state. Factors that the UTC may reviewin issuing certificates vary. With respect to some services,the UTC may consider an applicant's financial resourcesand prior experience in the field. Certificates issued by theUTC may include conditions, including operatingparameters and service rates, set by the agency. The UTC does not regula te companies operating wastewater systems. Summary: Certain wastewater companies may not provide sewerage services for compensation without firstobtaining certificates from the UTC. Wastewater compa-nies subject to UTC jurisdiction are entities owning or pro-posing to develo p and own sewerage systems (facilities and services to collect, treat, and dispose of sewage orstorm or surface run-off) that are designed: for a peak daily flow of 27,000 to 100,000 gallons if treatment is by large OSS; or to serve 100 or more customers. Excluded from UTC jurisdiction are publicly-owned wastewater systems and wastewater company service tocustomers outside of a UGA. The UTC must consider specified factors when deter- mining whether to issue certificates, including businessplans, sufficiency of financial resources, need to developsystems instead of connecting to existing systems, prior experience, unwillingness of municipalities to providesewerage services, and consistency with local sewer plans.Companies must file and maintain bonds or equivalentsureties with the UTC to en sure sufficient funding. The UTC may set fees to cover program costs. The UTC may determine that a wastewater company is unfit to provide service and order transfer of its systems to a capable and willing co mpany. The UTC may petition the Thurston County Superior Court to place a failedwastewater company into rece ivership. A system owned by a failed company may be taken over by anothercompany or a municipality in eminent domainproceedings. General laws applicable to several UTC-regulated utilities are applied to wastewater companies.Senate 46 0House 94 1SB 5035 238Municipal corporations or private utilities, including wastewater companies, ma y petition for amendments to county sewerage and/or water general plans. The UTC may adopt rules to implement the act, and collect payments from wastewater companies and other private entities that have notified the UTC of their willing-ness to cover rulemaking costs. The UTC is not requiredto engage in rulemaking un til it has collected sufficient payments to cover rulemaking costs.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senators Keiser, Pflug, Chase, Kohl-Welles, Conway, Roach , Shin and McAuliffe; by request of Department of Social and Health Services). Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Judiciary Background: Under current state law, the Department of Social and Health Services (department) has a duty to investigate allegations of abuse, abandonment, neglect,self-neglect, and financial exploitation of vulnerable adults. Within the departme nt, Adult Protective Services (APS) handles cases where victims reside in their ownhome, and in facilities where there is an allegation of mis-treatment by someone outside the facility. APS staff in sixregions statewide, receive and investigate allegations ofabuse and neglect, prioritizi ng action based on potential immediate harm to the allege d victim. The Residential Care Services (RCS) division handles cases when the vic-tim resides in a long-term care facility licensed by thedepartment. In recent years, allegations of financial exploitation against vulnerable adults have increased substantially, ac-cording to the department. These allegations could in-clude a wide variety of activities such as cashing anelderly person's checks without permission or forging sig-natures, stealing money or belongings, coercing a seniorinto signing an unfavorable will, or misusing legally obtained guardianships or powers of attorney. There is concern that state law does not adequately clarify what constitutes financ ial exploitation and this re- sults in difficulty prosecuting the offense. According tothe National Center on Elder Abuse, this is the fastest growing area of abuse, and only a fraction of these casesare prosecuted. Currently, APS and RCS init iate investigations on tribal lands when asked by trib es to do so. Once the inves- tigations have been conducted, the cases are turned over tothe tribal enforcement co mmunity to complete. Summary: Financial exploitation is expanded to include the use of deception, intimidation, or undue influence by aperson or entity who is trusted by the vulnerable adult, and using the property, income, resources, or trust funds tobenefit someone other than the vulnerable adult. Financialexploitation is the breach of fiduciary duty that results in unauthorized appropriation, sale, or transfer of property,income, resources or trust funds to benefit some personother than the vulnerable adult. It is also obtaining or us-ing the vulnerable adult's property, income, resources, ortrust funds without lawful authority by someone who knows or should know that th e vulnerable adult lacks the capacity to consent.Property is further defined as interest in real or person- al property income, credit, iden tity, or resources that are held for the benefit of a vuln erable adult by a fiduciary or representative of the vulnerab le adult, including trust ac- counts, conservatorships, guar dianships or other accounts. Language is added requirin g that the department pro- vide an alleged victim of abuse or the victim's guardianwith a written statement of the victim's rights afforded un- der RCW 74.34 at the time when an investigation begins. The department's adult protective services division may enter into agreements with federally recognized tribes to investigate reports of abandonment, abuse, financial ex-ploitation, neglect or self-negl ect of vulnerable adults on property over which a federally recognized tribe has ex-clusive jurisdiction. After the tribe assumes jurisdiction,the department is not liable for any action or inaction of the tribe, for any harm to th e alleged victim, to the person to whom the allegations were made, or to other parties. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5044 C 335 L 11 Concerning the tax preference review process. By Senators Rockefeller, Zarelli and Regala.Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: State law requires a periodic review of most excise and property tax preferences to determine if their continued existence or modification serves the publicinterest. A tax preference is a tax exemption, deduction,credit, or preferential tax rate. The enabling legislation as-signs specific roles in the review process to two differententities. The job of scheduling tax preferences, holdingpublic hearings, and commenting on the reviews is as-signed to the Citizen Commission for Performance Mea-surement of Tax Preferences (Commission). Theresponsibility for conducting th e reviews is assigned to the staff of the Joint Legislativ e Audit and Review Committee (JLARC). The Commission develops a schedule to accomplish a review of tax preferences at least once every ten years.The Commission is authorized to omit certain tax prefer- ences from the schedule such as those required by consti- tutional law, the sales and use tax exemptions formachinery and equipment an d food, the small business business and occupation tax cr edit, the property tax relief program for retired persons, and tax preferences that theCommission determines are a critical part of the tax struc-ture. The Commission consid ers two additional factors inSenate 49 0House 95 0 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5045 240developing its schedule. First, as a general matter, the Commission must schedule tax preferences for review inthe order in which the preferences were enacted into law.Second, the Commission must schedule tax preferences that have a statutory expiratio n date before the preference expires. Through 2010, JLARC has reviewed 95 taxpreferences. When reviewing tax preferences, JLARC is required to consider the following factors: the classes of individual s, types of organizations, or types of industries whose state tax liabilities are directly affected by the tax preference; the public policy objectives that might provide a jus- tification for the tax preference including, but notlimited to, legislative history, legislative intent, or the extent to which the tax pr eference encourages busi- ness growth or relocation into this state, promotesgrowth or retention of high wage jobs, or helps stabilize communities; the evidence that the existence of the tax preference has contributed to the achievement of any of itspublic policy objectives; the extent to which con tinuation of the tax preference might contribute to a ny of the public policy objectives; the extent to which the tax preference may provide unintended benefits to an individual, organization, or industry other th an those the Legi slature intended; the extent to which te rminating the tax preference may have negative effects on the category of taxpay-ers that currently benefit from the tax preference, and the extent to which resulting higher taxes may havenegative effects on employment and the economy; the feasibility of modifying the tax preference to pro- vide for adjustment or recapture of the tax benefits ofthe tax preference if the objectives are not fulfilled; and the fiscal impacts of the tax preference, including past impacts and expected future im pacts if it is continued. After evaluating these factors, the JLARC provides a recommendation as to whethe r the tax preference should be continued without modification, modified, scheduled for sunset review at a future date, or terminatedimmediately. As an alternative to the pr ocess described above, the Commission is authorized to recommend an expedited re-view process for any tax preference that has an estimatedbiennial fiscal impact of $10 million or less. Generally, anexpedited review process is limited to the identification ofpublic policy objectives of the tax preference and itsprimary beneficiaries as well as revenue impacts. Summary: The mandatory requirement that the Commis- sion schedule tax preference re views in the order tax pref- erences are enacted into law is replaced with a moreflexible approach. The modi fied approach allows the JLARC to consider the date of enactment as one factor. However, the JLARC is allowed to consider other factorsincluding, but not limited to, grouping preferences for re- view by type of industry, economic sector, or policy areain determining the schedule. The requirement that an expedited review can only be applied to preferences with a biennial fiscal impact of $10million or less is eliminated . The Commission is autho- rized to recommend an expe dited review for any tax preference. In evaluating tax preferences, the JLARC may deter- mine which factors should be included in the review of a particular preference based on the factor's relevance to thatpreference. Legislative findings are added that provide that tax preferences which are enacte d for economic development purposes must demonstrate growth in full-time familywage jobs with health and retirement benefits. An economic impact analysis is added to the list of factors to be considered by JLARC when reviewing tax preferences. For purposes of the analysis the state input-output model is to be used.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5045 PARTIAL VETO C 336 L 11 Making technical corrections to gender-based terms. By Senators Kohl-Welles, Conway, Holmquist Newbry, Keiser, Kline, King and Chase; by request of Statute LawCommittee. Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Judiciary Background: Since 1983 state law requires that all stat- utes be written in gender-neutr al terms, unless a specifica- tion of gender is intended. In 2007 the Legislature passed ESB 5063, an act relating to removing gender references. The act changed gender-speci fic terms to gender-neutral terms in several chapters of the Revised Code of Washing- ton (RCW), including those ch apters dealing with fire- fighters, police officers, bondspersons, and material suppliers. The Legislature directed the Code Reviser, inconsultation with the Statut e Law Committee, to develop and implement a plan to corr ect gender-specific references in the entire RCW.

Gregoire Governor SB 5057 C 33 L 11 Concerning the income tax requir ed to be paid by a trustee. By Senators Pflug, Kline and Harper; by request of Washington State Bar Association. Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Washington Principal and Income Act (WPIA) governs the allocation of receipts and disburse- ments of a trust. A trust may have different classes of ben- eficiaries: those that have an interest in the income (income beneficiary) and those th at have an interest in the principal (remainder beneficiary). A trustee has afiduciary duty to both kinds of beneficiaries. If a trust hastwo or more beneficiaries, the trustee is to act impartiallyamong them and is to take in to account the differing inter- ests of the beneficiaries. The WPIA gives a trustee thepower to reallocate or adjust receipts of the trust between or among beneficiaries. When a trust owns an interest in what is known as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes, such as an Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), it must report itsshare of the entity's taxable income regardless of whether the trust actually receives all of the income. The trustee must allocate the taxes betwee n income and principal. Be- cause the trust's taxes and amounts distributed to a benefi-ciary are interrelated, the trus tee may be required to apply a formula to determine the co rrect amount to pay to a beneficiary. Summary: A tax required to be paid by a trustee on the trust's share of an entity's ta xable income mu st be charged: to income to the extent that the receipts from the entity are allocated only to income; to principal when the receipts from the entity are allocated only to principal; proportionately to inco me and principal when the receipts are allocated to both income and principal; or in all other cases, to principal. Prior to determining whethe r to charge a tax to the principal or income, a trustee must adjust income or prin- cipal receipts by the distri butions to a beneficiary for which the trust receives an income tax deduction. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESB 5058 C 34 L 11 Addressing receiverships. By Senators Pflug, Kline and Harper; by request of Washington State Bar Association.Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: A receiver is a person appointed by a court to take charge, as the court's own agent, over property of a party. A receivership is th e means by which a court ap- points a custodian over property pending litiga tion. In ap- propriate circumstances a receiver may be appointed overall of an entity's assets, an d given the power to liquidate those assets for the general benefit of creditors. In othercircumstances, a receiver may serve simply a caretakingrole pending a creditor's actio n, such as a foreclosure. In 2004 the Legislature en acted new receivership stat- utes. The rules generally governing receivershipSenate 45 0House 76 21 Senate 43 2House 95 0ESB 5061 242proceedings were consolidated into a single chapter, RCW 7.08, to clarify the powers, duties, and procedures applica-ble to receivers and receiverships. The frequency of re-ceiverships has steadily increased since the financial crisisbegan in 2007. Receiverships, as a remedy, are morestreamlined than federal ba nkruptcy proceedings and are less costly, yet proved a streamlined process for monetiz-ing property for creditors. Practitioners in this area have proposed the following changes primarily to clarify ambi-guities and address procedural issues that have beenexperienced since the 2004 statutes were enacted. Summary: The time at which an action or proceeding for foreclosure or forfeiture is commenced for purposes of a provisional appointment of a receiver is clarified. Courts are provided flexibilit y to lengthen or shorten time frames addressed in admi nistering receiverships for good cause. The amount of time a receiver is given to file a sched- ule A: a list of all known creditors and applicable regula- tory and taxing agencies; their mailing addresses; theamount and nature of thei r claims, and whether their claims are disputed; and a schedule B: a list of all propertyof the estate, including liqui dation value, and location of the real property; and a le gal description of any real property, is increased from 20 to 35 days. An additional automatic stay exception is created to permit a petitioning creditor who has commenced foreclo-sure proceedings to obtain appointment of a receiverwithout staying its own pending foreclosure. The term \"perishable proper ty\" is substituted with the term \"property subject to eroding value\" to expand thetypes of property covered. The period in which to prov ide notice to creditors and other interested parties is increased from 20 to 30 days. The number of days over which wages, salaries, or commissions including vaca tion, severance, and sick leave pay, or contributions to an employee benefit plan isincreased from 90 days to 180 days. The dollar amount for allowed unsecured claims arising from consumer depositsfor household purchases is increased $900 to $2425 to bring the amount in line with federal bankruptcy law.

By Senators Swecker, Haugen, King and Shin.Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The 2007-2009 biennial transportation budget directed the Department of Licensing (DOL) to submit to the Legislature draft legislation that streamlinesvehicle and vessel title and registration statutes to specifi-cally address apparent conflicts, fee distribution, and otherrelevant issues that are revenue neutral, and which do notchange legislative policy. SB 6379 was submitted by DOLin 2009, reviewed by legisl ative staff and various stake- holders, and enacted during the 2010 regular legislative session. The enacted 2010 legislation had a delayed effec-tive date of July 1, 2011, in order for the Legislature toconsider a reconciliation bill during the 2011 session cor- recting any technical drafting problems identified over the2010 legislative interim. The Joint Transpor tation Committee (JTC) was direct- ed in the 2010 supplemental transportation budget to workwith DOL, the Code Reviser's Office, legislative staff, andstakeholders to evaluate th e implementation of SB 6379 and provide corrective legisla tion if needed. SB is the recommended draft legisl ation accompanying the JTC evaluation. Summary: Various technical corrections to certain vehi- cle and vessel registration statutes are made as a result of: (1) oversight or error in dr afting SB 6379 from 2010, (2) double amendments made du ring the 2010 legislative sessions, or (3) the recodification from SB 6379.

By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Carrell, Kline, Kohl-Welles, Nelson, Delvin, Tom, Shin, McAuliffe and Kilmer). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: Under current law, a person convicted of animal cruelty in the second degree is guilty of a misde- meanor if the person either knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence inflicts unnecessary suffering or pain upon an animal; fails to prov ide the animal with necessary shelter, rest, sanitation, space, or medical attention, and the animal suffers unnecessary or unjustifiable physical pain as a result of the failure; or abandons the animal. A personis guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the person abandonsthe animal and the animal suff ers bodily harm or there is a substantial risk the animal will suffer great bodily harmdue to the abandonment. If a person is convicted of animal cruelty in the second degree, the court may enter an orderrequiring the owner to forfeit the animal if the court findsthat the animal's treatment was severe or likely to reoccur.If forfeiture is ordered, the owner will be prohibited from owning or caring for any si milar animals for a set period of time. A \"similar animal\" is defined as an animal classified in the same genus. Genus is a biological classification thatgroups organisms with similar characteristics. Summary: Animal cruelty in the second degree is a gross misdemeanor. If a person is co nvicted of animal cruelty in the second degree and the court orders forfeiture of the person's animal, then the pe rson is prohibited from own- ing, caring for, or residing with any similar animals for aset period of time. If a person has no more th an two convictions for ani- mal cruelty in the second de gree, the person may petition the sentencing court for a restoration of his or her right af-ter five years, and the court may consider, among otherthings, whether the person complied with the prohibitionon owning, caring for, or residing with similar animals. Ifa person violates the prohibitio n, that person must pay a $1,000 civil penalty for the first violation and a $2,500 penalty for the second violation. The third and anysubsequent violations will result in gross misdemeanors. Similar animal means (1) for a mammal, another ani- mal that is in the same taxanomic order; or (2) for an ani-mal that is not a mammal, another animal that is in thesame taxonomic class. Food means food or feed ap propriate to the species for which it is intended. Necessary food means the provision at suitable inter- vals of wholesome foodstuff suitable for the animal's ageand species and that is suffic ient to provide a reasonablelevel of nutrition for the anim al and is easily accessible to the animal. Necessary water means wate r that is in sufficient quantity and of appropriate quality for the species forwhich it is intended and that is accessible to the animal. Animal control officers are given the power to issue citations to offenders for civil infractions based on probable cause.

By Senate Committee on Labo r, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally sponsored by Senators Conway, Prentice and Kohl-Welles; by request of Department ofLabor & Industries). Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: Under the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act, the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) has authority to adopt safety and health standardsgoverning the conditions of em ployment in all work plac- es. L&I sets occupational health and safety standards thatare at least as effective as t hose standards adopted by the federal Occupational Safety an d Health Act of 1970. The agency encourages employers and employees to provide safe and healthful working conditions. It also provides forappropriate reporting of working conditions, inspections,training, education, compliance, and input on rules. L&I has authority to inspect an d investigate workplaces and can issue a citation if an em ployer has violated safety or health standards. Citations are in writing, specify the vio- lation, and fix a reasonable time to correct the violation. If a citation has been issued, L& I notifies the employer with- in a reasonable amount of tim e of the penalty to be as- sessed. An employer has 15-working days within whichto notify L&I that the employer intends to appeal the cita-tion or penalty. If no notific ation is made to L&I within the 15-day period, the citatio n and penalty are considered final and cannot be appealed. If L&I determines that an employer has failed to cor- rect a cited violation within the time permitted for correc- tion, L&I notifies the employer of the failure to correct the violation and notifies the employer that it has 15 days tonotify L&I of an intention to appeal the penalty. If no such notification is received by L&I the penalty is consideredfinal and cannot be appealed. However, the period permit-ted in the citation for its correction does not begin to run until a final order is issued in the case of an appeal. Summary: In an application for a stay of abatement, the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) will not grant a stay when it can determine th at the preliminary evidence shows a substantial probability of death or serious physi-cal harm to workers. The Bo ard of Industrial Insurance Appeals will not grant a stay when, based on the prelimi-nary evidence, it is more likel y than not that a stay would result in death or serious physical harm to a worker. L&Iwill initiate rulemaking to im plement this law in 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5070 C 92 L 11 Regarding records requests relating to prevailing wage investigations.

Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: Prevailing wages must be paid to laborers, workers, and mechanics on public works projects. The prevailing wage is the rate of hourly wage, usual benefits, and overtime paid to the majo rity of workers in the same trade or occupation in the largest city in the county wherethe work is performed. The Department of Labor and In- dustries (L&I) administers and enforces state prevailingwage laws, and investigates complaints of violations ofprevailing wage laws or rules.

Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 1998 voters approved I-692 which per- mitted the use of marijuana for ses by qual- ifying patients. The Legisl ature subsequently amended the chapter on medical use of marijuana in 2007 and in 2010. In order to qualify for the use of medical marijuana, patients must have a terminal or debilitating medical con-dition (cancer, HIV , multiple sclerosis, intractable pain,glaucoma, Crohn's disease, hepatitis C, nausea/seizurediseases, or a disease approved by the Medical Quality As- surance Commission) and the diagnosis of this condition must have been made by a health care professional. Pa-tients are not provided arrest protection. Instead, patientsare permitted to assert an affi rmative defense at trial with proof of compliance with the medical marijuana law. Patients may grow medical marijuana for themselves or designate a provider to grow on their behalf. Designat-ed providers may only provid e medical marijuana to one patient at a time. Patients and their designated providersare limited to possession of an amount of marijuana that isnecessary for the patient's personal medical use, and notexceeding 15 plants and 24 ounces of useable marijuana. Summary: Health Care Professionals . In order to pro- vide valid documentation, demonstrating that the patient is a qualifying patient, a health care professional must exam-ine the patient, document the terminal or debilitating med-ical condition of the patient, inform the patient of otheroptions for treating the terminal or debilitating medicalcondition, and document othe r measures attempted to treat the terminal or debilitating medical condition. The healthcare professional may not have a business which consistssolely of authorizing the medical use of cannabis and maynot advertise the medical use of cannabis. Patient Protections . Qualifying patients may assert an affirmative defense, whether or not the patient possessesvalid documentation, if the patient possess no more than the permissible levels of cann abis; the patient exceeds theSenate 46 2House 92 0Senate 48 0House 96 0 (House 48 0 (Senate concurred)E2SSB 5073 246permissible levels of cannabis but is able to establish a medical need for th e additional amounts; and an investi- gating peace officer does not possess evidence of an unli- censed cannabis operation, theft of electrical power, illegaldrugs, frequent visits consistent with commercial activity,violent crime, or that the subj ect of the investigation has an outstanding arrest warrant. Parental rights may not be restricted solely due to the medical use of cannabis unless this results in long-term impairment that interferes with the performance of parent- ing functions. Qualifying pa tients may not be denied an organ transplant solely be cause of the use of medical cannabis. Collective Gardens . Qualifying patients and their des- ignated providers may form co llective gardens to produce cannabis for the medical use of members of the collectivegardens. Collective gardens are limited to ten qualifying patients and a total of 45 plants and 72 ounces of useablecannabis. Designated Providers . Qualifying patients may re- voke a designation of a designat ed provider at any time. A person may stop serving as a designated provider at anytime but may not serve another patient until 15 days have elapsed. Limitations . Health insurers are not required to pro- vide cannabis as a covered benefit. The National Guard isnot required to permit the me dical use of cannabis of its employees. Drug-free work places are permitted and med- ical use of cannabis workplace accommodations are notrequired. Evaluation and Study . The Washington State Institute for Public Policy must conduct a cost-benefit evaluation ofthe act and report its results to the Legislature by July 1, 2014. The University of Wa shington and the Washington State University may conduct scientific research on the ef-ficacy and safety of administering cannabis as part ofmedical treatment. Local Governments . Cities, towns, and counties may adopt zoning requirements, business licensing require- ments, health and safety requirements, and business taxespertaining to the production, processing, or dispensing ofcannabis or cannabis pr oductions within their jurisdictions. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed provisions that would establish a patient registry within the Depart- ment of Health (DOH) and provide arrest protection for those patients who register. Licensing provisions for pro-ducers, processors, and dispensaries were vetoed as well as the section providing current producers and dispensa- ries with an affirmative defen se if they register with the Secretary of State and file a letter of intent with DOH orthe Department of Agriculture (DOA). Also vetoed, arethe sections prohibiting the ad vertising of medical canna- bis and the requirement that the Joint Legislative Auditand Review Committee review the licensing programs if the federal government authorizes the medical use of can- nabis and the requirement th at if expenditures from the Health Professions Account exceed receipts, the amount will be made up by the Gene ral Fund. Housing protections for medical cannabis patients are also vetoed. VETO MESSAGE ON E2SSB 5073 April 29, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 101, 201, 407, 410, 411, 412, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 701, 703, 704, 705, Bill 5073 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to medical use of cannabis.\" In 1998, Washington voters made the compassionate choice to remove the fear of state criminal prosecution for patients who use medical marijuana for debilitati ng or terminal conditions. The voters also provided patients' physicians and caregivers with defenses to state law prosecutions. I fully support the purpose of Initiative 692, and in 2007, I signed legislation that expanded the ability of a patie nt to receive assistance from a designated provid er in the medical use of mari- juana, and added conditions and diseases for which medical marijuana could be used. Today, I have signed sections of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073 that retain the provisions of Initiative 692 and provide additional state law prot ections. Qualifying patients or their designated providers may gr ow cannabis for the patient's use or participate in a co llective garden without fe ar of state law crim- inal prosecutions. Qualifying pat ients or their designated provid- ers are also protected from certain state civil la w consequences. Our state legislature may remove state crim inal and civil penal- ties for activities that assist pe rsons suffering fr om debilitating or terminal conditions. While such ac tivities may violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, states are not required to enforce fed- eral law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. However, absent congressional action, state laws will not protect an individual fr om legal action by the federal government. Qualifying patients and designated providers can evaluate the risk of federal prosecution and make choices for themselves on whether to use or assist another in using medical marijuana. The United States Department of Justice has made the wise decisionnot to use federal resources to pr osecute seriously ill patients who use medical marijuana. However, the sections in Part VI, Part VII, and Part VIII of En- grossed Second Substitute Senat e Bill 5073 would direct employ- ees of the state departments of Health and Agriculture to authorize and license commercial businesses that produce, process or dis- pense cannabis. These s ections would open public employees to federal prosecution, and the Unit ed States Attorneys have made it clear that state law would not pr ovide these individuals safe har- bor from federal prosecution. No state employee should be re- quired to violate federal criminal law in order to fulfill duties under state law. For these reas ons, I have vetoed Sections 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 705, 803, 804, 805, and 807 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. In addition, there are a number of sections of Engr ossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073 that ar e associated with or dependent upon these licensing sections. Section 201 sets forth definitions ofterms. Section 412 adds protec tions for licensed producers,Senate 29 20 House 54 43 (House amended)Senate 27 21 (Senate concurred)SB 5076 247processors and dispense rs. Section 901 requires the Department of Health to develop a secure re gistration system for licensed pro- ducers, processors and dispensers. Section 1104 would require a review of the necessity of the cannabis production and dispensing system if the federal government were to authorize the use of can- nabis for medical purposes. Sec tion 1201 applies to dispensaries in current operation in the interi m before licensure, and Section 1202 exempts documents filed under Section 1201 from disclosure. Section 1203 requires the department of health to report certain information related to implementa tion of the vetoed sections. Be- cause I have vetoed the licensin g provisions, I have also vetoed Sections 201, 412, 901, 1104, 1201, 1202 and 1203 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. Section 410 would require owners of housing to allow the use of medical cannabis on thei r property, putting them in potential con- flict with federal law. For this re ason, I have vetoed Section 410 of Engrossed Second Substi tute Senate Bill 5073. Section 407 would permit a nonres ident to engage in the medi- cal use of cannabis using docume ntation or authorization issued under other state or territorial laws. This section would not re- quire these other state or territorial laws to meet the same stan- dards for health care professi onal authorization as required by Washington law. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 407 of Engrossed Second Substi tute Senate Bill 5073. Section 411 would provide that a court may permit the medical use of cannabis by an offender, and exclude it as a ground for find-ing that the offender has violat ed the conditions or requirements of the sentence, deferr ed prosecution, stipul ated order of continu- ance, deferred disposition or disp ositional order. The correction agency or department responsible for the person's supervision is in the best position to evaluate an individual 's circumstances and medical use of cannabis. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 411 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. I am approving Section 1002, which authorizes studies and medical guidelines on the appropriate administration and use ofcannabis. Section 1206 would make Section 1002 effective Janu- ary 1, 2013. I have vetoed Secti on 1206 to provide the discretion to begin efforts at an earlier date. Section 1102 sets forth local go vernments' author ity pertaining to the production, processing or dispensing of cannabis or canna- bis products within their jurisdic tions. The provisions in Section 1102 that local governments' zoning requirements cannot \"pre- clude the possibility of siting licensed dispensers within the juris- diction\" are without meaning in li ght of the vetoes of sections providing for such licensed dispensers. It is with thisunderstanding that I ap prove Section 1102. I have been open, and remain open, to legislation to exempt qualifying patients and their designa ted providers from state crim- inal penalties when they join in nonprofit cooperative organiza- tions to share responsibility for producing, processing and dispensing cannabis for medical use. Such exemption from state criminal penalties should be condi tioned on compliance with local government location and health and safety specifications. I am also open to legislation t hat establishes a secure and con- fidential registration system to pr ovide arrest and seizure protec- tions under state law to qualifying patients and those who assist them. Unfortunately, the provisions of Section 901 that would pro- vide a registry for qualifying pa tients and designated providers be- ginning in January 2013 are intertwined with requirements forregistration of licensed commer cial producers, processors and dispensers of cannabis. Conseque ntly, I have vetoed section 901 as noted above. Section 101 sets fo rth the purpose of the registry, and Section 902 is conti ngent on the registry. Without a registry, these sections are not meaningful . For this reason, I have vetoed Sections 101 and 902 of Engrosse d Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073. I am not vetoing Sections 402 or 406, which establish affir- mative defenses for a qualifying patient or designated provider who is not registered with the re gistry established in section 901. Because these sections govern th ose who have not registered, this section is meaningful even though section 901 has been vetoed. With the exception of Sectio ns 101, 201, 407, 410, 411, 412, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 704, 705, d Second Substitute Senate Bill 5073 is approved.

By Senators Hobbs, Benton, Prentice, Keiser, Haugen, Tom, Shin, Kline and Roach; by request of Department ofFinancial Institutions. Senate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Background: In 2007 the Washington State Supreme Court (Court) held that a search of personal banking re- cords by the Department of Financial Institutions (Depart- ment) without a judicially issued warrant or subpoenaviolated Article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitu-tion ( State v. Miles , 160 Wn. 2d 236). Article I, section 7 states that \"[n]o person shall be disturbed in his private af-fairs . . . without authority of law.\" The Court invalidated the Department's statute to the extent it authorized the De-partment to issue subpoenas to third parties for otherwise private information not relate d to the regulated business activities. In 2010 legislation was enacted (SHB 2789) establish- ing a process for the Department of Labor & Industries,the Employment Security Department, and the Depart-ment of Revenue to seek judicial approval of a subpoenain advance of its issuance. Summary: The Legislature intends to provide a process for the Department to apply for court approval of an agen- cy investigative subpoena wh ere the agency seeks approv- al, or where court approval is required by law or Article I,section 7 of the state Constitution. The Director, or authorized assistants, of the Depart- ment may apply for and obtain a superior court order au-thorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance. Theapplication must state that an order is sought pursuant to the authority granted; specify documents, records, evi- dence, or testimony; and include a declaration under oath that an investigation is bei ng conducted for a lawfully au- thorized purpose and that the documents, records, evi-dence, or testimony are reasonably related to aninvestigation within the Department's authority. Wherethe application is made to the satisfaction of the court, the court must issue an order approving the subpoena. Noprior notice to any person is required.

By Ericksen, Shin, Hewitt, Sheldon, Roach and Benton. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. The B&O tax is im- posed on the gross receipts from all business activities conducted within the state w ithout any deduction for the costs of doing business. Thus , the nature of the B&O tax is that of a pyramiding tax as each successive sale is sub-ject to the tax on the gross proceeds of the sale. A businessmay have more than one B&O tax rate, depending on thetypes of activities conducted. The tax rate for most types of businesses that provide services is 1.8 percent. Currently, provisions in law allow originating brokers and cooperating brokers to pay the B&O tax only on theirshare of a commission when they both participate in a transaction. However, other real estate offices are alsosubject to the B&O tax on their share of a commission paidfrom either the originating real estate office's commissionor the cooperating real estate office's commission. Thus,when referral fees are paid to a third-party broker or whenmultiple cooperating brokers are involved in a transaction, the paying broker does not get to deduct the fee and therecipient must also pay the B&O tax on the fee. Additionally, real estate agents or associate brokers are not subject to the B&O tax where the brokerage officehas paid the tax on the gross commission. Summary: Any real estate firm who receives a commis- sion at the time of closing on a real estate transaction must pay the B&O tax only upon th eir respective shares of the commission. Terms and definitions are updated to be consistent with real estate licensing laws. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed section 3 which would have made the act apply both prospectively and retroactively. VETO MESSAGE ON SB 5083 May 12, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 3, Senate Bill 5083 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to clarifying that the basis for business and occupation tax for real es tate firms is the commission amount received by each real es tate firm involved in a transaction.\"Senate Bill 5083 provides that wh en a real estate commission on a particular transaction is divided among real estate firms at the closing of the transaction, each fi rm must pay the tax only upon its respective share. Section 3 would apply this act both prospectively and retroac- tively. The retroactive application of the bill would reward delin- quent taxpayers while those who paid on time would not receive a refund under the prohibition on the gift of state funds in Article VIII, Section 5 of the Washington Constitution, as interpreted by the Washington Supreme Court. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 3 of Senate Bill 5083. With the exception of Secti on 3, Senate Bill 5083 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O.

JRA does notifythe Division of Developmen tal Disabilities (DDD) when a youth with developmental disabilities is to be released inorder to determine whether that youth is eligible to receive any services provided by DDD. Summary: Within available resources, a workgroup is es- tablished to address issues rela ting to juveniles with devel- opmental disabilities who ar e confined in juvenile detention or correctional facilities. The workgroup is to be chaired by representatives of the Developmental Disabili- ties Council (DDC) and the Washington Association of Ju-venile Court Administrators (WAJCA) and arepresentative of JRA. The following are members of theworkgroup: a representative of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs; a representative of the Division of Developmental Disabilities within DSHS; a representative of Disability Rights Washington; a representative of the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction; consumer advocates; a representative of the Washington State Defenders Association; and representatives of other interested organizations as identified by the DDC, WA JCA, and JRA, including parents of developmentally disabled youth. By December 1, 2011, the workgroup is to develop recommendations and report to the appropriate commit- tees of the Legislature relating to the following: How to expeditiously re view and determine eligibil- ity for developmental disab ility services provided by DSHS before a juvenile is released from detention or a correctional facility. The appropriate role for DSHS in providing potential confinement alternatives for persons with develop- mental disabilities, and consultation and technical assistance to juvenile faciliti es in their efforts to pro- vide reasonable accommod ations for persons with developmental disabilities co nfined in their facilities or institutions. The fiscal impact to DSHS of provid- ing consultation and technical assistance must beincluded with th is recommendation. How to increase the appropriate use of the court's authority under RCW 13.40 to order secureconfinement alternatives. The establishment of new options under Title 13 RCW to divert juveniles with developmental disabili-ties from the justice system while maintaining public safety. The feasibility of de veloping and adopting law enforcement training for r esponding to juveniles with developmental disabilities similar to the crisis inter-vention training currently provided to law enforce- ment officer responding to alleged criminal behavior by persons with mental illness. The feasibility of adopting standardized statewide screening and application practices and formsdesigned to facilitate the ap plication by juveniles who are likely to qualify for medical assistance services by the DDD within DSHS. The feasibility and need for developing a screening tool and training for juvenile justice staff to be used to identify persons with de velopmental disabilities. By September 1, 2012, if recommended, the workgroup is to develop the following: a simple screening tool that can be used by juvenile detention and correctional facilities as part of theirintake and classification syst em to help identify juve- niles with the most common types of developmental disability; a model policy for the use of the screening tool;Senate 44 0 House 91 5ESSB 5098 250 a cost-effective means to provide concise training to juvenile detention, corrections and probation, and parole staff on the use of the tool; information on best practices and training regarding appropriate accommodations for developmentallydisabled persons during their confinement; and a practical guide for fam ilies and juvenile justice staff that has comprehensive information about programsand services available to developmentally disabled youth who are referred to the juvenile justice system. The workgroup expires on January 1, 2013. Votes on Final Passage: VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5097 May 10, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval, Substitute Senate Bill 5097 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to juveniles with de velopmental disabilities who are in correctional detention cent ers, juvenile correction institutions or facilities, and jails.\" This bill would establish a work group to address issues relating to juveniles with developmental disabilities who are confined in juvenile detention or correctional facilities. The work group would be required to report to the Legisl ature by December 1, 2011, with recommendations concerning speci fic topics related to juveniles with developmental dis abilities and the juven ile justice system. If recommended by the work group, a screening tool and related ma- terials would be devel oped by September 1, 2012, to assist juvenile detention and correction institutions and facilities in identification of offenders with the most common types of developmental disabilities. The work group w ould expire on January 1, 2013. I support the intent behind this bill, but not the process estab- lished. As I have stated many time s, I believe that, in most cases, work groups that are charged with making recommendations on policy objectives should not be crea ted in statute. However, devel- opment of the information and recommendations outlined in thebill would be useful to executiv e agencies and the Legislature. The Washington Developmental Disabi lities Council has indicated it would participate in the work group and underwrite related costswith monies allocated from federa l funds. I am confident the Wash- ington Developmental Dis abilities Council will be able to coordi- nate with the parties listed in the bill and accomplish the tasks outlined without a statute. Repres entatives of the Juvenile Reha- bilitation Administration have indi cated a willingne ss to partici- pate in a work group established by the WashingtonDevelopmental Dis abilities Council. For this reason, I have vetoed Substitute Senate Bill 5097 in its entirety. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire GovernorESSB 5098 C 173 L 11 Exempting personal informa tion from public inspection and copying. By Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections (originally sponsored by Senators Carrell and Chase). Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Background: The Public Records Act (PRA) requires that all state and local govern ment agencies make all pub- lic records available for pub lic inspection an d copying un- less they fall within certain statutory exemptions. The provisions requiring public records disclosure must be in-terpreted liberally while the exemptions are interpreted narrowly to effectuate the general policy favoringdisclosure. Summary: The personal informatio n for a participant in a public or non-profit program serving or pertaining to children, adolescents, or stud ents, including but not limit- ed to early learning or child care services, parks and recre-ation programs, youth develo pment programs, and after- school programs is exempt from public inspection andcopying under the Public Reco rds Act. Personal informa- tion includes, but is not lim ited to, addresses, telephone numbers, personal e-mail addresses, social securitynumbers, emergency contact and date of birth information Emergency contact inform ation may be provided to appropriate authorities and medical personnel for the pur-pose of treating the indivi dual during an emergency situation.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESSB 5105 C 94 L 11 Addressing the conditional release of persons committed as criminally insane to their county of origin. By Senate Committee on Hu man Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Carrell, Conway, Stevens, Schoesler, Becker and Shin).Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: A defendant who pleads not guilty by rea- son of insanity may be found criminally insane by a court or jury. The court or jury mu st find that, due to a mentalSenate 49 0House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 1House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 45 1 (Senate concurred)SSB 5115 251disease or defect, the defendant was unable at the time of the offense to perceive the na ture and quality of his or her actions or was unable to perc eive that those actions were wrong. A defendant who has been found criminally insane may be committed to a state ho spital if the court or jury finds that the defendant is a danger to public safety or pres-ents a substantial likelihood of committing further crimi- nal acts. The length of treatment is up to the maximumterm for which the defendant could have been sentenced if convicted of the underlying crime. A patient who is committed to the state hospital as criminally insane may petitio n at least once every six months for conditional release. The state hospital must re- view this petition and forward it to the superior court in the county where the patient wa s committed with a recom- mendation as to whether or not the petition should begranted. If the hospital supp orts the petition, it must de- scribe the conditions under which it believes release maybe appropriate. Summary: The state hospital may not support a petition for conditional release for a patient committed as criminal- ly insane except under the condition th at the patient must reside in the patient's county of origin, which means the county which ordered the co mmitment. An exception is available if the state hospital determines that the county of origin would be inappropriate considering any court-is- sued protection orders, victim safety concerns, the avail- ability of appropriate treatmen t, negative influences on the person, or the location of family or other persons or orga-nizations offering support to the patient. When a state hos- pital assists in developing a placement which is outside of the county of origin, and there are two or more options forplacement, it must endeavor to develop the placement in amanner that does not have a disproportionate effect on asingle county.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5115 C 36 L 11 Concerning private transfer fee obligations. By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Harper, Pflug, Kline, Roach, Carrell andKilmer). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: Covenants are formal agreements or prom- ises between individuals. Co venants may be used to en- sure the execution or prevention of an action. A covenant for a title is a covenant that binds the person conveying theproperty to ensure the completeness, security, andcontinuance of the title transferred. A private transfer fee is a form of covenant that is at- tached to real property by the owner and requires payment of a fee upon each resale of the property. The fee typicallyis paid to an identified third pa rty, such as the property de- veloper or its trustee, is ofte n calculated as a percentage of the property's sales price, and can survive for a specified period of years. It is reported that up to 19 other states have a full or partial ban on private transfer fees. Summary: A private transfer fee is defined. Certain fees and taxes are expressly exclud ed from the definition of a private transfer fee and includ e: real estate broker com- missions, rent, taxes and fees imposed by a governmentalentity, and home owner association fees. Future Transfer Fee Obligations . A private transfer fee recorded or entered into in this state on or after the ef-fective date of this act does not run with the title to realproperty and is not binding or enforceable at law or in eq-uity. A private transfer fee that is recorded on or after theeffective date of this act is void and unenforceable. Any person who records, or enters into, an agreement imposing a private transfer fee in the person's favor afterthe effective date of this section is liable for any damagesresulting from the imposi tion of the fee. Existing Transfer Fee Obligations . A private transfer fee obligation recorded before the effective date of this section is not presumed vali d and enforceable. Any pri- vate transfer fee must be in terpreted and enforced accord- ing to specified principles of applicable real estate law, contract law, and co mmon law principles. For private transfer fees im posed prior to the effective date of this bill, the person or entity who claims the rightto collect a private transfer fee must record a separate doc-ument with the county before December 31, 2011. Thedocument must include spec ified information about the private transfer fee. If the no tice is not filed as required, then the private transfer fee obligation is null and void and the real property must be conveyed free and clear from thefee.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 13, 2011Senate 49 0 House 90 6 Senate 48 0House 93 0SB 5116 252SB 5116 C 37 L 11 Concerning public health dist rict authority as it relates to gifts, grants, conveyances, bequests, and devises of real or personal property. By Senators Swecker, Hatfield and Parlette.Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on Local Government Background: The enabling legislatio n for public hospital districts (PHD) was enacted in 1945. PHDs are special purpose districts. They are created by a process that be-gins either by petition of 10 percent of the voters in the proposed district, or by resolu tion of the county legislative authority. In either case, crea tion of the district requires a hearing and a simple majority vo te of the voters of the pro- posed district with the total votes cast being more than 40 percent of the total number of votes cast in the proposeddistrict at the preceding state general election. A PHD may be county-wide, less than county-wide, or encompass an area lying in more than one county. In noevent may the boundaries divide any existing precinctboundaries or voting precincts. Governance is by a board of three, five, or seven com- missioners who must be registered voters residing in thecommissioner district from wh ich they are elected. V oters of the entire PHD may vote at a primary or general elec-tion to elect the commissioners of their respectivecommissioner districts. PHDs are junior taxing districts. Besides regular property taxes of up to $0.75 per $1,000 of assessed valu-ation, excess property taxes may be levied by a vote of the voters of the PHD. PHDs also have the authority to contract or join with any other PHD, corporations, individuals, or others to pro-vide health care services. This may be accomplished byestablishing a nonprofit corpora tion or other legal entity of the PHD's choosing. Summary: PHDs may solicit and accept gifts of personal or real property; sell, invest or spend the proceeds from the gifts; and enter into contracts with for-profit or nonprofitorganizations for these purpos es, including, but not limit- ed to, contracts for the use of the PHD's facilities, property,personnel, or services.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SB 5117 C 95 L 11 Concerning the population restrictions for a geographic area to qualify as a rural public hospital district.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senators Keiser and Kline; by request of Insurance Commissioner).Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The federal Patient Pr otection and Afford- ability Care Act (PPACA), p assed in March 2010, includes a number of provisions that impact medical insurance plans or insurance carriers. A number of provisions have early implementation dates, so me are effective for policies issued on or after September 23, 2010. The state insurance statutes codified in Title 48 RCW, which apply to regulated insurance carriers, need modifi-cation to reflect the federal re quirements that are in place now. The early implementatio n insurance changes include extending coverage to dependen ts to age 26 for all plans that offer dependent coverage ; elimination of lifetime ben- efit maximums; prohibition of rescission of coverage;elimination of pre-existing condition waiting period for persons under 19; coverage changes for emergencyservices; enhanced consum er information including appeals requirements; and reporting of medical loss ratios(the percent of premium spent on medical expenses) witha requirement for rebates to enrollees triggered by certain medical loss ratios. Summary: The state insurance statutes are modified to reflect the PPACA insurance provisions with early imple-mentation. Coverage for depe ndents is extended to age 26. Lifetime benefit maximums are removed. Policies forpersons under 19 may not in clude pre-existing condition exclusions. Federal definitions are inserted for adverse benefit de- termination, final external review decision, and final inter-nal adverse benefit determ ination and grandfathered health plan. The grievance process required for each plan may re- flect differences for grandfathered health plans andapproval of HHS. Independent reviews of appeals must be completed by an organization that does not have a conflict of interest. Enrollees must have at least five business days to submit additional information to the independent re view organi- zation. The independent review organization must for- ward any additional informatio n within one business day. A benefit decision must be provided within 45 days of therequest for external review. Expedited review must be completed within 72 hours. The rate information for in dividual health benefit plans is modified to remove the calculation of the remit- tance to the high risk pool th at is based on the declination rate (rate of declining appli cants due to health screening), to ensure health insurance carriers do not pay the currentremittance and the new federal rebate to enrollees that istriggered if the individual plan's medial loss ratio is lessthan 80 percent. The remittance calculation is removedeffective January 1, 2012. Changes are made for the Washington State Health In- surance Pool, removing the lifetime maximum on benefitsof $2 million, extending depe ndents eligibility to age 26, and allowing the pool to wa ive the recertification of the standard health questionnaire and the rebidding of the poolif the program is discontinue d during the 36-month review cycle. Health care sharing ministries are not health carriers or insurers under our state insurance laws, and must followthe definition of health care sharing ministries provided infederal law in the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC Sec 5000A).Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 34 15 House 69 28 Senate 45 4House 63 32 (House amended) Senate 44 2 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5124 254ESSB 5124 C 10 L 11 Modifying elections by mail provisions.

Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Background: As early as 1915, a voter was allowed to cast an absentee ballot if the voter was not able to be pres- ent to vote at the polls on elec tion day. In 1933 voters with disabilities and voters over th e age of 65 were authorized to vote via absentee ballot. In 1967 a county auditor could designate a mail ballot precinct if the precinct had less than100 registered voters. By 1974 the Legislature expandedabsentee voting to all voters who made a request, and by1993 those voters could reques ted to vote absentee on an ongoing basis. In 2005 coun ty auditors were allowed to conduct all elections entire ly by mail ballot with the approval of the county legislative authority. Presently, all counties, excep t Pierce County, conduct elections entirely by mail. Summary: All counties must conduct all elections entire- ly by mail ballot. Any county auditor that maintained poll site voting must notify each re gistered poll voter that all future primary, general, and special elections will be conducted by mail. County auditors are required to open a voting center in the county auditor's office that must be open during busi- ness hours during the voting period. The voting period be-gins 18 days before and ends at 8 p.m. on the day of anelection. The voting center must provide voter registrationmaterials, replacement ballots , provisional ballots, disabil- ity access voting devices, sample ballots, instructions onhow to vote the ballot, a ballot drop box, and voters'pamphlets, if published. The voting center must be accessible to persons with disabilities and must provide at least one voting unit that provides access to individuals who are blind or visuallyimpaired. Persons wishing to vote at a voting center must either sign a ballot declaration or pr ovide identification. A voter who has already returned a ballot but requests to vote at avoting center must be issued a provisional ballot. The pro- visional ballot will not be counted if the canvassing boardfinds that the voter's regular ballot has been returned and the voter has already been credited with voting. Determinations of precinct size are changed from not more than 900 active registered poll voters to a maximumof 1500 active registered voters. Reference to polls, poll site voting, poll books, poll lists, precinct polling places, poll site ballot countingdevices, absentee voting, precinct election officers, andinspectors and judges of elections are removed. Statutes relating to precin ct and polling place determi- nation and accessibility, absentee voting, polling placeelections and poll workers, disability access voting, votingby mail, canvassing, casting a vote at a polling site, dutiesof election officers in securing unused ballots at pollingsites, and crimes and penalties are repealed.

Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Background: Unemployment Insurance Taxes . The total amount of unemployment insurance (UI) contributions or taxes paid by an employer in cludes an experience rated tax and a social tax. The experience rated tax is determinedbased on an employer's layo ff experience and falls into one of 40 rate classes. The social tax component coverssocial costs, or costs resu lting from the payment of bene- fits to an individual that are not charged to a specific em-ployer. The social tax is calculated using the flat socialcost factor, which is graduated for each employer based onthe employer's rate class. Employers in rate class 1 haveno layoff experience and only pay a social tax, which was0.95 percent in 2010 and was in itially calculated to be 1.33 percent in 2011. The total ta x rate is capped at 6 percent, and in 2010 employers in rate classes 35 through 40capped out. Extended Benefits Program . An individual who has exhausted his or her regular unemployment benefits andemergency unemployment compensation benefits can re-ceive up to 20 additional weeks of benefits under the ex-tended benefits program. The extended benefits programtriggers on during periods of high unemployment whenunemployment rates hit certain levels as compared to rates in a two-year look back period. The first 13 weeks of ex-tended benefits trigger on when the unemployment rateaverages at least 6.5 percent ov er the last three months and is at least 10 percent higher than the same three month av- erage in either of the previous two years. The remainingseven weeks of extended benefits trigger on when theSenate 26 23 House 52 43SB 5141 255unemployment rate averages at least 8 percent and is 10 percent higher than in either of the previous two years. Washington triggered on the first 13 weeks in February2009 and the remaining seven weeks in May 2009. Ex-tended benefits are expected to trigger off in the spring of 2011, as the two-year look back will include unemployment rates from 2009 and 2010. Extended benefit costs are generally shared equally by the state and federal government; however, the federalgovernment has paid the full cost of extended benefits since Washington triggered on in 2009. The federal TaxRelief, Unemployment Insura nce Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 authorized the federal govern-ment to continue to pay the full cost of extended benefits through 2011, provided the extended benefits programdoesn't trigger off. The federal legislation authorizedstates to use a three-year look back in 2011 rather than a two-year look back to prevent the extended benefitsprogram from triggering off. Eligibility Periods . For an individual who is in the training benefits program, training benefits are payable forup to two years beyond the end of the benefit year of theregular claim. For an individual who is e ligible for emergency unem- ployment compensation, the eligibility period for extend-ed benefits is defined as the period consisting of the weekending February 28, 2009, through the week ending May29, 2010. Summary: Unemployment Insurance Taxes . For rate year 2011, the flat social cost factor is capped at 1.22 per- cent, and the graduated rate is lowered for employers in rate classes 1 through 20 (from 78 percent through 120 percent to 40 percent through 116 percent). Consequently,the total 2011 UI tax rate for employers in rate classes 1through 34 will be lowered, and employers in rate classes35 through 40 will cap out at 6 percent. Extended Benefits Program . For 2011 the two-year look-back period used to de termine whether extended ben- efits are paid is changed to a three-year look-back period. Eligibility Periods . The period during which training benefits are payable is extend ed. For individuals who are eligible for extended benefits because of the three-yearlook-back period, training benefits are payable for up tothree years beyond the end of the benefit year of theregular claim. The eligibility period for exte nded benefits is also ex- tended through 2011. The elig ibility period consists of the week ending February 28, 2009, and applies as providedunder the federal Tax Relief, Unemployment InsuranceReauthorization, and Job Creatio n Act of 2010, as it exist- ed on December 17, 2010, or a subsequent date providedby the Employment Security Department by rule.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: February 11, 2011 SB 5141 C 246 L 11 Limiting the issuance of moto rcycle instruction permits.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Sena tors Pflug, Keiser and Kohl-Welles).Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Naturopathic medici ne practice involves diagnosing, treating, and preventing physical disorders by stimulating or supporting the natural processes of the hu- man body. This practice can include manual manipula-tion, the use of nutrition and food science, physicalmodalities, homeopathy, naturopathic medicines, nondrugcontraceptive devices, and common diagnosticprocedures. A naturopath using physical modalities uses physical, chemical, electrical, and other noninvasive modalities, in-cluding heat, cold, air, light, water, sound, massage, andtherapeutic exercises. Summary: The definition of physical modalities is mod- ified by removing the lim itation to noninvasive modali- ties.

By Senate Committee on Econ omic Development, Trade & Innovation (originally spons ored by Senators Murray, Prentice, White, Swecker, Delvin, Kohl-Welles and Shin).Senate Committee on Economic Development, Trade & Innovation House Committee on Comm unity Development & Housing Background: Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ) were created in the United States (U.S.) to provide special customs proce- dures to U.S. manufacturers engaged in internationaltrade-related activitie s. Duty-free treatment is accorded to items that are processed in FTZs and then re-exported;duty payment is deferred on items until they exit the FTZ for sale in the U.S. market. There is no time limit on goodsstored inside an FTZ and certain foreign and domesticmerchandise held in FTZs may be exempt from state andlocal inventory taxes. FTZs are divided into general-purpose zones (GPZ) and subzones. The FTZ Board accepts and reviews appli-cations for both. State or local governments, port authori-ties, nonprofit organizations, or economic developmentagencies typically sponsor GPZs . GPZs involve public fa- cilities that can be used by more than one firm, and aremost commonly ports or industrial parks used by small tomedium-sized businesses for warehousing/distributionand some processing/assembly. Subzones are sponsoredby GPZs but usually involve a single firm site used formore extensive manufacturing/processing or warehous-ing/distribution, which cannot easily be accomplished in aGPZ. FTZs were first authorized under Washington law in 1977. Currently, there are 13 GPZs and five sub-zones op-erational across the state from Seattle to Spokane, in-volved in the manufacturin g of products from boats to consumer electronics. Summary: New authority is granted to port districts con- cerning FTZs subject to the approval of the U.S. A port district is authorized to esta blish, operate, and maintain an FTZ within its district and on property adjacent to butoutside its district, if the prop erty is beyond the boundaries of any other FTZ grantee and it is not currently designated as a FTZ.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5167 C 174 L 11 Concerning tax statute clarifications and technical correc- tions, including for the purpos es of local rental car taxes. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Schoesler, Murray, Honeyford,Pridemore, Kilmer and Tom). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Technical errors may develop in the tax code in the course of on-goi ng statutory enactment and amendment. For example, le gislation frequ ently includes statutory references to link new laws or amendments to ex- isting definitions or related st atutory provisions. If chang- es are subsequently made to these statutes, the references may become incorrect. Also, when statutes include provi- sions tied to expiration dates, they may later become obso-lete for purposes of any statutory references. Further,instances may arise when statutory sections have beenamended more than once during a legislative session, each without reference to the other; when these amendmentscannot be merged, double amendments result. Summary: A subsection reference is added to the service and other activities business and occupation (B&O) tax rate to clarify that the tax rate does not apply to anyactivity taxed under the inte rnational services B&O rate. The word \"common\" is deleted from the definition of \"affiliated\" in the B&O tax pr ovision that provides an ex- emption of amounts received by a financial institution from an affiliated person. This change makes the defini-tions related to affiliated en tities consistent throughout the excise-tax code. References and definitions in the Food Stamp Pro- gram are updated in the sales and use tax chapters toreflect current law. In the Property Tax Relief Program for Low-Income Seniors and Disabled Persons, two changes are made: (1)eligibility requirements for di sabled veterans are modified to reflect federal definitions of service-connected disabili- ty; and (2) a section requiring notice to taxpayers ischanged to reflect less frequ ent program participant re- newal filing, which was changed in 2010 from every six toevery four years. Senate 41 4House 91 5 (House amended)Senate 42 6 (Senate concurred)Senate 49 0House 91 4SSB 5168 258Part II of the bill updates statutory references due to legislative activity from th e 2010 regular legislative session. Part III codifies a single version of statutes relating to aluminum smelters with multiple amendments that could not be merged as a result of legislation enacted in the 2010 regular legislative session an d the 2010 first special ses- sion. It also combines multiple amendments to the annualsurvey provisions. Part IV combines two statutory provisions relating to the subpoena of tax records, documents, or testimony. The act removes the requirement that 75 percent of the receipts from the local 1 percen t tax on car rentals must be used for three of the four st atutory purposes permitted: to acquire, construct, maintain, or operate a public sports sta-dium; to pay for services incidental to a public sports sta-dium facility; and to pay debt service for the construction of a public sports stadium facility. The fourth statutorypurpose for which tax receipts may be used is for youth or amateur sport activities or facilities. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 July 1, 2012 (Section 206) SSB 5168 C 96 L 11 Reducing maximum sentences for gross misdemeanors by one day. By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Prentice, Kline, Regala, Chase andKohl-Welles). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: Under current law, a gross misdemeanor is punishable by not more than on e year in the county jail, or by a fine of not more than $5,000 or by both imprisonmentand fine. Under federal law, state an d local criminal convictions and sentences can affect a non citizen defendant's immigra- tion status in various ways . Federal immigration law counts the total sentence, in cluding both days suspended and days actually served in determining whether a personmay be deported. This mean s that a noncitizen defendant who is convicted of certain crimes and, for example, issentenced to serve five days in jail, with 360 days suspend- ed, would have a one-year sentence as interpreted by im-migration law. Some deportation grounds are triggerednot just by the type of crime, but also based on whether the sentence imposed for the crime is one year or more, in- cluding suspended time. Th is means that a noncitizendefendant, who could be a refugee and a lawful permanentresident, could face automatic deportation for a gross mis-demeanor offense based solely on the receipt of a 365-daysuspended sentence. This re mains true despite whether the person served very little or , in some cases, no jail time for the sentence. Summary: A gross misdemeanor is punishable by up to 364 days in the county jail or by a fine of not more than$5,000 or by both imprisonment and fine.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5170 C 43 L 11 Increasing the number of judges to be elected in Grant county.

Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: Under current law, Grant County is permit- ted to elect two district court judges. Pursuant to RCW 3.34.020(5)(a), \"[c]hanges in the number of district courtjudges may only be made by the Legislature in a year inwhich the quadrennial election for district court judges isnot held.\" Furthermore, a re quest for additional district court judges must go throug h the Administrator for the Courts, under the supervision of the Supreme Court,which then conducts a workload analysis and makes a rec-ommendation to the Legislature. The Administrator forthe Courts has found that although Grant County has twoelected judges and one full-time court commissioner, it has a need of 3.3 judges. Summary: Three district court judges may be elected in Grant County.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 46 1 House 95 1Senate 45 3House 93 2 Senate 47 0 House 92 12ESSB 5171 2592ESSB 5171 C 349 L 11 Facilitating voting for servi ce and overseas voters. By Senate Committee on Government Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections (originally sponsored by SenatorsHobbs, Roach, Swecker, Pridemore, Shin, King, Kilmer,Hill, Keiser and McAuliffe; by request of Secretary of State).

Overseas voter is de- fined as any voter of the state outside the territorial limits of the United States. For regular mail-in elections and for absentee ballots, state law requires that ballots must be mailed at least 18days before a primary, special, or general election. Thistime period is 30 days for overseas and military voters. In order for a ballot to be counted, it must be post- marked no later than election day and must reach the coun-ty auditor by the last day provided for certification of theelection results. For primary and special elections, thecounty canvassing board must certify the results by the 15th day after election day. For general elections, the timeperiod is 21 days. An overseas or service voter may fax a voted ballot and the accompanying envelo pe if the voter agrees to waive secrecy. These voters may also obtain a ballot viaelectronic mail (e-mail) which may be printed, voted, and returned by postal mail. A faxed or electronically sent bal-lot may only be counted if it is mailed and received beforecertification of the election. The federal Military and Overseas Empowerment Act (Act) requires that ballots for overseas and service votersbe sent 45 days before an el ection for federal office. The Act also requires that those vo ters be provided additional options for receiving ballots an d that ballot instructions in- clude contact information for the auditor's office to con- firm that the voter's ballot was received. Service and overseas voters may register to vote, request a ballot, ortransmit a ballot using forms an d methods provided by the U.S. Department of Defense or the U.S. ElectionAssistance Commission. Summary: No distinction is made between mail ballots, absentee ballots and ballots with all being referred to as ballots. Counting back from the date of the general election, the primary date is two weeks earlier; candidate filing forthe primary begins three week s earlier; overseas and mili- tary ballots are mailed two weeks earlier for the generalelection and four weeks earlier for the primary. The county canvassing board has one less day to cer- tify the primary election and, to be counted, ballots mustbe received the day before canvassing ends, or two daysearly. To be counted, ballo ts for the general election must be received the day before canvassing ends, or one dayearly. Other changes in deadlines and dates in the electioncycle are made. The act provides for: the appeal periods for local redistricting plans based on the decennial census; the timing of filing periods and elections to fill unexpired terms in state and federal partisan offices; the rules for allowing service and overseas voters to return ballots by email or facsimile; and the timing of changes to precincts. Provisions regarding vacancies and voids in candidacy are clarified. The service and overseas voter must be provided with instructions and a secrecy co versheet for returning their voted ballot and signed declaration by fax or e-mail.Waiver of secrecy is not re quired. The county auditor must use established procedures to maintain the secrecy ofthe voted ballot. Several conflicting and outda ted sections are repealed.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators White, Tom, Hill, Zarelli, Murray, Ericksen, Prentice, Hobbs and Nelson). Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 1969 the Legislature established the Council on Higher Education (CHE). During the six years of CHE's existence it took most of its cues from the Leg-islature. Though the Legislature only gave the board lim-ited statutory authority, the board was widely viewed asone of the strongest in the country given its legislative backing. The CHE became the Council for Postsecondary Edu- cation (CPE) in 1975 when federal legislation required states to establish or designate a single state postsecondaryeducation planning agency to qualify for federal planningand other funds. There were several changes: (1) the membership of the CPE was reorganized; (2) its adminis-trative responsibilities with respect to such programs as fi-nancial aid increased; and (3) the board's capacity to consider and debate higher education matters wasenhanced. The Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) was established in 1985 and replaced the CPE. The statedpurpose of the HECB is to provide planning, coordination,monitoring, and policy analysis for higher education in thestate in cooperation and consu ltation with the institutions,autonomous governing boards and with all other segmentsof postsecondary education, including but not limited tothe State Board for Community and Technical Colleges(SBCTC). It is a ten member board that is charged withrepresenting the broad public interest above the interests of the individual colle ges and universities. Major functions of the HECB include: (1) developing a statewide strategic master plan for higher education; (2)recommending policies to en hance the availability, quali- ty, efficiency, and accountability of public higher educa- tion in Washington; (3) administering student financialassistance programs; (4) serving as an advocate on behalfof students and the overall system of higher education; (5)coordinating with other governing boards and institutionsto create a seamless system of public education for the cit-izens of Washington; and (6) helping families save forcollege. Mandated HECB responsibilities include reviewing, evaluating, and making recommendations on operatingand capital budget requests; recommending legislation af-fecting higher education; recommending tuition and fee levels, and policies; making recommendations on merging or closing institutions and developing criteria identifyingthe need for new baccalaureate institutions; and approvingnew degree programs. The HECB has a number of admin-istrative functions and duties, most of which pertain to stu- dent financial assistance programs and various federalprograms. Summary: On July 1, 2012, all of the current student fi- nancial aid functions perform ed by the HECB are trans- ferred to a newly created Office of Student FinancialAssistance (Office) that administers all state and federal fi-nancial aid and the advanced college tuition payment pro-gram. The Office is created as a separate agency of thestate. The HECB is eliminated on July 1, 2012. The Council for Higher Education (Council) is created, subject to rec- ommendations of a Steering Committee on Higher Educa-tion and legislation enacted in 2012. The SteeringCommittee on Higher Education is created to establish the purpose and functions of the Council. The Steering Com-mittee is chaired by the Govern or or the Governor's desig- nee and includes four legislators and equal representationfrom higher education sectors in the state. The member-ship and specific functions of the new Council will bedetermined by the Steering Committee. HECB functions regarding reporting on state support received by students, the costs of higher education, genderequity, technology degree production, costs and benefitsof tuition and fee reciprocity with Oregon, Idaho, and Brit-ish Columbia, and transmitti ng undergraduate and gradu- ate educational costs to boards of regents are eliminated.Until July 1, 2012, the HECB co ntinues to prioritize capi- tal projects for the higher education system, and the HECBis provided with additional guidance on how toaccomplish that task.Senate 40 1House 79 14SSB 5184 262Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 (Section 302) August 24, 2011 July 1, 2012 (Sections 101-103, 106-202, 204-244, and 301) Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed section 246 which would have immediately transferred all pow- ers, duties and functions of the higher education coordinat- ing board pertaining to student financial aid to the new Office of Student Financial Assistance.

VETO MESSAGE ON E2SSB 5182 June 6, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 246, Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5182 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to establishing the office of student finan- cial assistance by eliminati ng the higher educ ation coordinat- ing board and transferring its f unctions to various entities.\" Section 246 transfers powers, dutie s and functions of the higher education coordinating board pert aining to student financial as- sistance to the new office of stude nt financial assistance. Due to a technical bill drafting error, th e effective date of the transfer of powers would occur prior to the cr eation of the new office of stu- dent financial assistanc e on July 1, 2012. For this reason, I am vetoing Section 246. The new higher edu- cation steering committee will make recommendations concerning higher education gover nance prior to the 2012 legislative session. I expect the committee to consider the transfers of authority set forth in Section 246 and recomme nd any statutory changes neces- sary in the 2012 session to succ essfully achieve the appropriate transfers. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 246 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5182. With the exception of Secti on 246, Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5182 is approved.

By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored by Senators Schoesler, King, Carrell, Holmquist Newbry).Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 EducationHouse Committee on Education Background: School districts are required to report a myriad of information to the Superintendent of Public In- struction (SPI). The requireme nts appear in several chap- ters of Title 28A of the RCW, which encompasses the laws related to the common schools. Common schools are pub-lic schools operating a program for kindergarten through12th grade or any part thereof. A second-class school district has less than 2,000 stu- dents. Currently, 188 of Washington's 295 school districtsare second-class. Summary: Beginning September 1, 2011, second-class school districts may annually submit a condensed compli- ance report to the SPI. The di stricts that choose to submit these reports must: dedicate a public meeting for reviewing the report and receiving public testimony; adopt the report at a public meeting; and require the report to be signed by the school district superintendent and the school board chair and be notarized. School districts may voluntarily submit compliance information to the SPI concer ning programs not funded. Compliance requests do not include data required to be submitted by federal or state law or for the purposes of program evaluation or account ability, including data for a comprehensive K-12 educati on data improvement system. The SPI must develop a condensed compliance report form for second-class school districts by August 1, 2011.The form will allow the distri cts to choose one of the fol- lowing for each funded progra m: (1) it has complied or re- ceived a State Board of Education waiver; (2) it has notcomplied and includes an explanation or steps taken tocomply; or (3) it has received a grant for less than half afull-time equivalent instructiona l staff. In order to deter- mine whether districts have documentation to support thecondensed compliance report, SPI may conduct randomaudits. The majority of chapters in Title 28A RCW include a provision that allows second- class school districts to meet their compliance requirem ents with a condensed compliance report. The act includes a federa l severability clause.

By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Becker, Keiser,Hargrove, Stevens and Carrell). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Background: A parent in Washington may consent to mental health treatment on behalf of a minor child provid-ed that a professional person determines that there is a medical necessity for treatment. An evaluation and treat-ment facility (E&T) is not ob ligated to provide treatment to the minor but may not refuse solely on the basis of the lack of consent of the minor. A minor who does not con-sent to treatment may petition a superior court for reviewas to whether such treatment is based upon medicalnecessity. In 2003 and 2005, the Legislature passed bills obligat- ing an E&T to promptly prov ide notice of all available treatment options to a parent or guardian of a minor whoseeks treatment for that mino r, including the option for parent-initiated treatment. Summary: A hospital emergency room or inpatient psy- chiatric facility which provides services to minors must in- form a parent or guardian of a minor who is seeking treatment for that minor of all statutorily available treat-ment options, including the option for parent-initiated treatment. This notice must be provided verbally and inwriting, and the notice must be documented by the facility and accompanied by a signed receipt from the parent orguardian. A facility who fails to provide notice is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 unless the facility is licensed by the Department of Heal th (DOH), in which case DOH is authorized to enforce this provision through its authority to deny, suspend, revoke, or modify the facility's license. Facilities subject to this le gislation must develop pol- icies and protocols respecting notification by December 1, 2011. The Department of Social and Health Services andDOH must provide a detailed report to the Legislatureregarding the facilities' compli ance by December 1, 2012.

By Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections (origi nally sponsored by Senators Nelson, Swecker and Chase; by request of Department ofEcology). Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on Local Government Background: The Shoreline Management Act (SMA), enacted in 1971: governs uses of state shorelines; includes specific legisla tive findings that pressures on shoreline uses and the impact s of unrestricted devel- opment on public and private shoreline property cre-ate the need to coordina te planning for shoreline development activities; and finds these pressures create the need to protect private property rights consistent with the public interest. Senate 43 5 House 71 26 (House amended)Senate 46 2 (Senate concurred)Senate 48 0House 95 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)SSB 5195 264SMA involves a coop erative regulatory approach be- tween local governments and the state. At the local level, SMA regulations are develope d in local shoreline master programs (master programs). All counties and cities with shorelines of the state are re quired to adopt master pro- grams which regulate land use activities in shoreline areas of the state. Counties and cities are also required to enforce master programs within their jurisdictions. The Shorelines Hearings Board (SHB) hears appeals from shoreline substantial development, conditional use,and variance permit decision s, and from those shoreline penalties jointly issued by local government and the De-partment of Ecology (Ecology), or issued by Ecologyalone. Summary: A master program takes effect 14 days from the date of Ecology's written notice of final action to the local government. Ecology must publish notice that a master program has been approved or disapproved. On theday a master program of a lo cal government that does not fully plan under the GMA is approved or disapproved,Ecology must notify the legisl ative authority of the appli- cable local government by te lephone or electronic means, followed by written communicat ion as necessary to ensure that the local gove rnment has received the full written ap- proval or disapproval decision. For jurisdictions that fullyplan under the GMA, master program adoptions andamendment appeals must be made to the Growth Manage-ment Hearing Boards within 60 days from the date Ecolo-gy, rather than the local go vernment, publishes notice that the master program or amendment has been approved ordisapproved. For other jurisdictions, appeals pertaining tomaster program adoptions and amendments must be madewithin 30 days of the date Ecology publishes notice that the master program has been approved or disapproved. Permit decisions may be appealed within 21 days of the date of filing (the date of actual receipt by Ecology of the local government's decision ).

By Senate Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Senators Kline, Regala and Hargrove).Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: Driving while license suspended or re- voked (DWLS 3) is a misdemeanor and it can be commit- ted under a variety of circumstances. A person commitsDWLS 3 by driving a motor vehicle when the person'sdriver's license is suspended or revoked because the per- son has (1) failed to respond to a notice of traffic infrac-tion; (2) failed to appear at a requested hearing; (3) violated a written promise to ap pear in court; or (4) failed to comply with the terms of a notice of traffic infraction orcitation. There are also several other behaviors whichconstitute DWLS 3. There are approximately 100,000 cases of DWLS 3 filed annually. Because DWLS 3 is a criminal offense, ev-ery driver that is either cited and released, or booked intocustody is given a court date. In prosecuting the case, theprosecutor must provide discovery to the defense attorney,subpoena the Department of Licensing to establish the sta-tus of the defendant's driving privilege, and subpoena thelaw enforcement officer who noticed the driving behavior.Many of these defendants are eligible for a public defender due to the defendant's economic status. Summary: Violations of driving while license suspended in the third degree due to a pers on's failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction, fa ilure to appear at a requested hearing, violation of a written promise to appear in court, or failure to comply with the terms of a notice of traffic in-fraction or citation may be re ferred to the prosecutor's of- fice so a determination can be made as to whether to file an information or divert the case for entry into a precharge diversion program.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 Senate 46 2 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 46 2 (Senate concurred)Senate 46 0House 94 0SSB 5203 265SSB 5203 C 337 L 11 Improving the administration and efficiency of sex and kidnapping offender registration. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Regala, Hargrove,Stevens and Shin). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: In 2008 the Legislature created the Sex Of- fender Policy Board (Board) to promote a coordinated and integrated response to sex offender management. One ofthe first tasks assigned to th e Board, through 2SHB 2714 (2008), was to review Washington's sex offender registra-tion and notification laws. Th e Board came to several con- sensus recommendations and submitted a report to theLegislature in November 2009. After the 2009 report, theBoard continued to work toward consensus on other itemsof discussion surrounding registration and notification. In 2010 the Legislature passed SB 6414 adopting many of the Board's recommendations. Notably, the Leg-islature revamped the definiti on of an out-of-state offender who is required to register in Washington, standardized thetimeframes for when a sex offend er is required to register, specified criteria for the court to consider when reviewinga petition to relieve a sex offender from registration, andadopted a tiered approach in responding to an offender's failure to register. Separately, the Legislature addressedlaw enforcement verification of registered sex offenders.Sex offenders are no longer required to check-in with lawenforcement at the law enforcement office. Rather, fund-ing is provided for law enfo rcement to conduct periodic in-person address verifications to ensure the offender isresiding at the reported address. Special rules apply to offenders who lack a fixed resi- dence. The person must provide notice to the sheriff of thecounty where he or she is regi stered within three days after ceasing to have a fixed residence and is thereafter requiredto report weekly, in person, to the sheriff. The person must keep an accurate accounting of where that person stays during the week and provide it to the county sheriff upon request. Fixed residence or lacking a fixed residence is notcurrently defined in statute. A person who is required to register must give notice to the county sheriff within th ree days prior to arriving at a school or institution of high er education to attend class- es, prior to starting work at an institution of higher educa- tion, and after any term ination of enrollment or employment at a school or in stitution. The sheriff is in turn required to notify the sc hool's principal or institution's department of public safety. If the student is a risk level II or III, the principal must pr ovide information about the student to every teacher of the student and any other per-sonnel who, in the judgment of the principal, supervisesthe student or for security purposes, and should be awareof the student's record. If the student is a risk level I, in-formation may only be released to personnel who, in thejudgment of the principal, should be aware of the student'srecord. In May of 2010, a student in a Seattle school was sex- ually assaulted by another student who was a registered ju-venile sex offender. In response to that incident,legislators asked the Board to study existing laws regard-ing juvenile sex offenders and school notification. TheBoard came to several consensus recommendations, in-cluding requiring law enforcem ent to give notice regard- ing the student to both the pr incipal and the school district, making clarifications to the information that must be pro- vided to the school and the tim ing of those notifications, and reinforcing local policy and planning to addressjuvenile sex offenders in the school. The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC) operates an electronic statewide unifiedsex offender notification and registration program (SO-NAR) which contains a database of all registered sex of- fenders in the state of Washington. As required by law,WASPC creates and maintains a public website whichposts all level II and level III sex offenders. Summary: Terminology currently used throughout the registration and notification provisions are defined. \"Fixed residence\" is defined generally as a building that aperson lawfully and habitually uses as living quarters a majority of the week. \"Lacks a fixed residence\" means theperson does not have a residence that falls into the fixedresidence definition and speci fically includes a shelter program, an outdoor sleeping location, or locations wherethe person does not have permission to stay. For the purposes of registration in this state, a sex offense includes: any federal conviction classified as a sex offense under the federal Sex Of fender Registration and Notification Act; any military convictio n for a sex offense; and any conviction in a foreign country for a sex offense obtained with sufficient safeguards for due process. A person with a federal or out-of-state conviction for a sex offense may request to be removed from the registry if the person was relieved of th e duty to register in the per - son's state of conviction. The person must provide proofof relief from registration to the county sheriff. If the county sheriff determines the person should be removedfrom the registry, the sheriff will request the WashingtonState Patrol to remove the person. The information a person mu st provide when register- ing is clarified. A person ma y be required to update any of his or her registration information in conjunction with anyaddress verification conducted by the sheriff or as part ofany notice the person is required to provide.SSB 5204 266Two or more prior felony convictions for failure to register will classify a new conviction for failure to regis- ter as a class B felony regardless if those convictions werein Washington or in another state. A person who is re-quired to register in Washington for a crime committed inanother state may petition for relief from registration in thecounty of the person's reside nce rather than being required to file in Thurston county. The responsibility of law enforcement and a school in response to notification that a sex offender will attend theschool is set out in a separat e statute. Law enforcement must provide notice to the school principal and the schooldistrict. Information about th e student that must be pro- vided is specified to include the risk level classification. Provisions are updated to reflect the current practices of WASPC utilizing the SONAR system. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5204 C 338 L 11 Concerning juveniles who have been adjudicated of a sex offense. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Regala, Hargrove andStevens). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Juvenile Duty to Register & Relief from Registration . In Washington State, a juvenile who is adju- dicated of a sex or kidnapping offense has the same duty to register as an adult offender, regardless of the person'sage at the time of offense. If the juvenile is under the cus-tody of the Juvenile Reha bilitation Administration, the End of Sentence Review Co mmittee with the Department of Corrections will review the person's file and assign aninitial risk classification. If th e juvenile is on probation at the county level or serving a sentence under a Special SexOffender Disposition Alternative (SSODA), the juvenile'sinitial risk classification will be assigned by the countysheriff. A person who has a duty to register for a sex or kid- napping offense committed wh en the person was a juve- nile may be relieved of the duty to register if: at least 24 months have passed since the adjudication with no new sex or kidnapping offenses; the person has not been adjudicated or convicted of a failure to register during the 24 months prior to filing the petition; if the person was 15 years of age or older at the time of the offense, the person shows by clear and con-vincing evidence that he or she is sufficiently rehabil- itated to warrant remova l from the registration system, or if the person was under the age of 15 at the time of the offense, the person shows by a preponder- ance of the evidence that he or she is sufficientlyrehabilitated. In general legal terms, clear and convincing is a higher standard of proof than a pr eponderance of the evidence. Preponderance of the evidence is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. Effectively, the stan- dard is satisfied if there is a greater than 50 percent chancethat the proposition is true. Clear and convincing means that it is substantially more lik ely than not that the thing is in fact true. Beyond a reasonable doubt would be furtheralong the continuum, requirin g that the trier of fact be close to certain of the truth of the matter asserted. In 2008 the Legislature created the Sex Offender Pol- icy Board (Board) to promote a coordinated and integratedresponse to sex offender management. One of the first tasks assigned to the Board, through 2SHB 2714 (2008), was to review Washington's sex offender registration and notification laws. Soon after its inception, the Board cre- ated a subcommittee to address issues specifically related to juveniles who have been adjudicated of a sex offense. In response to recommenda tions from the Board, the Legislature modified provisions for a juvenile to petitionfor relief from registration. Specifically, the Legislatureclarified that a juvenile woul d not be precluded from peti- tioning for relief if they j uvenile had committed only one failure to register. The Legi slature also adopted 12 specif- ic factors for the court to re view in determining whether to relieve the person from the duty to register. Those factorsinclude the nature of the offe nse, subsequent criminal his- tory, the person's participatio n in treatment and rehabilita- tive programs, input from th e victim, and an updated polygraph examination. Sealing of Juvenile Records . Upon motion to the court, the court may seal the records of a juvenile if: 1. there is no proceeding pending against the moving party seeking his or her co nviction for a juvenile or criminal offense; 2. there is no proceeding pending seeking the formation of a diversion agreement with that person; 3. full restitution has been paid; 4. the person has not been convicted of a sex offense; and 5. the following time periods have passed since the last date of release from confinement, full-time residen- tial treatment, or entry of disposition in the commu- nity without being convicted of any offense or crime: a. class A felony - five years; b. class B or C felony, gross misdemeanor and misdemeanor offenses and diversions - two years.Senate 49 0 House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5213 267Any adjudication of a juven ile offense or a crime sub- sequent to sealing has the effect of nullifying the sealing order. Registered Persons Who Attend School . In May of 2010, a student in a Seattle school was sexually assaulted by another student who was a registered juvenile sex of-fender. In response to that incident, legislators asked theBoard to study existing laws regarding juvenile sex of- fenders and school notification. The Board came toseveral consensus recommenda tions, including requiring: that a court that orders 24/7 monitoring as part of SSODA must enter findings regarding that condition; schools to have policy and procedures in place regarding students who have been adjudicated of a registrable sex offense and the provision of a safe learning environment for all students; the Department of Corrections, End of Sentence Review Committee (ESRC) to assign the initial riskclassification for all juveniles required to register as a sex offender who go throug h the Juvenile Rehabilita- tion Association and tho se who receive a SSODA sentence. A person who is required to register must give notice to the county sheriff within th ree days prior to arriving at a school or institution of high er education to attend class- es, prior to starting work at an institution of higher educa- tion, and after any term ination of enrollment or employment at a school or in stitution. The sheriff is in turn required to notify the sc hool's principal or institution's department of public safety. If the student is a risk level II or III, the principal must pr ovide information about the student to every teacher of the student and any other per- sonnel who, in the judgment of the principal, supervises the student or for security purposes, should be aware of thestudent's record. If the student is a risk level I, information may only be released to personnel who, in the judgment ofthe principal, should be aw are of the student's record. In 2006 the legislature required the Office of the Su- perintendant of Public Instruction (OSPI) to convene aworkgroup to draft a model po licy for school principals to follow when they receive no tification from law enforce- ment that a registered sex/kid napping offender is attending or is expecting to attend the school (SB 6580). The modelpolicy was created and provid es the intended direction. However, schools and school districts are not mandated toadopt the policy or implement safety plans for these stu-dents and consequently there is not consistent approachthroughout the state. Summary: A person who has a duty to register for a Class A kidnapping or sex offense committed as a juvenile, age 15 or older, must have spent at least 60 months in the com-munity with no new sex or kidnapping offense before theperson may petition to be relie ved of the duty to register. Any other person who has a duty to register for a sex orkidnapping offense committe d when the person was ajuvenile must have spent at least 24 months in the commu- nity with no new sex or kidnapping offense before the per-son may petition to be relieved of the duty to register. In order to be relieved, the person must show by a preponder-ance of the evidence that he or she is sufficiently rehabili-tated to warrant removal fro m the registration system. This burden of proof applies regardless if the person wasunder or over the age of 15 at the time of the offense. A person who committed a sex offense as a juvenile and who has been relieved of the duty to register or whoseduty to register has ended, may have his or her recordssealed in the same manner and under the same conditions as other offenses unless the person was adjudicated of rapein the first degree, rape in the second degree, or indecentliberties that was actually committed with forcible compulsion. If the court orders 24 hour continuous monitoring of an offender who is awarded a SSODA, the court must in-clude the basis of this conditio n in its findings. The ESRC must assign the initial risk cl assification for juveniles un- der the jurisdiction of the coun ty juvenile court and juve- niles supervised from out-of-s tate under the interstate compact for juveniles. The Superintendent of Public Instruction must publish a revised and updated sample policy for schools to followregarding students required to register as sex orkidnapping offenders.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5213 C 47 L 11 Addressing insurance statutes, generally.

A resale cer tificate is not required if (1) delivery of a public offering statement is required, or (2)the unit owner is otherwise exempt from providing a resalecertificate, such as when the unit is sold under foreclosure. A resale certificate is signed by an officer or autho- rized agent of the condomin ium association and the certif- icate is based on the books an d records of the association, including: a statement disclosing any right of first refusal or other restraint on the free alienability of the unit contained in the declaration; a statement setting forth the amount of the monthly common expense assessment and any unpaid com-mon expense or special assessment currently due and payable from the selling unit owner, and a statementof any special assessments that have been levied against the unit which have not been paid even though they are not yet due; a statement, which must be current to within 45 days, of any common expenses or special assessmentsagainst any unit in the con dominium that are past due over 30 days; a statement, which must be current to within 45 days, of any obligation of the association which is past dueover 30 days; a statement of any other fees payable by unit owners; a statement of any anticipated repair or replacement cost in excess of 5 percent of the annual budget of the association that has been approved by the board of directors; a statement of the amount of any reserves for repair or replacement, and of any portions of those reserves currently designated by the association for any specified projects; the annual financial statement of the association, including the audit report, if it has been prepared, for the year immediately preceding the current year; a balance sheet and a revenue and expense statement of the association prepared on an accrual basis, which must be current to within 120 days; the current operating budget of the association; a statement of any unsatisfied judgments against the association and the status of any pending suits or legal proceedings in which the association is a plaintiff or defendant; a statement describing any insurance coverage provided for the benefit of unit owners; a statement as to whether there are any alterations or improvements to the unit or to the limited common elements assigned thereto that violate any provision of the declaration; a statement of the number of units, if any, still owned by the declarant, whethe r the declarant has trans- ferred control of the associ ation to the unit owners, and the date of such transfer; a statement as to whether there are any violations of the health or building cod es with respect to the unit, the limited common el ements assigned thereto, or any other portion of the condominium;Senate 45 1 House 93 0SSB 5232 269 a statement of the remaining term of any leasehold estate affecting the condominium and the provisions governing any extension or renewal thereof; a copy of the declaration, the bylaws, the rules or reg- ulations of the association, the association's currentreserve study, if any, and any other information rea- sonably requested by mortgagees of prospectivepurchasers of units; a statement as to whether the units or common ele- ments of the condominium are covered by a qualifiedwarranty, and a history of claims under any such warranty; and if the association does not have a reserve study, then a disclosure as proscribed by law.When a unit owner requests a resale certificate and provides any fee as may be required, the association is to provide the certificate within ten days of the request.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5232 C 303 L 11 Authorizing prize-linked savings deposits. By Senate Committee on Labo r, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally sponsored by Senators Kilmer, Hobbs, Carrell, Keiser and Kohl-Welles). Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Background: The percentage of workers who said they have less than $10,000 in savings grew to 43 percent in 2010, from 39 percent in 2009, according to the EmployeeBenefit Research Institute's annual Retirement Confi-dence Survey. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis re-ported in February 2007, that the rate of personal savings has declined steadily since th e 1980s and in 2005 was neg- ative for the first time since 1933. This has raised con- cerns about families ability to save enough for retirement and for protection against financial setbacks. Financial in-stitutions play a significant role in exploring creative options to increase personal savings. Current law permits a business to conduct a promo- tional contest of chance if a prize and chance are involvedbut the element of considera tion is not. A promotional contest of chance is not ga mbling as it is defined in RCW 9.46.0237.A financial institution is defined in state law as a bank, trust company, mutual savings bank, savings and loan as-sociation, or credit union auth orized to do business and ac- cept deposits in this state un der state or federal law. The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions(DFI) regulates and examines a variety of state charteredfinancial services. DFI also provides education to the public to protect consumers from financial fraud. Credit unions are financial institutions formed by an organized group of people with a common bond. Mem-bers of credit unions pool th eir assets to provide loans and other financial services to each other. They are not-for- profit cooperatives, owned by members and operated bymostly volunteer boards. Cred it unions are chartered and supervised by the National Credit Union Administration. Mutual savings banks are financial institutions char- tered through the state or fe deral government for the pur- pose of saving and investing savings in mortgages, loans, stocks and bonds, and other securities. Banks are financial institutio ns which are corporations with the ability to invest in bonds, notes, and investment securities. Summary: Financial institutions are conditionally authorized to conduct a promotional contest of chance. A promotional contest of chance is defined in statute. Depositors in a savings account, certificate of deposit, orany other savings program of the financial institution con-ducting a promotional contest of chance are eligible to re- ceive a prize in a drawing. This can be for an annual drawing if they retain funds in their account for at least oneyear, or it can be for other drawings for which depositors may be eligible. Those eligib le to receive a prize are not required to pay for, or purchase, any services or goodsother than the participatio n in the savings program. In order to conduct a promo tional contest of chance, a financial institution must get ap proval from its board of di- rectors. A financial institution cannot conduct a promo-tional contest of chance if it is likely to adversely affect theinstitution's safety or soundn ess, harm the institution's rep- utation, or mislead the institu tion's members or the general public. The director of DFI is given authority to examinebanks, mutual savings banks, and credit unions which areconducting a promotional contest of chance. DFI may is-sue a cease and desist order for violations under this act.Financial institutions must maintain sufficient audit records and make them available to DFI if requested. Banks, trust companies, and mutual savings banks are given authority to conduct a promotional contest of chance only if the director of DFI finds that a federal regulatory agency has interpreted fede ral law to permit them to conduct a promotional contest of chance.Senate 46 3House 74 17SSB 5239 July 22, 2011 SSB 5239 C 278 L 11 Requiring a definition of \"resident\" for purposes of the al- location method used to distribute federal forest revenueto schools. By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored by Senators Honeyford,Morton, Swecker and Becker; by request ofSuperintendent of Public Instruction). Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on EducationHouse Committee on Education Appropriations & Oversight Background: The Washington State Constitution re- quires the state to provide ba sic education for its citizens. In fulfillment of this respon sibility, the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) calc ulates for each of the school districts a basic education allocation (BEA). Under cur-rent Washington State practices, Federal Forest Funds re-ceived from the federal govern ment pursuant to federal law for the benefit of any particular school district are de-ducted from its total BEA. In other words, for every dollar received by a school district under federal law, there is acorresponding dollar reduction in the BEA received bythat school district from the state up to the full amount ofthe district's BEA. In 1989 the courts held that Congress intended to sin- gle out Skamania County and its school districts for a spe- cial benefit. It held that the school districts in Skamania county may use the Federal Forest Funds allotted to themwithout being penalized by a corresponding complete re- duction in their BEAs as it would violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Therefore, 30percent of the federal forest revenue is deducted from Ska- mania County school districts' BEA, leaving 70 percent tobe distributed among the districts. Currently, the distribution of Skamania County Feder- al Forest Funds to districts w ithin the county is affected by enrollments of non-resident st udents in alternative learn- ing education (ALE) programs. A district with high ALEenrollments origina ting from other parts of the state re- ceive a larger proportional share of county revenues thanwould otherwise be received. Summary: SPI must distribute fu nds received from the federal government to counties for school districts in their respective counties in proportio n of the number of residentfull-time equivalent students enrolled in each public school district to the number of resident full-time equiva- lent students enrolled in public schools in the county. SPI must adopt rules regarding th e definition of resident pro- vided that the impact of federal funds distribution be con-sidered with regard to alte rnative learning experience students. This must be completed by September 1, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 September 1, 2011 (Section 1) SB 5241 C 97 L 11 Modifying the authority of a watershed management partnership. By Senators Roach and Tom. Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Interlocal Cooperation Act allows public agencies to enter into agreements with one another for joint or cooperative actio n. Any power, privilege, or authority held by a public ag ency may be exercised jointly with one or more other public agencies having the same power, privilege, or authority. A public agency for pur-poses of interlocal agreem ents includes any agency, political subdivision, or unit of local government. Public agencies may enter in to interlocal agreements to form a watershed management partnership (partner-ship) to implement all or pa rts of a watershed management plan including coordination and oversight of plan imple-mentation. If two or more entities with the power of emi-nent domain join to form a partnership, then the partnership itself will have the power of eminent domain as well. The power of eminent domain may not extend toa separate legal entity created by a partnership. The separate legal entity cr eated by a partnership to conduct the operations of the partnership may exercise the power of eminent domain if: the partnership was form ed before July 1, 2006; all of the public agencies that form the partnership have the power of eminent domain; the partnership is governed by a board of directors consisting entirely of elected officials from the cities and districts constituting the partnership; and eminent domain authority is exercised only for those utility purposes for which the partnership was formedand solely for providing water services to its customers.Senate 46 2 House 91 2 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 48 0House 94 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)ESB 5242 271A partnership must comply with certain requirements before exercising eminent do main powers. The partner- ship must comply with stat utory notice requirements and must provide notice 30 days before the partnership board authorizes condemnation to the city, town, or county having jurisdiction over the subject property. Additionally, the partnership must enter into an in- terlocal agreement with a c ity to allow eminent domain within that city if the city is not a member of the partner- ship and has water or sewer service areas within one-half mile of Lake Tapps or within five miles upstream fromLake Tapps along the White River. A process is createdfor a city located within this ar ea to file and resolve a claim that the partnership's Lake Tapps water supply operationshave a negative impact on the city's water supplies. If a court determines that there has been a negative impact to the city, the partnership must implement a remedy accept- able to the city, and if the c ity and partnership do not agree on a remedy, the court must establish the terms of aremedy. Summary: The requirement that the partnership enter into an interlocal agreement with a city to allow eminent domain within that city if th e city is not a member of the partnership and has water or sewer service areas within one-half mile of Lake Tapps or within five miles upstream from Lake Tapps along the White River is repealed. Ad- ditionally, the process for a city located within this area tofile and resolve a claim that the partnership's Lake Tapps water supply operations have a negative impact on thecity's water supplies is removed.

By Senators Hargrove, Pflu g, Kline, Re gala, Harper, Carrell, Keiser, Nelson, Sh eldon, Conway and Shin. Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: Profiling occurs when a law enforcement officer singles out a suspect that has certain characteristicsthe officer believes are consistent with a class of personswho are more likely than others to commit crimes. Withrespect to profiling based on race, local law enforcement agencies must (1) adopt a writte n policy designed to con- demn and prevent racial prof iling; (2) review and audit their existing procedures, prac tices, and training to ensure that they do not enable or foster racial profiling; (3) con-tinue training to address the issues relating to racialprofiling; (4) ensure that they have a citizen complaintprocess in place; (5) work with minority groups to appro-priately address racial profiling; and (6) collect demo-graphic data on traffic stops and analyze the data to ensurethat racial profiling is not occurring. The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC) and the Criminal Justice Training Com-mission (CJTC) must ensure th at issues related to racial profiling are addressed in basic law enforcement trainingand offered in regional tr aining for in-service law enforcement officers.

By Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections (origi nally sponsored by Senators White, Swecker, Nelson, Litzow and Harper). Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on Local Government House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Growth Management Act (GMA) is the comprehensive land use pl anning framework for coun- ty and city governments in Washington. Enacted in 1990 and 1991, the GMA establish es numerous planning re- quirements for counties and c ities obligated by mandate or choice to fully plan under the GMA (planning jurisdic- tions), and a reduced number of directives for all othercounties and cities. Twenty -nine of Washington's 39 counties, and the cities within those counties, are planningjurisdictions. Public infrastructure funding is accomplished in a number of different ways in the state. The Legislature has,in recent years, examined a number of ways to increaseSenate 6House 62 91 0ESSB 5253 in public infrastruct ure in the state. Tax incre- ment financing is a method of redistributing increased tax revenues within a geograph ic area resulting from a public investment to pay for the bo nds required to construct a project. A number of tax incremen t financing programs have been created in the state: in 2001 the Legislature createdthe Community Revitalizatio n Financing Program; in 2006 the Local Infrastructure Financing Tool Program wascreated by the Legislature; and in 2009 the Legislaturecreated the Local Revitali zation Financing Program. A transfer of development rights (TDR) occurs when a qualifying land owner, through a permanent deed restric-tion, severs potential develo pment rights from a property and transfers them to a recipient for use on a differentproperty. In TDR transactions, transferred rights are gen-erally shifted from sending areas with lower populationdensities to receiving areas with higher population densi-ties. The monetary values associated with transferredrights constitute compensatio n to a land owner for devel- opment that may have otherwise occurred on thetransferring property. In 2007 the Legislature directed the Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development, now theDepartment of Commerce (Commerce), to fund a processto develop a regional TDR program that corresponds withthe GMA. The legislation sp ecified that the TDR program must encourage King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomishcounties, and the cities within, to participate in the devel- opment and implementation of regional frameworks andmechanisms for TDR programs. In 2009 the Legislaturedirected Commerce to establish a regional TDR programto foster voluntary local govern ment participation that will result in the transfer of development rights between jurisdictions in central Puge t Sound counties and cities. The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) is an as- sociation of cities, towns, counties, ports, and state agen-cies that serves as a forum for developing policies andmaking decisions about regional growth and transporta-tion issues in the four county central Puget Sound region. Membership of the PSRC includes King, Kitsap, Pierce,and Snohomish counties, 72 cities and towns, four portdistricts, and transit agencies and tribes within the region. Two state agencies, the Department of Transportation andthe Transportation Commission, are also members of thePSRC. Summary: An eligible county, defined as a county that borders Puget Sound, has 600,000 or more residents, and that has an established TDR program, must designate all agricultural and forest land of long-term commercial sig-nificance within its jurisdiction as sending areas under itsTDR program. An eligible county must calculate thenumber of development rights from agricultural and forest land of long-term commercial significance that are eligible for transfer to receiving cities. The number of transferabledevelopment rights does not include certain developmentrights from agricultural and fo rest lands of long-term com- mercial significance that ha ve been removed or extin- guished through a co nservation easement, mitigation, or a habitat restoration plan. An eligible county may de signate rural zoned lands as available for transfer to receiving cities if 50 percent ormore of the agricultural and forest land of long-term com-mercial significance in the co unty has already been pro- tected through a permanent conservation easement or isowned for conservation purpo ses. The portion of rural zoned lands available for tran sfer must not exceed 1500 development rights. Additio nally, the rural zoned lands must be identified either: by the county as top conservation priorities because they meet certain criteria; or as highly important to the water quality of Puget Sound. On or before September 1, 2011, each eligible county must report to the PSRC the total number of transferable development rights within the eligible county that may be available for allocation to receiving cities. The PSRC must allocate the total nu mber of development rights among the receiving cities in consultation with eligible counties and based on certain factors. On or before March1, 2012, the PSRC must report to each receiving city andto Commerce each receiving city's share of transferred de-velopment rights. A receivi ng city may, by interlocal agreement, transfer all or a portion of its transferred devel-opment rights to another receiving city. A receiving cityis defined as any incorporated c ity within an eligible coun- ty that has a population plus employment of 22,500 ormore. A receiving city becomes a sponsoring city by: accepting all or a portion of its transferred development rights; adopting a development plan for infrastructure; and creating one or more local infrastructure project areas. A development plan for infrastructure must: be developed in consulta tion with the Department of Transportation and the county where the local infrastructure project area to be created is located; be consistent with any TDR policies or development regulations adopted by the sponsoring city; specify the public improvements to be financed using local infrastructure project financing; estimate the number of transferred development rights that will be used w ithin the local infrastructure project area; and estimate the cost of the public improvements. Before creating a local infrastructure project area, a sponsoring city must (1) ad opt TDR policies or implement development regulations, or (2) make a finding that it will either receive its transferred development rights in a localSSB 5271 273infrastructure project area or purchase its transferred de- velopment rights to be held in reserve by the sponsoring city and used in future development. To create a local infrastructure project area, a sponsor- ing city must adopt an ordinance or resolution that de-scribes the proposed public improvements and the boundaries of the local infrastructure project area. Beforeadopting an ordinance or reso lution creating a local infra- structure project area, a sponsoring city must provide no-tice to the county assessor, county treasurer, and thecounty within the proposed local infrastructure project area and hold a public hearing on the proposed formation.A sponsoring city may adopt an element to its comprehen- sive plan and associated deve lopment regulations to apply within a local infrastructure project area. The designation of a local infrastructure project area is subject to limitations, incl uding, but not limited to: the area be contiguous tracts of land; the public improvements be financed with local infrastructure project financing; the area not contain more than 25 percent of the total assessed value of taxable property within thesponsoring city; there is no overlap of the boundaries of each local infrastructure project area; and all local infrastructure project areas created by the sponsoring city comprise an area in which the transferred development rights will be used. The county and the sponsorin g city must receive that portion of its regular property taxes produced by the rate of tax levied by or for the county and the city on the prop- erty tax allocation revenue base value for that local infra-structure project area. The sp onsoring city must receive an additional portion of the regula r property taxes levied by it and by or for the county and the city upon the property taxallocation revenue value with in the local infrastructure project area. The portion of the tax receipts distributed tothe sponsoring city may only be used to finance public im- provement costs within the lo cal infrastructure project ar- ea. Participating taxing districts must allow the use of allof their local property tax a llocation revenues for local in- frastructure project financing. The property tax allocation terminates when local infrastructure project financing isno longer used for costs of public improvements or based on certain threshold levels. The eligible counties, in collaboration with sponsor- ing cities, must provide a repo rt to Commerce by March 1 of every other year that contains certain information.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SSB 5271 C 247 L 11 Regarding abandoned or derelict vessels. By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Rockefeller,Swecker, Ranker, Morton, Sheldon, Delvin, Schoesler,Regala, Nelson, Fraser, Kilmer, Shin and Kline; by requestof Commissioner of Public Lands). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters House Committee on Judiciary Background: In 2002 the Legislature established what has become known as the Derelict Vessel Removal Pro- gram (DVRP), which is administrated by the Departmentof Natural Resources (DNR). Authorized Public Entities . Certain state agencies and local governments, including DNR, may take custody anddispose of abandoned or derelict vessels on or aboveaquatic lands within their juri sdiction. Such agencies are known as authorized public entities (APEs). A marina may contract with a local go vernment to serve as the APE for derelict vessel removal, but current law does not spe- cifically authorize such ac tions to cover abandoned vessels. Reimbursement for Vessel Removals . An abandoned or derelict vessel owner must generally reimburse an APEfor reasonable removal and disposal costs. An APE may,however, seek reimbursement of up to 90 percent of suchcosts from DNR if the owner is unknown or insolvent. Al- though ports are APEs, a separate provision of law cover-ing ports references the reimbu rsement rate as 75 percent of removal and disposal costs. DVRP reimbursemen t funding comes primarily from a $2 surcharge on vessel registrations, as well as a tempo-rary additional $1 surcharge on vessel registrationsimposed until 2014. Criminal Liability . It is a misdemeanor to cause a vessel to become abandoned or derelict. Summary: Criminal Liability . In addition to the current prohibition against a person causing a vessel to become abandoned or derelict, a person who intentionally and without authorization causes a vessel to sink, break up, orblock a navigation channel is subject to a misdemeanor. Marina Participation in the DVRP . Marinas may con- tract with a local government for the removal of an aban- doned as well as a derelict vessel. Reimbursement Rate for Ports . The reimbursement rate for abandoned and derelict vessels removals by portsis increased from 75 to 90 percent, which is consistentwith the rate provided for APEs generally. Limited Liability for APEs . An APE, or entity con- tracting with an APE, is not civilly liable when taking anaction under DVRP auth ority unless that action constitutes gross negligence or willful or wantonmisconduct.Senate 30 18House 62 35 (House amended)Senate 29 19 (Senate concurred)SB 5278 on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5278 C 175 L 11 Addressing information contained in rate notices under the industrial insurance laws. By Senators Holmquist Newbry and King.Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: Expenses relating to industrial safety and health services of the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) that pertain to workers' compensation are paid byL&I and financed by premiums and assessments collectedfrom the state fund and self-ins ured employers. In addi- tion to paying workers' compensation benefits and admin-istrative costs, premiums are used to fund other programs and services, including L&I's Division of OccupationalSafety and Health, the Department of Environmental andOccupational Health Sciences at the University of Wash- ington, and specialty compliance services at L&I whichinclude the apprenticeship and employment standardsprograms. Summary: Rate notices must incl ude an accounting that clearly identifies all programs and services that are fi- nanced in whole or in part by state fund premiums or self-insurers' administrative assessments.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5289 C 26 L 11 E 1 Concerning a business and occupation tax deduction for payments made to certain property managementcompanies for personnel pe rforming on-sit e functions. By Senators Murray and Zarelli. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Property owners often hire property man- agement companies to manage their real property. Fre- quently, the property management companies also managethe personnel who perform the necessary services at theproperty location. Under legislation adopted in 1998, property manage- ment companies are not resp onsible for paying business and occupation (B&O) taxes on amounts they receive for and pay to an on-site employee when (1) the employeeworks primarily at the owner's property; (2) the employ-ee's duties include leasing pr operty units, maintaining the property, collecting rents, or similar activities; and (3) un-der the property management agreement, the employee'scompensation is the ultimate obligation of the propertyowner, and all actions, includ ing hiring, firing, compensa- tion, and conditions of employment, taken by the propertymanager are subject to the approval of the property owner.The money must be paid from a property managementtrust account. In 2010 Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6143 narrowed the B&O tax exemption covering property man-agement companies for amounts received from a propertyowner for compensation of on-site personnel to apply onlyto (1) nonprofit property management companies; and (2)property management companies receiving amounts froma housing authority for compensation of on-site personnel.However, because of the natu re of how housing authorities and non-profit management companies are organized inthe area of low-income housing, they do not alwaysqualify for the exemption provided in 2010. Summary: A B&O tax deduction is permitted for amounts that (1) a nonprofit property management compa- ny receives for compensating on-site employees from theowner of property; (2) a property management companyreceives for compen sating on-site employees from a hous- ing authority; and (3) a property management company re-ceives for compensating on-s ite employees from a limited liability company or limited pa rtnership of which the sole managing member or sole general partner is a housingauthority. The B&O tax exemption is repealed for amounts re- ceived by (1) a nonprofit pr operty management company from a property owner for compensation of on-site person-nel paid from a property management trust account; and(2) a property management company from a housing au-thority for compensation of on-site personnel paid from aproperty management trust account. The definition for on-site pe rsonnel is changed to a definition of personnel perfo rming on-site functions. The new definition enables personnel to work at the owner'sproperty or centrally perform on-site functions, rather thanto require that they work primarily at the owner's property. The definition of nonprofit management company is modified to (1) re quire an organization to qualify for a property tax exemption for providing property manage-ment services for low-income housing in addition to the current requirement of being a 501(c) federally tax-ex-empt organization; and (2) include public corporations es-tablished by cities, towns, or counties for limited and specified purposes.Senate 47 0House 93 0 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 49 0 House 97 0SB 5295 275Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 SB 5295 C 50 L 11 Regarding leases of irrigation district property. By Senators Delvin, Swecker, Schoesler, Holmquist Newbry, Honeyford and Hewitt. Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development House Committee on Local Government Background: Irrigation districts provide construction, improvement, maintenance, and operation of irrigation systems. Irrigation districts may also provide drainage, domestic water supply, and electric power facilities. A board of three, five, or seven elected directors manageseach irrigation district. An irrigation district may sell or lease its real property if the property is not needed by the district and public no- tice is given by publishing in a local newspaper at leastonce a week for three consecutive weeks. The district has the followi ng options with regard to this property: lease the property from year to year; give the lessee the option to purchase the property; sell the property on contract for deferred payments; sell the property pursu ant to a promissory note secured by a mortgage or deed of trust; or sell the property for cash and conveyance by deed. The board must make record of the real property sale or lease price. This price must be not less than the reason- able market value of the property unless the property is do-nated for highway or public utility purposes that enhance the value of the district's rema ining property more than the value of the donated land. Summary: An irrigation district may lease real property it owns for a duration determined by its board. The restriction for a year-to-year lease is deleted.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SSB 5300 C 99 L 11 Enhancing the use of Washington natural resources in public buildings. By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Hargrove and Ranker). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters House Committee on Capital Budget Background: In 2005 the Legislat ure enacted High-Per- formance Building Standards requiring all major facility projects funded in the capital budget, or projects financed through a financing contract as established by law, to bedesigned, constructed, and cer tified to at least the United States Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standard. Thisrequirement applies to any en tity, including public agen- cies and public school distri cts, although the school dis- tricts may use the Washington Sustainable School DesignProtocol. The stated purpose of the st andard is to improve the built environment and emphasiz e design and construction practices that reduce energy consumption and water use, improve indoor air quality, and minimize the impact on the natural environment. LEED is a fee-based third-party certification. It is based on a point system, focusi ng on six major resources; in door environmen tal quality; and innovation and LEED Certified, LEED Silver,LEED Gold, and LEED Platinum. LEED and the related logo is a trademark owned by the U.S. Green Building Co uncil and is used with permission.

By Senate Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Senators Kline, Zare lli, Kohl-Welles, Nelson, Rockefeller and White).Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: Under current law, a person is guilty of negligent driving in the second degree if that person oper- ates a motor vehicle in a manner that is both negligent and endangers or is likely to endanger any person or property. Negligent driving in the secon d degree is an infraction and is subject to a fine of $250. Senate 34 13House 90 2 (House amended)Senate 44 2 (Senate concurred)Senate 46 0House 93 0SSB 5337 277For purposes of this infractio n, negligent is defined as the failure to exercise ordinary care, and is the doing of some act that a reasonably careful person would not do un-der the same or similar circumstances or the failure to dosomething that a reasonably careful person would dounder the same or similar circumstances. Summary: Vulnerable user of the public way is defined as a pedestrian, person riding an animal; or a person oper- ating a farm tractor, a bicycle, an electric assisted bicycle,an electric personal assistive mobility device, a moped, a motor-driven cycle; a moto rcycle; or a motorized foot scooter. A new traffic infraction is created. A person commits the traffic infraction if, while operating a vehicle under cir- cumstances that constitute ne gligent driving in the second degree, the person proximately causes the death, greatbodily harm, or substantial bodily harm of a vulnerable user of the public way. The law enforcement officer orprosecuting authority issuing the notice of infraction must state on the notice that the offense was a proximate cause of death, great bodily harm, or substantial bodily harm ofa vulnerable user of a public way. In addition to paying the fine levied for negligent driv- ing in the second degree, a person who has committed this infraction must pay a fine fixed by the court in an amountof at least $1,000 but not to exceed $5,000 and have his orher driving privileges suspended for 90 days. However, a person who requests and personally ap- pears for a hearing may request to instead pay a penalty of$250; attend traffic school for a number of days to be de-termined by the court; perform up to 100 hours of commu-nity service related to driv er improvement and providing public education on traffic safety, as determined by the court; and submit certification to the court that the person has completed the requirements. If a person fails to com-plete the required traffic safety and community service re-quirements within one year of the date of the violation, a court must asses a fine in an amount between $1,000 and$5,000 and suspend the person's driving privileges for 90days. The court has discretion to extend the period of time in which the person must complete the requirements. A person whose license is suspended as a result of a violation of this infraction and who is found operating a motor vehicle during the susp ension is guilty of driving while license suspended in the second degree. The infraction created und er this act may not be deferred.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2012SSB 5337 C 51 L 11 Authorizing the provision of financial assistance to pri- vately owned airports available for general use of the public. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators Stevens, Pflug, Honeyford, Swecker and Roach). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Aircraft owners and dealers pay a variety of taxes and fees that are deposited in whole or in part to the Aeronautics Account. Sour ces of revenue in the Aero- nautics Account also include federal airport developmentgrants, federal airport planni ng grants, and other federal sources. State levied taxes and fees include: Aircraft Excise Tax, between $20 and $125 annually; Aircraft Fuel Tax, $0.11 per gallon; Aircraft Dealers License Fee, $75 annually; and Aircraft Registration Fee, $15 annually.

By Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy (originally sponsored by Senators Honeyford, Morton,Swecker, Delvin and Schoesler). Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy House Committee on Environment Background: There is a comprehensive statewide pro- gram for handling, recovering, and recycling solid waste to prevent pollution and conserve the resources of thestate. Each county must pr epare a coordinated, compre- hensive solid waste management plan and adoptregulations or ordinances to implement the plan.Senate 43 5House 61 32 (House amended)Senate 44 2 (Senate 46 Department of Ecologyreviewsand approves lo- cally issued permits and so lid waste management plans, and defines minimum functiona l standards for all types of solid waste facilities. The sites and facilities must meet certain criteria to protect the environment and human health. Local governments have th e primary responsibility to manage solid waste. The lo cal jurisdictions permit solid waste disposal sites and facilities, as well as enforce envi-ronmental regulatio ns and ordinances governing illegal dumping. It is illegal to du mp or allow solid waste to be dumped anywhere except at a permitted solid waste site orfacility. However, a person may dump his or her own solidwaste onto his or her property so long as it is not inviolation of any statutes or does not create a nuisance. A person who illegally dumps solid waste must pay $50 per cubic foot of litter or twice the amount of the ac-tual cleanup, whichever is great er. One-half of the restitu- tion payment is distributed to the property owner wherethe illegal dumping occurred and the other half goes to the local health department inv estigating the incident. The court may, with permission from the landowner, allow the person to cleanup and remove litter from the property inlieu of, or in addition to, cleanup restitution payment. Summary: The enforcing authority must take reasonable action to determine and identify the person responsible forillegal dumping before requiring the property owner toclean up the site. Local health jurisdictions receiving restitution pay- ment for illegal dumping must use one-half of the amountreceived to assist property owners with cleanup of illegal dumping where the responsible person cannot be deter-mined. A landowner is not en titled to any restitution if the landowner gave written permission authorizing the litter-ing, in which case the entire restitution payment must be provided to the local health department investigating the incident. In addition to res titution payment, the court may also require a person to remove and properly dispose oflitter from the property.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5352 C 100 L 11 Regarding providing eyeglasses to medicaid enrollees. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Honeyford, Regala andSwecker).Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: Current law authorizes the Department of Corrections (DOC) to operate five classes of correctionalindustry work programs. Those classes of jobs have dif-ferent rules depending on the industry they are designed to serve to ensure that they have the limited goals of reducingcosts to the taxpayer, or serving the public in some mannerand do not compete with privat e businesses in the state. Class II, or tax reduction, industries are state-owned andoperated industries designed to reduce the costs for goods and services for public agencies and nonprofit organiza-tions. Industries in this class must be closely patterned af- ter private sector industries, but with the objective of reducing public support costs rather than making a profit.The products and services of this industry, including pur- chased products and services necessary for a completeproduct line, may only be sold to public agencies, nonprof-it organizations, and to privat e contractors when the goods purchased will ultimately be used by a public agency or a nonprofit organization. However, to avoid waste or spoil- age, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold at private sale or donated to nonprofit orga nizations when there is no public sector market for such goods. Inmates working in tax redu ction industries do so at their own choice and are paid a gratuity which cannot ex-ceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the lo- cality in which the industry is located. Class II includessuch jobs as producing aluminum signs, license plates andtabs, mattresses, asbestos abatement, meat processing, op-tical lab, engraving, pheasan t raising, furniture manufac- turing, screen printing and embroidery, industrial sewing,and laundry. The optical lab with corre ctional industries makes eyeglasses for persons receiving them through the stateMedicaid program. With the cost cutting measuresthroughout state government, eyeglasses will no longer becovered. Enrollees of the program will continue to get their eye exam paid for, but must purchase their owneyeglasses in the open market. Summary: Eyeglasses produced through a Class II cor- rectional industry program may be sold to a licensed health professional for the so le purpose of providing those eyeglasses to enrollees of a state medical program so long as the health professional does not charge a profit for theeyeglasses.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 18, 2011Senate 49 0 House 93 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 49 0House 93 0SSB 5359 279SSB 5359 C 101 L 11 Concerning contiguous land under current use open space property tax programs. By Senate Committee on Ag riculture & Rural Economic Development (originally sponsored by Senators Morton, Swecker, Honeyford and Schoesler). Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Agriculture & Natural ResourcesHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 1969 the state's voters approved a con- stitutional amendment that allo ws the valuatio n of agricul- tural lands, timber lands, an d open space for property tax purposes to be based on the land's current use value rather than the land's market value. The purpose of the program is to encourage retention of th e land in agricultural, forest- ry, or other approved open space uses by taxing the landaccording to its income prod ucing capacity in those uses rather than on its value if converted to other uses. Two chapters establish the crit eria for land to qualify for the current use program. Chapter 84.33 RCW applies to timber lands and chapter 84.34 RCW applies primarily to agricultural lands and open space lands. To enroll in these programs, different criteria applies to categories based on parcel size. The three size catego-ries are over 20 acres; five to 20 acres; and under fiveacres. To determine the parcel size, multiple parcels thatare contiguous and held by the same ownership arecombined. There have been questions as to what the term \"same ownership\" is intended to include when the multiple par-cels of contiguous land is owned by different familymembers. Summary: The term \"same ownership\" is defined to in- clude multiple contiguous parcels that are managed as part of a single operation and (a) owned by members of thesame family, (b) legal entities wholly owned by members of the same family, or (c) a combination of individuals andentities that are wholly owned by members of the family. This definition applies to the chapters of the current use valuation law that apply to forest lands, farm and agricultural lands, and open space lands.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SSB 5364 C 102 L 11 Concerning public water system operating permits.

About 2000 small Group A water systems provide drinking water to ab out 8 percent of Washington households. Group A water systems have 15 or more ser-vice connections, or regularly serve 25 or more people on60 or more days per year. Roughly 13,000 Group B watersystems provide drinking water to about 2 percent ofWashington households. About 14 percent of Washingtonhouseholds obtain their dr inking water from individual wells. Group A Public Water System Operating Permit Fees . Group A public water systems must apply to the Depart- ment of Health (DOH) for an annual operating permit. Anew application must be submitted upon any change inownership of the system. Each application must be ac-companied by an annual fee as set in statute. DOH mayrequire that each applicatio n include information that is reasonable and necessary to determine that the systemcomplies with application st andards and requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and state laws. DOHmust act on permit applications within 120 days of receipt of the application or of any supplemental informationrequired to complete the application. Satellite System Management Agency Fees . The DOH must issue one operating permit to any approved sat- ellite system management ag ency, as defined by the DOH. The operating permit fee fo r approved satellite system management agencies is $1 per connection, per year forthe total number of connectio ns under the management of the approved satellite agency. Summary: The DOH must adopt rules establishing cate- gories of annual operating permit fees based on system size, complexity, and number of service connections. Feescharged must be sufficient to cover, but may not exceed,the costs to DOH of administering a program for safe andreliable drinking water. Group A Public Water System Operating Permit Fees . The DOH must use operating permit fees to monitor and enforce compliance of Group A water systems with stateand federal laws that govern planning, water use, efficien-cy, design, construction, operating, maintenance, financ-ing, management, and emergency response.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011ESSB 5371 C 315 L 11 Addressing the needs for health insurance coverage for persons under age nineteen. By Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senators Keiser and Conway). Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The federal Patient Protection and Afford- able Care Act (PPACA), passed in March 2010, requires all health insurance carriers to provide coverage for per- sons under age 19 without ap plication of pre-existing con- dition exclusions, for policies i ssued on or after September 23, 2010. Previously, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 19 96 (HIPAA) limited the ap- plication of pre-existing condition waiting periods undercertain conditions for all gr oup plans. PPACA extended the provisions to individual plans and self-insured plansfor all persons effective January 1, 2014, and personsunder 19 beginning in 2010. The federal Department of Health and Human Servic- es with the Department of Labor and the Department of theTreasury, has issued regulations for the enrollment of per-sons under age 19. All health plans must issue the cover-age as guarantee issue and may not apply health screening exams, known as the standa rd health questionnaire in Washington State. The Office of the Insurance Commis-sioner issued emergency rules to help guide insurance car-riers through implementation with the establishment of open enrollment periods and special enrollment qualifying events (such as loss of elig ibility for Medicaid or other public programs, loss of covera ge due to a divorce, loss of coverage due to a move out of a plan service area, or birthor adoption). The Washington State Health Insurance Pool (WSHIP), or high risk pool, is established in statute to pro-vide coverage for those person s that are rejected for indi- vidual health insurance as a result of the standard healthquestionnaire screening. The pool cannot reject an indi-vidual with pre-existing conditions but it does apply a six-month waiting period for co verage of pre-existing conditions. Summary: The state statutes governing regulated insur- ance carriers and health plans are modified to reflect the PPACA requirement to provide coverage for persons un-der age 19 without applica tion of pre-existing condition exclusions and without a hea lth screening exam. The re- quirement does not apply to a grandfathered plan, asestablished in PPACA. The Office of the Insura nce Commissioner (Commis- sioner) must establish rules defining the time frame for open enrollment, an opportun ity to be held at the same time each year when applican ts may enroll in individualSenate 28 21House 51 40 House 52 40 (House reconsidered) Senate 48 0 House 95 0SSB 5374 281health plan coverage without health screening or provid- ing other evidence of insurab ility. Rules must also define a special enrollment that is triggered by a specific qualifying event. The Commissioner must monitor the sale of individu- al health benefit plans and if an insurance carrier refuses tosell policies to persons under age 19 during open enroll-ment or special enrollment, a nd may issue fines or suspend or revoke the carrier license as provided in RCW 48.05. Eligibility for WSHIP, or high risk pool, is modified to include persons under 19 that do not have access to indi-vidual plan open enrollment or special enrollment, or the federal pre-existing condition in surance pool at the time of application. The pool may not impose any pre-existingcondition waiting period for any person under 19.

By Senators Hobbs and Benton. Senate Committee on Financ ial Institutions, Housing & Insurance House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Background: Washington State currently allows many types of businesses to form as Limited Liability Compa- nies (LLCs), or convert to LLCs. A LLC is formed by one or more individuals or entities through a special writtenagreement, which provides such details as management structure and distribution of profits or loss. LLCs are pop-ular because, similar to a cor poration, owners have limited personal liability for the de bts and actions of the LLC. LLCs also provide management flexibility and the benefitof pass-through taxation genera lly applied to partnerships. Trust companies are corporations other than banks, savings banks, or savings asso ciations that provide fidu- ciary and wealth management services. The Departmentof Financial Institutions (D FI) charters, examines, and regulates commercial banks, savings banks, and trust com- panies. In 2006 banks, bank holding companies, and sav-ings banks were authorized to form or convert to LLCsafter obtaining approval from DFI. A qualified financial ins titution intending to become an LLC must satisfy variou s regulatory requirements. Such requirements include, but are not limited to meeting minimum safety and soundness standards; prohibiting au-tomatic termination, dissolutio n, or suspension; and qual- ifying for insurability of deposits through the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation. Summary: A trust company may form or convert to a LLC after obtaining approval from DFI. Approval isbased upon the same cond itions set for banks, bank holding companies, and savings banks.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 48 1 House 90 2 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 49 0 House 97 0Senate 45 0House 92 0SSB 5385 282SSB 5385 C 339 L 11 Increasing revenue to the state wildlife account. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Regala, Ranker, Rockefeller and Fraser;by request of Department of Fish and Wildlife). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The State Wildlife Account is an appropri- ated account under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fish and Wildlife and accounts for 25 to 30 percent of theagency's budget. Monies in the Wildlife Account come from various sources and include department-issued li-censes and tags, sale of department property, administra-tive penalties, compensation fo r damage to property, and the Game and Fish Excise ta x. The Wildlife Account does not receive revenue from the sale of annual saltwater, ra-zor clam, and shellfish licenses. The Wildlife Accountalso does not receive any revenue from the sale of com-mercial fish-landing taxes. These revenues are depositedinto the General Fund. The Wildlife Account has hist orically been in revenue shortfall. In previous bienni a, the shortfall was backfilled with General Fund monies. In 2009 the Legislature ap-proved a 10 percent surcharge on hunting and fishing li-censes to increase revenue to the Wildlife Account. Thatincrease is set to expire on July 1, 2011. Licenses are pur-chased through the department's automated system, bothonline and at over 600 vendors throughout the state. Funds in the Wildlife Account are used to support de- partment activities. The inte rest generated by the Wildlife Account is transferred to the General Fund. Summary: Revenue to the stat e Wildlife Account is increased by: changing fees for recrea tional hunting and fishing licenses; moving all recreational hunting and fishing license revenue from the General Fund; creating a new admini strative surcharge for commercial hunting and fishing licenses; and allowing the Wildlife Account to retain interest from the account. License Fee Changes . The 10 percent surcharge on hunting and fishing licenses expires on September 1, 2011, when the new fees take effect. The price of mosthunting and fishing licenses are increased. About 40 per-cent of licenses either decrease in price or arediscontinued. The fee changes for individual fees vary significantly. Examples of some of the fee changes include: 1. Fishing: a. Freshwater Fishing License: Saltwater, Shellfish with Rockfish: from $48.20 to $54.25; d. Columbia River Salmon and Steelhead: from $8.00 to no change. 5. Hunting: a. Deer: from $45.20 to $44.90; b. Deer, Elk, Bear, Cougar: from $81.20 to $95.50; c. Small Game with a Big Game License: from $21.20 to $24.00; d. Migratory Bird Permit: from $12.50 to $17.00. Each license has a variable structure; a different amount is charged for residents, non-residents, youth, and disabled persons or veterans. The average change in fee, including both increases and decreases, by category ofuser is: resident: 16 percent increase; non-resident: 12 percent 2 percent increase; and disabled persons or veterans: 4 percent decrease. The recreational fee increases net revenue to the Wild- life Account by approximately $14.6 million per bienni- um. Much of this revenue is used to replace the revenuethat is no longer collected from the 10 percent surcharge. The revenue generated from fees is increased by more than20 percent. Moving Revenue from Genera l Fund to Wildlife Ac- count . Revenue from hunting and fishing license fees is moved from the General Fund to the Wildlife Account.The estimated revenue is approximately $3 million per bi-ennium. The revenue collected from saltwater, razor clam,and shellfish licenses is expended for management, en-hancement, research, and enforcement of shellfish andsaltwater programs. New Administrative Fees . Administrative fees for commercial fishing licenses ar e established. The adminis- trative fees are either $70 or $105 per license issued. Therevenue generated by the fees goes toward paying for thecost of administering the prog ram. The variability in price depends on the complexity of issuing the license. The ad-ministrative fees increase re venue by over $1 million per biennium. There is a discount for administrative fees thatare collected online. Interest . Interest from the fund balance in the Wildlife Account remains in the Wildlife Acco unt and is not transferred to the General Fund.

By Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care (originally sponsored by Senator Pridemore).Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Washington's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act permits a person to donate all or part of his or her body to another person, hospital, procurement organization, re-search institution, and other en tities for transplantation, re- search, or the advancement of science. An organ donormay indicate his or her intent to donate by signing a docu-ment of gift. This may be a driver's license or a donorcard. Approximately 90,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list; 1,20 0 of these are listed at the Washington State transplant centers. There is ongoing in-terest in improving the state' s system for organ donation as the need for organs continues to grow. Summary: A work group is created to study how other states and countries have developed sustainable programs for increasing organ donatio n in their communities. The work group will consider all current strategies and include representatives from designated organ procurement orga-nizations, funeral directors, a transplant center, the Wash-ington Medical Association, the Washington Hospital Association, a licensed eye bank, a tissue band, and a re-search organization. The work group will use no statefunds and report to the Legislature by December 30, 2011,with recommendations for increasing organ donations inWashington State.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5388 C 53 L 11 Limiting liability for making ce rtain land and water areas available for recreational use under a hydroelectric license. By Senators Parlette, Regala , Holmquist Newbry, Hatfield and Honeyford.Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters House Committee on Judiciary Background: Landowner Duty to Invitees Generally . Under Washington tort law, landowners generally owe persons invited to enter their land a duty to use ordinary care to keep that land in a reasonably safe condition. Thisincludes an affirmative duty to inspect the premises and discover dangerous conditions. Protection Under the Recrea tional Use Immunity Stat- ute. The Legislature modified this general rule through what is known as the Recrea tional Use Immunity Statute (statute). The stated purpose of the statute is to encourage landowners, or others in possession and control of land(collectively landowners), to make their land accessible tothe public for recreational pu rposes by limiting their tort liability. The statute generally provides protection from tort li- ability for landowners who allo w public use of their lands and do not charge a fee. Ho wever, landowners may charge an administrative fee of up to $25 to those cutting, gather-ing, and removing firewood from their land. Additionally,the following are not considered a fee for purposes of thestatute: (1) a license or perm it issued under the State Parks and Recreation Commission or the Fish and Wildlife stat-utes; and (2) a daily charge not to exceed $20 for access tocertain public off-road vehicle facilities. Limitations on the Protection Offered by the Statute . The liability protection offered under the statute is not ab- solute. The statute does not protect landowners from cer-tain dangerous conditions for which warning signs havenot been conspicuously post ed. Additionally, landowners who intentionally injure recreational users receive noprotection. Summary: The statute is amended to: specify that limited-liability protection applies to hydroelectric project owners who allow free recreation on their lands and water areas; specify that kayaking, canoeing, and rafting are types of outdoor recreation covered under the statute; and provide that releasing water and making water areas available for specified recreation and viewing oppor- tunities pursuant to, and in substantial compliance with, a federal hydroelectric license does not create a known dangerous artificial latent condition that would remove a landowner from protection under the statute. This protection applies to unintentionalinjuries sustained by recreational users and observers.

By Senators McAuliffe and Shin; by request of Department of Early Learning.Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Background: In 2007 the Legislature established the Ear- ly Learning Advisory Counc il (ELAC) to advise the De- partment of Early Learning (DEL) on statewide early learning needs and to develo p a statewide early learning plan. Twenty-three members are specified in statute. Ofthe 23 members, the Governor must appoint seven leadersin early childhood education, with at least one representa- tive with experience or expertise in the areas such as chil-dren with disabilities, the K- 12 system, family day care providers, and child care centers. Washington State has been awarded approximately $1.7 million over a three-year period under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to support itsState Advisory Council. In Washington, the State Adviso- ry Council is ELAC. The fe deral Head Start Act governs the requirements for fede rally funded State Advisory Councils, and specifies members that the State AdvisoryCouncil must include to the maximum extent possible. Created in 1965, Head Start is a federal program that provides comprehensiv e education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The federal government administers theHead Start program and directly contracts with providers.Since 1990 the Office of Head Start has funded Head Start- State Collaboration Office (HSS CO) grants to support the development of multi-agency and public-private partner- ships at the state and local levels. The HSSCO is housedat DEL. Part C of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Ed- ucation Act (IDEA) authorizes grants to states to assistthem in planning, developing, and implementing state-wide systems of early interven tion services for infants and toddlers and their families. Summary: Of the seven leaders in early childhood edu- cation whom the Governor must appoint, four of the seven appointees are as follows: the Head Start State Collaboration Office director or director's designee; a representative of a Head Start, Early Head Start, Migrant/Seasonal Head Start, or Tribal Head Start program; a representative of a local education agency; and a representative of the state agency responsible for programs under Part C of IDEA.

By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored by Se nators Nelson, Hill, Harper, Ei de, Shin, Kohl-Welles, Tom and Roach). Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: The Education Reform Act of 1993 includ- ed four goals for each school district, with the involvement of parents and community members, to provide opportuni-ties for every student to develop essential knowledge andskills. The goals remain in current law, as follows: 1. read with comprehension, write effectively, and com- municate successfully in a variety of ways and settings and with a variety of audiences; 2. know and apply the core concepts and principles of mathematics; social, physical, and life sciences; civ-ics and history, including different cultures and par- ticipation in representativ e government; geography; arts; and health and fitness; 3. think analytically, logically, and creatively, and to in- tegrate different experiences and knowledge to formreasoned judgments and solve problems; and 4. understand the importance of work and finance and how performance, effort, and decisions directly affectfuture career and educational opportunities. The Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI) is re- quired to develop state learning standards called Essential Academic Learning Requirements (EALRs) based on thefour student learning goals. Under current law, the con-cepts articulated under Goals Th ree and Four are to be in- tegrated into the EALRs an d assessments for Goals One and Two. The purpose of the assessment system is to de- termine if students have mastered the knowledge andskills of the EALRs. In 2007 the Legislature directed SPI to develop EALRs for educational technolo gy literacy and technolo- gy fluency, which were finalized in December of 2008.SPI was also required to obtain or develop classroom-based or project-based educational technology assess-ments. School districts are not required to use the assess- ments, but if they do, they must notify SPI of their use.SPI has developed a series of classroom-based assess-ments that measure students' knowledge and skills 0House 87 10SSB 5394 285educational technology EALRs. The assessments are scheduled to be available by July 2011. Summary: Under Goal Three of the student learning goals, school districts must pr ovide students with the op- portunity to integrate techno logy literacy and fluency along with other experiences and knowledge to form reasoned judgments and solve problems.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: September 1, 2011 SSB 5394 C 316 L 11 Concerning primary care health homes and chronic care management. By Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senators Keiser, Becker, Pflug, Conway, Kline and Parlette). Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: Legislation passed in 2008 directed the De- partment of Health (DOH) to create a medical home learn- ing collaborative as an opport unity to support the adoption of medical homes in a variety of primary care practice set-tings. The same legislation di rected the Health Care Au- thority (HCA) and the Department of Social and HealthServices (DSHS) to assess opportunities for changing pay- ment practices in ways that would better support develop-ment and maintenance of primary care medical homes.The three agencies jointly submitted a report on their efforts December 31, 2008. Legislation passed in 2009 directed the HCA and DSHS to design and implement one or more primary caremedical home reimbursement pi lot projects. The agencies facilitated discussions with priv ate payers and providers to collaborate and identify reimbursement methods thatwould align incentives to support primary care medicalhomes. The multi-payer pilot project has been designed, and the pilot project is on track to begin with the paymentdemonstration this spring. Summary: State health care purchasing efforts for the Medicaid, Basic Health, and Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) programs must include provisions in con-tracts that encourage broad implementation of primarycare health homes. Contracts must include provider reim-bursement methods that incent ivize chronic care manage- ment within health homes; provider reimbursementmethods that reward health homes that reduce emergency department and inpatient use; and promote providerparticipation in the training program (medical home learn- ing collaborative) developed by the DOH. Health homeservices may be prioritized to enrollees with complex, high cost, or multiple chronic conditions. Contract ex-penses must not be more than they would otherwise bewithout the health home pr ovisions. DSHS must work with the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Inno-vation and seek funding opportunities to support healthhomes. A health home is defined to mean primary care provid- ed by a primary care provider who coordinates all medicalcare, with a multi-disciplinary health care team. Primary care provider means a genera l practice physician, family practitioner, internist, pediatri cian, osteopath, naturopath, physicians assistant, osteopathic physician assistant, oradvanced registered nurse practitioner. A health care team includes, but is not limited to, medical specialists, nurses,pharmacists, nutritionists, die ticians, social workers, be- havioral and mental health providers including substanceuse disorder prevention and treatment providers, chiro-practors, physical therapists, alternative medicine practi- tioners, home care and other lo ng-term care providers, and physicians assistants. The HCA must coordinate a discussion with carriers to learn from successful chronic care management modelsand develop principles for ef fective reimbu rsement meth- ods to align incentives in support of patient centered chronic care health homes. The HCA must report to theLegislature by December 1, 2012, describing the princi- ples developed from the discussion and any steps taken bythe PEBB or carriers to implement the principles throughtheir payment methodology.

In 2000 the Legislature enacted legislation that estab- lished the fatality review proce ss. Subject to the availabil- ity of funds, the Department of Social and Health Servicesmust contract with an entity with expertise in domestic vi-olence (DV) policy and education and with a statewideperspective to coordinate re view of DV fatalities. The contractor is authorized to convene regional review pan-els, gather information for th e panels' use, provide training and technical assistance to the panels, compile informa-tion and issue reports with recommendations, and develop a protocol to be used as a guideline for how a panel shouldoperate and choose cases. Th e entity may convene a re- gional DV fatality revi ew panel to review any DV fatality. Regional DV fatality panels must include the following persons: medical personnel with expertise in DV abuse; coroners or medical examiners; county prosecuting attorneys and municipal attorneys; DV shelter service staff; law enforcement; local public health staff; CPS workers; community corrections staff; a perpetrator treatment program provider, and judges and/or court commissioners. The regional review panels may invite other relevant persons to serve on an ad hoc basis and serve as a full panel member for a particular review. The contractor must issue a biennial statewide report in December of even-numbere d years. The reports must contain recommendations on policy changes that would improve program performance, and issues identifiedthrough the work of the regional panels. Summary: The contracting entity is authorized to con- vene statewide issue-specific review panels to review any DV fatality, gather information for the use of a statewidereview panel, and provide training and technical assis-tance to a statewide panel. The requirement that thecoordinating entity issue biennial reports is removed. Regional DV review panels may, but are no longer re- quired to, include the statutory list of persons on every DVfatality review panel. School teachers, guidance counsel- ors, and student health servic es staff are added to the list of persons that may be included on the panel. Statewidespecific-issue panels must include persons with particularsubject matter expertise helpful to the panel. The state-wide issue specific panel must make periodic reports to the contractor and must make a final report to the contractorfor every fatality that is reviewed. The contractor may issue periodic reports. The re- quirement that the contractor issue biennial reports is removed. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5423 C 106 L 11 Modifying legal financia l obligation provisions. By Senate Committee on Hu man Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Se nators Regala, Hargrove, Chase and Kline). Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Background: Legal Financial Obligations . When a de- fendant is convicted of a crim e, the court may impose fi- nancial obligations as part of the judgment and sentence. Financial obligations include victim restitution; crime vic- tims' compensation fees; of defense; fines; and other costsassociated with the offense or sentence. An offender'spayments toward a legal fina ncial obligation are applied first to restitution, and then proportionally to other mone- tary obligations after restitu tion has been satisfied. Costs of incarceration, if ordered, are paid last. Interest on Legal Financial Obligations . Judgments for financial obligations in cr iminal proceedings bear in- terest from the date of judgment at the same rate that is ap- plicable to civil judgments. The rate of interest generally applicable to civil judgments is the greater of 12 percent or four points above the 26-week treasury bill rate. As a re-sult of low treasury bill rates, 12 percent has been the ap- plicable interest rate on criminal financial obligation judgments for almost two decades. Interest that accrues onthe restitution portion of the fi nancial obligation is paid to the victim of the offense. All other interest accruing on thejudgment is split between the state and the county asfollows: 25 percent to the state for the Public Safety and Education Account; 25 percent to the state for the Judicial Information System Account; and 50 percent to the county's current expense fund, 25 percent of which must be us ed to fund local courts. Waiver of Interest on Legal Financial Obligations . An offender may petition a court to reduce or waive the inter- est on legal financial obligatio ns as an incentive for the of- fender to pay the principal. The court may grant the petition only if the offender shows: a good faith effort to pay; interest accrual is causing a significant hardship;Senate 49 0 House 97 02SSB 5427 287 an inability to pay both the principal and interest; and that reduction or waiver of interest will enable full payment.\"Good faith effort\" means that the offender has either paid the principal amount in full or has made 24 consecu- tive monthly payments under a payment plan agreementwith the court. Interest on the restitution portion of a legal financial obligation judgment may not be waived, but may be reduced if the offender h as paid the restitution principal in full. Summary: Upon motion by an offender, the court must waive the interest on non-restitution legal financial obliga- tions that accrued during the te rm of total confinement for conviction that gave rise to the obligations, if the offender shows that the interest creates a hardship for the offenderor his or her immediate family. When showing a good faith effort to pay in order to al- low the court to reduce or waive interest on non-restitutionlegal financial obligations that accrued other than when an offender was incarcerated, a good faith effort means theoffender has made at least 15 monthly payments within an18 month period. The Administrative Office of the Courts must send billing statements for legal fi nancial obligations periodi- cally rather than monthly. A judgment lien on realproperty resulting from a criminal sentence does notexpire and remains in effect until the judgment is fully sat- isfied.

Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on EducationHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 2009 the Legislature provided $100,000 over the biennium, contingent on an equal match from pri- vate sources, for the Department of Early Learning (DEL)to work with the Office of Superintendent of Public In-struction (OSPI) and others to identify and test a kinder- garten assessment process and tools in geographicallydiverse school districts. During the fall of 2010, OSPIpiloted the Washington Kindergarten Inventory of Devel-oping Skills (WaKIDS). The pilot reached 2600 incoming kindergarteners who were in 115 classrooms around thestate. The purpose of WaKIDS is to gather information about the child in order to better inform teacher instruc- tion. DEL submitted a report to the Legislature on January15, 2011. A final report will be available in the summer of2011. In 2009 the Legislature redefined the minimum in- structional program of Basi c Education to include 180 days of half-day kindergarten, to be phased in to 180 daysof all-day kindergarten, beginning with schools with thehighest poverty levels. Schools receiving funding for all-day kindergarten have to agree to program requirements,including providing at least 10 00 hours of instruction, pro- viding a rich curriculum, and having connections withcommunity early learning programs and parents. In 2010the Legislature directed that, effective September 1, 2011,funding to implement all-day kindergarten must be phasedin until full statewide implem entation is achieved in the 2017-18 school year. Summary: Beginning with the 2011-12 school year on a voluntary basis and to the extent funds are available, schools receiving all-day kindergarten support must iden-tify the skills, knowledge, and characteristics of kindergar- ten students at the beginning of the school year in order tosupport social-emotional, physical, and cognitive growthand development of individual children; support earlylearning provider and parent involvement; and inform in- struction. Kindergarten teachers must administerWaKIDS, as directed by the Superintendent of Public In-struction (SPI) in consultatio n with DEL, and report the results to the SPI, who will share the results with the Director of DEL. Beginning in the 2012-13 sc hool year, to the extent funds are available, WaKIDS must be administered to allstudents enrolled in state-funded all-day kindergarten pro-grams. Parents and guardians may excuse their studentsfrom participating in WaKIDS. Until full-implementation of state-funded full-day kindergarten, the SPI, in consultation with the Director ofDEL, may grant annually renewa ble waivers in order to al- low the administration of kindergarten assessments otherthan WaKIDS. An application for the waiver must include specified components. Before implementing WaKIDS, the SPI and DEL must ensure that a fairness and bias review of the assess-ment process has been conducted, including an opportuni-ty for input from the Achievement Gap Oversight andAccountability Committee an d an additional diverse group of stakeholders.Senate 46 1House 53 39SSB 5428 288Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 September 1, 2011 (Section 1) SSB 5428 C 107 L 11 Requiring notification to schoo ls regarding the release of certain offenders. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Se nators McAuliffe, Harper, Hargrove, Stevens, Zarelli, Pr idemore, Shin and Roach). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Background: A person who is required to register as a sex or kidnapping offender must give notice to the county sheriff within three days prior to arriving at a school or in- stitution of higher education to attend classes, prior to starting work at an institution of higher education, and af- ter any termination of enro llment or employment at a school or institution. The sherif f is, in turn, required to no- tify the school's principal or institution's department of public safety. If the student is a risk level II or III, the prin-cipal must provide informatio n about the student to every teacher of the student and any other personnel who, in thejudgment of the principal, supe rvises the student, or for se- curity purposes, should be awar e of the student's record. If the student is a risk level I, information may only be re- leased to personnel who, in the judgment of the principal, should be aware of the student's record. When a juvenile who was ad judicated of a violent of- fense, a sex offense, or stal king will be released from the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA), JRA mustnotify the chief of police, the sheriff, any private schools, and the school district board of directors in the vicinity inwhich the juvenile intends to reside. Notice must be provided at least 30 days pr ior to the juvenile's release. Summary: No later than 30 days prior to a youth's re- lease, the Department of Corrections (DOC) must notifythe school district board of directors of the district inwhich the offender last attend ed school when the youth (1) is 21 years of age or younger; (2) has been found to havecommitted a violent offense, sex offense, or stalking; and(3) last attended school in this state.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SSB 5436 C 248 L 11 Regarding the use of antifou ling paints on recreational water vessels. By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Ranker, Shin,Litzow, Swecker, Tom, Harper, Nelson, Hobbs, Fraser,Rockefeller, White, Kilm er, Conway and Kline). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine WatersHouse Committee on Environment Background: Aquatic antifouling paints are used on wa- ter vessel hulls to prevent the growth of aquatic organisms such as barnacles and algae. Most of these antifouling paints use copper to reduce the growth. According to a 2007 study, the Department of Ecology (DOE) has conducted research measuring copper concen-trations in marinas and found the primary source of copperto be from the antifouling paints found on boat hulls. Re- search has shown copper to be highly toxic to aquatic life. Summary: Recreational water vessels are defined as a vessel that is less than 65 fe et in length, and used primarily for pleasure or leased, rented, or chartered to a person forthe pleasure of that person. It does not include a vesselthat is subject to United Stat es Coast Guard inspection and is engaged in commercial use or carries payingpassengers. After January 1, 2018, new recreational water vessels with antifouling paint containi ng copper may not be sold in the state. Beginning Januar y 1, 2020, the sale of copper antifouling paint intended fo r use on recreational water vessels is prohibited. DOE is required to be resp onsible for the enforcement of the chapter. The money fro m the civil penalties collect- ed must be deposited into the state Toxics ControlAccount. DOE may establish a state wide advisory committee after January 1, 2016, to assi st DOE in the implementation of the Act. DOE is also required to study how antifoulingpaints affect marine organisms and water quality. Thestudy is in addition to the re quirement to survey the man- ufacturers of antifouling pain ts to determine the type of paints available and report the findings of the survey to the Legislature by January 1, 2018. DOE may adopt rules to implement the act.

By Senate Committee on High er Education & Workforce Development (originally sponsored by Senators Shin, Tom, Kilmer, White and Chase). Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development House Committee on Higher Education Background: Some public and private colleges and uni- versities offer students the op portunity to obtain a bacca- laureate degree in three years. The requirements of these accelerated baccalaureate programs vary. Frequently, these accelerated degree prog rams require summer school attendance, prior colle ge credits earned during high school through such programs as Advanced Placement and Run-ning Start, or enrollment fo r the maximum credits allowed per quarter. The University of Washington (UW) has a program, called The Husky Advantage, that makes it easier for stu-dents entering the university with a high number of Ad- vanced Placement or Running Start credits to complete a bachelor's degree in three years. Through careful planningand advising, these students can complete general educa- tion requirements and fulfill the requirements of certain majors, mostly in the Colleg e of Arts and Sciences. The Evergreen State College (TESC) reports that 9 percent of those entering as first year students graduate inthree years. Summary: The state and regional universities and TESC may develop accelerated baccalaureate degree programs that will allow academically qu alified students to obtain a baccalaureate degree in three years without attending sum-mer classes or enrolling in more than a full-time class loadduring the regular academic year. Qualified students insuch programs must be allowed to begin course workwithin their academic field during their first term or semester of enrollment. The universities and TESC mu st report on their plans for these accelerated programs to the Higher EducationCoordinating Board for approval.

By Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care (orig- inally sponsored by Senato rs Keiser, Pflug, White, Conway and Kline; by request of Governor Gregoire). Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: The federal Patient Protection and Afford- able Care Act (PPACA), passed in March 2010, requires states to establish health insurance exchanges (Exchange) by January 1, 2014, to facilita te the purchase of individual insurance and small employer group insurance, and pro- vide access to premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc-tions for individuals with family incomes between 133 percent and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level(FPL). Individuals with in come below 133 percent will have access to expanded Medicaid programs. The federalsubsidies for individuals will on ly be available through the Exchange, or through a fede ral Basic Health option that states may choose to have available for individuals withfamily income between 133 pe rcent and 200 percent of the FPL. The Exchanges are responsible for a number of functions or services, including: certifying qualified health plans that may offer products; seamless linking with Medicaid eligibility and enrollment; verifying income and citizenship status; ensuring the benefit packages offered include the essential health benefits and are available at four benefit values - 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent; applying risk adjustment and reinsurance; operating a toll free hotline and consumer portal that allows comparison shopping and premiumcalculation and facilitates enrollment; and adjudicating appeals. Exchanges may be administered by public agencies, private nonprofit entities, or some combination. States have a number of policy decisions about the structure and focus of the Exchange, and must demonstrate good prog-ress toward development of an Exchange by January 1, 2013, as certified by the federal Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS). HHS has made grant fundingavailable to all states to help with the research and plan-ning, and has recently announce d the availability of addi- tional grant opportunities to fund the development and implementation. HHS will es tablish an Exchange for res- idents and small employer groups in states that choose notto establish their own Exchange. Senate 46 3House 91 3SSB 5445 290Summary: The state must establish an Exchange consistent with PPACA intending to: increase access to qua lity affordable health care coverage; provide consumer choi ce and portability of health insurance, regardless of employment status; create an organized insurance marketplace that provides access to federal subsidies; promote consumer literacy and empower consumers to compare plans and make informed decisions about health care; effectively administer subsidies and determine eligibility for all su bsidized programs; create a health insurance market that competes on the basis of price, quality, service, and other innovative efforts; operate in a manner compatible with efforts to improve quality, contain costs, and promoteinnovation; recognize the need for a private health insurance market to exist outs ide the exchange; and recognize that the regulati on of the insurance market, inside and outside the exch ange, should continue to be performed by the Insurance Commissioner. The Exchange is established as a public-private part- nership separate and distinct from the state, exercising functions delineated by the act. By January 1, 2014, the Exchange must be operational, consistent with federal law, and subject to statutory author ization. The powers and du- ties of the Exchange and the Board are limited to thosenecessary to apply for and administer grants, establish in-formation technology infrastructure, and other administra-tive functions necessary to begin operating the Exchangeby January 1, 2014.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESSB 5457 C 373 L 11 Providing a congestion reduction charge to fund the operational and capital needs of transit agencies. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators White, Shin, Harper, Nelson, Keiser, Pren tice, Kline and McAuliffe). Senate Committee on TransportationHouse Committee on Transportation Background: There are 31 transit systems operating in the state. Transit systems are special purpose districts au- thorized to provide public transportation services within their respective boundaries. These transit systems can beformed under a variety of di fferent governance structures, including public transportation benefit areas (PTBAs),metropolitan municipal corpor ations, county transporta- tion authorities, city-owned transit systems, and regionaltransit authorities. To fund capital and operating expenses, transit sys- tems are authorized to seek voter approval of up to 0.9 per-cent in sales and use tax. Most transit systems may also seek voter approval of a business and occupation tax and ahousehold tax in lieu of a sales and use tax. Fares may be set and increased by the tran sit agency's governing body without voter approval. Summary: A metropolitan municipal corporation may impose, upon a two-thirds ma jority approval of the gov- erning body of the system or by a simple majority vote of the people, a congestion reduc tion charge for certain vehi- cles of up to $20. This charge remains in effect until twoyears after it is imposed or June 30, 2014, which ever comes first. Public transportation syst ems that impose a conges- tion reduction charge are required to complete a conges-tion reduction plan prior to implementation as well as reports detailing the expenditures of the congestionreduction charge. The proceeds from the charge must be used in a man- ner that is consistent with recommendations of a regional transit taskforce, if one was completed in the past twoyears.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Kline, Ke iser, Regala and McAuliffe). Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state operates five residential habilita- tion centers (RHC) established in statute to provide servic- es and housing for persons with developmentaldisabilities: Rainier School in Buckley, Lakeland Village in Medical Lake, Fircrest Sc hool in Shoreline, Frances Haddon Morgan Children's Center in Bremerton, and Ya-kima Valley School in Selah. Today approximately 900individuals reside in RHCs, as permanent residents, forshort term or respite stays. There are 36 individuals under age 21. Over the years there have b een repeated efforts to re- duce the number of people in RHCs as trends for providing services to persons with de velopmental disabilities have increasingly focused on doing so in community settings.Today, the Department of Social and Health Services (de-partment) provides community -based services through a number of programs to approximately 20,000 clients.These are designed as alterna tives to institutions for eligi- ble individuals with develo pmental disabilities who either live with family members, in rented housing, or in con- tracted or licensed residential housing in the community.Besides the individuals who receive some services eitherthrough RHC or in the commun ity, an estimated 14,000 el- igible clients do not receive any paid services due to lack of available funding. Currently the department is implementing plans to close two of the five RHCs: Frances Haddon Morgan, byJune 30, 2011, and Yakima Valley School by December31, 2012. The closure of the se facilities is included in the Governor's proposed budget for the 2011-2013 biennium.All of the 50 residents of Frances Haddon Morgan will berelocated to either a community residential placement,such as a state operated living arrangement (SOLA) or toone of three remaining RHCs. The department plans to set up three new SOLAs, and is currently working with Fi rcrest, Lakeland, and Rainier to accommodate residents leaving Frances HaddonMorgan who do not want a community placement. It is planned that the first ten residents leaving Yakima Valley School will do so by th e end of 2011. The depart- ment is planning to establis h crisis stabilization programs for children and adults using, where possible, institutional staff who will no longer be employed at the closedfacilities. Summary: Persons under the age of 16 may not be admit- ted to a Residential Habilitati on Center. Persons between ages 16 and 21 may be admitted for short-term crisis orrespite care. Frances Haddon Morgan Center must close by De- cember 31, 2011. Admissions to Yakima Valley Schoolare frozen except for limited, short-term admissions forcrisis and respite. When the resident population at YVSreaches 16 individuals, the institution will cease to exist asan RHC. The current operation of 12 crisis stabilization and re- spite beds at Yakima Valley School is maintained, andthese beds will stay in operation after the institution nolonger operates as an RHC. The Department of Social and Health Services must establish State Operated Living Alternatives (SOLAs) forclients who are transitioning out of RHCs and upon federal approval, must convert two cottages at both Frances Had-don Morgan Center and Yakima Valley School intoSOLAs that will operate after these institutions close. DSHS must offer RHC employees opportunities to work in the SOLAs as they are established. Any savings achieved by the closure of Frances Had- don Morgan Center must be used for additional communi-ty resources including state-staffed crisis and respiteservices. Up to eight state-staffed crisis stabilization beds and up to eight respite beds are established throughout thestate. A legislative task force is established to make recom- mendations on the long term need for RHC capacity; de- velop a plan for efficient co nsolidation of institutional capacity; recommend strategi es for the use of surplus property that results from the closure of RHCs; and pro-vide strategies for reframing the mission of Yakima ValleySchool.

VETO MESSAGE ON 2SSB 5459 June 15, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning, without my appr oval as to Sections 7 and 11, Second Substitute Se nate Bill 5459 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to services for people with developmental disabilities.\"This bill makes a number of c hanges that address the increased provision of services to persons with developmental disabilities in community settings. It reduces admissions to residential habilita- tion centers, closes the Franc es Haddon Morgan Center by De- cember 31, 2011, provides fo r relocation and alternatives, and strengthens the array of suppor t available in communities. Section 7 of this bill mandates that the Department of Social and Health Services provide a series of processes and se rvices that as- sist successful client transitions into the community. Most provi- sions in this section are current practices within the Department, including the following: person- centered approaches to discharge plans, family mentoring, offering residential habi litation center employees opportunities for employment in community settings, offering residents leav ing a residential habil itation center the abil- ity to return, and maximizing federal funding. Approv al of Section 7 is not required to implement these approaches. However, Section 7(2)(f)(vii) could be interpreted to mandate that the Department provide new transportation servic es and other supports to assist family and friends in maintaini ng regular contact with residents who have moved out of a residen tial habilitation center. While I agree that clients should maintain contact with their family and friends, this subsection could cr eate a broad, undefined require- ment that is also unfunded. The type, frequency, and costs of trans- portation are not easily asse ssed. Because these unknown elements present serious conc erns about unanticipated fiscal impacts, I am vetoing Section 7. Section 11 mandates that the Department annually submit a re- port to the Legislature regardi ng persons who hav e transitioned from residential habilitation center s to the community. Much of the information required for this re port is already gathered as a stan- dard part of the client assessmen t and existing quality assurances processes. Aggregating and assembling client-specific information into a new report is a significant unfunded mandate. Although I am vetoing this sectio n, I am directing the Depart- ment to share the various reports related to the quality of client transitions and community-based se rvices with the Legislature. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 7 and 11 of Second Substitute Senate Bill 5459. With the exception of Sec tions 7 and 11, Second Substitute Senate Bill 5459 is approved.

By Senators Kohl-Welles, Hobbs, Eide, Keiser, Fraser, Prentice and Conway. Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance House Committee on Comm unity Development & Housing House Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Background: Affordable Housing for All Surcharge . There is a $10 recording surcha rge fee, of which the coun- ty auditor retains up to 5 pe rcent for the collection and ad- ministration of the funds. Forty percent of the funds collected are remitted to the state Affordable Housing for All Account. The Departme nt of Commerce (Commerce) uses these funds to provide housing and shelter for ex-tremely low-income households. The remaining fundsmay be used by the counties to fund eligible housingactivities for very low-income households, with priority for extremely low-income households by funding: the acquisition, constr uction, or rehabilitation of housing projects, including units for homeownership, rental units, farm worker housing, and single-room occupancy units; supporting building operation and maintenance costs of housing projects; rental assistance vouchers; and operating costs for emergency shelters and overnight shelters.Homeless Housing Recording Surcharge . The Legis- lature enacted the Homeless Housing and Assistance Act in 2005, the goal of which is to reduce homelessness by 50 percent statewide and in each co unty by July 1, 2015. This goal is to be achieved throug h the creation of plans to ad- dress the causes of homelessness and the implementation of solutions to homelessness through state and countyhomeless housing programs. The Homeless Housing andAssistance Program is funded by a $10 surcharge for cer-tain documents recorded by th e county auditor. Of that $10 surcharge: the auditor retains 2 percent; 60 percent of the remain ing funds remain within the participating county of origin; any city which assumes responsibility for reducing homelessness within its boundaries receives a per-centage of the surcharge equal to the percentage of the city's local portion of the real estate excise tax; and the remaining monies are remitted to Commerce and deposited into the Home S ecurity Fund, a nonappro- priated account, of which 12.5 percent is used for administering the Homeless Housing Program, and the remaining funds provid e housing and shelter for the homeless. During the 2009-2011 and 2011-2013 biennia, the $10 surcharge is increased to $30. There is also an $8 recording surcharge, of which: 90 percent of the funds ar e remitted to the county for its homeless housing plans and programs thataccomplished the goals of the county's plan; and the remaining funds are deposited into the Home Security Fund and used by Commerce programadministration, housing and shelter assistance forhomeless persons, and the Homeless Housing Grant Program. Summary: The funds received by both Commerce and counties under the Affordable Housing for All Surcharge may be used to house victims of human trafficking, and their families. Funds from th e Home Security Fund may also be used to house victim s of human trafficking, and their families.Senate 45 2House 91 5ESSB 5485 2011 ESSB 5485 C 341 L 11 Maximizing the use of our state's natural resources. By Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy (originally sponsored by Senators Hargrove and Ranker). Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy House Committee on Environment House Committee on Capital Budget Background: It is the policy of the st ate to ensure that en- ergy conservation practices and renewable energy systems are used in the design of major publicly owned or leasedfacilities. Whenever a public agency determines that amajor facility should be cons tructed or renovated, the agency must conduct a life-cycle cost analysis that in-cludes energy costs as well as all operating costs. A life-cycle analysis must conform to guidelines established bythe Department of General Administration (GA). In addi-tion, all major public fac ility projects receiving capital funding must be designed, co nstructed, and certified to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver standard. Life-cycle assessments review every impact associat- ed with all stages of a process from extracting raw materi-als through manufacturing, distributing, using, repairing,maintaining, recycling, or disposing. Life-cycle assess-ment can provide a broader review on the environmental,social, and economic concerns related to a product. Embodied energy is the amount of energy needed to extract, transport, manufacture, install, and recycle or dis-pose of a product or service. Methodologies to determineembodied energy vary as to the scale and scope of the use and type of embodied energy. Summary: The University of Washington (UW) College of Built Environments and th e Washington State Universi- ty (WSU) College of Engin eering and Architecture must complete a review of other states' existing building codes, international standards, peer-reviewed research and mod-els of life-cycle assessment, embodied energy and embod-ied carbon in building materials. The review mustidentify: if standards and models are developed according to recognized consensus-based process, and could be implemented as part of building standards or building codes; and the scope of life-cycle impacts addressed in the standards and models.The UW and WSU must report to the Legislature recommendations for methodologies to: determine if a standard, model, or tool using life- cycle assessment can be suff iciently developed to be incorporated into the state Building Code; develop a comprehensive guideline using common and consistent metrics for embodied energy, carbon, and life-cycle accounting of building materials; and incorporate ongoing monitoring, verification, and reporting of a high performance public building overits life cycle. UW and WSU must seek input from design represen- tatives, construction professionals, academics, building materials industries, and life-cycle assessment experts. GA must make recommendations for streamlining statutory requirements of life-cycle cost analysis, energyconservation in design, and high performance buildingsusing the report from UW and WSU. If specific funding is not included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, this bill is null and void.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5487 C 306 L 11 Regarding eggs and egg products in intrastate commerce. By Senate Committee on Ag riculture & Rural Economic Development (originally sponsored by Senators Schoesler, Hatfield, Hobbs, Delvin, Honeyford, Becker and Shin). Senate Committee on Agri culture & Rural Economic Development House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: The Department of Agriculture (WSDA) administers the Wholesome Eggs and Egg Products Act.

With oversight by the Director of the Washington De- partment of Agriculture, the Commission promotes Wash-ington beer and may conduct research, promotional, andeducational campaigns. The Commission may also pro-mote Washington-grown hops , malting barley, and wheat. To fund its activities, th e Commission assesses affect- ed brewers and sells beer at Commission-sponsored beerfestivals.Summary: The 100,000 barrel annual production limit onbrewers assessed and represented by the Commission isdeleted, enabling any state-licensed brewer to be assessedand represented by the Commission.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5495 C 42 L 11 Concerning shareholder quorum and voting requirements under the Washington business corporation act. By Senate Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles and Pflug).Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Washington Business Corporations Act (WBCA) provides default ru les with respect to quo- rum and voting requirements fo r corporate actions. A cor- poration may alter these requirements in its articles of incorporation as long as the altered quorum and voting re-quirements meet certain minimum standards in theWBCA. In some instances, a voting group representing a par- ticular class or series of shares may be entitled to vote sep-arately on proposed corporate actions. When separatevoting by voting groups is required, quorum and voting re-quirements must be met for the voting group representing all shares entitled to vote on the action, as well as for each voting group entitled to vote separately on the action. Quorum Requirements . The WBCA provides that a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on an action repre- sents a quorum. The articles of incorporation may providefor a greater or lesser quorum requirement as long as it is not less than one-third of vot es entitled to be cast on the action. V oting Requirements . Generally the WBCA provides that if a quorum exists, corporate action is approved if thevotes approving the corporate action exceed the votes op- posing the corporate action, unless the articles require agreater voting requirement. However, there are a number of corporate actions that may be taken by the board of directors only upon approvalof the shareholders, and approval of these actions is sub-ject to different voting requirements. These actions in-clude amendments to some provisions of the articles ofincorporation; mergers or share exchanges; the sale of theassets of the corporation other than in the regular course ofbusiness; and dissolution of th e corporation. With respect to these actions, the WBCA generally requires the actionto be approved by two-thirds of the votes entitled to becast. The articles of incorporation may require a greater orSenate 34 13House 70 27 (House amended)Senate 32 14 (Senate concurred)Senate 46 3House 92 0SB 5500 298lesser voting requirement as long as the voting require- ment is not less than a major ity of all votes entitled to be cast on the action. Summary: The WBCA is amended to establish alterna- tive shareholder quorum and voting requirements that are applicable to corporations th at have foreign shareholders and meet other specified criteria. Alternative Quorum Requirements . The required quorum of the voting group co nsisting of all shares enti- tled to be cast, and of each voting group entitled to vote separately on the action, is the lesser of: a majority of the shares other than shares credited to stock depositories located in a member state of the European Union, as long as this majority equals or exceeds one-sixth of the total votes entitled to be cast by the voting group; or one-third of the total votes entitled to be cast by the voting group. Alternative V oting Requirements . The vote required for approval by any voting group entitled to vote on the corporate action is a majority of the votes actually cast by the voting group, as long as the votes approving the actionequal or exceed 15 percent of the votes within the voting group. This alternative voting requ irement applies to the fol- lowing corporate actions: amendment of the articles of in-corporation or bylaws; plan of merger or share exchange;disposition of all or substantially all of the corporation'sproperty not in the usual and regular course of business;and dissolution. Criteria for Alternative Quorum and V oting Require- ments . A corporation must meet all of the following re- quirements in order to be subject to the alternative shareholder quorum and voting requirements: As of the record date of the annual or special meeting of shareholders, the corporation is a public company, shares of its common stock are listed on a EuropeanUnion regulated market, and at least 20 percent of the corporation's shares are credited to the accounts of stock depositories located in a member state of theEuropean Union. At the time such shares were initially listed on the European Union regulated market, the corporation's shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The listing of shares on th e European Union regulated market was a condition to the acquisition of 100 per- cent of the equity interests of a foreign corporation and certain other conditions relating to the acquisition are met. At the corporation's most recent annual or specialmeeting less than 65 percent of the shares within thevoting group comprising al l the votes entitled to be cast were present in person or by proxy.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 13, 2011 SB 5500 C 249 L 11 Concerning the rule-making process for state economic policy. By Senators Senate Committee on Econom ic Development, Trade & Innovation House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs Background: Under current law, all state agencies and lo- cal governments with rule -making authority have to consider economic values in the rule-making process. In 1994 the Legislature adopted the Regulatory Fair- ness Act to protect small bu sinesses from being dispropor- tionately impacted by stat e regulation. Under certain circumstances the statute requires agencies to prepare a Small Business Economic Impact Statement (SBEIS)when adopting a rule. If disproportionate impact on smallbusiness is found in the impact statement, agencies must,where legal and feasible, re duce the costs imposed on small businesses by a rule. When an SBEIS is required on a rule, agencies must either directly notify known interested small businesses orprovide information on the rule to publications likely to be obtained by affected small businesses. Summary: A legislative finding states that government decisions can have negative consequences for businesses and employees. Those with rule-making authority have toconsider economic impacts in the rule-making process. Agencies must consider specified methods to reduce the impact of a proposed rule on small businesses, includ-ing those suggested by small businesses or small business advocates. When an SBEIS is required on a rule, agencies must provide notice of the rule directly to known interestedsmall businesses, through publ ications likely to be ob- tained by affected small businesses, and via posting on theagency website.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 49 0 House 91 1 Senate 47 0 House 95 0SB 5501 299SB 5501 C 55 L 11 Concerning the taxation of employee meals provided without specific charge. By Senators Murray, Kilm er, Schoesler, Conway, Honeyford, Kohl-Welles, Keiser, Shin, Holmquist Newbry and White.Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Retail sales and use taxes are imposed by the state, most cities, and all counties. Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangible per- sonal property, digital products, and some services. A re-tail sale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of the property, digital product, or service. If retail sales taxeswere not collected when the property, digital products, orservices were acquired by the user, then use taxes apply to the value of most tangible personal property and digitalproducts and some services when used in this state. Thestate sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent. Local tax ratesvary from 0.5 percent to 3.0 percent, depending on thelocation. Food and food ingredients purchased for human con- sumption are exempt from sa les and use tax. However, prepared meals are generally subject to the retail sales or use tax. Prepared meals are meals that are: sold in a heated state or heated by the seller; sold with eating utensils provided by the seller; and food in which two or more food ingredients are mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item. Washington's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gross receipts of business ac tivities conducted within the state, without any deduction for the costs of doing busi- ness. Revenues are deposited in the state General Fund. Abusiness may have more than one B&O tax rate, depend-ing on the types of activities conducted. There are a num- ber of different rates. The main rates are 0.471 percent forretailing; 0.484 percent for manufacturing, wholesaling, and extracting; and 1.8 percent for professional andpersonal services, and activ ities not classified elsewhere. Meals provided to employees free of charge are con- sidered to be in exchange for services received from the employee and thus are subject to the sales tax and retailingclassification of the B&O tax. Summary: A B&O tax and a sales and use tax exemption are provided to restaurants for meals provided to employees without a specific charge to the employee. Restaurant is defined to be any establishment having special space and accommodati on where food and bever- ages are regularly sold to the public for immediate, but not necessarily on-site, consumption. The term restaurantexcludes grocery stores, mini-markets, and conveniencestores. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 SSB 5502 C 374 L 11 Concerning the regulation, operations, and safety of limousine carriers. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators Litzow, Harper, Fain, Swecker, Delvin and Shin). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on TransportationHouse Committee on General Government Appropriations & Oversight Background: Currently, all limousine carriers must oper- ate from a main office. However, no office may be solelyin a vehicle. All arrangemen ts for the carrier's services must be made through its of fices and dispatched to the carrier's vehicles. The Department of Licensing (DOL) and/or the Wash- ington State Patrol (WSP) must regulate limousine carrierswith entry, safet y equipment insp ections, chauf- feur qualifications, and operations. Under certain circum-stances, a port district, city, or county may regulatelimousines. A limousine carrier may adve rtise its services with a number of limitations. A chauffeur may not operate a limousine unless he or she is at least 21 years of ag e, holds a valid driver's license, has successfully completed a tr aining course approved by DOL, has successfully passed a written examination, hassuccessfully completed a back ground check, and has sub- mitted a medical certificate certifying his or her fitness asa chauffeur. DOL may adopt and enforce fee setting rules. Summary: Contact by a customer or customer's agent toengage the services of a carri er's limousine must be initi- ated by a customer or custom er's agent at a time and place different from the customer's time and place of departure.Under no circumstances ma y customers or customers' agents make arrangements to immediately engage the ser- vices of a carrier's limousine with the chauffeur. However,a limousine carrier is no long er required to operate from a main office. Further, chauffeurs are re quired to do the following: generally substantiate the prearrangement of business through written electronic records;Senate 49 0House 91 1SSB 5504 300 list a physical address on their master business license where records may be reviewed; and list a telephone number or pager number on their master business license that is used to prearrange the carrier's services. WSP, and in some instances a port district or city, must conduct annual limousine safe ty inspections, random re- cords inspections, and other la w enforcement activities re- lating to state laws or rules ap plicable to limousine carriers and chauffeurs. No limousine carrier may operate a limousine upon the highways of this state without the following: registration as a business in Washington; a unified business identifier; a limousine carrier license; liability and property damage insurance; a limousine vehicle certificate for each limousine operated by a carrier. A number of penalties may be incurred by a carrier, chauffeur, or a third party for not complying with rules regarding proper advertisement. Among other requirements fo r a chauffeur to operate a limousine, the chauffeur must have passed an initial con-trolled substance test, partic ipate in random controlled substance testing, and have a satisfactory driving record. Any fee related to limousine vehicle certificates must not exceed $75; any fee related to a limousine carrier li-cense for a business must not exceed $350; and any fee re-lated to limousine vehicle inspections must not exceed $25. DOL must convene an internal workgroup regarding the issuance of chauffeur licenses and must provide a re-port on its recommendations on this issue to the Legislature. A Limousine Carriers Account is created in the state treasury where all receipts from each civil infraction andviolation regarding limousi ne regulations must be deposited. A cooperative agreement is re quired that allows for lo- cal enforcement of limousine la ws to restrict the fee reve- nue use by a city to the costs of enforcing state laws orrules applicable to limousine carriers and chauffeurs. A contract for payment to a third party to solicit cus- tomers is required to be stored at the limousine carrier'sbusiness premises and requires limousines engaged in the services detailed in the contract to carry a certificateverifying the existence of a current contract. A limousine chauffeur is requ ired to file a physician's certification with the limousine carrier upon initialapplication and every two years thereafter.

DEL may assess civil monetary penalties against an agency providing child care se rvices without being prop- erly licensed. Monetary penalties levied against unli- censed agencies will be forgiven if the agency submits a license application within 30 days of being notified that they need to be licensed and subsequently become li-censed. Civil monetary penalties are not to exceed $75 perviolation for a family child care home. DEL must report on its public website the following licensing actions taken agains t agency licensees: suspen- sion; surrender; revocation; denial, stayed suspension, orreinstatement of a license. When it receives a report that an agency is providing child care services without a license, DEL sends that agen-cy a letter ordering them to stop providing child care ser-vices immediately and notifying them that they could beassessed a monetary penalty if they do not. The letter alsostates that the agency must be licensed in order to provide child care services. Summary: DEL may impose civil monetary penalties of not more than $150 per viol ation for a family child care home. DEL must post on its public website those agencies subject to licensure that ha ve not initiated the licensing process within the 30-day pe riod following notification by DEL that they need to become licensed.

By Senators Hill, Chase, Fain, Pridemore, Stevens, Swecker, Honeyford and Schoesler.Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on Local Government Background: Annexations and Population Determina- tions . Annexations by cities, towns, and code cities, while governed by separate statutes, share a common require- ment for the annexing jurisd iction to determine the resi- dent population of the territory to be annexed. Suchpopulation determinations mu st be accomplished using the practice of actual enumer ation, conducted in accor- dance with the practices and policies, and subject to theapproval of the Office of Financial Management (OFM),which uses the information supplied through the annexa- tion process in annually calcu lating the population of all cities and towns in the state. State-shared revenues fro m the gasoline tax, liquor board profits, and the liquor excise tax are distributed to cities on the basis of popu lation as determined by OFM. For a city to have its popula tion adjusted for an annexation for purposes of state-shared revenue distributions, OFMmust certify the annexation, after which it notifies theappropriate state agencies of the population change. For purposes of state-shared revenues, the revised city boundaries and the new population are not recognized un-til the date that OFM approves the annexation certificate submitted to it by the city. Federal Census Blocks . The United States Census counts every resident in the United States. It is mandatedby Article I, section 2 of th e U.S. Constitution, takes place every ten years, and must be accomplished using actualenumeration. Among other purposes, decennial census data is used to determine th e distribution of Congressional seats to states, to make de cisions about what community services to provide, and to distribute federal funds to local,state, and tribal governments. Census blocks are the smallest geographic area for which the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) collects and tabu- lates decennial census data. Generally, they are formed by streets, roads, railroads, streams and other bodies of water,other visible physical and cultural features, and the legalboundaries shown on Bureau maps. Senate 47 1 House 57 39 (House amended)Senate 47 1 (Senate concurred)SSB 5525 302Summary: Actual enumeration must be used to account for the population of territory to be annexed if: the annexing city has a population of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants; the territory to be annexed consists entirely of one or more partial census blocks; or the annexation does not occur within the 12 months immediately following release of the 2010 federal decennial census data. An annexing city may always choose to use actual enumeration to determine the population of territory to be annexed. However, if the c ity or town does not use actual enumeration for determining population within the 12 months immediately following the release of the 2010 fed-eral decennial census data, its determination of thepopulation of the area to be annexed must consist of: relevant 2010 federal decennial census data, as updated by the OFM, pertai ning to the population of any complete census block or blocks located within the territory to be annexed; an actual enumeration of any population residing within the annexed territory but outside any complete census block or blocks; and an actual enumeration of group quarters, mobile home parks, certain apartment buildings, missing subdivisions, and closures of any of these structures or complexes that are loca ted within a complete cen- sus block if the OFM confirms the existence of a known census error and identifies one or more of these structures or complexes as the source of theerror. If an annexing city is using 2010 federal decennial census data, and at least two we eks prior to the date of an- nexation, the OFM confirms a known census error within a complete federal census block, the OFM may require thecity to enumerate the population of certain group quarters,mobile home parks, apartmen t complexes, missing subdi- visions, and closures of any of these structures orcomplexes within that block. An actual enumeration must be conducted pursuant to the policies and procedures, and subject to the approval, ofthe OFM, and the annexing city is responsible for the full cost of determining the popu lation of the territory to be annexed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: May 12, 2011SSB 5525 C 363 L 11 Concerning hospital benefit zones that have already formed. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Kilmer and Carrell).Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 2006 the Legislature authorized coun- ties, cities and towns to finan ce public improvements in a defined area with a new form of tax increment financing. The defined area, called a benefit zone, must include ahospital that has received a cer tificate of need. Local gov- ernments may establish a hospital benefit zone (HBZ) tofinance public infrastructure improvements. Revenue forthe projects is generated through a new local sales and usetax, up to $2 million per proj ect per year, credits against the state sales and use tax, and matched with an equivalentamount of local resources. Monies collected under the lo- cal tax credited against the state tax must be matched withan amount from local public sources dedicated throughDecember 31 of the previous calendar year to finance pub-lic improvements authorized under chapter 39.100 RCW.Eligible public improvement projects include streets, wa-ter and sewer systems, parkin g facilities, sidewalks, street lighting, and parks. Summary: The definition of public improvements is amended to include construc tion, maintenance, and im- provement of state highways th at are connected to the ben- efit zone, including interchang es connected to the benefit zone. A local government may modify the public improve- ments to be financed with the use of HBZ financing by amending the enabling ordinance and holding a publichearing, provided that th e total cost of the public improvements is not increased. Local public sources may include amounts expended by a hospital in the zone sin ce the date of formation of the zone and may be applied to the year or years designated bythe local government. The definition of items ex cluded from local public sources are amended to exclude local government fundsderived from the state-subsidized portion of any state loanor state grant.

By Senators Regala, Delv in, Eide, and McAuliffe.Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Technology, Energy & Communications House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Business and Occupation Tax . Washing- ton's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gross receiptsof business activities conducte d within the state, without any deduction for the costs of doing business. Revenuesare deposited in the state Ge neral Fund. A business may have more than one B&O tax rate, depending on the typesof activities conducted. There are a number of differentrates. The main rates are 0. 471 percent for retailing; 0.484 percent for manufacturing, wholesaling, and extracting;and 1.8 percent for professional and personal services, andactivities not classified else where until June 30, 2013 (at which time the 0.3 percent rate surcharge expires and theB&O rate for service and other category is 1.5 percentthereafter). Solar Energy Systems - B&O Preferential Rates . In 2005 the Legislature provided a reduced B&O tax rate of0.2904 percent for manufacturers, proc essors for hire, or wholesalers of solar energy systems using photovoltaic modules or silicon components of these systems. In 2009 the Legislature modified this tax preference by allowing alower B&O rate of 0.275 percent for businesses that man-ufacture or sell at wholesale either (1) solar energy sys-tems using photovolta ic modules; or (2) solar grade silicon and an expanded list of materials to be used exclusively inthe components solar systems or semiconductors. Thelower B&O tax rate expires on June 30, 2014. Cost-Recovery Incentive Payment Program for Re- newable Energy Systems . In 2005 the Legislature created a Renewable Energy Cost-Recovery Incentive Program(Cost-Recovery Incentive Pr ogram) to promote renewable energy systems located in W ashington that produce elec- tricity from solar, wind, or an aerobic digesters. An indi- vidual, business, or local government purchasing aneligible system may apply fo r an incentive payment from the electric utility serving th e applicant. The incentiveprovides at least $0.15 for each kilowatt-hour of energy produced, with extra incentives for solar generating sys-tems or wind generating systems that use certain compo-nents manufactured in Washington. Payments are cappedat $5,000 annually per applicant. A utility providing incentiv e payments is allowed a credit against its public u tility tax (PUT) for incentives paid, limited to $100,000 or 0.5 percent of its taxable pow-er sales, whichever is greater. If the amount of requests forincentive payments exceeds th e amount of funds available for PUT credit to the utility, the incentive payments toapplicants must be reduced proportionally. The Cost-recovery Incen tive Program expires June 30, 2020. Community Solar Projects . In 2009 and in 2010 the Legislature expanded the Cost-Recovery Incentive Pro- gram to include community solar projects. Community solar projects are defined as either (1) a solar energy sys-tem owned by local individual s, households, or non-utility businesses that is placed on the property owned by theircooperating local government entity; (2) a utility-owned solar energy system that is voluntarily funded by the utili- ty's ratepayers where, in ex change for their financial sup- port, the utility gives contribu tors a payment or credit on their utility bill for the value of the electricity produced bythe project; or (3) a company-owned solar energy systemthat is a limited liability comp any, a cooperative, or a mutual corporation or association. Community solar projects are eligible to receive in- centives of $0.30 for each kilowatt-hour of energy pro-duced, unless the amount of requests for incentivepayments exceeds the amount authorized for credit to util- ity, in which case the incent ive payments to applicants must be reduced proportionally. Payments to a community solar project are capped at $5,000 annually per applicant. Incentive payments to par ticipants in a utility-owned community solar project may only account for up to 25 percent of the total allowabl e credit. Incentive payments to participants in a company-owned community solar proj- ect may only account for up to 5 percent of the total allow- able credit. Only community solar projects capable of generating up to 75 kilowatts of electricity may receive cost-recoveryincentive payments. Summary: Businesses that manufacture stirling convert- ers are eligible to receive a business and occupation tax rate of 0.275 percent. A stirling converter is define d as a device that produc- es electricity by converting heat from a solar source usinga stirling engine.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5531 C 343 L 11 Reimbursing counties for pr oviding judicial services involving mental health commitments. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Sena tors King, Prentice, Keiser and Shin). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: A person may be detained for involuntary commitment if a designated mental health professional finds, following investigation, that due to a mental disor- der the person presents a likelihood of serious harm or isgravely disabled. Detention for longer than a 72-hour pe-riod requires court review an d the detained individual is afforded an array of due pr ocess protections including the right to counsel, confrontation of witnesses, and a jury trial under certain circumstances. Detention for civil commitmen t occurs at an evalua- tion and treatment facility (E &T). Twelve counties in Washington have E&Ts. These E&Ts are found in nine ofthe 13 Regional Support Networks (RSNs). Because E&Tresources are not spread evenly across the state, countieswhich have E&Ts frequently ser ve patients who were de- tained outside of th e county and RSN wh ere the E&T is lo- cated. An estimated 38 percent of all civil commitmentcases filed in 2009 were filed outside the RSN where thepatient was originally detained. An RSN currently reimburses counties for the judicial costs of civil commitment in two ways. First, the RSNpays a filing fee of $230 of wh ich 54 percent is retained by the county and 46 perc ent is transmitted to the state. Sec- ond, many RSNs pay direct reimbursement fees to thecounties which host civil commitment hearings. All reim-bursement funds are paid using non-Medicaid funding. Inrevenue and expenditure report s filed with the Department of Social and Health Services, the RSNs reported spending $4.3 million on judicial costs in fiscal year 2009 and $6.5million in fiscal year 2010. A survey distributed to coun- ties in 2010 suggests that the actual cost of providing judi- cial services in civil commitment cases was an estimated$6.6 million in calendar year 2009. Summary: A county may seek reimbursement from its RSN for its cost of providing judicial services. The RSNin which the patient resides must reimburse the RSN which serves the county of comm itment. The rate of reim- bursement for each county must be based on an average of actual expenditures within the county over the past threeyears. The Joint Legislative Audit & Review Committeemust conduct an independent assessment of the county ju-dicial costs in all counties which had at least 20 involun-tary commitment cases in th e previous year. This independent assessment must include a review and analy-sis of the reasons for cost di fferences between the counties and a recommendation as to how the costs may be updated in the future. No filing f ee may be assessed for any com- mitment case subject to reimburs ement under this act. The judicial costs related to 180-day civil commitment hear-ings at the state hospitals are excluded from reimburse-ment procedures. Maintenance-of-effort funds paid bycounties to support the judici al services of involuntary commitment must be expended for other purposes that fur- ther treatment for mental health and chemical dependencydisorders.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 (Section 3) July 1, 2012 SSB 5538 C 56 L 11 Concerning members of certain nonprofit conservation corps programs.

Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: The National and Community Service Trust Act (Act) was enacted in 1993 and established theCorporation for National and Community Service. TheAct launched AmeriCorps, a network of programs thatpromote national service in education, public safety,health, and the environment. Language in the Act speci- fies living allowances and other benefits provided to par- ticipants, and the United States Department of Labor hasdetermined that AmeriCorps participants are exempt from federal Davis-Bacon Act labor standards, which establish a prevailing wage for government public projects. The Legislature created the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC) in 1983 to provide work experience andskills to the youth of the state between the ages of 18 and25.

When thenational AmeriCorps program began in 1994, the WSCbecame part of the national se rvice movement and now all WSC members are also AmeriC orps members. The WSC works with nonprofit organizations and local governmentsto address a variety of community needs. The WSC is ad-ministered by the Washington State Employment Security Department with federal funding provided by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Summary: Participants in a conservation corps program offered by a nonprofit organization are exempt from pro-visions related to rates of compensation while performing environmental and trail maintenance work. The nonprofitmust be affiliated with a na tional service organization es- tablished under the Nationa l and Community Service Trust Act, registered with the Secretary of State, and haveits management and administrative headquarters locatedin state.

By Senate Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Senators Hobbs, Delvin, King and Hewitt). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Under current law, the driver of a vehicle, upon overtaking or meeting from either direction anyschool bus which has stopped on the roadway for the pur-pose of receiving or dischargi ng any school children, must stop the vehicle before reachi ng the school bus when there is in operation a visual stop signal on the school bus. Thedriver must not proceed until the school bus resumesmotion or the visual stop signals are no longer activated. Summary: An automated school bus safety camera is a device affixed to a school bus for the purposes of record- ing one or more sequenced photographs of the rear of a ve-hicle that drives past school buses when the stop paddle and flashing lights are deployed.School districts are authorized to install automated school bus safety cameras on school buses to detect vehi-cles that fail to stop for a school bus that displays a stopsignal if the use of the cameras is approved by a vote of theschool district board of directors. How the photographs may be taken and used, how long the photographs may be retained, and how theinfractions are issued is limited. How school districts may enter into contracts with camera vendors and how the vendors may be compensatedis limited. Infractions issued by automated school bus safety cameras must be processed lik e parking infractions and any revenue collected, less the cost to operate the program, must be remitted to school di stricts for school zone safety projects. The maximum monetary penalt y for failure to stop for a school bus that displays a stop signal is limited, when theinfraction is generated by an automated school bus safetycamera, to twice the amount permitted under the penalty schedule. The maximum amount of the penalty is currently set at $394.

By Senate Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles, De Fraser, Keiser, Rockefeller, Regala, Kline, Holmquist Newbry, King, Shin, White, Stevens, Roach and Conway). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness Background: In 2000 the United States enacted the Traf- ficking Victims Protection Act; and, in 2003 Washingtonwas the first state to pass a law criminalizing humantrafficking. According to the 10th annual trafficking in persons re- port produced by the United States Department of State,the United States is a source, transit, and destination coun-try for men, women, and children subjected to traffickingin persons, specifically forced labor, debt bondage, andforced prostitution. Traffick ing occurs primarily for labor and most commonly in dom estic servitude, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial services, hotel services, con-struction, health and elder care, hair and nail salons, andstrip club dancing. Traffick ing cases also involve passportSenate 48 0House 91 1Senate 49 0House 93 45 1 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5555 306confiscation, nonpayment or limited payment of wages, restriction of movement, is olation from the community, and physical and sexual abuse as means of keeping victimsin compelled service. The 2008 report produced by theWashington State Task For ce Against the Trafficking of Humans indicates that several factors make Washingtonprone to human trafficking. The factors cited are Wash-ington's international border with Canada, an abundanceof ports, vast rural areas, an d a dependency on agricultural workers. A person commits the crime of trafficking when he or she recruits, harbors, transpor ts, provides, or obtains an- other person knowing that force, fraud, or coercion will beused to cause that person to engage in forced labor or in- voluntary servitude. The crim e is also committed when a person benefits financially or otherwise from participating in such acts. It is trafficking in the first degree if these acts include committing or attempting to commit kidnapping; involve a finding of sexual motivation; or result in a death.Trafficking in the first degree is a class A felony, ranked atseriousness level XIV for purposes of sentencing. Traf-ficking in the second degree is committed when a personrecruits, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains another person knowing that force, fraud, or coercion will be usedto cause that person to engage in forced labor or involun- tary servitude. The crime is also committed when a person benefits financially or otherw ise from participating in such acts. Trafficking in the second degree is a class A felony,ranked at seriousness level XII. Summary: A person commits the crime of trafficking when he or she recruits, harbors, transports, transfers, pro- vides, obtains, or receives another person knowing thatforce, fraud, or coercion is u sed to cause that person to en- gage in forced labor, involu ntary servitude, or a commer- cial sex act. The crime is also committed when a personbenefits financially or otherw ise from participating in the recruitment, harboring, tran sporting, transferring, provid- ing, obtaining, or receiving another person knowing thatforce, fraud, or coercion is u sed to cause that person to en- gage in forced labor, involu ntary servitude, or a commer- cial sex act. It is trafficking in the first degree if these actsinclude committing or attemp ting to commit kidnapping, involve a finding of sexual mo tivation, result in a death, or involve illegal harvesting an d sale of human organs. Trafficking in the second degree is committed when a person recruits, harbors, transports, transfers, provides,obtains, or receives another person knowing that force,fraud, or coercion is used to cause that person to engage inforced labor, involuntary servitude, or a commercial sexact. The crime is also comm itted when a person benefits financially or otherwise from participation in the abovedescribed illegal acts. Forced labor is defined as knowingly providing or ob- taining labor or services of a pe rson by (1) threats of seri- ous harm to, or physical restraint against, that person oranother person; or (2) means of any scheme, plan, orpattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if the person did not perform such la bor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physicalrestraint. A definition is pr ovided for involuntary servi- tude. It means a condition of servitude in which the victimwas forced to work by the use or threat of physical re-straint or physical injury, or by the use of threat of coercionthrough law or legal process. Serious harm means any harm, whether physical or non physical, including psycho- logical, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficientlyserious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to com-pel a reasonable person of the same background and in thesame circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor, services, or a commerci al sex act in order to avoid incurring that harm. A commercial sex act is defined asany act of sexual contact or sexual intercourse for which something of value is given or received.

By Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy (originally sponsored by Senators Parlette, Hatfield,Morton, Honeyford and Hewitt). Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: Washington operates under a water right permit system. The right to use water that has been put tobeneficial use is, and remains, an appurtenance of the landor place where the water is used. The Department of Ecol-ogy (Ecology) may permit certai n changes to a water right. Ecology may also permit a transfer of a water right fromone holder to another. In processing change or transfer ap-plications, Ecology analyzes the validity, limits, and quan- tity of the right. If it appears that the transfer of the waterright, change of point of diversion, or purpose of use canbe made without harming ex isting rights, Ecology must grant the transfer or change.Senate 48 0 House 96 0SSB 5574 307Summary: For counties located east of the crest of the Cascade mountains, Ecology may only approve a change or transfer application for an interbasin water rights trans- fer after providing notice elec tronically to the board of county commissioners in the county of origin upon receipt of an application.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5574 C 57 L 11 Concerning collection agencies. By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Harper and Kline). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: Collection agencies are prohibited from en- gaging in certain practices when attempting to collect debts. A collection agency cannot threaten a debtor with impairment of the debtor's credit rating if a claim is notpaid. Credit agencies cannot harass a debtor. Certainbehaviors are presumed to be harassment, including: communicating with a debtor more than three times in a single week; communicating with a debtor at the debtor's place of employment more than one time in a single week; or communicating with a debtor or spouse at his or her residence between 9:00 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. Collection agencies are requ ired to provide a debtor with an itemization of the amounts the collection agency will seek to collect on the claim. This information must be included in the first claim no tice sent to the debtor and includes the following: the amount owing on th e original obligation at the time it was received by the collection agency; interest or service charge, collection costs, or late payment charges, if any, ad ded by the original credi- tor before it was received by the collection agency; interest or service charge, if any, added by the collec- tion agency customer or assignor after it was received by the collection agency; collection costs, if any, the collection agency is attempting to collect; attorneys' fees, if any, that the collection agency is attempting to collect on its behalf or on the behalf ofthe customer or assignor; and any other charge or fee that the collection agency is attempting to collect on its behalf or on behalf of thecustomer or assignor.Collection agencies have to include this information in subsequent notices if the amount owed changes. If a debtor disputes a claim in writing, the collection agencymust forward a copy of the dispute to the credit reportingbureau. Summary: The prohibition that a collection agency can- not give or send to any debtor any notice, letter, message,or form which represents or implies that a claim existswithout including certain info rmation does not apply when it is through proper legal action, process, or proceedings.If the notice, letter, message, or form concerns a judgment against the debtor, no itemization of the amounts con-tained in the judgment is required, excep t postjudgment interest and the current account balance. When the debtor provides the collection agency with written notice disputing the cl aim, the collection agency must inform the credit reporting bureau, by written or elec-tronic means of the dispute, and create a record of the dis-pute and when the notification was provided to the credit reporting bureau. Advising a debtor that the collection agency has re- ported or intends to report a claim to a credit reportingagency (CRA) is not considered a threat if the collection agency has reported or intend s to report the claim to a CRA. If a collection agency comm unicates with a debtor or spouse more than three times in a single week and it is in response to a communication from the debtor or spouse, itis not presumed to be harassment. If a collection agencycommunicates with a debtor at his or her place of employ-ment more than one time in a single week and it is in re- sponse to a communication from the debtor, it is notpresumed to be harassment. A call to a telephone is pre- sumed to be received in the time zone for the area code of the number. If an area code is not assigned to any specificgeographic area, the time zone is presumed to be the localtime zone of the debtor's last known place of residence.The presumptions do not ap ply if the collection agency reasonably believes the telephon e is located in a different time zone. A collection agency may attempt to communicate with a debtor by way of a cellular telephone, provided theagency cannot cause ch arges to be incurred to the recipient more than three times in any calendar week when the agency knows or reasonably sh ould know that the number belongs to a cellular telephone, unless the agency is re- sponding to a communicatio n from the debtor. A collec- tion agency does not violate th is restri ction if, at least monthly, it updates its record s with information provided by a commercial provider of cellular telephone lists andthe agency calls a number that does not appear in the most recent list provided by the commercial provider. Collec- tion agencies are prohibited from calling or sending a textmessage to a cellular telephone more than twice a daywhen it knows or reasonably should know the number be- longs to a cellular teleph one, unless the agency isSenate 48 0House 93 0SSB 5579 308responding to a communication from the debtor. The agency does not violate this r estriction if it updates its re- cords with information provid ed by a commercial provider of cellular telephone lists and the agency calls a numberthat does not appear in the most recent list provided by thecommercial provider. Inten tional blocking of an agency's telephone number by the agency when it calls a debtor'scellular telephone is prohibited. It is prohibited to bring an action or initiate an arbitra- tion proceeding on a claim when the collection agencyknows or reasonably should know that the suit orarbitration is barred by an applicable statute of limitation.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5579 C 307 L 11 Modifying harassment provisions. By Senate Committee on Judiciary (originally sponsored by Senators Kline and Pflug). Senate Committee on Judiciary House Committee on Judiciary Background: A victim of unlawful harassment (the peti- tioner) may obtain a civil anti-harassment protection order if the petitioner fears violence or suffers substantial emo-tional distress from an unrelated person (the respondent)because the petitioner has been seriously alarmed, an-noyed, or harassed by the r espondent through conduct that serves no legitimate or lawful purpose. Anti-harassmentprotection orders are separate and distinct from domesticviolence protection orders, restraining orders, andno-contact orders. There are three types of trial courts in Washington: su- perior courts, district courts, and municipal courts. Eachhas differing levels of jurisdiction over the subject matterareas. District courts have jurisdiction to grant anti-ha-rassment protection orders and municipal courts may optto exercise jurisdiction by adopting procedures through lo-cal court rules. Superior courts have concurrent jurisdic-tion when a case is transferred from a district court ormunicipal court. A transfer to superior court is requiredwhen the respondent is under 18 years of age. In addition, a district court or municipal court may transfer an actionfor an anti-harassment protectio n order to a superior court when a judge makes findings of fact and conclusions of law showing that meritorious reasons exist for the transfer. The petitioner may request that a district court grant an anti-harassment protection order against the respondent.If the court finds by a prepon derance of the evidence that unlawful harassment exists, it must grant an order to thepetitioner that prohibits the respondent from engaging inthe harassment. A knowing violation of ananti-harassment protection orde r is a gross misdemeanor. The filing fee and service of process costs are waived if the petitioner is seeking an anti-harassment protection order to obtain relief from (1 ) a person who has stalked him or her; (2) a person who has engaged in conduct thatwould constitute a sex offense; or (3) a family or house-hold member who has engaged in conduct that constitutes domestic violence. Summary: District courts have original jurisdiction to grant civil anti-harassment protection orders and munici- pal courts may opt to exerci se jurisdiction by adopting procedures through local court ru les. The district court or municipal court must transfer proceedings to the superior court if (1) the respondent to the petition is under 18 yearsof age; (2) the action involves title or possession of realproperty; (3) a superior court has exercised or is exercisingjurisdiction over a proceeding in volving the parties; or (4) the action would have the effect of interfering with a re-spondent's care, control, or custody of the respondent'sminor child. Prior to granting an ex parte temporary anti-harass- ment protection order or a civil anti-harassment protectionorder, the court may consult the judicial information sys- tem for records regarding cr iminal histories and other current proceedings involving the parties. In granting an ex parte temporary anti-harassment protection order or a civil an ti-harassment protection, the court cannot restrict the re spondent's (1) constitutionally protected free speech; (2) use or enjoyment of his or herreal property unless the orde r is related to dissolution pro- ceedings or a separate action involving the title or posses- sion of real property; and (3) right to care, control, orcustody of his or her minor child, unless the order is relat-ed to dissolution proceedings , non-parental actions for child custody, or proceed ings under the Uniform Parentage Act or the Family Reconciliation Act. An intentional violation of a court order by a defen- dant charged with a crime involving harassment underRCW 9A.46.040, or the equivalent local ordinance, is amisdemeanor. A willful violation of a court order by a defendant found guilty of the crime of harassment issued under RCW 9A.46.080, or the equivalent local ordinance, is amisdemeanor.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Keiser, Parlette, Hargrove, Shin, Conway and Kline). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The current Washington Medicaid program provides health and long-term care assistance to low-in- come individuals, is administered by the state in compli-ance with federal laws and regulations, and is jointly funded using state and federa l dollars. The federal funds are matching funds, and are referred to as the Federal Fi-nancial Participation (FFP) or the Federal Medical Assis- tance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is calculated basedon average per-capita income and is usually between 50and 51 percent for Washington. Typically, the state pays the remainder using stat e General Fund dollars. Medicaid law and regulations provide for a particular Medicaid funding vehicle that states can utilize to fund aportion of their state share of Medicaid program costs.This funding vehicle is often referred to as a Medicaid pro-vider tax or, sometimes, as a provider assessment or pro-vider fee. States can use the proceeds from the tax to makeMedicaid provider payments and claim the federal match-ing share of those payments. Essentially, states use theproceeds from the provider tax to offset a portion of thestate funds that would have been required to fund the Med-icaid program. Federal regulations define the rules forMedicaid provider taxes. Nineteen different types of providers are included in the permissible classes of health care providers and, assuch, can be included in a provider tax. Some examplesinclude inpatient hospital serv ices, outpatient hospital ser- vices, skilled nursing facility services, and physician services. Specifically, provider taxes must: be imposed on a permissible class of health-care services; be broad-based, or apply to all providers within a class; be uniform or apply the same rate to all providers within a class; and avoid hold-harmless arrangements in which collected taxes are returned directly or indirectly to taxpayers. A state can request a waiver from the broad-based and uniform requirements, and the hold-harmless provision doesn't apply if the tax is at or below 5.5 percent of provid-er revenues. This threshold of 5.5 percent of revenues ap-plies through federal Fiscal Year 2011; thereafter thethreshold is 6.0 percent of revenues. If a waiver of thebroad-based and uniform requirements is requested thenthe state must show that the tax is generally redistributiveand the amount of the tax is not directly correlated to Med- icaid payments. Federal regulations lay out detailed statis-tical tests that states must us e to show this; essentially the tests are designed to measure the degree to which the Med-icaid program incurs a greater tax burden than if the broad-based and uniform requirements were met or not waived. Currently 44 states, including Washington, and the District of Columbia have at least one type of Medicaidprovider tax. Skilled nursing facilities (nursing homes) are licensed by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS)and provide 24-hour supervised nursing care, personalcare, therapy, nutrition management, organized activities,social services, laundry ser vices, and room and board to three or more residents. Currently, there are over 200licensed facilities throughout the state. Medicaid rates for nursing fa cilities (i.e., payments for providing care and services to eligible, low-income resi- dents) are generally based on a facility's costs, its occupan- cy level, and the individual care needs of its residents. The nursing home rate methodology, including formu- la variables, allowable cost s, and accounting/auditing pro- cedures, is specified in stat ute (RCW 74.46) and is based on calculations for seven di fferent components: direct care, therapy care, support services, operations, variablereturn, property, and a financin g allowance. The rate cal- culation for the noncapital comp onents (direct care, thera- py care, support services, and operations) is based on actual facility cost reports that are typically updated bien-nially in a process known as rebasing. The capital compo-nents (property and financing allowance) are also based on actual facility cost reports bu t are rebased annually. The variable-return compon ent is designed to reward efficien- cy based on the four noncapital components. The vari-able-return component is currently scheduled to be repealed on July 1, 2011. Additional factors that enter into the rate calculations are resident days (the total of the days in residence for alleligible residents), certain median lids (a percent of themedian costs for all facilities in a peer group), facility geo-graphical location, and the c ase-mix index of the facility. The case-mix index is a weig hted scoring of all facility residents, designed to quantif y the relative acuity of the residents. Finally, RCW 74.46.421 im poses a rate ceiling, com- monly referred to as the budget dial. The budget dial is asingle daily-rate amount calculated as the statewideweighted average maximum payment rate for a fiscal year.This amount is specified in the appropriations act, and DSHS must manage all facility-specific rates so thebudget dial is not exceeded. Summary: Nursing Home Rate Methodology Changes : Rebasing is postponed fo r one year and the cycle for rebasing moves to every odd-numbered year. The finance component's ra te on return for all tangi- ble assets is reduced to 4.0 percent, regardless of dateSB 5584 310of purchase. This is changed from 8.5 percent for purchases on or after May 17, 1999, and 10 percent for purchases before May 17, 1999. DSHS is authorized to adjust the case-mix index for the ten lowest acuity resource utilization groups toany case-mix index that aids in achieving cost-efficient care. Minimum occupancy requirements are raised in the rate components of operat ions, property, and financ- ing allowance by 3.0 percent for large providers andby 2.0 percent for small providers and essential community providers. Median cost lids are lowe red by 2.0 percentage points for direct care and support services. DSHS is instructed to provide rate add-ons based on a comparison of the 2010 and 2011 rates and also for homes that experienced incr eases in client acuity as demonstrated by changes in their direct-carecomponent. Nursing Home Safety Net Assessment . The fee is as- sessed on a per-resident-day basis. It does not apply to Medicare residents and cert ain types of facilities are exempt from paying the fee. The exemptions are: continuing-care retirem ent communities, as defined in the act; nursing facilities with 35 or fewer beds; state, county, tribal, and public-hospital-district operated nursing facilities; and hospital-based nursing facilities. In addition, DSHS must administer the fee in a tiered manner such that a lower fee is assessed for either certain high-volume Medicaid nursing facilities, as defined, or certain facilities with high-resident volumes. This actdoes not shield the lower fee th at is to be assessed so that the statistical redistributive te sts required by federal law are met. The act establishes the Skil led Nursing Facility Safety Net Trust Fund (Trust Fund) and directs all proceeds fromthe fee into this fund. The Trust Fund is subject toappropriation and can be used for: immediate pass-through to nursing facilities or rate add-on to reimburse the Medicaid share of the fee; maintenance and enhancement of the Medicaid nursing-facility rates; and administration of the co llection and disbursement of the fee (however, these administrative expenses can- not exceed one-half of 1.0 percent of the proceedsfrom the fee). The act instructs DSHS to handle certain administra- tive and operational duties relating to the assessment of the safety-net fee and regarding the use of the proceeds. In ad-dition, DSHS is instructed to work with the Department of Health and two professional stakeholder organizations -the Washington State Health Care Association and AgingServices of Washington - to design a system of skilled- nursing facility quality-incen tive benchmarks and related payments. The design of these incentive payments mustbe submitted to the Legislat ure by December 15, 2011. The act provides that, beginning with fiscal year 2013, thesafety-net assessment fee may be increased to support anadditional 1.0 percent increase in the nursing facility pay-ment rate for facilities that meet the quality-incentive benchmarks. Certain delinquency penalties are provided, including withholding the facility's medical assistance reimburse- ment payments, suspension or revocation of the nursingfacility license, or imposition of a civil fine. Finally, nursing facilities are prohibited from itemiz- ing the safety-net assessment on invoices to residents orthird-party payers. The sections of the act crea ting and dealing with the implementation of the safe ty-net assessment and quality- incentive payments are null and void if the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not ap-prove the waiver of the broad-based and uniform require-ments or does not approve the state Medicaid planamendment incorporating the fee into the plan. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 SB 5584 C 308 L 11 Concerning the conforming of apprenticeship program standards to federal labor standards. By Senators Harper, Kohl-Welles and Kline; by request of Department of Labor & Industries. Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: The Washington State Apprenticeship and Training Council (WSATC) is a seven member board that establishes apprenticeship progr am standards as rules and approves apprenticeship training programs. The Depart-ment of Labor and Indust ries (L&I) works with the WSATC to oversee and administer the apprenticeshipprogram. The Secretary of the United States Department of La- bor delegates to the state au thority to certify apprentice- ship programs for federal purposes. Apprentices thatcomplete certified programs are recognized as qualified journey workers nationwide. The Secretary delegates au-thority only if state apprenti ceship law conforms with fed- eral apprenticeship federalSenate 27 17House 54 38ESSB 5585 311regulations in December of 2008 require that a state ap- prenticeship agency, and not a state apprenticeship coun-cil, have responsibility and accountability forapprenticeship within the state. States must be incompliance with these change s by December 29, 2010. Summary: L&I is the agency with responsibility and ac- countability for apprenticeship within the state for federal purposes. L&I has rulemaking authority for apprentice- ships but must consult with the WSATC prior to adoptingrules. Any decision of the WSATC affecting registrationand oversight of apprenticesh ip programs and agreements may be appealed to L&I within 30 days.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESSB 5585 C 114 L 11 Concerning street rod and custom vehicles. By Senate Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Senator Carrell). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Currently, a street rod vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, that meets the following conditions: the vehicle was manufactured before 1949; the vehicle has been assembled or reconstructed using major component parts of a motor vehicle manufactured before 1949; or the vehicle was assembled or manufactured after 1949, to resemble a vehicle manufactured before1949; and the vehicle has been modified in its body style or design through the use of nonoriginal or reproductioncomponents, such as frame, engine, drive train, sus- pension, or brakes in a manner that does not adversely affect its safe performance as a motor vehicle or render it unlawful for highway use; or the body has been constructed from nonoriginal mate- rials or has been altered dimensionally or in shape and appearance from the orig inal manufactured body. Further, a parts car is currently defined as a motor ve- hicle that is owned by a collector to furnish parts for resto- ration or maintenance of a collector vehicle, thus enablinga collector to preserve, restore, and maintain such avehicle. Summary: A street rod vehicle is defined as a motor ve- hicle that is a 1948 or older vehicle or the vehicle was manufactured after 1948 to resemble a vehicle manufac-tured before 1949 and has altera tions to one or more of themajor component parts that ch ange the appearance or per- formance of the vehicle from the original manufacturer's design or has a body constructed from nonoriginalmaterials. A custom vehicle is defined as: a motor vehicle that is at least 30 years old and of a model year after 1948; or was manufactured to resemble a vehicle at least 30 years old and of a model year after 1948; and has alterations to one or more of the major compo- nent parts that changes the appearance or perfor- mance of the vehicle from the original manufacturer's design or has a body constructed from nonoriginalmaterials. The presence of modern equipment including, but not limited to, brakes, engines, or seat belts or the presence of optional equipment on a street rod or custom vehicle doesnot invalidate the year of ma nufacture on the certificate of title. A procedure for submitting an application for a certif- icate of title for a street rod vehicle or a custom vehicle forthe first time is outlined. A ve hicle registration issued to a street rod or custom vehicle need not be an initial vehicleregistration for the vehicle. Current law which excludes certain vehicles from emission test requirements is amended to include streetrod and custom vehicles. Before accepting an application for a certificate of ti- tle, the Department of Licensin g, county auditor, or other agent or subagent must requir e an applicant to provide a certificate of vehicle inspection completed by the Wash-ington State Patrol or other authorized inspector when the application is for a vehicle be ing titled for the first time as a street rod or custom vehicle. The inspection must verifythat the vehicle identification number is genuine andagrees with the number shown on the certificate of titleand registration certificate. A street rod or custom vehicle is allowed to use blue dot taillights for various vehicle equipment lamps. How-ever, hoods and bumpers are optional equipment on streetrod and custom vehicles; bo th kinds of vehicles must comply with fender and windshield requirements. Various provisions of existing law regarding parts cars and street rod vehicles are repealed. Both street rod and custom vehicles must be main- tained for occasional transp ortation, exhibitions, club ac- tivities, parades, tours, and similar uses. These vehicles are not to be used for general daily transportation.

By Senator Morton.Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Department of Transportation (DOT), with respect to state highways maintained within port dis- trict property, may, at the request of a port commission,make and enter into agreements with port districts and ad-jacent jurisdictions or agencies of the districts, for the pur- pose of managing short heavy haul industrial corridorswithin port district property for the movement ofoverweight sealed containers used in international trade. Currently, DOT must designate the portion of State Route 97 from the Canadian border to milepost 331.22 asa heavy haul industrial corridor for the movement ofoverweight vehicles to and from the Oroville railhead. Additionally, DOT may issue special permits to vehi- cles operating in th e heavy haul industri al corridor to carry weight in excess of weight li mits established in law, but not to exceed a gross vehicle weight of 137,788 pounds. Summary: DOT must designate the portion of State Route 97 from the Canadian border to milepost 331.12 as a heavy haul industrial corridor for the movement ofoverweight vehicles to and from the Oroville railhead. Further, DOT may issue special permits to vehicles operating in the heavy haul industrial corridor to carry weight in excess of weight limits established in currentlaw, but the weight carried may not exceed a gross vehicleweight of 139,994 pounds. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5590 C 364 L 11 Concerning lien holder requirements for certain foreclosure sales. By Senate Committee on Fina ncial Institutions, Housing & Insurance (originally spon sored by Senator Benton). Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions, Housing & Insurance House Committee on Judiciary Background: A short sale occurs when a borrower sells a home for less than is owed and the lien holder approves of selling the property at a lo ss. Short sales can occur for a variety of reasons, such as financial hardship of the bor- rower (due to job loss or disability) combined with the in- ability to sell the property for at least as much as is owed.Post-Foreclosure Remedies Under the Deeds of Trust Act. For owner-occupied residential property, the failure of the borrower to bring a civil action to enjoin a foreclo-sure does not constitute a wa iver of a claim for damages asserting common law fraud or misrepresentation, a viola-tion of the CPA, or the failure of the trustee to materially comply with the Deeds of Trust Act. Such a claim may bebrought within two years of the foreclosure, or the appli-cation statute of limitations, as long as the claim does not affect the validity of the sale or cloud the title of the prop-erty, among other things. The relief that may be granted is limited to actual damages, except for a CPA claim. Summary: If a seller of owner-occupied residential prop- erty and a buyer agree on a pu rchase price that is insuffi- cient to pay in full the obl igation owed, and the seller makes a written offer to the senior beneficiary, the seniorbeneficiary must respond, in good faith, within 120 dayswith an acceptance, rejectio n, or counter-offer of the seller's written offer. If the senior beneficiary acts in bad faith, the seller has a right of action for actual mo netary damages. However, a senior beneficiary is not responsible for the actions orinactions of a subsequent lien holder. If the property is foreclosed , and the seller (borrower) failed to enjoin the sale based on a lien holder acting in bad faith, the seller is not deemed to have waived his or her claim for damages under the Deeds of Trust Act. These provisions do not apply to beneficiaries that conduct fewer than 250 trustee sales per year. These provisions do not alter a beneficiary's right to issue a notice of default and do es not lengthen or shorten any time period imposed or required under the Deeds ofTrust Act.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 ESSB 5594 C 39 L 11 Regulating the handling of hazardous drugs. By Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles,Keiser, Prentice, Conway, Kline and Murray). Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: Antineoplastic drugs are chemotherapy agents that control or kill canc er cells. Drugs used in the treatment of cancer are cytotoxic (destructive to cellsSenate 46 0 House 96 0Senate 49 0House 96 0 (House amended)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred)313within the body) but are ge nerally more damaging to dividing cells than to resting cells. Workers may be exposed to a hazardous drug at many points during its manufacture, transport, distribution, re- ceipt, storage, preparation, and administration, as well asduring waste handling and equipment maintenance and re-pair. All workers involved in these activities have the po-tential for contact with an uncontained hazardous drug. Exposure to these drugs in the workplace has been as- sociated with acute and short-term reactions, as well aslong-term effects. Reports range from skin-related and oc- ular effects to flu-like symptoms, sore throat, chroniccough, infections, dizziness, eye irritation, and headaches among nurses, phar macists, and pharmacy technicians routinely exposed to hazardous drugs in the workplace.Reproductive studies on health care workers have shownan increase in fetal abnormali ties, fetal loss, and fertility impairment resulting from occupational exposure to thesedrugs. Hazardous drugs enter the body through inhalation, accidental injection, ingestio n of contaminated foodstuffs or mouth contact with cont aminated hands, and dermal absorption. Compounding of these drugs often requires sterile preparation and as such is regulated as pharmaceuticalcompounding by the United St ates Pharmacopeia (USP), chapter 797. USP 797 has provided minimal guidance forthe handling of hazardous drugs. A series of articles, publishe d in July 2010 in the Se- attle Times, highlighted hea lth care personnel who had worked with hazardous drugs and been subsequentlydiagnosed with some form of cancer. Summary: The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) will adopt rules for the handling of hazardous drugs in health care facilities. Rule development will consider input from hospitals, organiza tions which represent health care personnel, and ot her stakeholders. It will take into ac- count reasonable time for fa cilities to implement new re- quirements. Rules develope d will be consistent with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provisions adopted in the 2004 alert, as updated in 2010, but will not exceed them. Rules adopted can in- corporate updates and changes by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 20112SSB 5595 C 361 L 11 Concerning the distribution of the public utility district privilege tax. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Parlette).Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Public utility district (PUD) privilege tax is an in-lieu-of property tax. It applies to electricity-generat- ing facilities for the privilege of operating in this state. The tax rate has several comp onents including gross in- come derived from the sale of electricity, the number of kilowatt hours of self-generated energy which is either dis- tributed to consumers or resold to other utilities, and thewholesale value of energy pr oduced in thermal generating facilities. The PUDs report the facts pertinent to calculation of the tax to the Department of Revenue (DOR) once peryear. DOR calculates the tax owed and collects the taxespaid by the PUDs. These tax proceeds are deposited with the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer deposits 4 percent of the proceeds from the basic tax rate to the state general fund. The re-maining 96 percent is distribute d: 37.6 percent to the state general fund for public schools ; and 62.4 percent to the counties to be redistributed. A county must distribute funds to each taxing district in the county, but not to school districts, in a manner thecounty deems most equitable. However, it can be no lessthan an amount equal to 0.0075 percent of the gross reve-nues obtained by a PUD from the sale of electricity to thecity. A circumstance is not addressed in the statutory distri- bution of this tax. This ci rcumstance is where a PUD is located in a city but does not sell any electricity to that city. Summary: If a county receives priv ilege taxes because a public utility district operated by another county owns feetitle to property in a city or town in the county, but the dis-trict has no sales of electrical energy in that city or town, the county may retain 70 percent of the tax proceeds andeach city or town where proper ty is owned shall divide the remainder equally. This on ly applies when the city or town is adjoins a reservoir on the Columbia river whollyor partially created by such district's hydroelectric facilitywhich began power generation in 1967. The bill applies to PUD privilege taxes to be distributed in 2012 and thereafter.Senate 49 0House 92 0E2SSB 5596 July 22, 2011 E2SSB 5596 C 1 L 11 E 1 Requiring the department of social and health services to submit a demonstration waiv er request to revise the federal medicaid program. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Parl ette, Zarelli, Becker and Hewitt). Senate Committee on Hea lth & Long-Term Care Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medicaid is a federal-state partnership with programs established in the federal Social Security Act, and implemented at the state level with federal matching funds. The federal law has provided a framework for cov- erage for children, pregnant women, some families, and elderly and disabled adults, with varying income require-ments. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(PPACA) creates a new mandatory eligibility category fornon-elderly, non-pregnant adults with income at or below133 percent of the federal po verty level (FPL), beginning January 1, 2014. States have the option to provide Medic-aid coverage to all non-elderly individuals above 133percent of FPL through a state plan amendment. PPACA requires states to main tain the Medicaid eligi- bility income standards that were in place in March 2010 through December 31, 2013, fo r all adults. The mainte- nance of effort requirement extends through September30, 2019, for all children cove red in Medicaid or the Chil- dren's Health Insurance Programs. States may be exemptfrom the maintenance of effo rt requirement for optional, non-pregnant, non-disabled, adult populations whose in-come is above 133 percent of FPL if the state certifies it iscurrently experiencing a budget deficit or projects to havea budget deficit in the following fiscal year. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has some auth ority to grant waivers from certain requirements to a llow states to demonstrate innovative approaches in their Medicaid programs. Washington State recently received approval for a bridgedemonstration waiver to a llow early federal Medicaid match for the new eligibles (adults that will be eligible forMedicaid in 2014) that are enrolled through our statefunded Basic Health and medical care services programs. Summary: By October 1, 2011, the Department of Socialand Health Services must submit a request to the federalCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Inno-vation Center, and if necessary a request for a Section 1115demonstration waiver from CMS. To the extent permitted under federal law, the waiv er request must include: Establishment of base-ye ar, eligibility group per cap- ita payments with maximum flexibility for the state to manage within the appropriation; Coverage of benefits de termined to be essential health benefits under federal law, with coverage ofadditional benefits as approp riate for distinct catego- ries of enrollees such as children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilitie s, and elderly adults; Limited, reasonable, and enforceable cost-sharing and premiums to encourage informed consumer behavior and appropriate utilization of health ser- vices, while ensuring that access to evidence-based, preventative and primary care is not hindered; Streamlined eligibility determination; Innovative reimbursemen t methods such as bundled, global, and risk bearing payment arrangements, that promote effective purchasing, efficient use of healthservices, and support health homes, accountable care organizations, and other innovations intended to con-tain costs, improve health , and incent smart consumer decision making; The ability for Medica id and CHIP enrollees to voluntarily enroll in the in surance Exchange, broader authority to enroll client s in employer-sponsored insurance when available and deemed cost-effectivefor the state, and authority to require clients to remain enrolled in their chosen plan for the calendar year; An expedited process for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to respond to any state request forchanges within 45 days to ensure the state has the flexibility to manage within its appropriation; and The development of an alternative payment method- ology for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics that enables capitated or global payment of enhanced payments. The department must provide status reports to the Joint Select Committee on He alth Reform Implementation as requested by the committee, as well as multiple oppor- tunities for stakeholders and the general public to review and comment on the request as it is developed. In addi-tion, the department must identify statutory changes thatmay be necessary for successful and timelyimplementation.

By Senate Committee on Labo r, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally sponsored by Senators White, Kilmer, Tom, Kohl-Welles, Keiser, Kline and Conway). Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Personnel System Reform Act of 2002 (Act) provides for collective ba rgaining with representa- tives of civil service employees in general government and institutions of higher education. For purposes of negotiations, state agencies are repre- sented by the Governor. Ins titutions of higher education may be represented by either their governing boards or bythe Governor. The Act prov ides for multi-employer bar- gaining involving st ate agencies and coalition bargaining involving state agencies and in stitutions of higher educa- tion represented by the Governor. Representatives ofmore than one bargaining unit must negotiate one mastercollective bargaining agreement covering all of the repre-sented employees. Representatives of fewer than 500 em-ployees must bargain in one coalition. The coalition must bargain for a master collective bargaining agreement cov-ering all represented employees. For universities and col-leges, if the parties mutually agree, the Governor and a bargaining representative must negotiate one master col-lective bargaining agreement for all of the bargaining unitsthat the representative represe nts at multiple universities or colleges. The Governor must submit requests for funds neces- sary to implement collective ba rgaining agreements to the Legislature. The request must not be submitted to the Leg-islature unless two conditions are met. First, the requestsmust be submitted to the Director of the Office of Finan-cial Management (Director) by October 1 prior to the leg-islative session at which the re quests are to be considered. Second, the request must be certified by the Director as be-ing financially feasible for the state. For institutions ofhigher education, if a bargaining representative is certifiedduring or after a legislative session and the compensationand fringe benefit provisions of the bargaining unit's initialagreement are submitted before final legislative action on the budget, the Legislature may act upon the provisions. Summary: Two changes are made to the process for re- quests for funds to implemen t the compensation and fringe benefit provisions of agreements. These changes applyonly in the case of agreements between the University ofWashington and representatives of classified employees. If appropriations of less than $10,000 are necessary to implement an agreem ent, the Governor must submit a re- quest for funds to the Legislature if the request is submit-ted to the Director by October 1 prior to the legislativesession at which the request is to be considered. The re- quest need not be certified by the Director as beingfeasible financially for the state. If appropriations of $10,00 0 or more are necessary to implement the agreement and th e request is not certified by the Director as being feasible financially for the state,the parties must enter into co llective bargaining solely for the purpose of reaching a mutu ally agreed upon modifica- tion to address the absence of requested funds. The Leg-islature may act on a modified collective bargainingagreement if those provisions are submitted to the Office of Financial Management and legislative budget commit-tees before final legislative action on the operating budget.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SSB 5622 C 320 L 11 Concerning recreation access on state lands.

Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and the State Parks and Recreation Commission(State Parks) are charged with managing the public landsof the state. WDFW owns or manages nearly one millionacres of public land for fish and wildlife, habitat conserva-tion, and wildlife-related re creation. DNR protects and manages 5.6 million acres of state-owned land. In addi-tion, the Washington Stat e park system includes 120 developed parks.Senate 49 0 Senate 41 0 House 96 0 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 1House 95 0 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)SB 5625 316DNR and State Parks currently do not charge fees for access to their lands or recreation sites. WDFW charges $10 for the annual fish and wildlife lands vehicle use per-mit, or the permit is provided free of charge with allhunting and fishing licenses. Public or private landowners are not liable for unin- tentional injuries to member s of the public who use the land for outdoor recreation, if no fee is charged. StateParks and WDFW vehicle use and parking permits are notconsidered a fee for purposes of recreational immunity. Summary: Creates the Discover Pass which costs $30 per year and is available for purchase at the Department of Li- censing (DOL) at the time of vehicle registration, throughthe WDFW's automated syst em, and through the State Parks Reservation System. A complimentary DiscoverPass must be provided to a volunteer who performs 24hours of service on agency-sanctioned volunteer projectsin a year. Creates the Day-Use Permit which costs $10 per cal- endar day and is available for purchase through each stateagency. Hunters and fishers will receive a Vehicle Access Pass to WDFW lands only with the purchase of certainspecified hunting an d fishing licenses. The Discover Pass or the Day-Use Permit is not re- quired for persons who have a valid camper registration is-sued by State Parks. The annual investment permit isallowed in lieu of the Discov er Pass or Day-Use permit at State Parks' designated boat launch sites. The sno-parkseasonal permit is allowed in lieu of the Discover Pass or Day-Use permit at designated sno-parks betweenNovember 1 and March 31 of each year. State Parks may offer up to 12 free days, of which three days must be on weekends. The act maintains the current donation for State Parks at the time of vehicle registration at DOL. A new account is created with the following disbursements: For the first $71 million in revenue: 8 percent is deposited into the Wildlife Account (WDFW); 8 percent is deposited in to Park Land Trust Revolving Account (DNR); and 84 percent is deposited into State Parks Renewal & Stewardship Account. For any additional revenue beyond $71 million: Revenues are distributed equally amongst the agencies.The Discover Pass, Vehicle Access Pass, and Day-Use Permit must be visible in the front windshield of the vehi- cle. Failure to display the pa ss or permit is an infraction with a penalty of $99, reduced to $59 if a Discover Pass is purchased.The Discover Pass and the Day-Use Permit are not considered a fee under the Recreational Immunity Statutefor purposes of liability.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 October 1, 2011 (Section 12) SB 5625 C 297 L 11 Authorizing implementation of a nonexpiring license for early learning providers. By Senators Harper, King, Mc Auliffe, Litzow and Nelson. Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Background: The Department of Early Learning (DEL) is charged with licensing earl y learning providers in Wash- ington. (Child care is includ ed in the definition of early learning.) According to D EL, it licenses more than 7500 child care providers, who care for approximately 180,000 children. DEL also monitors licensed providers to ensureminimum licensing requirements are met. In the 2010 legislative session, ESB 6444 directed DEL, by January 15, 2011, to develop a plan to improvechild care licensing practices. On January 14, 2011, DELreleased its report to the Legi slature. The report outlines a ten-year plan to improve licen sing. One of the items ad- dressed in the plan is to a llow non-expiring licenses for child care providers. Currently, child care providers are issued an initial li- cense for a six-month period until the licensee can demon- strate that they meet specifi c requirements. Four initial licenses can be issued within a two-year period. All li-censed child care providers are required to reapply for li-censure every three years. According to DEL,\"relicensing is a time-cons uming process that involves much paperwork for both th e licensor and provider, and culminates in a relicensing visit that can last severalhours.\" According to a 2008 survey administered by the Na- tional Association for Regula tory Administration and Na- tional Child Care Informatio n and Technical Assistance Center, the following 12 states use the non-expiring li-cense model: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia,Kansas, Maryland, North Carolina, Nebraska, Oklahoma,South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. Summary: Fully licensed child care providers are no lon- ger required to reapply for licensure every three years. In- stead, full licenses will rema in valid so long as licensees submit the following items to DEL on an annual basis:Senate 33 14House 55 42SB 5628 317 the annual licensing fee; a declaration indicating the intent to either continue or cease operating a licensed child care program; a declaration of compliance with all licensing rules; and a background check application, according to DEL's established schedule. If a licensee fails to submit the items listed above, the license will expire, and the licensee must submit a new application for licensure. DEL is required to consider whether an agency is in good standing before granting a continuation of a full li-cense and when determining the most appropriate ap- proach and process for monito ring visits. An agency in good standing is defined as an agency that does not have: complaints; history of noncompliance related to those complaints or pending from prior monitoring visits; or other information that when evaluated may result in a finding of noncompliance. DEL is authorized to issue a probationary license to an agency that is not in good st anding. Before issuing a pro- bationary license, DEL is re quired to provide licensees with a written referral to the Child Care Resource and Re- ferral Network or other approp riate resources for technical assistance. DEL, the licensee, and the technical assistance provider must meet to develop a plan to correct the areasof noncompliance identified by DEL within 30 days after the licensee accepts the referral. DEL may issue a proba-tionary license within 15 work ing days after it has sent its referral if (1) the licensee has refused, in writing, to accept the referral, or (2) the licen see has failed to respond in writing to DEL's referral. DEL may issue a probationarylicense after 60 days if the licensee has not corrected theareas of noncompliance in co nsultation with the technical assistance provider.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5628 C 365 L 11 Concerning a limited proper ty tax exemption from the emergency medical services levy.

The sum of property-tax rates is limited by the state Constitution to amaximum of 1 percent of true and fair value, or $10 per$1,000 of value. The Cons titution provides a procedure for voter approval for tax rates that exceed the 1 percentlimit. These taxes are called excess levies. Excess leviesrequire not only voter approval, but most also require a 60percent super majority to be approved. Taxes imposed under the 1 percent limit are ca lled regular taxes. The Con- stitution does not require vote r approval of regular taxes. However, some regular taxes are limited in time durationand require voter approval. EMS Levies . An emergency medical service (EMS) levy is a regular voter-approved levy which is used to pro- vide emergency medical care or emergency medical ser- vices, including related person nel costs, training for such personnel and related equipment, supplies, vehicles, andstructures needed to provide this care or service. An EMS levy must be approved by a super majority of registered voters at a genera l or special election and may be six years, ten years, or permanent. If approved, a taxingdistrict can impose a regular property-tax levy in anamount that cannot exceed $0 .50 per $1,000 of assessed value of the property of the taxing district. Only a county, emergency medical service district, city, town, public hospital district, urban emergency med-ical service district, or fire protection district is authorizedto impose an EMS levy. If a co unty is the first taxing dis- trict to impose the $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value EMSlevy, no other taxing district within the county maysubsequently impose the EMS levy. EMS Levies in the City of Milton . King County cur- rently imposes a countywide EMS levy of $0.30 cents per$1,000 of assessed value. Pi erce County does not impose an EMS levy. The City of Milton is located partially inKing County and partially in Pierce County. The voters of Milton have au thorized the city to im- pose the levy at its maximum rate of $0.50 per $1,000 ofassessed valuation. Through an interlocal agreement, King County remits to Milton the funds that it receivesfrom its county levy from property located within Milton. Milton has, however, collected only $0.20 per $1,000 ofassessed valuation pursuant to its city levy, and not the full$0.50 authorized by the city's voters. The Department of Revenue construed the provisions of the EMS levy statute, whic h requires a city's levy to be reduced if a county has first imposed the levy to require that Milton's levy be reduced, such that the combined lev- ies of King County and Milton would not exceed $0.50 per$1,000 of assessed valuation. An Attorney General Opin-ion was issued, AGO 2010 No. 8, concluding that a city di- vided between two counties may impose an EMS levy ofup to $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation throughoutSenate 48 0House 94 2 (House amended)House 96 0 (House amended)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5633 318the city, without regard to any EMS levy imposed by a county in which some of the city's territory is located. Therefore, if the city of Milton imposed an EMS levy up to the maximum tax rate in th e future, the portion of the city located in King County would have an EMS levy of$0.80 per $1,000 of assessed value, while the remainder ofthe city would have an EMS levy of $0.50 per $1,000 ofassessed value. Summary: All real and personal property is exempt from a county EMS levy if the following requirements are met: 1. the property is located in a county with a population of more than 1.5 million; 2. the property is located in a city included within two counties; and 3. the locally assessed value of the property in the por- tion of the city included w ithin the county described under subsection (1) of this section is less than $125 million. This act applies to taxes le vied for collection in 2012 and thereafter.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5633 C 116 L 11 Exempting agricultural fair premiums from the unclaimed property act. By Senators Pridemore, Hewitt, Kastama and Swecker.Senate Committee on Agriculture & Rural Economic Development House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington's Unclaimed Property Act (UPA) requires holders of unclaimed property, including private entities and local governm ents, to hold the proper- ty for owners. Unclaimed property includes uncashedchecks. After three years, a private entity holding an obli-gation to pay an uncashed chec k must transfer funds to pay the check to the state Department of Revenue (DOR). Alocal government holding an obligation to pay an un- cashed check may transfer funds to pay the check to DORor retain the funds. There is no time limit for an owner to claim the funds from either DOR or the local government. Some uncashed checks are exempt from the UPA, in- cluding certain claim offers issued by insurers. Checksthat are not subject to the UPA may become unpayable sixmonths after issuance. In Washington, counties and private nonprofit entities operate agricultural fairs. The fairs commonly awardsmall premium checks as prizes. Recipients sometimesretain the checks as mementos , rather than cashing them. The fairs remain subject to long-term liability under the UPA to pay the uncashed checks. Summary: Unclaimed premiums paid by an agricultural fair by check are not subject to the UPA. An agricultural fair is a fair or exhibition intended to promote agriculture by including varied exhibits of livestock, agriculturalproducts, and related manufactured products and arts. Apremium is an amount paid for exhibits and educationalcontests, displays, and demonstrations, but does not in-clude judges' fees and expenses, livestock sale revenues,or prizes or amounts paid for promotion or entertainmentactivities such as queen contests, parades, dances, rodeos,and races.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5635 C 117 L 11 Concerning changes in the point of a diversion under a surface water right permit. By Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy (originally sponsored by Senators Honeyford andRockefeller; by request of Department of NaturalResources). Senate Committee on Environment, Water & Energy House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: Washington operates under a water right permit system. The right to use water that has been put tobeneficial use is, and remains, an appurtenance of the landor place where the water is used. The Department of Ecol-ogy (Ecology) may permit certai n changes to a water right. Ecology may also permit a transfer of a water right fromone holder to another. In processing change or transfer ap-plications, Ecology analyzes the validity, limits, and quan- tity of the right. If it appears that the transfer of the waterright, change of point of diversion, or purpose of use canbe made without harming ex isting rights, Ecology must grant the transfer or change. If the transfer involves surface water supplied by an ir- rigation district, and the transferred water remains in thedistrict, the transfer needs only to be approved by the irri- gation district. Water users may make a seasonal or tempo-rary change of point of diversion or place of use of waterwhen the change can be made without detriment to exist- ing rights. Such a seasonal or temporary change requiresthe permission of Ecology or the local water master. Withsuch approval, water users who own the land to which thewater rights are attached may also rotate the use of the wa-ter when the rotation can be accomplished without detri- ment to other existing water rights. Ecology may allow aSenate 47 0House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 45 0House 95 02SSB 5636 319change of the point of dive rsion to a downstream intake structure when a modification will provide both environ- mental benefits and water supply benefits. The structure must be located downstream, have an existing approvedintake structure with capacity to transport the additional diversion, and have the same ownership, purpose of use, season of use, and place of use. Summary: Ecology may allow a change of the point of diversion to a point of dive rsion located between Colum- bia River miles 215.6 and 292, if the existing point of di- version is also within those miles on the Columbia River. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 2SSB 5636 C 321 L 11 Concerning the University Center of North Puget Sound. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Haugen , Harper, Shin and Delvin). Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: A number of studies have been undertaken over the past decade to dete rmine the higher education needs of North King, Snohomish, Island, and Skagit Counties. In November 2006 a consultant team's final re-port found that the needs of about 10,800 full-time equiv-alent students would be unmet by 2025 if students fromthose counties participated in baccalaureate and graduatedegree programs at the 19 98 national average for all adults. The mission of the Univers ity Center of North Puget Sound (University Center) is to develop partnerships withother colleges and universities for the purpose of provid-ing baccalaureate and graduate degrees for the residents ofNorth Snohomish, Island and Skagit Counties and to pro-vide the services and facilities that deliver these educa-tional opportunities. The University Center offers on-lineand in-class courses from Washington State University(WSU), University of Washin Western Washington University (WWU ), Central Washington Uni- versity, The Evergreen State College, Hope International University, and Saint Martin's University. Instruction isdelivered in various formats including web-based distanceeducation, two-way interactiv e video, technology support- ed classrooms and combinations of these. In 2005 the leg-islature named consortium member Everett Community College (ECC) as manager of the University Center and inMarch, 2009 the University Center moved to the new Un-dergraduate Center in Gray Wolf Hall on the main campus. Summary: WSU assumes management and leadership for baccalaureate and graduate degree production at theUniversity Center by July 1, 2014. The Director of the University Center reports to the President of WSU and im-plements decisions of the Coordinating and PlanningCouncil (council). The counci l is established to provide long-range strategic planning, facilitate collaborations,and resolve internal disputes. The membership of the council is specified, but may be modified by agreement. The council must establish a strategic plan addressing the employers' needs for skilled workers by expandinghigh employer demand programs of study, with an ongo-ing emphasis by WSU on undergraduate and graduate en-gineering degree programs in a variety of engineeringdisciplines such as civil, me chanical, aeronautical, and aerospace manufacturing. The plan must specifically ad-dress the operating and capital budget required to imple- ment the plan, expansion of the range of regionaleducational opportunities, incl ude specified strategies, and establish a process for program development. It must becompleted by December 1, 20 12. The strategic plan is considered approved if the Legislature does not takefurther action during the 2013 legislative session. Academic programming and delivery are developed in accordance with the missions of WSU, ECC, and other in-stitutions that have a presence at the University Center. Each participating institution awards degrees granted in its programs at the University Ce nter. The council establish- es a process for prioritizing new programs and revisingexisting programs to fit the needs of the region. University Center expansion needs and capital facility funding are reviewed annua lly by WSU in cooperation with ECC. WSU designs, constructs, and manages any fa-cility developed at the Univer sity Center with the excep- tion of facilities design effo rts utilizing ECC capital funding. WSU is responsible for infrastructuredevelopment and maintenance wi th costs shared equitably. The act takes effect only after the Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) determines whether a needsassessment and analysis is required and, if so, conducts aneeds assessment and viability determination and recom- mends that this should move forward. The Office of Fi-nancial Management, the Legislature, and the CodeReviser must be notified of the HECB's recommendationsby July 1, 2012.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: ContingentSenate 49 0 House 96 0 Senate 39 9House 66 31 (House amended)Senate 38 10 (Senate concurred)2ESB 5638 3202ESB 5638 C 28 L 11 E 1 Concerning the exemption of certain taxing districts. By Senators Keiser, Fa in, Prentice and Shin. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state Constitution limits regular prop- erty tax levies to a maximum of one percent of the proper- ty's value ($10 per $1,000 of assessed value). V oters within a taxing district can vote to tax themselves higher than this 1 percent limit with an excess levy. In order to keep the total tax rate for regular property taxes within this constitutiona l limit, the Legislature has established rate maximums and aggregate rate maximumsfor the individual taxing districts that derive their fundingfrom the regular proper ty tax. The state property tax levy is limited to $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value. The lev-ies of the remaining local taxing districts are generally di-vided into two types: senior taxing districts and juniortaxing districts. Senior taxing districts are cities and coun- ties. Junior taxing districts include library districts, fireprotection districts, and park districts, among others. If the combined rates of the senior and junior taxing districts exceed $5.90 - or if the combined rate of all dis-tricts exceed the $10 limit - the rates of certain districts arereduced according to statutorily set priorities until thecombined rate fits within the $5.90 limit or the overall $10limit. This process is referred to as pro-rationing. There are also local property taxes with rates outside of the $5.90 limit, but which are still subject to the 1 per-cent constitutional limit. These following taxes are re-duced first in the pro-rationi ng process for the $10 limit: voter-approved emergency medical services (EMS) taxes; taxes to acquire conservation futures; voter-approved taxes for affordable housing; voter-approved metropolitan park district taxes; King County ferry district taxes for passenger-only ferries; voter-approved county criminal justice taxes; a portion of levies by fire protection districts; and certain King County transit taxes. A flood control zone district (zone) is an independent taxing authority. A zone may receive funding from a vari- ety of sources, including property tax receipts; rates,charges, and assessments; and debt proceeds. A zone may impose annual, nonvoter-approved regu- lar property tax levies of up to $0.50 per $1,000 of as-sessed value. With 60 percent voter approval, a zone mayalso impose excess levies for general purposes and to re-tire general obligation bonds issued for capital purposes. In the latest tax year, the King County Flood Control Zone District was subject to pro-rationing.Summary: Metropolitan Park Districts in King County may, if authorized by a vote of the people, move all or a portion of their levy outside the $5.90 aggregate limit if it would otherwise have been pro-rationed away. The pro-tected levy for such Metropolitan Park Districts is stillwithin the constitu tional $10 limit. Should the $10 limit be exc eeded the protected portion of the Metropolitan Park Dist rict's levy will be the first priority to be pro-rationed down. Unintentional errors in EHB 1969 which dealt with flood control districts and passed earlier this session arecorrected.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 Contingent ESSB 5656 C 309 L 11 Creating a state Indian child welfare act. By Senate Committee on Hu man Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Se nators Hargrove, Regala, White, McAuliffe and Kline).Senate Committee on Huma n Services & Corrections House Committee on State Gove rnment & Tribal Affairs House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Background: The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is a federal law passed in 1978. ICWA was passed in response to the high number of Indian children being removed fromtheir homes by both public and private agencies. The in-tent of Congress under ICWA was to \"protect the best in-terests of Indian children and to promote the stability andsecurity of Indian tribes and families\" (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902).ICWA sets federal requirements that apply to state childcustody proceedings involving an Indian child who is amember of or eligible for me mbership in a federally rec- ognized tribe. These requirements apply to proceedingsunder chapters 13.32A, 13.34, and 26.33 RCW. Indian children involved in state child custody pro- ceedings are covered by ICWA. A person may define hisor her identity as Indian but in order for ICWA to apply, the involved child must be an Indian child as defined by thelaw. ICWA defines an Indian child as \"any unmarried per- son who is under age 18 and is either (1) a member of an Indian tribe, or (2) is eligib le for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indiantribe\" (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903). Under federal law, individual tribes have the right to determine eligibility, membership,or both. However, in order for ICWA to apply, the childSenate 44 2 Senate 38 7 House 53 37ESSB 5656 321must be a member of or eligible for membership in a fed- erally recognized tribe. ICWA does not apply to divorceproceedings, intra-family disputes, juvenile offender proceedings, or cases under tribal court jurisdiction. All tribes have the right to determine who is a member of their tribe, and differ ent tribes have different requirements for eligibility. Caseworkers must make several considerations when handling an ICWA case, including (1) providing active ef-forts to the family, (2) identifyi ng a placement that fits un- der the ICWA preference provisions, (3) notifying thechild's tribe and the child's parents of the child custodyproceeding, and (4) working ac tively to involve the child's tribe and the child's pare nts in the proceedings. The child's tribe must have exclusive jurisdiction over the child custody proceeding involving the Indian child who resides on a reservation unless the tribe has consented to state's concurrent jurisdiction, or the tribe expressly de-clined jurisdiction or the stat e is exercising emergency ju- risdiction. If the court or any party knows or has reason toknow that a child is or may be an Indian child, the court or party must notify the parent or Indian custodian and thechild's tribe, by register ed mail, of any pending proceedings and their right of intervention. In a child custody procee ding involving an Indian child who is not a resident of the reservation and not award of the tribal court, the court must transfer the case totribal court unless either parent objects or there is goodcause not to transfer the case. The tribe may declinejurisdiction. Before an Indian child can be placed in foster care, the Department of Social and Human Services (DSHS) or asupervising agency must show that active efforts havebeen made to provide reme dial services and rehabilitative programs to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have been unsuccessful. The court can-not order a foster care placement without a determination,supported by clear and conv incing evidence, including testimony of a qualified expert witness, that continuedcustody by the child's parent or Indian custodian is likelyto result in serious physical or emotional damage to the child. A court cannot order the term ination of parental rights without a determination, supp orted by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of a qualified ex- pert witness, that continued custody by the child's parentor Indian custodian or return of custody to the parent orcustodian is likely to resu lt in serious physical or emotional damage to the child. A court may order the emergency removal of an Indi- an child, including a child who is a resident of or domi-ciled on a reservation, to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The court, DSHS, or super-vising agency must terminate the emergency removal orplacement of a child when th e removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent im minent physical damage or harm to the child. The party that obtained emergencyremoval or placement of the child must immediately initi- ate a child custody proceeding that complies with ICWA,transfers the child to the ju risdiction of the appropriate tribe, or restores the child to the parent or custodian. An emergency removal or placement of an Indian child mustimmediately terminate and the court order approving theremoval vacated when the remo val or placement is no lon- ger needed to prevent imminent physical damage or harmto the child. If the petitioner in a child custody proceeding has im- properly removed the child from the parent or custodian'scustody or has improperly retained custody after a visit orother temporary relinquishment of custody, the court mustdecline jurisdiction over the petition and immediately re-turn the child to the parent or custodian unless such return would subject the child to substantial and immediate danger or threat of danger. Under current law, an Indian child must be placed in a foster care home with the following characteristics whichmust be given preference in the following order: 1. relatives; 2. an Indian family of the same tribe as the child; 3. an Indian family of a Washington Indian tribe of a similar culture to that tribe; 4. any other family which can provide a suitable home for an Indian child, such suitability to be determined through consultation with a local Indian child welfare advisory committee. Summary: The provisions of the act are substantially similar to those in the federal ICWA. The state act will ap-ply to child custody proceedings, which are defined as pro-ceedings, to determine (1) foster care placements; (2) terminations of parental rights; (3) pre-adoptive place-ments, which are placements of children after parentalrights have been terminated; and (4) adoptive placements. There are some differences between the federal statute andthe provisions in the act regarding definitions, jurisdiction,notice requirements, and placement preferences of the child. Definitions . Active Efforts . The federal ICWA em- ploys the term active efforts. For example, any party seek-ing to remove an Indian child from a parent or custodianfor placement in foster care must satisfy the court that ac- tive efforts have been made to provide remedial servicesand rehabilitative programs desi gned to prevent the break- up of the Indian child family and that the efforts haveproved unsuccessful. The federal statute does not defineactive efforts, and this act in cludes a definition. Active ef- forts requires a showing that the party actively worked with the parent to engage in remedial services and rehabil- itative programs to prevent the breakup of the family,beyond simply providing re ferrals to such services. Qualified Expert Witness . Testimony from a qualified expert witness is required under the federal statute beforea court can place an Indian child in foster care or enter anESSB 5656 322order terminating parental righ ts. The term qualified ex- pert witness is not defined in federal law. In this act, a qualified expert witness is defined as (1) a member of the child's Indian tribe or other person of the tribe's choicewho is recognized by the tribe as knowledgeable regardingtribal customs of family orga nization or child rearing prac- tices; (2) any person having substantial experience in thedelivery of child and family services to Indians, and exten- sive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearing practices with in the Indian child's tribe; (3) a professional person havi ng substantial education and experience in the area of his or her specialty; or (4) anyperson having substantial experience in the delivery ofchild and family services to Indians, and knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearingpractices in Indian tribes with cultural similarities to theIndian child's tribe. Best Interests of the Indian Child . This term is not de- fined in the federal ICWA. For purposes of the state act, itis defined as the use of practices designed to accomplishthe following: (1) protect the safety, well-being, develop-ment and stability of the Indian child; (2) prevent unnec- essary out of home placements; (3) acknowledge the right of Indian tribes to maintain their existence and integrity which will promote the stability and security of their chil- dren and families; (4) recogn ize the value to the Indian child of establishing, develo ping and maintaining ties to the child's tribe; and (5) prioritize placement of a child inaccordance with the placement preferences outlined in the act. Tribal Customary Adoption . This term is not included in the federal ICWA but is de fined in the act as an adoption through tribal custom, tradi tions, or laws of an Indian child's tribe by which the In dian child is permanently placed with a nonparent, who in turn has the rights, privi- leges, and obligations of a legal parent. Termination of theparent-child relationship betw een the Indian child and the biological parent is not required to effect or recognize atribal customary adoption. Jurisdiction . Jurisdictional provisions over an Indian child in a custody proceeding who, regardless of whetherthe child resides or is domic iled within the reservation of his or her tribe, are substantially similar to the federal stat-ute. For children who do not reside on the reservation, aparent or other party identified in the statute may make amotion to the court to have th e case transferred to the ju- risdiction of the Indian child's tribe. The tribe, as in the federal statute, may decline ju risdiction. Unlike the feder- al law, which is silent on this issue, the act provides a75-day time frame for the tribe to respond. Notice . The notice provisions of the federal law are substantially duplicated in the act. Burden of Proof in an Involuntary Child Custody Pro- ceeding . The burdens of proof for foster care placement and termination of parental rights for a proceeding involv-ing an Indian child are the same as those in the federalICWA. For foster care placement, the court must find byclear and convincing eviden ce that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indi an custodian is likely to re- sult in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.A termination order cannot be issued unless the court findsbeyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of thechild by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physi cal damage to the child. Not included in federal law but included in the act is the provision that harm that may result from interferingwith a bond or attachment between a foster parent and anIndian child can not be the so le basis or the primary reason for keeping an Indian child in foster care or for thetermination of parental rights. Where a child has been dete rmined by the court not to be an Indian child, and an In dian tribe subsequently deter- mines that the child is a member, the tribe may move thecourt for redetermination during the pendency of theproceeding, rather than at any time. V oluntary Foster Care Placement or Termination of Parental Rights . The required consen t for a voluntary fos- ter care placement or terminati on of parental rights involv- ing an Indian child is the same as federal law. An Indianchild's parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consentto a voluntary foster care placement at any time, and uponthe withdrawal of consent, th e child must be returned to the parent or Indian custodian. For a voluntary termination of parental rights or adop- tive placement involving an Indian child, the consent of the parent may be withdrawn for any reason at any timeprior to the entry of an order terminating parental rights or a final decree of adoption. Upon withdrawal of consent,the child must be returned to the parent. If consent to adoption was obtained through fraud or duress, a parentmay withdraw consent after the entry of a final decree ofadoption if the adoption has been effective for less thantwo years. Placement of Indian Child . The federal ICWA sets out placement priorities for adoptive and foster care and pre-adoptive placements. The pla cement priorities in the act contain two options in additio n to those provided in the federal law: (1) an Indian fam ily that is of a similar culture to the child's tribe, and (2) any other family which can pro- vide a suitable home for an In dian child, as determined in consultation with the child's tr ibe or the Local Indian Child Welfare Advisory Committee, where the child's tribe has not intervened. Other Provisions . DSHS, in consultation with the In- dian tribes, must establish standards and procedures for itsreview of cases involving Indian children under the newlycreated chapter and methods for monitoring the DSHS's compliance with the federal and state acts. Nothing in this chapter sh all affect, impair, or limit rights or remedies provided to any party under the federalICWA, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1914.SSB 5658 323Every order or decree entered in any child custody proceeding must contain a finding that the federal ICWA or state Indian Child Welfare Act applies. The order must also contain a finding that a ll notice, consent, and eviden- tiary requirements under the state and federal acts havebeen satisfied.

Summary: The Department of General Administration (GA) must survey the 50 states to determine which ones provide advantages for their in-state contractors bidding on public works projects. Th e survey must be completed by November 1, 2011. GA must report on the results of the survey, and provide recommen dations necessary to imple- ment the intent of the legislation, to the Legislature by De-cember 1, 2011. GA must distribute the report to all stateand local agencies with public works procurementauthority. Any bidding process for public works in the state in which a bid is received from a nonresident contractor,from a state that is identified in the survey as providing an in-state contractor advantage, must provide a comparabledisadvantage to the bid of that nonresident contractor.This requirement applies when GA has adopted rules andprocedures to implement the reciprocity requirement. The reciprocity provisions do not apply if they contradict requirements for federal funding.Senate 46 1House 79 18 (House amended)House 82 16 (House amended)Senate 44 3 (Senate concurred)Senate 45 0House 93 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)SSB 5664 on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5664 C 118 L 11 Concerning the Lake Washingt on Institute of Technology.

By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Ranker,Swecker, Rockefeller, L itzow, Shin and Kline). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine WatersHouse Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: Shark Finning Defined . The National Oce- anic and Atmospheric Administration explains shark fin-ning as the practice of cutting off a shark's fins andreturning the remainder of the shark to the water. Current Shark Fining Prohibitions . Currently, rules of the Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) make it illegal to fin a shark in state waters. A commercial fisher must re-tain the entire shark in order to retain a fin. Once a sharkhas been delivered to a dealer and the sale recorded on afish ticket, the shark fin may be dealt with separately fromthe carcass. The practice of shark finning is also prohibited under federal law. Summary: Creates the Crime of Unlawful Trade in Shark Fins. A person is guilty of unlawful shark trade in the sec- ond degree if that person (1) of fers to or does buy, sell, or otherwise exchange a shark fin or derivative product for commercial purposes; or (2) prepares or processes a shark fin or derivative product for human or animal consump-tion for commercial purposes . A violation constitutes a gross misdemeanor, and triggers suspension of commercial fishing privileges for one year. A person is guilty of a violation in the first degree if the violation (1) involves shark fins or a derivative productworth more than $250; (2) is committed with knowledge the shark was illegally caught; or (3) is committed within five years of a conviction of this or other specified fish andwildlife crimes. A violation constitutes a class C felony,and triggers suspension of commercial fishing privileges for one year. Provides Certain Exemptions . A person may conduct scientific or educational activities under a DFW permit without being liable for unlawful trade in shark fins. Ad- ditionally a person may exchange, prepare, or process forcommercial purposes shark fins or derivative productslawfully caught or acquired before the act takes effect. An intent section is included, and terms are defined.

By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senator Hargrove). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Public Safety & Emergency Preparedness House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Crime Victims' Compensation Pro- gram (CVCP) is a program which uses a combination of state appropriations and federal grants for benefits such asmedical treatment, counseling, and financial support tocertain victims of crime and their beneficiaries. TheCVCP is administered by the Department of Labor and In-dustries (L&I), and is based on the structure of the Indus- trial Insurance (Workers Co mpensation) Program. CVCP benefits are capped at $50,000 per claim until July 1, 2015,at which time the benefit cap is due to rise to $150,000. A permanent partial disability is an injury causing per- manent physical limitation whic h does not incapacitate the victim or prevent the victim from performing work in anygainful occupation. Summary: The benefit for permanent partial disability for victims of criminal acts is repealed. The benefit for payments for home and vehicl e modifications is also re- pealed. Non-medical benefits are limited to $40,000 outof the $50,000 benefit cap. Colposcopy exam s are exclud- ed from the $50,000 benefit cap. The methods used to de-termine the amount of claim payments for to tal permanent disability, financial support, an d fatality benefits are sim- plified. L&I is permitted to use electronic means of com-munication. The CVCP must not pay for experimental orcontroversial treatment, bu t only for treatment which is evidence based and curative. CVCP provisions are severed from laws relating to Industrial Insurance. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: Removes provisions which would restore CVCP benefits for permanent partial dis- ability and home and vehicle modifications on July 1, 2015. Removes a provision which would disallow making exceptions to the CVCP benefit cap for necessary medical benefits after July 1, 2015.VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5691 May 12, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 402, 503, 804 and 805, Substitute Senate Bill 5691 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to crime victims' compensation.\" With this bill, the Legislature has taken important steps to en- sure the sustainability of our Cr ime Victims' Compensation pro- gram. Administrative efficiencies, coupled with painful but necessary benefit reductions, will allow the program to maintain its viability for the foreseeable future. However, only temporarily reducing these benefits will only temporarily strengthen the Crime Victims' Compensation program. An increase in crime victims' benefits is a discussion that should occur if and when state revenues improve, but not before that time. For these reasons, I have veto ed Sections 402, 503, 804 and 805 of Substitute Senate Bill 5691. With the exception of Sections 402, 503, 804 and 805, Substitute Senate Bill 5691 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SSB 5700 PARTIAL VETO C 377 L 11 Concerning certai n toll facilities. By Senate Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Senators Haugen and King). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: During the 2009 regular legislative session, the Legislature authorized tolling on the State Route 520 (SR 520) corridor, authorized bonds to finance construc-tion of corridor projects, and committed to continue im-posing tolls on the corridor in amounts sufficient to pay theprincipal and interest on the bonds. The Washington State Department of Transportation has indicated it will beready to start imposing tolls on the corridor in Spring of2011, using a new electronic toll collection system, includ-ing photo tolling, authorized during the 2010 regular leg- islative session. As such, on January 5, 2011, theTransportation Commission adopted a schedule of toll rates applicable to the SR 520 corridor, and on January 25, 2011, adopted a schedule of photo toll rates applicable to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Included in the commis- sion's January 5 action was the adoption of administrative fees for toll collection processes. On November 2, 2010, Washington State voters ap- proved Initiative Measure No . 1053 (I-1053). Among oth- er things, I-1053 provides that \"[a] fee may only beimposed or increased in any fiscal year if approved withSenate 46 2House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred) ESSB 5708 326majority legislative approval in both the house of repre- sentatives and the senate ...\" I-1053 took effect December 2, 2010. Tolls are considered fees. Summary: Consistent with the fee provisions of I-1053 and previously enacted statutory toll-related criteria, the Legislature approves the ac tion taken by the Transporta- tion Commission in January to (1) adopt the schedule oftoll rates applicable to the SR 520 corridor, (2) adopt the schedule of photo toll charges applicable to the TacomaNarrows Bridge, and (3) adopt the assessment of adminis-trative fees for toll collection processes. The Legislatureauthorizes the Transportation Commission to set and ad-just toll rates on the SR 520 corridor in accordance withpreviously enacted statutory criteria. The TransportationCommission may exceed the SR 520 toll rates only inamounts not greater than those sufficient to meet mainte- nance and operating costs on the corridor and to make debtservice payments and other associated financing costs.The Transportation Commission must send a report to the Legislature regarding any incr ease or decrease to the SR 520 toll rates, and to photo toll rates on the Tacoma Nar- rows Bridge, along with a de tailed justification for the action. Corrective language is enacte d to reauthorize the issu- ance of toll revenue bonds applicable to the SR 520 corri-dor. The definition of toll revenue for bonding purposes applicable to the SR 520 corri dor is broadened to include funds received for the benefit of transportation facilities in the state.

As outlined in an in- formal Attorney General Opini on, Initiative 10 53 does not con- strain the manner in which the legislature approv es imposition or increases in fees. Section 1 could be misconstrued to constrain the form of legislative approvals. Ve toing the intent section does not impede implementation of the bill.

Gregoire GovernorESSB 5708 C 366 L 11 Creating flexibility in the delivery of long-term care services. By Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care (originally sponsored by Senator Keiser). Senate Committee on Health & Long-Term Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Boarding homes are privately owned facil- ities that are licensed by th e state to assume general re- sponsibility for the safety an d well-being of seven or more residents. The services provided are considered domicili- ary care may include a wide range of support, from lightcare and housekeeping to inte rmittent nursing services and other specialized care. Boarding homes vary in size andownership from a small, loca lly-owned seven-bed facility to a 150-bed facility operated by a large national corpora- tion. The majority of residents are private pay. Medicaidcontracts for assisted living, adult residential care, andgroup homes for developmentally disabled individuals.There are approximately 544 bo arding homes in the state, with 28,882 licensed beds. Boarding homes may alsohave non-licensed beds. Nonresidents in these beds maynot receive domiciliary care directly by the boarding home. They receive all of their services independently,through contracts or arrangem ents not directly involving the boarding home. Nursing facilities provide 24 -hour supervised nursing care, personal care, therapy, nutrition management, orga-nized activities and other spec ialized services. Residents in nursing facilities may require nursing services forchronic illness or rehabilitation, and are not capable of in- dependent living, or they may need short post-hospital re-cuperative care. In general, because of the regulatorylimits on the amount of nursing care provided in boardinghomes, residents in nursing facilities are considered to have more acute needs than those in boarding homesSome nursing facilities in the state have converted part of their facility to boarding home s in order to provide lower levels of care under assisted living and private payarrangements. Summary: Nonresidents of boarding homes may receive technology-based monitoring devices, scheduled blood pressure checks, reminders about health care appoint- ments, medication assistance, falls risk assessment, and nutrition management and educ ation services, dental ser- vices, and wellness programs. Boarding homes must no- tify residents in non-licensed rooms that certain protections and services available to licensed beds do notapply to them. The State Board of Nursing Home Administrators is authorized to determine the parameters for on-site full time administrators in nursin g homes with small resident populations when the nursing home has converted some ofSenate 35 10House 73 25 (House amended)Senate 32 10 (Senate concurred) SSB 5722 327its licensed nursing facility bed capacity into assisted living. Under certain circumstances, nursing facilities may provide transitional care management services for up to 30days by either telephone or through web-based means topatients who have been discharged from their facilities.These transition care services may be provided when a res-ident is without in -home care services, because they have refused them, or they are no t eligible. The services may include care coordination, review of the discharge plan,and other support. If the nu rsing facility is concerned about the discharged patient's situation, the facility must call the patient's primary care physician. DSHS must convene a workgroup of stakeholders to identify mechanisms to ince ntivize nursing facilities to close or eliminate licensed beds from active service. Therecommendations from the wo rkgroup must be submitted in a report to the Governor and the Legislature bySeptember 1, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 5722 C 347 L 11 Concerning the use of moneys collected from the local op- tion sales tax to support chemical dependency or mental health treatment programs and therapeutic courts. By Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections (originally sponsored by Senators Hargrove, Morton,Stevens, Regala, Shin and McAuliffe). Senate Committee on Human Services & Corrections House Committee on Ways & Means Background: A county may impose a sales and use tax (tax) of 0.1 percent to support mental health treatment pro- grams, chemical dependency treatment programs, andtherapeutic courts. Limitations exist on the extent towhich this money can be used to supplant funding for ex-isting services. Fifteen counties have imposed this tax:Clallam, Clark, Ferry, Grays Harbor, Island, Jefferson,King, Okanogan, Thurston, Wahkiakum, and Whatcom. Summary: A county with a population greater than 25,000 which imposes the tax may use up to 50 percent of monies collected to supplant funding for existing services in 2011-2012, up to 40 percent in 2013, up to 30 percent in 2014, up to 20 percent in 2015, and up to 10 percent in2016. A county with a popula tion less than 25,000 which imposes the tax may use up to 80 percent of monies col- lected to supplant funding for existing services in 2011-2012, up to 60 percent in 2013, up to 40 percent in 2014,up to 20 percent in 2015, and up to 10 percent in 2016.

Senate Committee on Econom ic Development, Trade & Innovation House Committee on Co mmunity Development & Housing Background: In 2006 the Legislature created the Wash- ington Manufacturing Services in statute as a nonprofit corporation (the corporation) to operate a modernization extension system, coordinate a network of public and pri- vate modernization resources, and stimulate the competi- tiveness of small and midsize manufacturers. TheLegislature stated an intent to encourage small and mid- size firms to aggregate their demand for training and other modernization services, thus dr iving down the cost to the individual firm and securing more effective services, and directed the corporation to provide assistance to industry associations, networks, or consortia. In 2010 the board ofdirectors of the corporation changed the name ofWashington Manufacturing Services to ImpactWashington. The U.S. Department of Commerce commissions an annual audit of the corporation's clients. Their most recentaudit results for 2010 showed increased sales of$47,806,779; 150 jobs created; 410 jobs retained; de-creased costs of $12,127,51 2; and increased capital spending of $18,576,608. The corporation receives about $2 million annually from the federal government. The federal government re- quires local matching funds. The corporation receives$200,000 annually from the state, and the remainder of its$4 million annual budget comes from fee for services. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Trade Adjust- ment Assistance for Firms pr ogram helps American com- panies become more compet itive when faced with import competition in their markets.

In general, fuel used for purposes other than for the propulsion of a motor vehicle on public highways is notsubject to the state motor vehi cle fuel tax or special fuel tax. However, such fuel is subject to the state retails salesand use tax. Fuel used for urban passenger transportationsystems and fuel used for passenger-only-ferry services are exempt from the state retail and use tax as well. Washington State Department of Transportation's public works projects estimated to cost $2 million or more must require the contractor to have a minimum of 15percent of the work performed by apprentices. The Marine Employees Commission (MEC) is the agency that processes grieva nces for the WSF unions and provides arbitration services. In grievance arbitration, the employee organization determ ines whether the issue will be resolved through arbitration. Summary: The Capital Vessel Replacement Account (CVRA) is created. The Comm ission must impose a $0.25 surcharge on every ferry fare sold; the proceeds of which are deposited into the CVRA. Expenditures from theCVRA must be by appropriation and may only be for theconstruction or purchase of ferry vessels. Surchargerevenues are to be first used to support the construction or purchase of a ferry vessel with a carrying capacity of atleast 144 cars.

By Senate Committee on Labo r, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally spon sored by Senators Hewitt, Kohl-Welles and Conway).Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Background: The Washington Horse Racing Commis- sion is authorized to license, regulate, and supervise all race meets in the state. The commission can license racemeets which are nonprofit and meet certain other criteria for a fee of $10 per day. The sponsoring nonprofit is ex-empt from other fees. Other licensees of race meets arenot exempt from these fees or taxes. If a licensee is not exempt from payment of a parimu- tuel tax they must withhold and pay a specific percentageof all daily gross receipts from its in-state parimutuel ma-chines, based on the gross receipts of all its in-state pari-mutuel machines in the previo us calendar year. A licensee is also required to forward one-tenth of 1 percent of thedaily gross receipts of its in-s tate parimutuel machines to the commission for payment to certain non-profit horse race meets. Payments to nonprofit race meets must onlybe used for purses at race tracks that have been operatingfor the five consecutive years immediately preceding theyear of payment. The commissi on is required to distribute $15,800 per race day from the funds generated. If thesefunds are not sufficient to pay for purses of $15,800 perrace day, the commission is au thorized to pay for them by other means such as: fines im posed by the board of stew- ards, a percentage of an authorized source market fee gen-erated from advance deposit wagering, interest earnedfrom the commission operatin g account or from the ac- count. If more than $15,800 is generated per race day, theexcess must be returned to th e licensees. Funds not need- ed in a calendar year must be deposited in the WashingtonHorse Racing Commission operating account. Investment earnings from the Washington Horse Rac- ing Commission operating acco unt are required to be dis- tributed to the class C purse fund account for nonprofit race meets. When determining how to a llocate funds available for the purpose of developing the equine industry the commis-sion must give first consideration to uses that assist thenonprofit race meets and equine health research. Summary: Payments to fund purses at nonprofit race meets must be to only those ra ce tracks that have been op- erating in 2010 or for the five consecutive years immedi- ately preceding the year of payment. The commission is required to distribute up to $15,800 from funds generated for nonprofit race meets. Pr ovisions for the commission to cover payment of purses for no nprofit race meets when in- sufficient funds are generated are removed. Provisions forreturn of excess funds to licensees are removed. Investment earnings from the Washington Horse Rac- ing Commission operating account at the State Treasurerare retained in the operating account, not the class C pursefund.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 5, 2011 ESSB 5748 C 281 L 11 Regarding cottage food operations. By Senate Committee on Ag riculture & Rural Economic Development (originally sponsored by Senators Rockefeller, Honeyford and Chase). Senate Committee on Agri culture & Rural Economic Development House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources House Committee on Health & Human Services Appropriations & Oversight Background: In 2010 Michigan enacted a law allowing residents to make certain food products at home and to sell them. Previously, residents we re required to make their foods in a commercial kitche n certified by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and to pay license fees. TheMichigan law covers busi nesses that gross less than $15,000 annually. The foods that can be sold must be clas-sified as non-potentially hazardous foods and the Senate 46 2House 93 2331legislation contains a list of items that qualify and that do not qualify. Washington State has similar requirements to those that existed in Michigan prio r to the passage of the 2010 Michigan legislation. There is interest in Washington State to allow a similar progra m to allow cottage food op- erations to sell breads, baked goods, and other fooddirectly to the ultimate consumer. Summary: Cottage food is defined to include baked goods, jams, jellies, preserves, fruit butters, and other non- potentially hazardous food iden tified by rule, that may be produced for sale in a person's home kitchen. Cottagefoods may be sold only direc tly to the consumer and may not be sold through the Internet, mail order, or for retailsale outside the state. A permitted cottage food operation may have sales of up to $15,000 per year. This maximumannual sales limit may be incr eased by rule each biennium to reflect inflation. To produce cottage foods, a person is required to ob- tain a permit from the Departme nt of Agriculture (Depart- ment) and to allow inspection of the kitchen and areas of the home in which the cottage food is prepared or stored. Fees include a $30 permit fee, a $75 public health review fee, and a $125 basic hygiene inspection fee. An addition-al fee may be charged for additional complianceinspections. The areas of the home used to prepare or store cottage food products are subject to inspection. The operator mustsign a document that expressly grants authority to the De- partment the right to enter th is portion of the residence during normal business hours or other reasonable times. Ifaccess is denied to this area, the Department is authorizedto obtain a search warrant for the permitted area fromcourt. Denial of access to the Department may be groundsfor denial or suspension of a permit. Labeling requirements are lis ted and must include the statement: \"Made in a home k itchen that has not been sub- ject to standard inspection criteria.\" Any person whoworks at a cottage food operation must have secured afood and beverage service worker's permit. The Department may contract with local health juris- dictions to conduct the requ ired inspections. Except as otherwise provided, cottage fo od operations with the re- quired permits are not requir ed to be licensed under the state Food Processors Act nor to be permitted or inspected by a local health jurisdiction. This act does not affect ap- plication of any other state or federal law, or anyapplicable local ordinance. The Department may adopt by rule, requirements for cottage food operations pertaining to: the permit application and renewal process; sanitary procedures; facility, equipment, and utensils; food product labeling in addition to those specifically listed in the legislation; clean water sources and waste and wastewater disposal; and washing and hygiene practices.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011Senate 47 2 House 92 0 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5749 332ESSB 5749 PARTIAL VETO C 12 L 11 E 1 Regarding the Washington advanced college tuition payment (GET) program. By Senate Committee on High er Education & Workforce Development (originally sponsored by Senators Brown, Hewitt and Shin). Senate Committee on Higher Education & Workforce Development Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Guaranteed Education Tuition (GET) Program is Washington's 529 prepaid college tuition plan. Families can prepay for their child's college tuition today knowing that the value of th eir account is guaranteed by the state to keep pace with ri sing college tuition. Since GET began in 1998, familie s have opened more than 119,000 accounts. The state guarantees that 100 GET units will cover one year of resident undergradu ate tuition and state-mandated fees at the most expensive Washington public university.GET accounts can be used at nearly any public or privatecollege in the country. Fa milies can buy between one and 500 units per child, and the account will benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals. To date, 16,500 studentshave used their GET accounts in all 50 states. The Higher Education Coordinating Board adminis- ters the GET Program while the State Investment Boardoversees its investments. A five-member committee es-tablishes the policies of the program and sets the price of the GET unit, currently $117. Summary: The Committee on Advanced Tuition Pay- ment (Committee) utilizes the State Actuary in reviewing the Guaranteed Education Tui tion Program rather than a nationally recognized actuary , but the Committee may, at its discretion, obtain an asse ssment by a nationally recog- nized actuary. The Committee, with the State Actuary, re- views the program in light of passage of E2SHB 1795(Higher Education Opportunity Act) and makes any nec- essary changes to the program for units purchased on orafter September 1, 2011. A legislative advisory co mmittee to the Committee on Advanced Tuition Payment is established. The advisorycommittee provides advice to the Committee and the state actuary regarding the administration of the program in-cluding, but not limited to, pr icing guidelin es, the tuition unit price, and the unit payout value.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 6, 2011 (Sections 1-6) August 24, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed section 1 of the bill which would have expanded the membership of the Committee on Advanced Tuition Payment to include citizen and business representatives. VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 5749 June 6, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 1, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5749 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the Washington advanced college tuition payment program.\" Section 1 would expand the membership of the Committee on Advanced Tuition Paym ent, limit private sector and citizen repre- sentatives on the committee to f our year terms and require Senate confirmation of citize n and business representatives. The work of this committee involves oversigh t of complex financial issues. The bill does not stagger th e terms of the commi ttee members, and ex- pands the number of term-limited members to four of the commit- tee's seven members. Unstaggered and limited terms for a majority of the committee members would leave the committee highly vul- nerable to the loss of expert ise accumulated by citizen and business representatives and inhibi t the work of this committee. For these reasons, I have veto ed Section 1 of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5749. With the exception of Section 1, Engro ssed Substitute Senate Bill 5749 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire Governor SB 5763 C 7 L 11 Amending the existing nonresident retail sales tax exemption. By Senators Ranker, Ericksen, Morton, Fraser and Shin; by request of Department of Revenue. Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Retail sales and use taxes are imposed by the state, cities, and counties. Retail sales taxes are im- posed on retail sales of most articles of tangible personal property, digital products, and some services. A retail sale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of the property,digital product, or service. If retail sales taxes were notSenate 47 0 House 90 2 (House amended) Senate 41 3 House 89 7 333collected when the property, digital products, or services were acquired by the user, then use taxes apply to the valueof most tangible personal pr operty, digital products, and some services when used in this state. A sales tax exemption is allowed to residents of a state, possession, or Canadian province that does not im-pose a retail sales tax or use tax of 3 percent or more onpurchases of goods for use ou tside the state. The exemp- tion does not apply to items or services consumed in thestate such as hotel stays or meals at restaurants. Retailersare not required to make ta x-exempt sales to qualifying nonresidents. A vendor may choose to collect sales tax onpurchases made by qualifying nonresidents or to sellmerchandise tax free. Beginning July 1, 2010, the provinces of British Co- lumbia and Ontario implemen ted a Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), which replaced their prov incial sales taxes. The Department of Revenue (DOR) has determined that, de-spite its name, the HST is not a retail sales tax but rather avalue added tax. Consequently, the department took theposition that residents of British Columbia and Ontariowould become eligible for the nonresident sales tax exemption effective July 1, 2010. The City of Bellingham and Whatcom County brought suit against the department, arguing that residentsof British Columbia and othe r provinces that have imple- mented an HST are not entitled to the nonresident exemp- tion. On July 16, 2010, a Skagit County Superior Court judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring DOR to advise retailers not to grant the nonresident retail sales tax exemption to residents of Br itish Columbia, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario,and Quebec. Summary: Residents of any state, possession, territory or province of Canada may not take the nonresident sales tax exemption if their place of residence imposes sales tax, usetax, value added tax, gross receipts tax or similar generallyapplicable tax of 3 percent or more. This is an expansion of the requirement to qualify for the exemption as current- ly it is limited to only sales and use taxes of less than 3 percent in order to ta ke the exemption. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 20112ESB 5764 PARTIAL VETO C 14 L 11 E 1 Creating innovate Washington. By Senators Kastama, Ch ase, Shin, Kilmer, Brown, Conway and McAuliffe.Senate Committee on Econom ic Development, Trade & Innovation Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Legislature created the Washington Technology Center (WTC) in 1983 and the Spokane Inter- collegiate Research and Techno logy Institute (SIRTI) in 1998. Both have a mission to conduct and commercializeresearch and to strengthen university-industry relation- ships through the conduct of r esearch that is primarily of interest to Washington-based companies or state economic development programs. WTC's focus is state-wide whileSIRTI's is Eastern Washington. WTC operates a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Assistance Program and SIRTI has taken part inthe program by assisting small businesses in applying for federal SBIR grants. WTC has a statutory obligation tooperate the Investing in Innovation Grants Program, butfunding has never been appropriated for its operation. The Clean Energy Leadership Council (CELC) was created in 2009 to develop strategies and recommenda-tions for growing the state's clean energy sector. CELCwas directed to identify the clean energy industry seg-ments and where the state ha s competitive advantages or emerging strength in research, development, ordeployment of clean energy solutions. Summary: Innovate Washington is created as the succes- sor agency to WTC and SIRTI and is the primary stateagency responding to the te chnology transfer needs of existing businesses in the state. Innovate Washington: facilitates research suppor tive of state industries and provides mechanisms for collaboration be tween tech- nology-based industries and higher education institutions; helps businesses secure research funds and develops and integrates technology into new products; offers technology transfer and commercialization training opportunities; serves as the lead entity for coordinating clean energy initiatives; and administers technology and innovation grant and loan programs. Innovate Washington must develop a five-year busi- ness plan to be updated every even-numbered year. The first plan is due by December 1, 2012, and must include aplan for operating additional facilities in Vancouver, theSenate 46 1House 95 02ESB 5764 334Tri-Cities, and Bellingham. Th e plan must also include methods of working with co mmunity and technical colleg- es, including Centers of Excellence; methods to ensure ac- cess to Innovate Washington's services by clients ofImpact Washington; mechanisms for outreach to firms inInnovation Partnership Zones; and a clean energycomponent consistent with CELC recommendations. A board of directors (board) governs Innovate Wash- ington. The board must convene a group to determine thebest method to develop and make available a database ofin-state technologies and inventio ns. It must also report to the Governor and the Legislature every year on customersatisfaction and a variety of outcome measures. The boardis authorized to: employ staff and engage technical experts; create advisory committees; enter into agreements with other entities to carry out any of its programs; solicit funds from a variety of sources; establish affiliated organi zations, special funds, and controls as it sees fit; and delegate any of its powers and duties if consistent with the purposes of the act. Innovate Washington must operate a small business innovation assistance program to help in the procurement of awards from federal small business research programs. Centers of Excellence are to broker assistance avail- able for firms in targeted in dustries and work with Inno- vate Washington to deve lop methods to identify businesses within a targeted industry that could benefit from the services of Innovate Washington. The Investing in Innovation Grants Program is changed to the Investing in Innovation Program. The pro-gram is operated by Innovate Washington and may makeboth loans and grants using fund s raised by the board of di- rectors. Proprietary information of those applying or re-ceiving funding through the Investing in InnovationProgram is not subject to pub lic disclosure. The Investing in Innovation Account is established in the custody of theState Treasurer.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 1, 2011 Partial Veto Summary: The requirements that the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (1) review the performance of Innovate Washington regarding the effec- tiveness of Innovate Washington programs, and (2) makerecommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature by December 1, 2015 were vetoed.VETO MESSAGE ON 2ESB 5764 June 7, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 18, Second Engrossed Senat e Bill 5764 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to innovate Washington.\" This bill creates Innovate Wa shington as the successor agency to the Washington Technology Ce nter and the Spokane Intercolle- giate Research and Technology Institute. Section 1 provides that Innovate Washington will act as the pri- mary agency focused on growing innovation-based sectors of our economy and will work with busines s to meet tec hnology transfer needs. This section defines the mission of Innovate Washington as making our state the best place to develop, build, and deploy inno- vative products with collaborative partnerships among academic institutions, industry and governmen t. Among the means Section 1 outlines to carry out this mission is leveraging state investments in sector-focused, innovation-based economic development initia- tives. Innovate Washington is desi gnated as the lead entity to co- ordinate and approve state funding \"for programs targeted at expanding the clean energy sector \" while maintaining policy and regulatory functions at the stat e energy office housed at the Department of Commerce. Given Innovate Washington's miss ion, the definition of \"lead en- tity\" in Section 1(7) to mean \"t he organization that all other state agencies must coordinate with and receive approval from in order to award state funds in support of clean energy initiatives\" is lim- ited to approval of state fundi ng awards for the primary purpose of economic development in the clean energy sector. Approval would not extend to state funding of initiatives not specifically tar- geted to grow the clean energy sect or. Moreover, as stated in a col- loquy on the Senate floor and cons istent with the terminology clean energy \"initiatives,\" the approval required under Section1(7) applies to new programs begun after the effect ive date of the act. The above understanding and in terpretation of the bill is shared by the legislature as set fort h in a letter to me from Senator Jim Kastama and Representative Deb Eddy dated May 25, 2011encouraging me to give clarif ying direction to the agencies involved. It is with this understanding that I approve Section 1. I am vetoing Section 18 of Se cond Engrossed Senate Bill 5764 which requires the joint legislat ive audit and review committee to review performance of Innovate Washington and to make recom- mendations regarding the effectiv eness of its programs by Decem- ber 1, 2015. Innovate Washington is required to submit its first five year business plan to the legisl ature by December 1, 2012, which will identify its ac tivities and programs, and set forth its opera- tional plan and strategy for carryin g out its mission. The timing of a study to determine the effectivenes s of its programs is best deter- mined based on the schedule in the business plan. When the busi-ness plan is completed, the joint legislative audit and review committee can determine the appr opriate timing and content of a review based on experience wi thout the need for a statutory provision. For this reason, I am vetoing Se ction 18 of Second Engrossed Senate Bill 5764. With the exception of Section 18, Second Engrossed Senate Bill 5764 is approved. Re spectfully submitted, Christine O. Gregoire GovernorSenate 46 2 Senate 43 0 House 53 35 (House amended)Senate 45 2 (Senate concurred) E2SSB 5769 335E2SSB 5769 C 180 L 11 Regarding coal-fired electr ic generation facilities. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Rockefeller, Pridemore, Kohl-Welles,White, Chase, Murray, Fraser, Shin andKline). Senate Committee on Enviro nment, Water & Energy Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on EnvironmentHouse Committee on Capital Budget Background: Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduc- tions . The state is required to achieve the following state- wide GHG emission reductions: by 2020 reduce overall GHG emissions in the state to 1990 levels; by 2035 reduce overall GHG emissions in the state to 25 percent below 1990 levels; and by 2050 reduce overall GHG emissions in the state to 50 percent below 1990 levels, or 70 percent below the state's expected GHG emissions that year.GHG Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) for Electric Generation Plants . Electric utilities may not enter into a long-term financial co mmitment for baseload elec- tric generation on or after July 1, 2008, unless the generating plant's emissions are the lower of: 1100 pounds of GHG per megawatt (MW)-hour; or the average available GHG emissions output as updated by the Department of Commerce (Commerce). Baseload electric generation means electric genera- tion from a power plant that is designed and intended to provide electricity at an annualized plant capacity factor of at least 60 percent. Long-term financial commitmentmeans (1) either a new ownership interest in baseloadelectric generation or an upgrade to a baseload electricgeneration facility; or (2) a new or renewed contract forbaseload electric generation with a term of five or moreyears for the provision of retail power or wholesale powerto end-use customers in this state. Executive Order . In 2009 the Governor issued an ex- ecutive order directing the Department of Ecology (Ecol-ogy) to work with the ex isting coal-fired plant within Washington that burns over 1 million tons of coal per year, TransAlta Centralia Genera tion LLC, to establish an agreed order to apply the EPS to the facility by no laterthan December 31, 2025. The agreed order must include a schedule of major decision making and resourceinvestment milestones. Senate Work Sessions . On January 19, 2011, the Sen- ate Environment, Water & Energy Committee held a worksession on the role of coal in meeting Washington's elec-tric needs. On January 21 , 2011, the same committee helda work session on the environmental and health impacts ofcoal power. Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) . EFSEC is the permitting and cer tificating authority for the siting of major energy facilit ies in Washington, such as thermal electric power plants 350 megawatts or greater. In addition, energy facilities of any size that exclusively usealternative energy resources (wind, solar, geothermal,landfill gas, wave or tidal ac tion, or biomass energy) can opt-in to the EFSEC process. EFSEC must generally pro-cess an application within 12 months of receipt; however, it can be as short as 180 days under an expedited sitingprocess. Community Economic Rev italization Board (CERB) . Comprised of 20 members ap pointed by the Governor, CERB funds public infrastructure improvements, such asthe acquisition, construction, or repair of water and sewer systems, bridges, railroad spurs, telecommunication systems, roads, structures, and port facilities. Public Works Board . Comprised of 13 members ap- pointed by the Governor, the Public Works Board admin-isters the public works assista nce account to provide loans to local governments and sp ecial purpose districts with infrastructure projects. Sales and Use Tax Exemptions for Coal . Purchases of coal used at a thermal electr ic generating facility placed in operation after 1969 and before July 1, 1997, are exemptfrom retail sales and use taxes. The exemptions are con-tingent upon owners of the plant demonstrating to Ecologythat progress is being made to install the necessary air pol-lution control devices and that the facility has emitted nomore than 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide during theprevious 12 months. Technology to Control Emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) . Selective Catalytic Re duction (SCR) is a technol- ogy for capturing NOx emissi ons from industrial boilers such as coal fired power plan ts. It uses a combination of ammonia injection and a cata lyst to capture NOx emis- sions. Selective Noncatalytic is also aNOx control technology for indust rial boilers. It is similar to SCR but only uses injected ammonia without a catalyst. According to Ecology, SCR ma y capture up to 90 percent of NOx emissions from a large coal-fired plant whileSNCR may capture up to 25 percent, but SCR issubstantially more expensive than SNCR. Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) . The WUTC is a three-member commission that has broad authority to regulate the rates, services, andpractices of investor-owned electric utilities, among otherindustries. Under general ra te-making principles, an elec- tric utility may recover the full cost of a power purchasecontract in rates, with no additional premium, if the con- tract is approved by the WUTC. An electric utility may re-cover the full cost of an investment in a new generatingfacility in rates, with an additional return to reflect the riskof the investment, if the investment is approved by theWUTC.E2SSB 5769 336Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) . All investor-owned and consumer-owned electric utilities in the state, with more than 25,000 customers, must develop IRPs. All oth- er utilities in the state, incl uding those that essentially re- ceive all their power from the Bonneville PowerAdministration, must file either an IRP or a less detailedresource plan. An IRP must describe the mix of generating resources and conservation and efficien cy resources that will meet current and projected needs at the lowest reasonable cost to the utility and its ratepa yers. When determining the lowest reasonable cost for resources identified in its IRP, autility must consider state an d federal policies regarding resource preference, among other factors. Carbon Dioxide Mitigation for Fossil-Fueled Energy Facilities . Under state law, certain fossil-fueled thermal power facilities with a genera ting capacity of 25 MW or more must mitigate their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.The requirement applies to ne w electric generating facili- ties seeking site certificatio n from EFSEC or an order of approval under the Washington Clean Air Act. The re-quirement also applies to existing facilities between 25and 350 MW that increase their generating capacity by atleast 25 MW or their emissions production of CO2 by 15percent or more. Mitigation is required for 20 percent of the CO2 emis- sions produced by a facility over a 30-year period, and must include one or a combination of the following op-tions: (1) payments to an in dependent qualified organiza- tion; (2) direct purchase of permanent carbon credits; or(3) direct investment in CO 2 mitigation projects, includ- ing qualified alternative energy resources andcogeneration. Summary: Applying the EPS to Specified Facilities . A coal-fired baseload electric generation facility in Washing- ton that emitted more than 1 million tons of GHG in any calendar year prior to 2008 (qualifying facility) must meet the lower of the following emissions standards such thatone generating boiler is in compliance by December 31, 2020, and any other generating boilers are in complianceby December 31, 2025: 1100 pounds of GHG per MW-hour; or the average available GHG emissions output as updated by Commerce, whichever is lower. The emission standard does not apply to a coal-fired baseload electric generating f acility if Ecology determines as a requirement of state or federal law or regulation that selective catalytic reduction te chnology must be installed on any of its boilers. Requiring a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) . By January 1, 2012, the Governor on behalf of the state mustenter into an MOA that takes effect on April 1, 2012, withthe owners of a qualifying f acility for achieving the spec- ified emissions reductions. The MOA must include a number of terms, such as bi nding commitments to install SNCR pollution control technolo gy by January 1, 2013.The MOA terminates if Ecolog y determines state or feder- al law or regulation requires the installation of SCR tech- nology. If the MOA is not signed by January 1, 2012, theGovernor must impose requir ements consistent with the installation of SNCR technology. The MOA must also require the facility to provide the following financial assistance to the affected community:(1) $30 million for economic development and energy ef- ficiency and weatherization; and (2) $25 million for ener-gy technologies with the pote ntial to create considerable energy, economic development, and air quality, haze, orother environmental benefits. The MOA must specify the accounts where the funds are to be deposited, individualswho may approve expenditures from the accounts, and theschedule for disbursing the fu nds. Financial assistance is no longer required if the sal es and use tax exemptions on coal are repealed. If an MOA is reached, no st ate agency or political sub- division of the state may adop t or impose additional or in- consistent GHG emission standard s as specified in the act. Recognizing Coal Transition Power in the EPS and in WUTC Rate Proceedings . The EPS is amended to allow long-term contracts for the ou tput of a qualifying facility, called coal transition power (transition power). In addi- tion, a process is created to a llow an electric utility to pe- tition the WUTC for approval of a power purchaseagreement for transition powe r. If approved, the utility may treat the purchase as an investment entitled to a por- tion of the premium it would receive if it constructed afacility with an equivalent generation capacity. Recognizing Carbon Reductions . An MOA may in- clude provisions reco gnizing such reduct ions in relating to GHG emissions, andadvocating for such reductio ns in all established and emerging regional, national, or international GHG frame-works. The Governor may recommend actions to the Leg-islature concerning the recogn ition of investments in early emissions reductions. Requiring Expedited EFSEC Processing . EFSEC must use its expedited proces s for siting generating facili- ties meeting the EPS if the facility is to be sited in thecounty where a qualifying facility is located, and if thesiting application is filed before December 31, 2025. Requiring a Decommissioning Plan . A qualifying fa- cility subject to closure must provide Ecology with a plan for the closure and postclosure of the facility at least 24months prior to closure or 24 months prior to start of de-commissioning work, whichever is earlier. Among otherthings, the plan must includ e financial assurances to fund required activities and the pr eparation of a decommission- ing and site restoration plan. The decommissioning planas well as any significant changes to it are subject toEcology's approval. Requiring Financial Assistance Guarantees in the Decommissioning Plan . A qualifying facility subject to2ESB 5773 337closure must guarantee funds are available to perform all activities in the decommissi oning plan. The guarantee may be accomplished with an Ecology approved letter ofcredit, surety bond, or other means acceptable to Ecology. Providing for Community Economic Development . CERB and the Public Works Board must each solicit andgive priority consideration to projects that attract new in- dustrial and commercial projects to areas affected by theclosure or potential closure of a qualifying facility. Projectawards must be consistent w ith applicable plans for future major industrial activities on la nds formerly used or desig- nated for surface coal mining and other supporting uses. Requiring Additional Analysis in IRPs . When devel- oping its IRP, a utility must compare the benefits and risksof purchasing power or building new resources. Exempting Certain Fossil-Fueled Facilities from Car- bon Mitigation . The owner of a qualifying facility apply- ing to EFSEC for the siting a natural gas-fired generationplant to be constructed in a co unty with the qualifying fa- cility is exempt from state ca rbon mitigation requirements, if the application is filed be fore December 31, 2025. The exemption expires December 31 , 2025, or when the sta- tion-generating capability of a ll natural gas-fired genera- tion plants approved under this provision equals the station-generating capability from a coal-fired electricgeneration facility subject to the EPS provision forqualifying facilities. Adopting Findings, Expressing Legislative Intent, and Adding a Severability Clause . Various findings are adopt- ed, including the harmful ef fects of emissions from the combustion of coal to generate electricity; the contributionof coal-fired electricity generation as a large source of thestate's GHG emissions; the role of coal-fired electricitygeneration in providing baseload power necessary fornear-term grid stability and re liability; and that coal-fired baseload electric generation facilities are a significantcontributor of family-wage jobs. Among other things, the Legislature intends to pro- vide for the reduction of GHG emissions from large coal-fired baseload electric power generation facilities; to en-sure appropriate cleanup and site restoration upon decom- missioning of any facilities in the state; and to provide assistance to host communiti es planning for new econom- ic development a nd mitigating the economic impacts of the closure of these facilities. A severability clause is added, stating that if any pro- vision of this act or its appli cation to any person or circum- stance is held invalid, the re mainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons orcircumstances is not affected.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 20112ESB 5773 C 8 L 11 E 1 Making a health savings account option and high deduct- ible health plan option an d a direct patient-provider primary care practice option available to publicemployees. By Baumgartner, Hill, Parlette, Schoesler, Newbry. Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 2003 Congress enacted section 223 of the Medicare Modernization Act which allows people to establish health savings accou nts (HSAs) to work in com- bination with qualifying high-deductible health plans(HDHP) to help finance medical expenses. A health planqualifies as an HDHP if it ha s an annual deductible of at least $1,200 for individuals and annual out-of-pocket ex-penses (not premiums) that do not exceed $5,950. HSAsare tax-free accounts that can be set up by individuals or employers. They are personal accounts that are owned byindividuals, even when empl oyers establish and contribute to them. Interest earned is no t taxed, and funds that are not used may carry over to the following year. Under Chapter 299, Laws of 2006 (EHB 1383) the Health Care Authority (HCA) is directed to develop aHealth Savings Account option for covered employees. AHealth Savings Account option is not currently available to employees enrolled in HCA- administered health plans. Chapter 257, Laws of 2007 (E2SSB 5958) created a statutory framework for direct patient-provider primaryhealth care practices. Direct practices were explicitly ex- empted from the definition of health care service contrac-tors in insurance law. Di rect practices furnish primary care services in exchange for a direct fee from a patient.Services are limited to primary care, including screening,assessment, diagnosis, and tr eatment for the purpose of promotion of health, and detection and management ofdisease or injury. Direct practices are also allowed to payfor charges associated with ro utine lab and imaging servic- es. Direct practices are prevented from accepting pay-ments for services provided to direct care patients from regulated insurance carriers, all insurance programs ad- ministered by the Washington State Health Care Authority(Authority), or self-insured plans. Direct practices mayaccept payment of direct fees directly or indirectly from non-employer third parties, but are prevented from sellingtheir direct practice agreements directly to employergroups. Summary: The Health Care Authority (HCA) is directed to offer a high-deductible hea lth plan with a health savings account as an option alongsid e its traditional comprehen- sive medical insurance offerings in the Public Employees'Benefits Board (PEBB) program, beginning with the 2012plan year. The HCA must also develop a plan to offer di-rect patient-provider primary care practices to PEBBSenate 36 13House 87 9 (House amended)Senate 33 14 (Senate concurred)SSB 5784 338participants for the open en rollment period beginning with the 2013 plan year and submit the plan to the PEBB and the House and Senate health care committees byDecember 1, 2011. By November 30, 2015, and annually thereafter, the Health Care Authority is requir ed to submit a report to the relevant legislative policy an d fiscal committees that in- cludes medical care utilization trends over the past threeyears, the demographics of each plan offered to employ-ees, and the impact of alternative plan offerings on themost comprehensive plan offered to employees.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 SSB 5784 C 250 L 11 Advancing the regional ocean partnership. By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Litzow, Ranker,Swecker, Hobbs, Fain, Hill, Pridemore, Nelson,Rockefeller, Regala, Shin and Kline). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters House Committee on Environment Background: West Coast Governors' Agreement on Ocean Health (WCGA) . On September 18, 2006, the Governors of California, Oreg on, and Washington entered into the WCGA. The WCGA cites a need to improve co- ordination among coastal governing bodies, and states adesire to advance the following goals: clean coastal waters and beaches; promote effective eco system based management; reduce impacts of offshore development; increase ocean awareness and literacy among the region's citizens; expand ocean and coastal scientific information, research, and monitoring; and encourage sustainable economic development of coastal communities.Marine Resources Stewardship Trust Account (Ac- count) . The Account was created in 2010 as an appropri- ated account that can accept grants, gifts, donations, and appropriations.

By Senate Committee on Transportation (originally sponsored by Senators King, Haugen and Shin). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Currently, Washington State law does not permit the conversion of off-road motorcycles for on-street use. Summary: A person may operate an off-road motorcycle upon a public road, street, or highway in Washington, if the person complies with th e following requirements: file a motorcycle use declaration, in which the Department of Licensing (DOL) certifies confor- mance with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and state standards; obtain and have in full force and effect a current and proper off-road vehicle (ORV) registration ortemporary ORV use permit; obtain a valid driver's license and motorcycle endorsement issued to Washington residents; and install various outlined motorcycle components, if not already present on th e off-road motorcycle. An off-road motorcycle is defined. In order to be reg- istered for on-road use, an of f-road motorcycle must travel on two wheels with a seat desi gned to be straddled by the operator and have handlebar-type steering control. DOL must establish a declar ation, which must be sub- mitted by an off-road motorcyc le owner when applying for on-road registration of an off-road motorcycle. The declaration must include the following: documentation of a safe ty inspection conducted by a licensed dealership or repair shop; documentation that the lic ensed dealership or repair shop did not charge more than $100 for the inspec- tion, all of which goes to the dealership or repairshop; verification of the vehicle identification number; and a release signed by the owner that releases the state from liability.

By Senate Committee on Labo r, Commerce & Consumer Protection (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles, Holmquist Newbry, Conway and Kline). Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: The state Industrial Insurance Program provides medical and other benefits to workers who suffer a work-related injury or develop an occupational disease.The Industrial Insurance Prog ram is administered by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) and is fundedthrough a premium collected from employers and employ- ees in the state. An injured worker can see the medicalprofessional of his or her choice who is qualified to treatthe injury. Centers of Occupational H ealth and Education (CO- HE) are resources that attemp t to improve injured worker outcomes and reduce disab ility through community-based health care delivery. COHE efforts focus on the first 12weeks of a claim and promote disability preventionthrough helping coordinate he alth services and return to work activities, assisting providers to adopt occupationalhealth best practices, and early identification of cases thatappear to be at risk for long-term disability. There are cur-rently four COHEs in the state: Renton COHE at ValleyMedical Center; Eastern Washington COHE at St. Luke'sRehabilitation Institute in Sp okane; the Everett Clinic; and Harborview Medical Center. Summary: L&I must establish a health care provider net- work to treat injured workers. Providers who meet mini- mum standards are accepted into the network and must agree to follow L&I evidence-based coverage decisions,treatment guidelines, and policies. Providers who followL&I established best practice standards can qualify for asecond tier within the network. Financial and nonfinancial incentives may be provided to second tier providers. L&I is to convene an advisory group to advise the departmenton issues related to the im plementation of the network, and seek input of various health care provider groups andassociations concerning implementation of the network. Network provider contracts will automatically renew, unless L&I or the provider give written notice of contract termination. Once a provider network is established in a worker's geographic area, an injured worker needs to seek medical services from a health care provider in the net- work. Providers failing to meet minimum network stan-dards can be temporarily or permanently removed fromthe network.L&I must establish additiona l COHEs, with a goal of extending access to all in jured workers by December 2015. L&I can certify or decertify COHEs based on crite-ria listed in the legislation. Incentives can be establishedfor COHE providers, and el ectronic methods of tracking measures to identify and im prove outcomes for injured workers are to be developed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2011 SB 5806 C 352 L 11 Authorizing a statewide raffle to benefit veterans and their families.

Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Lottery . The Washington Lottery was es- tablished in 1982. Lottery revenues are used for the following purposes: Washington Opportunity Pathways Account; stadium bonds; problem gambling education; economic development; and General Fund. Veterans Innovations Program . In 2006 the Legisla- ture established the Veterans Innovations Program (VIP) within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The purpose of the VIP is to provide crisis and emergency relief and edu- cation, training, and employment assistance to veteransand their families. The VIP terminates on June 30, 2016. Two separate programs were created within the VIP: the Defenders' Fund Program and the Competitive GrantProgram.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Murray, Litzow, McAuliffe, Nelson,Hill, White, Kohl-Welles, Fain and Eide). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: A hotel-motel tax is a special sales tax on lodging rentals by hotels, mo tels, rooming houses, private campgrounds, RV parks, and si milar facilities. Cities and counties are authorized to levy a basic, or state-shared ho- tel-motel tax of up to 2 percent. These taxes are credited against the state sales tax on the furnishing of lodging.Other hotel-motel taxes are imposed in addition to ordi-nary state and local sales taxes and are added to theamount paid by the customer . The latter type is often referred to as special hotel-motel taxes. In King County the 2 percent state-shared hotel-motel tax is currently used for retir ing the debt on the Kingdome and supporting arts and heritage programs. After 2015 (orearlier if the debt is repaid) th e tax will be used to repay the debt on the football stad ium and exhibition center and to provide youth athletic-facility grants to cities, counties,or nonprofit organizations if su fficient money is available. Cities in King County, except Bellevue, are not al- lowed to impose the 2 percent state-shared hotel-motel tax until the football stadium and exhibition center debt isretired. This is anticip ated to occur in 2020. The distribution of a portion of the 2 percent state- shared hotel-motel tax to arts and heritage programs isscheduled to end in 2012. Fo rty percent of these distribu- tions are deposited into an endowment (fund) of which only the earnings on the fund may be spent on currentprograms. Established in January 2003, 4Culture is King Coun- ty's cultural services agency. It continues the work of the King County Arts Commission, Public Art Commission,and the heritage programs of the Landmarks Commission.4Culture is a tax-exempt pu blic corporation with a 15 member Board of Directors who are nominated by theKing County Executive and confirmed by the Metropoli-tan King County Council. 4C ulture receives a portion ofthe hotel-motel tax revenues to provide funding to support the visual and performing arts, public art, heritageprograms, and historic preservation. Summary: The 40 percent distribution of King County's hotel-motel tax to arts and he ritage programs is no longer distributed to the fund, but instead is distributed to an ac-count dedicated to art muse ums, cultural museums, heri- tage museums, the arts, and performing arts. In addition,the fund is retired and the principal from the fund may be spent on the arts, culture, and heritage programs. At the time the bonds used to pay for the repairs to the Kingdome are retired, the co unty hotel-motel tax will be distributed into the account de dicated to the arts, culture, and heritage programs until December 31, 2015. The prohibition for cities in King County imposing the 2 percent state shared hotel-mo tel tax is extended indefi- nitely. Beginning January 1, 2021, at least 37.5 percent ofthe county hotel-motel tax reve nues will be distributed to the account dedicated to art museums, cultural museums,heritage museums, the ar ts, and performing arts. Yakima County can contin ue to receive hotel/motel tax distributions from within the city of Yakima until 2035. The requirement that Yakima County must do a fi-nancial audit of organizations that receive funding from the lodging tax is removed. Beginning January 1, 2021, at least 37.5 percent of the county hotel-motel tax revenues will be distributed for af- fordable workforce housing and services for homelessyouth. The Washington State Major League Baseball Stadi- um Public Facilities District is authorized to impose the 10 percent parking tax at a park ing facility owned or leased by the district without voter ap proval. This tax is in lieu of the city parking tax. The revenue from the tax must beused for repair, re-equipping , and capital improvement of the baseball stadium. The permitted uses of the co unty 5 percent admissions charge is changed to fund re pair, re-equipping, and capital improvement of the baseball stadium.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011Senate 46 2 House 96 1 Senate 35 14 Senate 33 8 House 62 34SSB 5836 343SSB 5836 C 379 L 11 Allowing certain private transportation providers to use certain public transportation facilities. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators King, Haugen, Hobbs, Delvin and Shin). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Washington's rules of the road exclude cer- tain vehicles from traveling in the left-hand lane of a lim- ited access roadway having three or more lanes of traffictraveling in one direction. Under the rules of the road, many buses are excluded from the left-hand lane because of weight restrictions. The high occupancy vehicle (HOV)lane is not considered the left-hand lane. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and local jurisdictions are authorized to reserve all or any portion of a highway or roadway for the exclu-sive or preferential use of public transportation vehicles. Currently, there are lanes reserved for the exclusive use oftransit in the City of Seattle. In addition, WSDOT and local jurisdictions are autho- rized to reserve all or a portion of a highway or roadwayfor the exclusive or preferenti al use of private motor vehi- cles carrying a specified number of passengers. Publictransportation vehicles may use the HOV lanes regardlessof the number of passengers in the vehicle. Private buses may use the HOV lanes regardless of the number of pas-sengers in the vehicle if the bus has the capacity to carry16 or more passengers. Summary: The Washington State Department of Trans- portation (WSDOT) and local jurisdictions are authorized to allow certain private transportation provider vehicles to use HOV lanes and lanes reserved for public transporta-tion on highways, except for tr ansit-only lanes that allow other vehicles to access abutting businesses. Local authorities are encouraged to establish a process for private transportation prov iders to apply for the use of public transportation faciliti es and to allow such use. Transit agencies that receive state funding for park and ride lots are required to make reasonable accommodationsfor certain private transporta tion providers unless the fa- cility is at or exceeds 90 percent capacity during two con-secutive months. Allows the transit agency to recoveractual costs and fair market value. WSDOT must convene a stakeholder process to deve lop standard forms, permit rates, and indemnification pr ovisions for use by local authorities. WSDOT and local authorities are required, when de- signing portions of roadways intended for the exclusive orpreferential use of public transportation, to considerwhether the design will safely accommodate certain private transportation provider vehicles.If any part of the act is found to conflict with a pre- scribed condition to allocati on of federal funding, the conflicting portion is inoperable.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011 SB 5849 C 113 L 11 Concerning estates and trusts. By Senators Prentice and Parlette.Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Judiciary Background: SSB 6831 was enacted in 2010 in order to provide a rule of construction in interpreting formula clauses in wills and trusts that referred to the federal estatetax or generation-skipping transfer tax exemptionamounts. The purpose of th e bill was to address issues which arose in 2010 when there was no federal estate tax.Because there was no federal estate tax, there was noexemption amount, so the formula clauses did not work. SSB 6831 created a rebuttable presumption that the decedent intended, when using a formula clause, the estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptionamounts be equal to what th ey were when the applicable federal tax was last in effect, i.e ., $3.5 million on December 31, 2009. On December 17, 2010, Congress retroactively reen- acted the estate tax and generation-skipping transfer taxprovisions to January 1, 2010. At the same time, Congressincreased these exemptions to $5 million which were also retroactive to January 1, 2010. As a result, for decedents dying after December 31, 2009, and before December 18, 2010, it is not clear if for-mula clauses used in wills and trusts would result in apresumed exemption amount of $3.5 million or $5 million. Summary: For estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2009, and before December 18, 2010, the act: 1. Allows for the introduc tion of extrinsic evidence in order to determine what w as the testator's or grant- or's intent regarding a formula clause based on the federal estate tax or genera tion-skipping transfer tax exemptions, even if the will is not ambiguous. 2. Removes the presumption created by SSB 6831 that the formula amount mentioned in paragraph #1 aboveis $3.5 million. It also a llows for construction of theSenate 47 0 House 96 1 (House amended) (Senate refused to concur) Conference Committee Senate 45 0House 97 0ESSB 5860 344formula as meaning $3.5 million or $5 million based on the decedent's intent. 3. Changes the time limit for bringing a judicial con- struction action under RCW 11.108.080 to two years following the death of the decedent's death, as opposed to one year. 4. In order to conform to federal disclaimer law, extends the time to make a qualifie d disclaimer of property passing from an estate of decedent dying after De- cember 31, 2009, and prior to December 18, 2010, tothe later of nine months fo llowing the date of death or September 17, 2010. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 18, 2011 ESSB 5860 C 39 L 11 E 1 Addressing temporary compen sation reductions for state government employees during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Murray; by request of Office of FinancialManagement). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The programs and functions of state gov- ernment are administered by numerous state agencies and institutions, the costs of whic h are appropriated by the Legislature. These costs in clude expenditures for salaries, wages, equipment, personal services contracts, and stateemployee travel and training. Generally, state employment positions are either ex- empt, general service, or Washington Management Ser-vice (WMS). General service employees are eligible tocollectively bargain if they so elect. In higher education, employee positions typically ar e either exempt or general services; some categories of exempt employees as well asgeneral service employees may collectively bargain if theyso elect. For example, higher education faculty and grad-uate students are exempt employees but may collectivelybargain. For employees who collectively bargain, salary and wage increases are determined as provided in theexisting contract. Summary: During the 2011-13 biennium, base salaries are reduced 3 percent for all state employees except for elected officials whose sala ries are established by the Commission on Salaries for Elected Officials; employeesat state institutions of higher education; certificated em-ployees of the state School for the Blind and the Center forChildhood Deafness and Hearing Loss; commissioned of-ficers of the repr esented of theDepartment of Transportation; and whosemonthly full-time equivalent salary is less than $2,500 permonth. Employees subject to the salary reduction accrue additional Temporary Salary Re duction leave at the rate of 5.2 hours per month. Amounts paid during the 2011-13fiscal biennium to state employees who cash-out annual orsick leave at the time of retirement or sick leave in excessof 60 days at any time are not reduced by temporarycompensation reductions. Agencies that are prevented by the terms of a collec- tive bargaining contract from implementing the 3 percentsalary reduction are required to achieve a 3 percent reduc-tion in compensation expenditures through employeeleave without pay, reduced work hours, temporary layoffs,or other actions consistent with the terms of the collectivebargaining agreement. State institutions of higher education are required to reduce compensation to meet savings targets provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. During the 2011-13 fiscal biennium, no performance- based awards or incentives may be granted to state em-ployees. Agencies are prohibited from granting a salaryincrease for exempt or WMS employees during the 2011-13 fiscal biennium, except in cases where a demonstratedrecruitment and retention issu e exists; and, in the case of executive branch agencies, the Director of the Office of Fi-nancial Management has approved the increase. Agenciesthat do give salary increases to exempt or WMS employ-ees are required to submit re ports by July 31, 2012, and July 31, 2013, describing the increases given and thereasons for granting them.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 ESSB 5891 C 40 L 11 E 1 Addressing criminal justice cost savings. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senator Murray).Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Offender Release and Supervision . In- mates may shorten their sentence time, if they display good behavior, through a program called earned early re-lease. Depending on the crim e committed, date of convic- tion, and the offenders' risk classification, offenders mayget from 10-33 percent time off their sentence. Offenders who are convicted of a sex offense, a vio- lent offense, a crime against persons, or a drug crime areeligible to be released to community custody in lieu ofSenate 48 1House 97 0 Senate 36 10House 72 24ESSB 5891 345earned early release. The Department of Corrections (DOC) may deny transfer of the offender to communitycustody if the offender does not have an approved releaseplan. In the release plan, the offender must propose a res-idence location and living a rrangements. If DOC finds that the proposed plan may violate the offender's condi-tions of sentence, place the offender at risk to reoffend, orcompromise community safety , DOC will not approve the offender's release plan. In this case, the offender will re- main incarcerated until a viable release plan is found or the offender reaches the end of his or her sentence. DOC mayprovide rental vouchers to an offender for a period up tothree months, if rental assistance will enable the offenderto have an approved release plan. DOC is currently required to supervise felony offend- ers sentenced to community custody who are classified ata high risk to reoffend; all sex offenders; all dangerouslymentally ill offenders; all of fenders with an indeterminate sentence; all offenders sentenc ed to Drug Offender Sen- tencing Alternative, Special Sex Offender Sentencing Al- ternative, and first time offender waiver (FTOW); and alloffenders required to be su pervised under the Interstate Compact. DOC must also supervise misdemeanant of-fenders who have been sentenced to probation by a supe-rior court and who have been convicted of a sex offense,including a failure to register; and those convicted offourth degree assault or violation of a domestic violencecourt order and who have a prior conviction. Approximately 60 percent of the offenders supervised by DOC are sentenced to confinement of one year or lessand therefore do not serve time in prison. Cost of Supervision . Assessments for Supervision of Felony Offenders. DOC may impose a monthly supervi- sion assessment on a felony offender under supervision, which is considered paymen t toward providing supervi- sion. The assessment is $15 per month for routine paroleand up to $50 per month for intensive parole supervision. The assessment is imposed for the duration of supervisionand is deposited in the Cost of Supervision Fund. Expen-ditures from the Cost of Supe rvision Fund are made for supporting the collection of legal financial obligations. DOC may exempt an offender from payment of all or part of the assessment if the offender has diligently at-tempted but has been unable to obtain employment; the of- fender is a student; the offender has an employmenthandicap; the offender's age prevents employment; the as- sessment would create an undue hardship because the of-fender is responsible for supporting dependents; or otherextenuating circumstances exist. Assessments for Supervisio n of Misdemeanant Proba- tioners. When an offender convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor is placed on probation and supervised by either DOC or a county probation department, DOC orthe probation department may collect a monthly assess-ment up to $100 per month from the offender. Theassessment is imposed for th e duration of probation. Application for Interstate Transfer. DOC processes applications for transfer of offenders under the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and may chargeoffenders a reasonable fee for processing the application. First Time Offender Waiver (FTOW) . An offender is eligible to receive a sentenc ing alternative of a FTOW if the person: has never been convicted of a felony or participated in a program of deferred prosecution for a felony; and is not currently convicted of: 1. a violent offense or sex offense; 2. manufacturing, delivery, or sale of certain controlled substances; or 3. felony driving under the influence.In sentencing a first-time offender, the court may waive imposition of the stan dard sentence and impose a sentence of up to 90 days confinement and community custody of up to one year, or up to 24 months if treatment is also ordered. In 2010 the court sentenced 1469 offenders to an FTOW. Approximately 41 percent of the offenders re- ceived a sentence of confinem ent within the standard sen- tence range. Three hundred fi fty-five were sentenced to a 12-month term of community custody and 1021 were sen-tenced to a 24-month term of community custody. DOC currently supervises 2550 first-time offenders. Indeterminate Sentence Review Board (ISRB) . Prior to 1984 sentences imposed for adult felonies in Washing- ton were indeterminate. Co urts had wide discretion over whether or not to impose a prison sentence and the length of any sentence. The Board of Prison Terms and Paroles then decided when or whether to release an offender with-in the statutory maximum sentence period. Indeterminatesentencing is still in effect fo r a small number of prison in- mates who committed crimes be fore July 1, 1984. The Board of Prison Terms and Paroles was re-designated asISRB which has continuing responsibility to set the release dates for those offenders. In addition to pre-1984 offenders, ISRB also deter- mines whether to release sex offenders who committed their crimes after September 1, 2001, and who were sen-tenced to a determinate plus sentence including a mini- mum and maximum term of incarceration. ISRB exists asan independent entity in current law, consisting of a chairand four other members, each of whom is appointed by the Governor. Sentencing Guidelines Commission (SGC) and the Sex Offender Policy Board . The Legislature established SGC in 1981 and directed it to recommend a determinate sentencing system for adult felonies. The principal goal ofthe new sentencing guidelines system was to ensure that offenders who commit similar crimes and have similarcriminal histories receive equivalent sentences. Sentenceswere to be determined by the seriousness of the offense and by the criminal record of the offender. SGC complet- ed the original adult felony sentencing grid in 1982, whichESB 5907 346was subsequently enacted into law and applied to crimes committed after July 1, 1984. In 1996 the Legislature di- rected SGC to assume the functions of the Juvenile Dispo- sition Standards Commission , serving similar functions with regard to juvenile sentencing. SGC is organized as a separate entity with member- ship appointed by the Governor. The continuing duties ofSGC include evaluating and mo nitoring adult and juvenile sentencing policies and practi ces and recommending mod- ifications to the Governor and the Legislature and serving as a clearinghouse and information center on adult andjuvenile sentencing. In 2008 the Legislature created the Sex Offender Pol- icy Board (SOPB) to promote a coordinated and integratedresponse to sex offender management. SOPB is organizedas an independent entity, staf fed and maintained by SGC. SOPB responds to requests from legislators and conductscase reviews of sex offense inci dents that occur within the state. Summary: Offender Supervision . DOC supervision is eliminated for offenders convicted of a first-time felony failure to register who are assessed at a low or moderate risk to reoffend and misdemeanant offenders convicted af- ter August 1, 2011 of fourth degree assault or violation ofa domestic violence court order who also have a prior con-viction. DOC must supervise offenders convicted afterAugust 1, 2011 of two or more domestic violenceconvictions where domestic vi olence is plead and proven. In sentencing a first-time offender, the court may im- pose up to six months of community custody or up to 12months of community custody if treatment is also ordered. Tolling for offenders on community supervision is eliminated; the length of s upervision will run continuously regardless of whether an offend er is incarcerated. Tolling continues for sex offend ers subject to community supervision. Cost of Supervision . Intake Fee for Supervision of Of- fenders . Both felony and misdemeanor offenders under DOC supervision must pay a su pervision intake fee, which is considered payment toward the cost of establishing su-pervision. The fee is imposed after the offender is deter- mined to be eligible for supervision. For an offenderwhose crime was committed on or after October 1, 2011, the fee is $400-$600 and is a ssessed for each judgment and sentence imposed for which su pervision is required. For an offender whose crime w as committed before October 1, 2011, the monthly supervision assessment is converted toa one-time fee. The fee is based on the monthly rate andthe number of months of supervision left, but may notexceed $600. Application for Interstate Transfer . DOC may charge a reasonable fee set by rule fo r processing an offender's ap- plication for out-of-state tran sfer of supervision under the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision. The fee is deposited in the Cost of Supervision Fund. ISRB . ISRB is created within DOC. DOC must pro- vide administrative and staffing support to ISRB. DOCmay employ a senior administrative officer and other per-sonnel as necessary to assist ISRB in carrying out its du-ties. The property and employees of ISRB are transferredto DOC. Sentencing Guidelines Co mmission and Related Du- ties. SGC is created as an advi sory agency, located within the Office of Financial Management. The Caseload Fore-cast Council (CFC) will serve as the clearinghouse and in-formation center for adult an d juvenile sentencing and must annually produce a statistical summary of adult felo-ny sentencing and juvenile dispositions. The CFC must also publish and maintain the adult felony sentencing manual. CFC is not liable for errors or omissions in the manual or for sentences that may be inappropriately calcu-lated as a result of a practitione r's or court's reliance on the manual. DOC assumes full responsibility for administering the interstate compact for adult offender supervision in the state. SGC must establish and maintain the SOPB. TheSOPB serves in an advisory capacity and may be con-vened at the request of the Governor or legislativecommittee of jurisdiction. Miscellaneous . By January 1, 2012, DOC must im- plement the provisions of this act, including recalculatingcommunity custody terms and release dates for offendersin accordance with the provision s of this act. This act ap- plies to persons convicted before, on, or after the effectivedate.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 15, 2011 (Sections 1-9 and 42) July 1, 2011 (Section 43) August 24, 2011 ESB 5907 C 252 L 11 Implementing the policy reco mmendations resulting from the national institute of correctio ns review of prison safety.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 22, 2011SSB 5912 C 41 L 11 E 1 Expanding family planning services to two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Keiser, Pflug, Kohl-Welles and Kline).Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Through the Take Charge program, the De- partment of Social and Health Services (DSHS) provides family planning services to state residents with family in-comes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Ser-vices include an annual gynecological exam and papsmear; birth control pills and devices; emergency contra-ception; and sterilization. Pr egnancy termination is not a covered service. Approximately 60,000 people per month are enrolled in the program, at an annual cost of $21 million. Approx- imately 80 percent of the cost of the program is covered byfederal funds, with the balance coming from the state Gen-eral Fund. Services are delivered by a variety of local con-tractors, including county he alth departments, community clinics, and planned parenthood organizations. Through Medicaid, the state provides medical cover- age for pregnant women with incomes up to 250 percentof the federal poverty level, depending upon family size.Additionally, through the State Children's Health Insur-ance Program, the state provides medical coverage forchildren in families with in comes up to 300 percent of poverty. It has been suggest ed that, by expanding eligibil- ity for family planning servic es, the state could avoid the cost of some of the unplanned pregnancies and births forwhich it would otherwise pay. Summary: The DSHS is to submit an application to the federal Department of Hea lth and Human Services by September 30, 2011, to expand eligibility for family plan- ning services to 250 percent of the federal poverty level.Upon implementation of the expansion, the Office of Fi-nancial Management is to re duce General Fund-State al- lotments for the medical assistance program by $4.5million.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011Senate 49 0 House 97 0 Senate 30 17House 52 36ESSB 5919 349ESSB 5919 PARTIAL VETO C 27 L 11 E 1 Regarding education funding. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Murray and Zarelli). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Basic Education and K-12 Funding Formu- las. In the 2009-11 biennium, two pieces of legislation were enacted to redefine basic education and restructure the K-12 funding formulas. The first was Engrossed Sub- stitute House Bill 2261, Chapte r 548, Laws of 2009, which expands the definition of basi c education by adding the programs for highly capable students and student transpor-tation to and from school. A new transportation funding formula was adopted to predic t pupil transportation costs based on regression analysis . Additionally, the all-day kindergarten programs that had been phased in since 2007are to become part of basic education with the continued phase in of the highest povert y schools first. Increases in the number of instructional hours and the minimum num-ber of credits for high school graduation are to be phasedin on a schedule set by the Legislature. The framework fora new K-12 funding allocation formula based on prototyp-ical schools was created. These changes are to take effectSeptember 1, 2011. The second bill, Substitute House Bill 2776, Chapter 236, Laws of 2010, enacted new prototypical school allo-cation formulas at funding levels which represent the 2009-10 school year state sp ending on basic education. The bill also established a tim eline, effective September 1, 2011, for phasing in enhancements to the program of basiceducation and certain fundin g levels as follows: During the 2011-13 biennium, enhanced funding for transportation must begin to be phased in to be completed by the 2013-15 biennium; beginning with the scho ols with the highest poverty students, the K-3 class size must be reduced to 17 students per teacher by 2017; the minimum allocation for maintenance, supplies, and operating costs (MSOC) must be increased asspecified in the Omnibus Appropriations Act untilspecific amounts are provid ed in the 2015-16 school year; and funding for all-day kindergarten must continue to be phased in each year until full statewide implementation is achieved in the 2017-18 school year.Career and Technical (CTE) Student Organizations . SPI must provide staff suppor t for statewide coordination of CTE student organizations, including but not limited to the National FFA Organization; Family Career, and Com-munity Leaders of America; SkillsUSA; DistributiveEducation Clubs of America; Future Business Leaders of America; and the Technology Student Organization. Special Services Pilot Program . In 2003 the Legisla- ture authorized and funded two school districts to pilotprograms of early and intensive intervention services inreading and language with the intent to reduce the number of children who may eventua lly require special education services. The pilot program was originally to expire June30, 2007. In 2007 the Legislature reauthorized, expanded,and funded the pilot program for seven school districts. The expanded pilot program is to expire June 30, 2011. Summary: Basic Education and K-12 Funding Formulas . It is clarified that the number of instructional hours and the minimum number of credits for high school graduation will be increased no sooner th an the 2014-15 school year. The pupil transportation funding formula, scheduled to go into effect September 1, 2011, is adjusted as follows: The new formula includes statistically significant factors only. The indirect-cost rate added to the final prior year expenditures is specified as the federal restricted indirect rate. The growth in salaries and benefits in the allowable prior year expenditures will not exceed the growth provided in the budget. During the transition to full implementation, the funding will include budgeted increases provided inthe Omnibus Appropriations Act for salaries or fringe benefits. Clarifies that, during th e transition to full implemen- tation, in-lieu bus deprecia tion payments to contract- ing districts are not included in the reported prior yearexpenditures. The transitional bilingual education funding formula is amended to provide that, notwithstanding the require- ment that funding allocation provide a statewide averageadditional number of hours per week of instruction, the ac- tual per-student allocation may be scaled for a larger allo- cation for students needing more intensive intervention and a commensurate reduced allocation for those needing less intensive intervention. (CTE) Student Organizations and Special Services Pi- lot. The SPI is responsible for staffing the CTE student or- ganizations only to the extent that funds are available. The special services pilot program expires March 1, 2011,instead of June 30, 2011.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 7, 2011 August 24, 2011 (Section 7) September 1, 2011 (Sections 1-3)Senate 34 11House 57 39ESSB 5921 350Partial Veto Summary: Because the section was very similar to a provision in En grossed Substitute House Bill 1410, Chapter 22, Laws of 2011, the Governor vetoed the section that would have required students in the graduat-ing class of 2015, rather than 2013, to meet the state stan- dard on the high school assessment in order to earn acertificate of academic achievement or certificate ofindividual achievement.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Regala and Carrell). Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Ways & Means Background: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) . TANF is a federal block grant established under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Recon- ciliation Act of 1996. TANF program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Ch ildren program, which had provided grants to poor fam ilies with children since the 1930s. States use TANF block grants to operate their own programs. State programs differ, but operate in accor-dance with the following purpo ses set forth in federal law: to provide assistance to needy families so that chil- dren may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, andmarriage; prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals forpreventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.The basic TANF block grant has been set at $16.6 bil- lion since it was established in 1996. States are required to spend their own funds on programs for needy families or face financial penalties; this is referred to as themaintenance of effort (or MOE) requirement. WorkFirst . Washington's WorkFirst program was cre- ated by the state Legislature in 1997 following the passageof the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Act of1996 and is administered by the Department of Social andHealth Services (DSHS). Parents with children who re-ceive TANF are required to participate in activities de- signed to lead to employme nt in return for the cash assistance they receive. Fo llowing an initial assessment, each recipient signs an Indi vidual Responsibility Plan which outlines the activities the recipient is required to at-tend if the recipient has adeq uate child care and transpor- tation. The activities genera lly fall into categories of barrier removal (chemical depe ndency treatment, English as a Second Language, etc.), job search, education andtraining, and community jobs. In addition to WorkFirst clients, TANF grants are also provided to qualified non-re lative and relative caregivers who are providing personal care to children not residingwith their parents. When participants fail to me et WorkFirst participation requirements, they face sanctio ns or reduced grants. Par- ticipants who are out of compliance with requirements forfour months are terminated, but may reapply. WorkFirst Redesign . The WorkFirst Subcabinet (Sub- cabinet) chartered a re-examination of the WorkFirst pro-gram between July and November of 2010, and releasedits report to the Legislature on February 3, 2011. The Sub-cabinet found that WorkFirst, as currently designed, is notfinancially sustainable within available funding. The re- port includes a comprehensive set of time-series recom-mendations to redesign the pr ogram so it can be sustained for needy families in the fu ture. Some recommendations include: continue to provide a full TANF grant for families with income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and a reduced grant for those with higher incomes; revise rules regarding the amount of earned income that can be disregarded when determiningparticipants' eligibility to receive TANF assistance; ESSB 5921 351 implement reasonable eligibility requirements and follow-up checks for child-only cases, for cases in which the child was not placed by the Children's Administration on a dependency order; and enhance participant accountability. Cash Assistance . TANF benefits are provided to re- cipients through an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card. The benefit amount is electronically added to thecard each month. The EBT card can be used at ATMs andalso at stores through a poin t of sale machine, similar to how debit cards are used. A TANF recipient is prohibited from using an EBT card or cash obtained with an EBT card to participate in a gambling activity, a parimutuel wagering activity, or topurchase lottery tickets. DSHS must notify EBT card- holders that using an EBT card or cash obtained with anEBT card for any of the proh ibited activities could result in legal proceedings and the fo rfeiture of all cash benefits. Fraud . The Division of Fraud Investigations (DFI) within DSHS is responsible for investigating allegationsof fraud by applicants and recipients of public assistanceprograms and for investigating allegations of fraud by vendors with whom DSHS has a contract to provide ser- vices to DSHS clients. DF I partners with the Economic Services Administration Community Services Division toinvestigate current eligibility for TANF, Disability Life-line, Basic Food, Medical, and Working ConnectionsChild Care benefits. Accord ing to DSHS material, during the 2009 fiscal year, the cost-avoidance associated withthe Fraud Early Detection program was $24.2 million.During the same period the DFI Overpayment Unit recov-ered overpayments totaling $1.8 million and the Criminal Investigations Program referred 98 cases to state andfederal prosecutors. Summary: WorkFirst Program . During fiscal year 2012, the requirement that WorkFi rst activity requirements be fulfilled by TANF recipients is suspended for one and two parent families or relatives pe rsonally providing care for one child under the age of two years, or two or more chil- dren under the age of six years. Both parents in a two par-ent family cannot use the suspension during the same month. Beginning on July 1, 2012, DSHS is to begin phas-ing in recipients required to participate in WorkFirst backinto work activity st arting with those recipients closest to reaching the 60-month tim e limit for receiving TANF. DSHS is to accomplish the phase-in in such a way that afairly equal number of required participants are returned to work activities each month un til all those required to par- ticipate in work activities is reached by June 30, 2013. Arecipient affected by the suspension may nevertheless vol-unteer to participate in the WorkFirst program during thesuspension. Recipients who participate in the WorkFirstprogram on a voluntary basis must be provided an optionto participate in the program on a part-time basis,consisting of 16 or fewer hours of activities per week.The Legislative-Executive WorkFirst Oversight Task Force is established. The Pres ident of the Senate appoints two members from each of the two largest caucuses in theSenate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives ap-points two members from each of the two largest caucusesin the House. The Govern or must appoint members representing the following state agencies: DSHS; Department of Early Learning (DEL); Department of Commerce; The Employment Security Department; The Office of Financial Management; and The State Board for Community and Technical Colleges. The task force is to choo se co-chairs, one from among the legislative members and one from among the execu- tive branch members. The legislative members are toconvene the first meeting. The task force is to oversee the partner agencies' im- plementation of the redesign of the WorkFirst program and operation of the TANF program to ensure the programs are achieving the desired outcomes for their clients; determine evidence-based outcome meas ures for the WorkFirst pro- gram, including measures relate d to equitably serving the needs of historically underrepresented populations; devel- op accountability measures for WorkFirst recipients and the state agencies responsibl e for their progress towards self-sufficiency; and make recommendations to the Gov- ernor and Legislature regarding the following: policies toimprove the effectiveness of the WorkFirst program over time; early identification of th ose recipients most likely to experience long stays on the program; and strategies to im-prove their ability to achieve progress toward self-suffi- ciency and necessary changes to the program includingtaking into account federal changes to the TANF program. The partner agencies must provide the task force with regular reports on their prog ress toward meeting the out- come and performance measures established by the taskforce, caseload trends and program expenditures on client services, and the characteristics of families who have beenunsuccessful on the program and have lost their benefitseither through sanction or the 60-month time limit. The task force is to meet on a quarterly basis begin- ning in September 2011 or as determined necessary by thetask force co-chairs. During its tenure, state agency task force members must respond in a timely fashion to data requests from the co-chairs. TANF . DSHS must institute income eligibility rules, effective November 1, 2011, for those persons receiving TANF benefits for a child, other than a foster child, forwhom the person is the caregiver. DSHS is to establish asliding scale benefit standard for a child when the caregiv-er's income is above 200 percent but below 300 percent ofthe federal poverty level based on family size. ESSB 5921 352DSHS must adopt regulatio ns to apply the 60-month time limit to households in wh ich a parent is in the home and ineligible for TANF. Any regulations must be consis- tent with federal funding re quirements. Exemptions that apply to an adult receiving benefits on his or her behalfmust also apply to parents receiving benefits on his or herchild's behalf. Unless otherwise exempt, no TANF recipient can receive benefits for mo re than 60 months. DSHS may implement a pe rmanent disqualification for adults who have been te rminated from the program be- cause of WorkFirst noncompliance sanction three or moretimes since March 1, 2007. A household that includes apermanently disqualified adult is ineligible for furtherTANF assistance. Working Connections Child Care (WCCC) . As a con- dition of receiving WCCC, the applicant must seek child support enforcement services from DSHS, unless there isgood cause not to. The pa yment for WCCC constitutes an authorization for DSHS to provide the WCCC recipientwith child support services. DS HS is authorized to collect but not retain child support payments. A WCCC recipient is eligib le to receive the subsidy for up to six months before having to recertify his or herincome eligibility. The six- month recertification period applies only if the WCCC program entries are capped. DSHS and DEL, in consulta tion with interested indi- viduals and organizations, must jointly identify differentoptions to track subsidized ch ild care attendance including methods using a landline or cellular telephone, a comput-er, a point of sale system, or some combination of thesemethods and report their reco mmendations to the Legisla- ture by December 31, 2011. Each department's recom-mendations must address any implementation issues and aproposed implementation tim e line and should assume a January 2013 implementati on date for the attendance tracking system. The Legislature must review the recom-mendations and authorize im plementation of those recom- mendations. The me thod that is chosen must interface smoothly with the current and future payment systems for subsidized child care payments. DSHS and DEL must also assess the current subsi- dized child care eligibility de termination system and de- velop recommendations to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and resp onsiveness of the system. The results of the assessment are to be re ported to the Legislature no later than December 31, 2011. Electronic Benefit Cards and Financial Management . DSHS, in consultation with its electronic benefits cardcontractor and interested persons and organizations, mustdevelop strategies to increas e opportunities for public as- sistance recipients to mainta in bank accounts with a goal of increasing recipient fina ncial literacy and financial management skills and minimizing recipient costs associ-ated with ATM transaction fees. A report andrecommendations are to be su bmitted to the relevant poli- cy and fiscal legislative comm ittees by December 1, 2011. DSHS, in contracting with electronic benefit card pro- viders, must require that any surcharge or transaction fee charged by the provider be di sclosed to EBT clients at the point at which the surcharge or transaction fee occurs. Fraud . A TANF recipient is prohibited from using an EBT card or cash obtained with an EBT card for thefollowing: to participate in or purc hase activities located in a tattoo, body piercing, or body art shop; to purchase any alcoholic beverage; to purchase cigarettes or tobacco products; or to purchase or particip ate in any activity in certain locations. On or before January 1, 2012, the businesses listed be- low must disable the ability of the ATMs and point-of-sale machines located on their business premises to accept EBT cards: taverns; beer/wine specialty stores; nightclubs; contract liquor stores, but only for the point-of-sale machines used for liquor purchases; bail bond agencies; gambling establishments; tattoo, body piercing, or body art shops; adult entertainment venues with performances that contain erotic material where minors under the age of18 are prohibited; and any establishments where persons under the age of 18 are not permitted. Only the recipient or the re cipient's authorized repre- sentative may use an EBT card or EBT card benefits and the use may only be for th e respective benefit purposes. The recipient may not sell, or attempt to sell, exchange, or donate an EBT card or any benefits to any other person orentity. The first violation on the use of an EBT card is a class 4 civil infraction under RCW 7.80.120. Second and sub-sequent violations constitute a class 3 civil infraction.Any of the listed business esta blishments that do not com- ply with the requirement to disable ATM and point-of-salemachines on their business premises from accepting EBT cards will have its business license suspended until itcomplies with the requirements. The Office of Fraud and Accountability (OFA) is es- tablished in DSHS to detect , investigate, and prosecute any act that constitutes fraud or abuse in the public assis- tance programs administered by DSHS except for Medic-aid and other medical programs. The OFA Director is toreport directly to the DSHS Secretary and is to ensure thateach citizen or employee co mplaint, law enforcement complaint, and agency referral is assessed and fully353investigated and referred for prosecution when there is substantial evidence of wrongdoing. OFA is to conduct independen t investigations into al- legations of fraud and abuse, recommend policies, proce-dures, and best practices desi gned to detect and prevent fraud and abuse, analyze cost effective, best practice alter-natives to the current cash be nefit delivery system, and use best practices to determine the appropriate use anddeployment of investigative resources.

DSHS is to establish an employee incentive program pilot for those employees who work directly with WorkFi rst participants. The pilot is to provide for eight hours of annual leave, in addition to the amount the employee normally accrues, for those em-ployees who assist participan ts in meeting certain out- comes as established by DSHS. The outcomes established must be significant for the participant and can includeachieving unsubsidized employment or the removal of asignificant barrier to achieving unsubsidized employment.DSHS is to report to the Legislature by January 1, 2013,on the implementation results of the pilot. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011 September 1, 2011 (Section 6) Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section requiring DSHS to engage in competitive performance- based contracting for all WorkFirst activities and the sec- tion establishing the fraud ombudsman in the State Auditor's Office.VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 5921 June 15, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 3 and 26, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5921 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to social services.\" This omnibus bill addresses redesign and policy changes to Washington's WorkFirst program, including provisions related to eligibility, accountabili ty, fraud detection and enforcement. Dur- ing the current economic downturn the state has experienced in- creased utilization of safety ne t programs. Now is the time to redouble our focus on service delivery that meets the intended out-comes and ensures fiscal accountabi lity for the use of limited public funds. Section 3 of the bill requir es the Department of Social and Health Services to engage in co mpetitive performance-based con- tracting for all WorkFirst activi ties. I strongly support government efficiency and improved performanc e in providing critical services to Washington residents. However, Se ction 3 of the bill is not need- ed and could create confusion about the applicable law that would govern such contracting. The Legislature enacted a law in 1997,codified as RCW 74.08A.290, t hat authorized the Department of Social and Health Services to e ngage in competitive contracting using performance-based contracts to provide all work activities. The Department of Social and Health Services would be expressly mandated to exercise its aut hority granted in 1997 under RCW 74.08A.290 by Second Engrossed Subs titute House Bill 1087, a bill among those I sign today. I w ill direct the Department of So- cial and Health Services and th e WorkFirst Subcabinet to act on the Legislature's direction in Second Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1087 to competitive ly contract all work activities under the 1997 law. Section 26 of the bill establ ishes a Fraud Ombudsman in the State Auditor's Office to audit an d provide oversight of the Office of Fraud and Accountability at the Department of Social and Health Services. Transparency of public fund s is critic ally impor- tant. I remain committed to ensuring appropriate use of publicfunds when providing critical services for the State's most vulnerable residents. However, Section 26 is duplicativ e of the State Auditor's Office existing authority to audit the work of the Office of Fraud and Ac-countability. The Department of Social and Health Services will provide the State Auditor's Office wi th access to any relevant re- cords in its possession to the fullest extent practicable upon therequest of the State Auditor's Office. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 3 and 26 of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5921. With the exception of Sections 3 and 26, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5921 is approved.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Keiser and Pflug; by request of HealthCare Authority and Department of Social and HealthServices). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state contracts w ith health insurance systems to deliver medical care services under the state Medicaid, Disability Lifeline, and Basic Health Plan pro- grams. These systems contract with individual health carepractitioners, group practices, clinics, hospitals, pharma- cies, and other entities to part icipate in their network of providers. Persons enrolled in the managed care plan musttypically obtain their medical care services from providers who participate in their plan's network in order for theservice to be covered. When they receive services at an in-network facility, managed care enrollees sometimes receive services fromhealth care providers who have not contracted to partici- pate in their managed care plan's network. For example,an enrollee may have surgery at a hospital that has con-tracted to participate in thei r managed care plans' network but receive anesthesia from a practitioner who has not. Disputes have arisen about how much the managed care plan should pay the health care practitioner in such in- stances. A Snohomish County Superior Court judge hasruled that in such instances the managed care organiza-tions should pay the non-cont racted practitioner the full amount billed by the practitione r. Managed care organiza- tions, the Department of Social and Health Services, andthe Health Care Authority have expressed concern this will increase the cost of serv ices delivered under state- purchased plans. Summary: A nonparticipating provider is defined as a health care practitioner or fa cility that does not have a written contract to participate in a managed health care system's provider network. When a nonparticipating pro- vider delivers services to an enrollee covered by a state-contracted managed care plan, the plan must pay the non-participating provider no mo re than the lowest amount paid for that service under the managed health care sys-tem's contracts with similar providers in the state. Thenonparticipating provider mu st accept the payment as pay- ment in full and may not bala nce bill the patient except for any deductible, copayment, or coinsurance. State-contracted managed care plans must maintain a network of contracted providers sufficient to provide ac-cess to all services covered by the contract, including hos-pital-based physician servic es. The department mustmonitor and must report to the Legislature by January 1 ofeach year on the proportion of services provided by con-tracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by coun-ty, for each state-contracted managed care system toensure that the systems ar e meeting network adequacy requirements. Except for the definition of a nonparticipating provider, the provisions of the act expire July 1, 2016. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 24, 2011 ESSB 5931 PARTIAL VETO C 43 L 11 E 1 Reorganizing and streamlinin g central service functions, powers, and duties of state government. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Baumgartner and Zarelli).Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington State has several central ser- vice agencies that primarily pr ovide services to other state agencies and occasionally local governments and nonprofits. Department of General Administration (GA) . GA provides support services to state agencies, and other enti-ties such as schools, local governments, higher educationinstitutions, and nonprofits. Services provided by GA in-clude purchasing and contra cting for goods and services, lease management, facility an d grounds maintenance, con- struction project management, state motor pool, operationof the consolidated mail services, adoption of statebuilding code, and oversight of bidding procedures. Office of Public Printer (Printer) . The Printer was es- tablished in 1854 and provides printing and binding for awide range of agency documents. The Printer may sub-contract printing to a private vendor under some circum-stances. In those cases, the Printer may apply a 5 percentmarkup. Current law requires the Printer to charge the ac-tual cost for print jobs but those costs may not exceed the prices listed in the Fr anklin Pricing Guide. Department of Personnel (DOP) . DOP manages the state's civil services system since creation by initiative in 1960. Civil service law applies to all state agencies, insti-tutions of higher education, boards and commissions and each employee, unless express ly excluded or exempted by law. DOP duties include oversight and administration ofthe civil service system and administration and operationof the central personnel payroll system. The Director ofSenate 34 9 House 94 2 (House amended)Senate 34 11 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5931 355DOP is responsible for adopting rules regarding disciplin- ary and other employee action, transfers, training and ca- reer development, sick leave and vacations, layoffs andreemployment, salary schedu les and performance evalua- tions. The Public Employment Relations Commissionmanages collective bargaining provisions, including the determination of appropriate bargaining units within any agency. Office of Financial Management (OFM) . OFM was established in 1969 as a division of the Office of the Gov-ernor. The general duties of OFM including planning andcoordination in the prepara tion of budgets, accounting functions, research related to the state and federal census,preparation of fiscal notes, oversight of the state's riskmanagement, and management of personal servicecontracts. Department of Information Services (DIS) . DIS pro- vides technology-based services to state agencies and lo- cal governments. The Director of DIS is responsible formanaging the functions of DIS, as well as serving as thestate's Chief Information Offi cer (CIO). DIS provides a variety of services includ ing telecommunications and computing services, procurement of technology equip-ment through master contracts, and information technolo-gy (IT) support. DIS must char ge a fee sufficient to fully recover all costs associated with providing its services.State agencies may procure information technologyservices through DIS, but are not required to do so. The Information Services Board (ISB) is staffed by DIS and provides authorizatio n and oversight for manag- ing large IT projects. ISB is tasked with developing stateIT standards, governing acq uisitions, reviewing and ap- proving statewide IT strategic plans, and developing state-wide technical polices. The members of ISB include stateagencies and members of the Legislature. Civil Service and Collective Bargaining . The state civil service law establishes the state's personnel adminis-tration system. Civil service rules apply to non-represent-ed classified employees. These rules may be supersededby collective bargaining agreements for represented em-ployees. State collective bargaining law provides for bar-gaining by the Governor and representatives of classifiedemployee bargaining units. Collective bargaining agree-ments must be submitted to OF M by October 1, and to the Legislature as part of the Governor's budget proposal. TheLegislature must accept or reject the request for fundsnecessary to implement the agreements as a whole. Summary: Many of the central service agencies are sig- nificantly reorganized and two new state agencies are cre- ated, the Department of Enterp rise Services (DES) and the Consolidated Techno logy Services (CTS). Part 1 - Creation of DES . DES is tasked with provid- ing products and services to support state agencies, othergovernmental entities, and no nprofits. DES is an execu- tive branch agency and the director is appointed by theGovernor and subject to co nfirmation by the Senate.DES assumes the following responsibilities: all roles and responsibilities of GA and the Printer; risk management and oversight of personal service contracts from OFM; training and career development, oversight of the payroll system, and many other basic functions of DOP; and purchase of wireless devices and digital signature authority from DIS. Additionally, OFM must examine on a biennial basis which services within DES might be performed by the pri- vate sector. Until June 30, 2018, OFM will select up to sixactivities each biennium for DES to competitively bid tothe private sector. If a service cannot be provided at a low-er rate or more efficiently, OFM will notify DES to cancelthe bid. If the bid is canceled, OFM must notify the legis-lative fiscal committees. OF M must report on the results of these examinations biennia lly and the legislative fiscal committees must hold a public hearing on the reports. TheJoint Legislative and Audit Review Committee (JLARC)will conduct a study of the im plementation of contracting for services at DES and report to the Legislature by Janu-ary 1, 2018. DES must also examine state procurementpractices and report on recommendations forimprovement by December 31, 2011. Part 2 - Powers and Duties Transfer from GA to DES . GA is eliminated as a state agency and all of its powers andduties are assigned to DES. Provisions regarding bid pro-cesses are revised to require that all purchases require for-mal sealed bids and exceptions to formal bid direct buypurchases are added. The DES director is required toestablish policies annually to define bid criteria and limits. Part 3 - Powers and Duties Transfer from the Public Printer . The State Printer's powers and duties are trans- ferred to the DES. State agencies are no longer required touse the State Printer. If a print job is solicited, then DESmust be included. Bids must encourage the use of recy-cled paper and biodegradable ink. Printing that contains sensitive or personally identi fiable information must be done by DES or, if contracted, a confidentiality agreementmust be included in the printing contract. DES must pro-vide printing services on a cost recovery basis. State agen-cies are required to consul t with DES regarding economic and efficient options for printing jobs. DES will issueguidelines for agencies to ma nage their print operations. DES will prepare recommendatio ns regarding agency spe- cific print shops. DES will broker print management con-tracts for state agencies. All agencies with 1,000 FTEs ormore will utilize print manageme nt services. These print management contracts must result in savings. OFM mayauthorize an exemption from th is requirement. All agen- cies with 500 FTEs or more must consult with DES tostandardize the use of envelopes. Part 4 - Powers and Duties Transferred from GA to DES . DOP is eliminated and its powers and duties dividedESSB 5931 356between OFM and DES. DES will receive the majority of DOP's responsibilities includin g training, and career de- velopment, and oversight of the payroll system. DES isresponsible for job classification activities. Other functions currently performed by DOP are transferred to OFM. These functions include creatingbroad personnel policies, compensation and salary sched-uling, and prescription of training provisions forsupervisory or management positions. Part 5 - Powers and Duties Transferred from OFM to DES . Risk management and personal services contracting oversight activities are transferred from OFM to DES. Part 6 - Powers and Du ties Transferred from DIS . DES is authorized to rece ive funding from the Data Pro- cessing Revolving Account as DIS will no longer exist as a state agency. High-speed Internet programs are movedto the Department of Commerce. Part 7 - Creation of the Offi ce of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) . OCIO is created within OFM. OCIO is responsible for the preparat ion and implementation of a strategic IT plan and enterprise architecture (EA) for the state. OCIO must work to wards standardization and con- solidation of IT infrastructure, establish standards and pol- icies for EA, and educate and inform the state on IT matters. CIO is appointed by the Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. OCIO will prepare a biennial state performance report on IT, evaluate current IT spending and budget requests,and oversee major IT projects including procurements. An 13-member Technology Services Board (TSB) is created. The TSB will consis t of eight members appointed by the Governor and four legislators. Three of the Gover-nor's appointees must be representatives of state agenciesor institutions, and three representatives must be from theprivate sector. Of the state agency representatives, at leastone must have direct experience using the software proj-ects overseen by the TSB or reasonably expect to use thenew software developed under the oversight of the TSB.Two non-voting members with IT expertise must be ap-pointed by the Governor: (1) a representative of a stateagency bargaining unit that will be selected from a list of names submitted by each of the general government ex-clusive bargaining representatives; (2) a representative oflocal governments that will be selected from a list of names submitted by commonly recognized localgovernment organizations. The CIO will be a member of the TSB and serve as chair. The TSB will: review and approve standards and procedures devel- oped by the OCIO governing the acquisition and dis- position of equipment, pr oprietary software and purchased services, licensing of radio spectrum by or on behalf of state agencies, and confidentiality of computerized data; review and approve statewide or interagency techni- cal policies, standards, and procedures developed bythe OCIO; review and approve standards and common specifica- tions for new or expanded telecommunications net- works proposed by agencies, public postsecondary educational institutions, educational service districts,or providers of K-12 information technology services; develop a policy to determine whether a proposed product or service should undergo an independentanalysis prior to being su bmitted for inclusion in any proposed operating, capital, or transportation budget; review, approve and provide oversight of major IT projects to ensure that no major IT project is approved or authorized funding without considerationof the technical and financial business case for the project; provide a forum to solicit external input on IT developments, enterprise architecture, standards,and policy development; and provide a forum where IT plans, policies, and standards can be reviewed. Agencies are required to su bmit IT portfolios and are required to co-locate servers within the state data center. OCIO will assess agencies ability to utilize CTS and develop a strategy for increase agency use of CTS. Part 8 - Creation of CTS . A majority of service provi- sion duties are transferred from DIS to CTS includingserver hosting and network administration, telephony,security administration, and email. Positions within the CTS re lated to systems integra- tion, data center engineering and management, engineering and mana gement, information tech- nology contracting, informat ion technology customer re- lations management, and network and systems securitycan be made exempt. Senior experts in enterprise IT infra-structure, engineering, or systems can also be madeexempt. The CTS may contract for se rvices related to opera- tion and management of the State Data Center, if they areapproved by the TSB. The TSB may approve contracting for other services and activities if those services arerecommended by the CIO through a business plan.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: October 1, 2011 December 31, 2011 (Section 462) January 1, 2012 (Sections 109, 448, and 732)Senate 29 18House 54 42 (House amended)Senate 31 13 (Senate concurred)357Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed a require- ment that the State Auditor conduct a performance audit of the consolidated state data center. Sections related to transferring the Education Research Data Center from OFM to the Legislative Ev aluation and Accountability Program Committee are also vetoed. VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 5931 June 15, 2011 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 815 and 816 and Sections 901 through 909, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5931 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to reorganizi ng and streamlining central service functions, powers, and duties of state government.\" Sections 815 and 816 require the State Auditor to conduct a per- formance audit of the consolidated state data center during the same period that the Department of Information Services and Of- fice of Financial Management will be fully engaged in the trans- formative activities associated w ith implementation of this bill and the consolidated data center business plan. Such activities will in- clude designing and installing the consolidated state data center infrastructure; moving staff to the new office building; structuring the new Department of Enterprise Services, Consolidated Tech- nology Services, and Of fice of the Chief Information Officer; and conducting a statewide information technology total cost of own- ership study. A performance audit during this timeframe will redi- rect key leadership and staff capacity and attention from implementing these complex and resource intensive initiatives to reviewing the rationale for the current strategies underway. Sections 901 through 909 transfer the Education Research Data Center (ERDC) from the Office of Financial Management's Fore-casting Division to the Legislative Evaluation and Accountability Program Committee (LEAP). Th e ERDC and LEAP are collabor- atively involved in building a robust and informative research ca- pability that inform s decision-making for both the executive and legislative branch. Th is transfer would not accomplish the goals that are shared among the legisl ative and executive branches and may actually slow the federally funded initiatives underway. The ERDC will continue to serve our shared commitment to transpar- ency, education data quality, and useful informat ion for decision makers while remaining at the Office of Financial Management. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 815 and 816 and Sec- tions 901 through 909 of Engrosse d Substitute Senate Bill 5931. With the exception of Sect ions 815 and 816 and Sections 901 through 909, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5931 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Christine O.

Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 1, 2011ESSB 5942 C 45 L 11 E 1 Concerning the warehousing and distribution of liquor, in- cluding the lease and modernization of the state's liquorwarehousing and distribution facilities. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senators Hewitt and Zarelli).Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington is one of 18 liquor control states, in which the state has a monopoly over the distribu- tion and sale of specified types of liquor. The Liquor Con-trol Board (Board) determines the localities where state liquor stores are established and the number of stores with-in each locality. The Board mu st also appoint contract li- quor stores in cities, towns, and other communities whereno state liquor store is located. There are approximately165 state liquor stores and 160 contract liquor stores in thestate. The Board operates a liquor distribution center located in Seattle from which they di stribute liquor to the liquor stores. In Washington, spirits may be sold only in state li-quor stores and contract liquor stores. An exception al-lows limited sales of spirits by craft distilleries. The liquorstores are responsible for supp lying spirits to the various types of licensees such as restaurants, taverns, and bars. Summary: Within 120 days, the Office of Financial Man- agement (OFM) must conduct a competitive process for the selection of a private sector entity to lease and modern- ize the state's spirits warehousing and distributionfacilities and related operations. The lease must include a contract for the entire state spirits warehousing and distribution business, includingthe facilities, opera tions, and other assets associated with the warehousing of spirits an d the distribution of spirits. The request for proposals (RFP) must include: A requirement that the proposals demonstrate rele- vant previous experience as well as the financial capacity to perform the obligations. A requirement that the proposals demonstrate a posi- tive financial benefit to th e state, local government, and interested stakeholders over the term of the pro- posed contract compared to projected financial bene- fits to the states from warehousing and distribution. OFM must take into account an initial up front pay- ment, proposed profit sharing payments, liquor taxes,retail profit, and projected business and occupation tax revenues. OFM, in consultation with the Spirits Distribution Advisory Committee, must develop a definition and criteria on how to determ ine \"positive financial benefit to the state.\"Senate 26 17 House 58 29 (House amended)Senate 29 18 (Senate concurred)SB 5956 359 A requirement that the prevailing proponent deposit into an escrow account within 15 days the full amount of the initial up-front payment, subject to suc- cessful negotiation of a mutually acceptable lease or contract. A requirement that proposals include a quantified commitment to invest in capital improvements towarehousing and distribution facilities. A requirement that proposals include a commitment to assume responsibility fo r the costs associated with the operation of spirits wa rehousing and distribution. A requirement that proposals demonstrate to the satis- faction of OFM a commitment to improved distribu-tion to improve margins, ensure regularity of deliveries to retail stores, improve service to stores in remote areas, and expanded sprits selection. A requirement that measurable standards for the performance of the contract be established. A proposal must require a commitment to offer state employees currently in positions affected by the act tobe offered employment and that their bargaining unit is recognized. OFM must publicly disclo se the analysis of the fiscal impacts of each offer. After consultation with the Board and the Spirits Dis- tribution Advisory Council, OFM is authorized to recom- mend to the Board the proposal that best meets the criteria and the best interest of the st ate. If there are no proposals that meet the best interest of the state, OFM must notifythe Board to not accept any of the proposals. Once all the parameters are set for the RFP process that each proposal will be measured against, the fiscalcommittees of the House and Senate will review and havethe opportunity to hear pub lic input on the parameters. The fiscal committees have 14 days to review the RFP andto gather public input. Requires that challenges or protests of the recommen- dation of the OFM must be submitted within five days ofa decision by respondents that submitted a proposal. The grounds for challenge are limite d to claims that the deci- sion was arbitrary and capricious. The OFM has five daysto render a decision. Respondents may appeal decisions to the Superior Court of Thurston County within five days of the decision,and the court has ten days to render its decision. SuperiorCourt decisions on competitive procurement processappeals are final. Within 60 days after the recommendation of a propos- al, the Board may accept that proposal and enter into along-term contract with that en tity for the lease of the busi- ness, facilities, and assets asso ciated with the warehousing and distribution of spirits in the state. The contract must include enforceable performan ce standards and minimum financial returns to the state. The contract must provide aprovision that allows the stat e to terminate should specific performance standards or financial returns not be realized.The contract must provide fo r a reasonable termination notification process as well as financial terms of termina-tion should termination of cont ract take place. The con- tract must contain a provision that any losses by the privateentity must not be compensated for by the state, contractstores, consumers, or license es. The Board will make the product selections and set the prices of the products. The director of OFM must appoint a Spirits Distribu- tion Advisory Committee to assist and make recommenda- tions to OFM regarding settin g the requirements for the procurement process, selection of a private entity or rec-ommendation that no entity be selected, and creation of the terms of a contract with a se lected private entity. The rec- ommendations of the Spirits Distribution Advisory Com-mittee are advisory in nature and do not prohibit OFM andthe Board from performing their duties under the act. TheSpirits Distribution Advisory Committee is composed of the Washington State Treasurer or designee, and a desig-nee from each of the two largest caucuses of the Senateand House of Representatives. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: June 15, 2011 SB 5956 C 29 L 11 E 1 Concerning the prohibited practices of collection agencies. By Senators Harper, Pflug and Kline.House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Background: Collection agencies are prohibited from en- gaging in certain practices when attempting to collect debts. A collection agency cannot threaten a debtor withimpairment of the debtor's credit rating if a claim is notpaid. Credit agencies cannot harass a debtor. Certainbehaviors are presumed to be harassment, including: communicating with a debtor more than three times in a single week; communicating with a debtor at the debtor's place of employment more than one time in a single week; or communicating with a debtor or spouse at his or her residence between 9:00 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. Collection agencies are required to provide a debtor with an itemization of the amounts the co llection agency will seek to collect on the clai m. This information, along with other required informatio n, must be included in the first claim notice sent to the debtor. If a debtor disputes aSenate 31 14 House 52 42 (House amended)Senate 26 19 (Senate concurred)SSB 6892 360claim in writing, the collec tion agency must forward a copy of the dispute to the credit reporting bureau. Current law provides that collection agencies may not send any telegram or make an y telephone calls to a debtor or concerning a debt or for the purpose of demanding pay- ment of a claim or seeking information about a debtor, forwhich the charges are payable by the addressee or by theperson to whom the call is ma de. Senate bill 5574, which passed during the 2011 regula r session, prohibits collec- tion agencies from sending any telegram or making anytelephone calls to a debtor or concerning a debt or for thepurpose of demanding payment of a claim or seeking in-formation about a debtor, with a limited exception for calls to cell phones.

Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: July 22, 2011 SSB 6892 C 2 L 10 E 2 Establishing a temporary penalty and interest waiver pro- gram for certain excise taxes administered by thedepartment of revenue. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Murray; by request of Department ofRevenue). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Current tax law provides a variety of pen- alties related to timely and accurate filing and payment of excise taxes. Penalties are added to the taxes due under the follow- ing circumstances: late filing of tax returns; late payment of taxes (including tax assessments and warrants); failureto register as a taxpayer; disregard of specific written in-structions; failure to remit sal es tax to the seller; evasion; and misuse of resale certificates or reseller permits. Pen-alties may be waived or cance lled only upon finding that the underpayment or failure to pay tax was the result of circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer. Interest is added to the amount of outstanding taxes. However, interest is not added to the amount of any penal-ties assessed. The rate of interest is calculated as an aver-age of the federal short term rate plus two percentage points. The rates for calendar year 2010 and 2011 are 3percent. Interest may only be waived or cancelled if thefailure to pay was the direct result of written instructionsor a due date was extended fo r the sole convenience of the Department of Revenue (DOR). When taxpayers make payment, amounts are applied first to interest, then penaltie s, and finally to the tax due. Summary: DOR is authorized to waive most penaltiesand interest added to the following taxes which became due before February 1, 2011 : state business and occupa- tion tax (B&O), state public utility tax (PUT), state or localsales or use taxes. To obtain an interest an d penalty waiver, a taxpayer must meet the following conditions: By April 18, 2011, file all outstanding tax returns and any amended tax returns re lating to the tax liabilities for which a penalty and inte rest waiver is requested; By April 18, 2011, complete and deliver a request form for a waiver; By May 1, 2011, make full payment of taxes due for which a penalty and intere st waiver are requested; Timely file all current tax returns and make all tax payments due from January 31, 2011, and before May 1, 2011; By May 1, 2011, pay an y penalties added for evasion or misuse of reseller permit or resale certificate; and The taxpayer must never have been a defendant in a criminal prosecution related to an offense involving the failure to collect or pay the proper amount of anyexcise tax. Taxpayers receiving penalty or interest waivers under this legislation may not seek a refund or otherwise challenge their tax liability paid under these conditions. DOR may not waive penalties for tax evasion or misuse of reseller permits or resale certificates. Payments made to DOR prior to May 1, 2011, are ap- plied first to B&O, PUT, and sales and use taxes, then to any other taxes, and then to penalties or interest. If taxpayers are current for tax returns due as of No- vember 25, 2010, tax liability that accrues after that date would not qualify for the temporary waiver of interest andpenalties. As a condition to request a waiver of penalties and interest, a taxpayer may never have been assessed pen-alties for evasion or misuse of a reseller permit or resalecertificate.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: February 1, 2011Senate 42 0 House 86 0 Senate 38 0House 93 0SSB 6893 361SSB 6893 C 3 L 10 E 2 Suspending the child support pass through payment. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally sponsored by Senator Murray). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: As a condition of receiving Temporary As- sistance for Needy Families (T ANF) cash benefits, a fam- ily must assign its child suppor t rights to the state during the months they receive TANF. Washington, under a state option in the federal Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), passeschild support collections to the family up to $100 per month for a family with one child or $200 per month for afamily with two or more child ren. This is known as the child support pass through. If a state does not choose the child support pass through option, the amount coll ected is shared between the state and federal government. Summary: Effective May 1, 2011, the child support pass through is suspended for all fa milies. All rules to the con- trary adopted before May 1, 2011, are without force and effect.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: May 1, 2011 SSJM 8004 Requesting the reestablishment of the road leading to the upper Stehekin Valley within the North Cascades NationalPark. By Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters (originally sponsored by Senators Parlette, Nelson,Tom, Zarelli, Fraser, Hewitt, Kline, Hatfield, Murray andShin). Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Marine Waters House Committee on Environment Background: Established in 1968, the North Cascades National Park Complex contains three park units that are all managed as one, which include the North Cascades Na-tional Park, and Ross Lake and Lake Chelan National Rec-reation Areas. These protected lands are united by acontiguous overlay of Stephen Mather Wilderness, whichwas established by Congress in 1988 in the Washington State Wilderness Act. The town of Stehekin is located at the end of Lake Chelan and accessible only by boat, floatplane, or on foot. The Stehekin Valley Road was originally built as a wagon road in 1899 and runs over 20 miles from the lake into the national park. It provides access to Stephen MatherWilderness trailheads and North Cascades National Parkfrom the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The National Park Service ha s made the lower portion of the road accessible to vehicles, but the upper portion ofthe road is closed. Part of the upper portion was damagedin a 1995 flood, and more of the road was washed outwhen the Stehekin River flooded in October 2003. Summary: The Legislature requests the United StatesCongress, the United States Department of the Interior,and the National Park Service to work with WashingtonState to reestablish the road allowing access to the upperStehekin Valley within the North Cascades National Park.Votes on Final Passage: SJM 8008 Requesting that the United States Department of Laborprovide Washington with fe deral unemployment tax relief for Washington employers and a financial benefit for thestate's trust fund. By Senators Brown, Hewitt, Kohl-Welles, Holmquist Newbry, Conway, Parlette, Fraser, Kilmer, White andHatfield. Senate Committee on Labor, Commerce & Consumer Protection House Committee on Labor & Workforce Development Background: A number of states have had to borrow funds from the federal unemployment account to pay un- employment benefits. Genera lly, those loans must be paid back, with interest, within two years. If a state fails to ful-ly repay a loan, the federal g overnment is required to re- coup it by raising federal unemployment insurance (UI) taxes on employers in the state. It is expected that federalUI taxes on employers will increase automatically in anumber of states in 2011 and 2012. Interest payments onUI loans are made separately, and are due in September ofeach year that a state is bo rrowing. States commonly enact special assessments on employ ers to make the interest payments. Current proposals at the federal level would call for a moratorium on states raising taxes to pay for unemploy- ment insurance, allow states to avoid paying interest ontheir unemployment insurance debt, and suspendautomatic hikes in the federal unemployment tax. Summary: The United States Department of Labor is re- quested to provide Washington and UI tax paying employ-ers with federal unemployment tax relief and a financialbenefit equal to any benefit provided to employers instates who have had to borrow from the federalUnemployment Account.Senate 11House 86 8205 Repealing a conflicting reside ncy requirement for voting in a presidential election. By Senator Carrell.Senate Committee on Govern ment Operations, Tribal Relations & Elections House Committee on State Government & Tribal Affairs Background: Article VI, Section 1 of the Washington State Constitution entitles all persons who are 18 years or older, citizens of the United States, and have lived in thestate, county, and precinct 30 days immediately preceding the election to vote in all elections. Article VI, Section 1A of the Washington State Con- stitution provides that all citi zens of the United States who become residents of Washington during the year of a pres-idential election with the intention of making it their per-manent residence may vote for presidential electors or for the office of President and Vice-President of the UnitedStates if they resided in the state at least 60 daysimmediately preceding the election. At the time Section 1A was added to the Washington State Constitution in 1966, Section 1 required voters tolive in the state for one year, in the county for 90 days, andin the city, town, ward, or pr ecinct for 30 days immediate- ly preceding the election. The original purpose behindSection 1A was to allow citize ns who met all of the quali- fications for voting, except the residence requirement to vote for the office of President. (Section 1 was amendedin 1974 to read as it does today.) Summary: At the next general election, an amendment to Article VI Washington Constitution will be submitted to the voters to repeal Section 1A of Article VI, in its entirety. The Secretary of State is required to publish notice of the amendment at least four times during the four weeks preceding the election in every newspaper in the state.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: Contingent upon approval by the voters at the November 2011 general election.SJR 8206 Requiring extraordinary revenue growth to be transferred to the budget stabilization account. By Senators Zarelli, Brown, Pridemore, Tom, Kilmer, White and Parlette. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state Constitution was amended in 2007 to establish a Budget Stabilization Account. Each fiscal year, 1 percent of general state revenues are depos- ited to the Budget Stabilization Account. \"General staterevenues\" is defined in the state Constitution as all state revenues that are not dedicated to a particular purpose.Thus, general state revenues cons ist of all revenues to the state General Fund, with the exception of property tax rev-enues, which are dedicated to the common school system. Monies may be appropriated from the Budget Stabili- zation Account by a majority vote of each house of theLegislature if (1) forecasted state employment growth forany fiscal year is less than 1 percent; or (2) the Governor declares an emergency resulting from a catastrophic event that requires government action to protect life or publicsafety. Other withdrawals from the Budget StabilizationAccount may be made only by a three-fifths vote of theLegislature. To the extent that the bala nce of the Budget Stabiliza- tion Account exceeds ten percent of general state reve-nues, the Legislature may appropriate the excess balanceto the Education Construction Fund (which is statutorily dedicated to K-12 and higher education constructionprojects). Employment forecasts and revenue estimates for the Budget Stabilization Account are made by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council. Summary: At the end of each fiscal biennium, three quar- ters of any extraordinary grow th in state revenue is trans- ferred to the Budget Stabilization Account. \"Extraordinary revenue growth\" is defined as the amountby which the growth in general state revenues exceeds byone-third the average biennial growth in general state rev-enues over the prior five bienni a. The transfer of extraor- dinary revenue growth will be made only to the extent that it exceeds the automatic 1 percent transfer of general staterevenues.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: Contingent upon approval by the voters at the November 2011 general election.Senate 47 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 46 0 House 92 0 Senate 45 3 Senate 39 3 House 76 10 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)Sunset Legislation 363Sunset Legislation Background: The Legislature adopted the Washington State Sunset Act (chapter 43.131 RCW) in 1977 to im- prove legislative oversight of state agencies and programs.The sunset process provides for the automatic terminationof selected state agencies, pr ograms, units, subunits, and statutes. Unless the Legislature provides otherwise, theentity made subject to sunset review must formulate theperformance measures by whic h it will ultimately be eval- uated. One year prior to an automatic termination, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee and theOffice of Financial Management conduct program and fis-cal reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the Leg-islature in determining wh ether agencies and programs should be terminated automatic ally or be reauthorized in either their current or a modified form prior to thetermination date. Session Summary: Legislation repealed the requirement for: (1) The Office of Regulatory Assistance to be terminated on June 30, 2011, and repealed on June 30, 2012. (2) The Sex Offender Policy Board to be terminated on June 30, 2013, and repealed on June 30, 2014.

That budget left a projected near general fund en ding fund balance of approximately $459 million. Over the next three quarters, the revenue forecast for the 2009-11 biennium was reduced by more than $1.3 billion, resulting in a projected deficit of $900 million as of December 2010. The shortfall grew larger when projected caseload increases, the latest projection of fe deral rates used to match Medicaid, and the March 2011 revenue forecast were all incorporated. These factors, combined with the $900 million shortfall discussed above, created a new total 2009-11 shortfall of $1.2 billion. In December 2010, the Legislature met in special sessi on and adopted Chapter 1, Laws of 2010, 2nd sp.s. (HB 3225), which addressed $588 million of the projected deficit ($490 million throug h reduced appropriations and $98 million through increased resources, primarily fund transfers). In February 2011, the Legislature adopted Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1086), which addressed another $367 million of the projected deficit ($242 million through reduced appr opriations and the remai nder through fund transfers). In May 2011, the Legislature learned that the impact of the previously enacted tax penalty and interest waiver program was $200 million better than originally anticipated, reducing the shortfall to $1 billion. In addition to making initial appropriations for the 2011-13 biennium, Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087) addressed the remainder of the 2009-11 shortfall and left a projected near general fund (NGF-S) ending balance for 2009-11 of approximately $111 million. With respect to the 2009-11 biennium, Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087): (1) incorporated the latest projection of federal rates used to match Medicaid expenditure costs of $128 million; (2) delayed a portion of the apportionment payments that would otherwise be made to school districts in June 2011 until July 2011 (saving $115 m illion in the 2009-11 biennium and increasing the 2011-13 costs by an equal amount); and (3) made a variety of other typical supplemental changes. 2011-13 Shortfall In addition to the shortfall in the 2009-11 biennium, the Legislature faced an additional shortfall in the 2011-13 biennium. The March 2011 revenue forecast projected Near General Fund plus Opportunity Pathways (NGFS+) revenue collections of approximately $32.3 billion (compared to $28. 5 billion in 2009-11). Wh ile revenue collections were projected to increase by almost 6.6 percent per year in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, fiscal year 2013 ($16.5 billion) is the first year that near general fund re venue collections are expected to exceed fiscal year 2007 collections. The 2009-11 biennial budget, including the 2010 supplemental, appropriated approximately $31.1 billion from NGFS+. That budget also used more than $2.3 billion in one-time federal funds (primarily American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enhanced FMAP (ARRA FMAP) rates, as well as fiscal stabilization grants in the Department of Corrections, in public schools and higher education) that directly offset state expenditures. Two education-relate d initiatives (Initiative 732 and Initiative 728) were temporarily suspended in the 2009-11 biennium but, under then current law, were to resume in the 2011-13 biennium. Pension rates were projected to increase by almost $566 million. Caseloads continued to increase in various programs, including K-12 education, long-term care, and medical assistance programs. The estimated cost of continuing the 2009-11 budget in to 2011-13 biennium was estimated at $36.3 billion or about $3.7 billion more than projected revenues. The gap widened further when $424 million in additional costs 365 2011-13 Operating Budget Overviewwere included, such as repaying the delayed June 20 11 apportionment payment, beginning the new education funding formula, increasing the state need grant to k eep pace with assumed increases in tuition, and leaving projected reserves of $741 million ($282 million of which is in the Budget Stabilization Account). Altogether, the projected budget problem statement for 2011-13 biennium addressed by this proposal is $5 billion. Total policy level reductions are $4.5 billion. The remainde r of the shortfall is addressed through fund transfers and resource changes. 2011-13 Policy Level Spending Changes Major 2011-13 reductions in Chapter 50, Laws of 201 1, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087) include: (1) $1.2 billion from changes to the Initiative 728 class size and Initiative 732 cost-of-living adjustment requirements; (2) $215 million by eliminating K-4 class enhanc ement, which is partially offset by maintaining the funding for high poverty schools; (3) $535 million in reducti ons to state higher education institutions, which is partially offset by tuition increases; (4) $356 million by ma king salary reductions to state, higher education and K-12 employees; (5) $344 million from ending future automa tic cost of living increases for Public Employees' Retirement System Plan 1 and the Teachers' Retirement System Plan 1 members; (6) a $130 million reduction to the Basic Health Plan; (7) $110 million from reducing hos pital payments by 7 to 8 percent; (8) $98 million from reduced personal care hours for long term care and devel opmentally disabled clients; and (11) $116 million by changing the Disability Lifeline cash program to a housing and essential needs program. Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087) also makes approximately $424 million in NGFS+ policy additions, some of whic h are related to achieving greater sa vings. Policy additions include the following items: (1) $115 million repayment of the K- 12 apportionment delay in the 2011 supplemental budget; (2) $124 million for the higher education State Need Gr ant to accommodate authorization to increase tuition; (3) $82 million in K-12 related items (mostl y related to converting to a new funding formula); (4) $28 million for increased debt service; and (5) $11 million for repayment to the State Efficiency and Reorganization Account. 2011-13 Fund Transfers & Resource Changes For the 2011-13 biennium, Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087) makes $459 million in transfers from various funds to increase General Fund-St ate resources. Some of the largest transfers include: (1) $204 million from suspending the transfer to the Education Construction Account for the 2011-13 biennium; (2) $85 million from the Liquor Revolving Account (implic itly assuming continuation of a previous markup on distilled spirits); (3) $50 million from the Public Works Assistance Account; (4) $45 million from the Education Savings Account; (5) $25 million from the Treasurer's Service Account; and (6) $10 million from a 3.4 percent reduction to various distributions to local governments. Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087), also includes additional actions that are expected to result in $57 million in additional revenue. These incl ude: (1) $53.5 million from continued and new revenue collection efforts by the Department of Revenue; and (2) $3.6 million from changes in liquor retail operations, such as opening six new contract stores and five new co-located stores. 2011-13 Agency Consolidations Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2 ESHB 1087) assumes the following agency consolidations/ transfers: (1) Medical Purchasing Administration wher e the DSHS Medical Assistance Administration becomes part of the Health Care Authority; (2) Department of Enterprise Services where certai n central service and back office functions are transferred (in part or in whole) fr om various agencies into the newly-created Department of Enterprise Services; (3) the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board being merged into the Department of Corrections; and (4) the Sentencing Guidelines Commission is divided so that the research and data functions are transferred to the Caseload Forecast Council and the policy functions and Sex Offender Policy Board are transferred to the Office of Financial Management. 366 2011-13 Operating Budget OverviewMultiple Budget Bills Were Enacted The Legislature adopted budget bills in December 2010 (2009-11), February 2011 (2009-11), and May 2011 (both 2009-11 and 2011-13). As a result of the multiple budget actions taken by the Le gislature in addressing the 2009-11 shortfall, there is an increased possibility for confusion on how the various budget items interact w ith the budget for 2011-13. In some instances, the reductions included in Chapter 50, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESHB 1087), are the continuation of reductions (sometim es at a lower or higher level) first begun in either Chapter 1, Laws of 2010, 2nd sp.s. (HB 3225), or Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1086). Additionally, the reductions from any of the budget versions are not automatically carried in to the future. If the reductions are continued at any level into the 2011-13 biennium, they are displayed at the policy level. 367 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview2009-11 2011-13 RESOURCESNear General Fund-State and Opportunity Pathways Account (Dollars in Millions)Estimated Revenues and Expenditures Beginning Fund Balance 309.5 111.3 Revenue November 2010 Revenue Forecast 28,566.4 33,210.8 December 2010 Legislation with Revenue Impacts 70.3 -30.1 March 2011 Revenue Forecast Change -143.4 -654.2 2011 Budget Driven Revenue (2ESHB 1087) 0.0 58.1 2011 Revenue Legislation (Net Change) 0.0 -10.1 Interest & Penalty Deferral (Update) 200.0 0.0 Total Revenue 28,693.3 32,574.5 Other Resource Changes Transfers to the Budget Stabilization Account 245 6 281 4 Transfers to t he Budget Stabilization Account -245.6 -281.4 Use of Budget Stabilization Account 267.0 0.0 Other Previously Enacted Fund Transfers & Adjustments 1,269.4 -204.0 Fund Transfers HB Resource Changes 1,496.3 -26.8 Total Resources 30,499.2 32,659.0 EXPENDITURES Spending Previously Enacted Appropriations 31,084.5 December 2010 (HB 3225 no vetoes) -491 8 December vetoes) -491.8 -234.4 May 2011 1087, after vetoes) 29.4 32,200.0 Total Spending 30,387.8 32,200.0 RESERVES Ending Balance & Reser esEnding Balance & Reserves Unrestricted Ending Fund Balance 111.3 459.0 Budget Stabilization Account Balance 0.0 281.5 Total Reserves 111.3 740.6 Note: The balance sheet reflects appropriations as made in enacted budget bills.

The March for ecast was a reduction of $80 million for 2009-11 and $698 million for 2011-13 compared to th e November 2010 forecast. Although curre nt collections continue to show year over year growth, they are below the forecast, which resulted in another reduction in future revenue expectations. The reduction for 2009-11 would have been $191 million but for revenue actions taken in the December special session and an administrative shift in payment frequency for 32,600 taxpayers from quarterly to monthly tax filers. Appropriations to the Department of Revenue made in December supporte d increased audit activity that was expected to bring in $19.5 million in business and occ upation (B&O) tax from out-of-state companies operating in Washington. Also, Chapter 2, Laws of 2010, 2nd sp.s. (SSB 6892), created a temporary program to provide amnesty on interest and penalties on past taxes owed but no t yet paid. Applications were accepted until April 18, 2011. As of the March forecast, amnesty agreements were expected to net an additional $50.8 million for the 2009-11 period. Since some of this revenue was expect ed to be pulled forward from the 2011-13 period, the 2011-13 forecast was reduced by $30.1 million. On May 3, 2011, the Department of Revenue announced that nearly 8,900 businesses paid $320.7 million in state and local tax under the program. Of the total, $263.4 million was state general fund. The near general fund balance sh eet reflects an additional $200 million in 2009-11 revenue over the amount included in the March forecast. In addition to the revenue efforts made in December, a dditional appropriations were ma de to the Department of Revenue to continue increased audit activity for out-of-state companies ($39 million in 2011-13) and to increase traditional collection methods ($14.5 million in 2011-13). Revenue Reductions Chapter 339, Laws of 2011 (SSB 5385), generally increases revenue to the state Wildlife Account by changing fees for recreational hunting and fishing licenses, moving all recreational hunting and fishing license revenue from the general fund, creating a new administrative surcharge fo r commercial hunting and fishing licenses, and allowing the Wildlife Account to retain interest from the account. The general fund reduction is a bout $2.9 million for 2011-13. This is primarily from moving shellfish license reve nue from the general fund to the Wildlife Account. Chapter 322, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (SB 5083), allows any real estate firm that receives a commission at the time of closing on a real estate transaction to pay the B& O tax only upon their respective shares of the commission. Originating and cooperating brokers were allowed this special B&O tax treatment under prior law. Now commissions shared with a referring real estat e broker will be allowed the same treatment. Chapter 163, Laws of 2011 (ESHB 1902), and Chapter 19, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (2ESHB 1224), deal with the B&O tax treatment of government social services provided by nonprofit service providers. Nonprofit service providers of mental health services (2ESHB 1224) and child welfare services (ESHB 1902) are exempt from the B&O tax on funds received from non-government agen cies for providing services for a government-funded program. This change accommodates a shift in management of these programs from direct government agency management to management by nonprofit and for profit firm s. Under prior law, the exemption for nonprofit service providers depended on receiving money dir ectly from a government. In addition, the nonprofit and for profit firms are also exempt on the funds they receive from a government that is used to pay nonprofits for these social services. Moving Revenue to General Fund Chapter 334, Laws of 2011 (HB 2019), removes the dedica tion of the additional $0.60 cigarette tax from the Education Legacy Trust Account and moves the revenue to the general fund.

COM's funding for administra tion and operation of its programs is reduced by $1.8 million. Funding for growth management grants is reduced by $0.8 million. Increases: Chapter 36, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESHB 2082), directs the termination of the Disability Lifeline-Unemployable (DL-U) program that provides a cash benefit to eligible needy individuals who do not qualify for other federal assistance programs. Effective November 1, 2011, $64.1 m illion of funds previously provided for cash grants to DL-U clients is transferred from the Department of Social and Health Services to COM to be used to provide support for essential needs and housing of these individuals. COM shall utilize the funds to provide grants to local governments and community-based organizations. Assistance to individuals will be provided within available resources and cannot be provided in the form of cash grants. Chapter 58, Laws of 2011 (2SHB 1362), authorizes e xpenditures of $14.2 million for COM to implement provisions of the act. COM will use revenues from newly-authorized fees on financial institutions issuing notices of defaults to implement provisions including incr easing the number of housing counselors and attorneys available to assist individuals at risk of default and establishing a foreclosure mediation program. The budget also includes increased federal expenditure au thority of $13.4 million for COM in a variety of areas. The largest of these are authority to expend a $6.1 million fe deral grant for a program to install renewable energy systems and energy efficiency technologies and a $5 million federal grant for a program to stabilize neighborhoods with abandoned homes. Department of Revenue Revenue Enhancement Funding is provided to continue efforts that began in the early action bill in December 2010 to collect additional revenue from out-of-state audits. Funding is also provided and for additional staff in 2011-13 to collect state tax revenues. The additional tax collection staff includes taxpayer account administrators, compliance staff, and auditors. On average, each employee is estimated to bring in $420,000 per fiscal year in revenue. The continuations of the early action efforts are estimated to generate an additional $39 million, and the additional staff is estimated to generate $14.5 million, for a total of $53.5 million in additional revenues. Business Licensing Transfer Expenditure authority of $14.4 million and the administration of the Master License Service (MLS) program are transferred from the Department of Licensing to the Depa rtment of Revenue (DOR). Over 500,000 state and city business licenses and endorsements are issued and renewed annually through a one-page application system via the MLS program. By building upon existing processes to administer the MLS program, DOR is expected to achieve expenditure savings of over $1 million annually. 391 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Military Department Enhanced 911 Expenditure authority of nearly $7 million is provided from the Enhanced 911 Account to continue upgrading the current 911-telephone system. The upgrades support the second of a three-phase process to develop a modern Internet protocol system that allows the 911 dispatcher s and authorities to accept information from a wide variety of communication devices during emergencies. Department of Financial Institutions Mortgage Fraud Prosecution Expenditure authority of $1 million is provided to the Department of Financial Institutions to continue administering the Mortgage Lending Fraud Prosecution Account (MLFPA). Funded by a $1 surcharge at the recording of a deed of trust, MLFPA is used to reimbur se county prosecutors for costs related to the investigation and prosecution of mortgage fraud cases. The program was set to expire in July 2011, but legislation extended MLFPA for five additional years. Other Heritage Agencies The budget redistributes over $3.5 million from the Washington State Heritage Center Acc ount to supplant all or a portion of the Near General Fund-State support for the Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation and State Library's operating expenses. The Account consists of fee revenue pr eviously collected for the Heritage Center project, a new facility in the planning stages of construction on the Capitol Campus that would house the State Library and Archives. The redistribution of funds is one-time and ongoing fee revenue remains dedicated to the Heritage Center project. Juvenile and Adult Sentencing Database and Caseload Forecasts The Sentencing Guidelines Commission (SGC) and the Sex Offender Policy Board are transferred to the Office of Financial Management. Some SGC f unctions, managing the adul t and juvenile sentencing database and preparing criminal justice fiscal notes, are transferred to the Caseload Forecast Council. The Council will maintain the records database and publish an annual statistical summa ry for both juvenile di spositions and adult felony sentences, along with adult felony and juvenile sentencing manuals. Innovate Washington Chapter 14, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s., Partial Veto (2ESB 5764), creates Innovate Washington as the successor agency to the Washington Technology Center (WTC) and the Spokane Intercollegiate Research and Technology Institute (SIRTI). Innovate Washington is identified as the primary state agency responding to the technology transfer needs of existing businesses in the state. The role of Innovate Washington includes: facilitating research supportive of state industries; providing mechanisms fo r collaboration between technology-based industries and higher education institutions; help ing businesses secure research funds; developing and integrating technology into new products; offering technology transfer and comme rcialization training opportunities; serving as the lead entity for coordinating clean energy initiatives; and administering technology and innovation grant and loan programs. The 2011-13 operating budget provides Innovate Washingt on with $8.2 million in total funds ($6.0 million General Fund-State) to maintain support for these activiti es. This is a reduction in General Fund-State of $1.5 million (20 percent) from the prior combined funding levels of WTC and SIRTI. 392 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Human Services The Human Services section is separated into two secti ons: the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and Other Human Services. The DSHS budget is displayed by program division to most efficiently describe the costs of particular services provided by the Department. The Other Human Services section displays budgets at the agency level and includes the Departme nt of Corrections, Employment Security Department, Department of Veterans' Affairs, De partment of Labor and Industries, Criminal Justice Training Commission, Department of Health, and other human services related agencies. 393 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Department of Social & Health Services Children and Family Services The Children's Administration operates Ch ild Protective Services (CPS) that responds to reports of child abuse or neglect. The Department also operates the foster care system for children who are out-of-home placements with caregivers and the adoption support program for children who have been adopted from the foster care system. Additionally, the Department contracts for prevention, early intervention services, and services for children and families involved in the child welfare system. Savings of $18.7 million in total funds ($8.1 million Near General Fund-State) are achieved through the reduction of 249 FTEs from the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) Children's Administration and through management efficiency savings. These savings are achi eved through reducing both vacant and filled positions within the Department. The budget reduces a total of $1.8 million in total funds ( $462,000 Near General Fund-State) for Secure Crisis Residential Centers, Crisis Resi dential Centers, and HOPE beds. Savings of $1.7 million in total funds ($1.1 million Near General Fund-State) are achieved through reductions in the Behavioral Rehabilitative Services (BRS) program. BR S services are provided to children in foster care who need intensive services. The Department will continue to focus on decreasing the length of stay and placing children in less restrictive settings. The budget reduces funding for foster parent childcare by a total of $3 million ($2.6 million Near General Fund- State) reflecting revisions to policies that have b een implemented by the Department regarding childcare authorizations. Savings of $8.4 million in total funds ($4.4 million Ne ar General Fund-State) ar e achieved through expediting adoptions for children awaiting a home study to finali ze the adoption and through modifications to policies pertaining to the use of Voluntary Placement Agreements. Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration A total of $179 million is provided for DSHS-Juven ile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) to incarcerate approximately 600 juvenile fe lons per month in state institutions, supervise an average of 426 youth on parole, and provide grants to county juvenile courts for alternative disposition a nd evidence-based treatment in the 2011-13 biennium. This represents a decrease of $37 million (17 percent) in JRA spending from the 2009-11 biennium and a decrease of $19 million (10 pe rcent) from the 2011-13 maintenance level. The budget provides $500,000 each to JRA and for pass-thr ough grants to juvenile c ourts for expansion of evidence-based treatment programs. Funding is reduced by $12.6 million General Fund-Stat e, including: reducing parole services that includes reducing aggression replacement therapy and functional family therapy ($4. 3 million), reducing juvenile court funding ($2.3 million), and reducing administra tive and JRA institution costs ($5.2 million). Funding is reduced by $3.3 million General Fund-State to reflect the closure of Maple Lane School on June 30, 2011. The 2010 supplemental budget assumed closure of Maple Lane School on June 30, 2013, but a declining caseload and capacity at other institu tions enables an earlier closure. 394 2011-13 Operating Budget OverviewMental Health Mental health services for those living with severe, chronic, or acute mental illnesses are administered primarily through DSHS. This includes operation of two adult state hospitals that deliver psychiatric services to clients on civil or forensic commitment orders and for the Child Study Treatment Center, which is a small psychiatric inpatient faci lity for children and adolescents. In addition, DSHS contracts with 13 Regional Support Networks (RSNs) as local administrative entities to coordinate crisis response, community support, residential, and resource management services through a network of community providers. Services for Medicaid -eligible consumers within each RSN are provided through a capitated Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan. Limited services that cannot be reimbursed through the Me dicaid program are provided within available state and local resources. A total of $1.598 billion ($890 million General Fund-State) is provided for operation of the public mental health system during the 2011-13 biennium. This is $57.2 million (3 percent) less than the estimated amount needed to maintain the current level of mental health services and activities. Major reductions include: Funding for the community mental health services delivered through RSNs is reduced by a total of $26.2 million, or about 3 percent. DSHS is to reduce RSN mental health capitation rates for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid by $17.5 million, approximately 2 percent. In addition, \" state only \" funding for people and services not eligible for the federal Medicaid program is reduced by a total of $8.7 million, or about 4 percent. Staffing in the state psychiatric hospitals is reduced by approximately 112 FTEs (4 percent) with a total reduction in funding of $31.0 million, or about 7 percent. This includes savings of $6.6 million resulting from a Western State Hospital civil ward closure implemented in fiscal year 2011. In addition, DSHS is to maintain and enhance a variety of strategies at all three of the state hospitals for achieving opera ting and administrative efficiencies that save another $9.7 million without further reductions of beds. Reductions to employee compensation and suspension of automatic benefit increases in the Public Employees' Retirement System Plan 1 will result in savi ngs of approximately $14.6 million. DSHS is to achieve savings of $2.6 million in G eneral Fund-State during the 2011-13 biennium by leveraging alternative fund sources. This includes increased use of Medicaid to pay for Program of Assertive Community Treatment team services as well as alternative community services provided to former residents of the Program of Adaptive Living Skills. In addition, DSHS will enter into an interagency agreement with the O ffice of the Attorney General for expenditure of $700,000 of the state' s proceeds of the cy pres settlement in State of Washington v. AstraZeneca (Seroquel) and use this to maintain support for the University of Washington' s Evidence Based Practice Institute. A total of $3 million is provided to adjust RSN Medicaid mental health capitation rate ranges to correct a technical oversight related to costs associated with hospitals participating in the state 's certified public expenditure (CPE) payment program. When rate ranges were reset in 2010, some costs associated with these facilities were inadvertently omitted from the rate- setting study. Aging and Disabilities Services (Long -Term Care and Developmental Disabilities) A total of $5 .5 million is provided for health benefit inflation for approximately 39,000 homecare workers who meet minimum standards for hours worked providing personal care services to senior citizens and clients with developmental disabilities. Pursuant to the coll ective bargaining agreement for individual providers, the way health benefits are paid for is converted from a monthly payment rate to a cents-per-hour payment methodology. Just under $1.5 billion in state funding ($2.9 billion in total funds) is appropriated for DSHS to provide Medicaid Personal C are (MPC) services to an average of 45 ,000 eligible adult clients per month who are elderly or have developmental disabilitie s. The MPC program utilizes a client assessment to determine an individual 's need for assistance with activities of daily living - such as bathing, meal preparation, toileting, medication management, and housekeeping. The appropriated amount reflects General Fund-State savings of $98 million from the 2009-11 biennial appropriation. The savings are achieved through a reduction in hours that are authorized on a monthly 395 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview basis for MPC. The actual reduction in hours is tiered acco rding to client acuity and will range between 6 percent and 18 percent per client with the m ost acute client s receiving the smallest reduction in authorized hours. A savings of $30 million General Fund-State ($56 milli on in total funds) is achieved by delaying the implementation of enhanced long-term care worker traini ng and certification requireme nts established in 2008 by Initiative 1029. The savings include a reduction in contribut ions paid to the training partnership and to homecare agencies to administer the training for homecare workers. Funding is continued for the current level of fundamental training for long-term care workers, which is 28-34 hours, depending on the type of worker. Funding is maintained for current levels of specialty tr aining as required to care for clients with dementia, mental health, and developmental disabilities. The current con tinuing education and state background checks remain in effect. The implementation of additional federal fingerprint background checks is also delayed. A total of $147 million is appropriated for the agin g and disability services home- and community-based waiver programs' employment and day services. This reflects a reduction of $20 million in total funds due to changes to existing services. These include a modification from the current adult working policy to a work first policy resulting in $2.8 million total savings and transitioning the Adult Day Health (ADH) program to a long-term care waivered service resulting in $17.2 million total savings. Collectively, these changes prohibit a client with developmental disabilities from receiving more than one em ployment or day service simultaneously. Clients over the age of 21 must work with contracted employment vendors for nine months seeking employment after which time they may elect to transfer to the community access program. Alternatively, clients who prefer ADH may access this program by switching from the developmental di sability waiver program to the long-term care waiver program, making them ineligible for employment or co mmunity access services. Services remain unchanged for eligible senior citizens who currently participate in the ADH program. Developmental Disabilities A total of $11 million is provided for community resi dential placements for 58 individuals who have been identified as aging out of foster care, ready for disch arge from juvenile rehabilitation and mental health institutions, or ready for release from the Department of Corrections. Long-Term Care The budget assumes the creation of a nursing facility safet y net assessment pursuant to Chapter 7, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (ESSB 5581 - Nursing Home Safety Net). The safety net assessment utilizes a new revenue stream and leverages additional federal funding for skilled nursing fac ility Medicaid payments. All revenues from the safety net assessment are utilized for payments to nursing facilities. New payments total\u0003$170 million to include $88 million from the newly-created Skilled Nursing Facility Safety Net Trust Fund and matching federal funds. \u0003 Economic Services Administration The Economic Services Administration operates a variety of programs for low-income persons and families. These programs include the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), the state Food Assistance Program, the state WorkFirst Program, th e Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, and the Disability Lifeline Program. Savings of $100.3 million state general funds are achie ved through the continuation of the Disability Lifeline grant reduction implemented in fiscal year 2011. The gr ant reduction affects all Disability Lifeline recipients. Funding is reduced by $79.5 million to reflect provisions included in Chapter 36, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESHB 2082). Under ESHB 2082, the Disability Lifeline Program is terminated on October 31, 2011. The Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program is established for persons likely to meet the federal Supplemental Security Income disability standard. An Essential Needs and H ousing Support Program is established for individuals eligible for Medical Care Services who are not recipients of Alcohol and Addiction Services or are not recipients 396 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview of Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program. Total funding of $64.1 million is provided to the Department of Commerce for the Essentia l Needs and Housing Support Program. Savings of $12.6 million in total funds ($6.3 million N ear General Fund-State) are achieved by continuing the suspension of redistributions of Internal Revenue Service refund payments that previously prioritized former TANF clients over repayment of state debt. The federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to pass through up to $100 a month of collected child support to TANF families with one chil d and up to $200 a month of collected child support to TANF families with two or more children without having to reimburse th e federal government for its share of the child support collected. Chapter 3, Laws of 2010, 2 nd sp.s. (SSB 6893), suspended the child support pass through resulting in savings of $37.6 million in total funds ($18.8 million Near General Fund-State). The 2011-13 operating budget set the state Food Assistance Program benefit at 50 percent of the federal SNAP benefit amount resulting in savings of $30 million state general fund. Low-Income Medical Assistance A total of $10.7 billion is appropriated to pay for medi cal and dental services for an average of 1.3 million low- income children and adults each month during the 201 1-13 biennium. This is an increase of $519 million (5 percent) from the 2009-11 biennium in total appropriations for such services. An average of 83,000 (7 percent) more persons per month are expected to receive state- subsidized coverage than during the 2009-11 biennium. These funds are appropriated exclusively to the Health Ca re Authority (HCA) because Chapter 15, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (2E2SHB 1738), transferred administration of the Medical Assistance Program from DSHS into HCA. Of the $10.7 billion appropriated, $4.9 billion is stat e funds; $5.6 billion is federal funds, primarily from Medicaid; and the rest is local government funds prov ided for purposes of collecting Medicaid matching funds. Of the $4.9 billion in state funds, $4.5 billion is stat e general fund and $400 million is from the Hospital Safety Net Assessment enacted in 2010. The $4.9 billion provi ded for low-income medical assistance is 15 percent of total state fund appropriations and is a $777 million (19 percent) increase in such appropriations from the 2009-11 level. The increase in state fund appropriations ($777 m illion) is greater than the increase in total appropriations ($519 million) because of the expiration of federal Americ an Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds that temporarily reduced the state share of Medicaid costs during the 2009-11 biennium. Though a $777 million increase, the $4.9 billion state appr opriation is $620 million (11 percent) less than would be required to continue all low-income medical assi stance programs and policies with no changes from the 2009-11 biennium. As depicted in the pie chart, and d escribed in some detail below, the $620 million of state general fund reductions fall into seven broad categories. 397 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview $224 million (36 percent) of the state general fund reductions ($427 million total funds) are due to reduced provider payments . The largest components are a $110 million reduction in state Medicaid payment rates for non-rural, non-gove rnmental hospitals (8 percent for inpatient services and 6 percent for outpatient services), and a $42 million (approximately 11 percent) reduction in payment rates for low-income community clinics. Other state general fund reductions in this category include an anticipated $27 million savings in fiscal year 2013 as a result of emphasizing price in the selection of managed care contractors; $25 million from eliminating state gran t support for low-income community clinics and community coverage collaboratives; and $14 million fro m a 40 percent reduction in grants to hospitals that serve disproportionately large numbers of low-income patients. $125 million (20 percent) of the state general fund reductions ($196 million total funds) are due to covering fewer people under the state's Basic Health Plan (B HP). An average of 35,000 people will receive subsidized BHP coverage during 2011-13, just over half as many as originally planned. This reduction results from terminating BH P coverage for persons who are ineligible for the state's Medicaid Transition Bridge waiver because of their age or immigration status; transferring coverage for approximately 1,700 children from BHP to other state programs; and continuing to freeze new admissions to the program. $102 million (17 percent) of the state general fund reductions ($199 million total funds) are due to service delivery and purchasing reforms. Almost $40 million of state expenditures are to be avoided by increasing efforts to: (1) identify and bill other in surance coverage for pers ons who have it and (2) recover payments that have been inappropriately char ged. An additional $36 million of state savings are anticipated from a new policy under which the medica l assistance program will not pay for more than three emergency room visits for non-emergent c onditions per patient per year. Other state-fund reductions in this category include: $9 million fro m improved utilization management of advanced Provider Payment Reductions $224 Million 36%Delivery & Purchasing Reforms $102 Million 17% Coverage Reductions $125 Million 20%Benefit & Service Reductions $53 Million 9% Fund Source Changes $76 Million 12% Increased Cost Sharing $26 Million 4% Staffing & Compensation $9 Million 2% 398 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview imaging, prescription drugs, and selected outpatient surgeries; $8 million from extending ma naged care coverage to m ost disabled Medicaid recipients during the second year of the biennium; $4 million from selectively contracting for wheelchairs and some ot her medical equipment and supplies; and $3 million from streamlining delivery of medical interpreter services. $76 million (12 percent) of the state general fund reductions are due to fund source changes . The largest is the use of $44 million from the Tobacco Settlement Account to fund BHP enrollments. The federal government has agreed to cover half the cost of kidney dialysis and cancer treatment for low-income immigrants who do not qualify for Medicaid, saving $ 23 million of state expenditures. An additional $11 million of state expenditures will be saved by redu cing the state's contribution towards the required non-federal match for school-based Medicaid services to 40 percent, requiring school districts to provide the other 60 percent with local funds. $53 million (9 percent) of the state general fund reductions ($118 million total funds) derive from covering fewer services for eligible recipients. Preventive and restorative dental care will no longer be covered for adults unless they are pregnant or recei ving long-term care services, for an anticipated $29 million in state savings. Maternity support services are reduced by 30 percent, for a $12 million state savings. The Medicaid program will no longer cover eyeglasses and most hearing devices for adults, saving approximately $5 million, and adult occupati onal, physical, and speech therapy benefits are reduced by about one-third, for a savings of $4 million. $26 million (4 percent) of the state general fund reductions ($36 million total funds) are from requiring recipients to pay more for covered services. The state will no longer cover the cost of drug co-payments for low-income elderly and disabled persons eligible for Medicare, and HCA will seek a federal waiver under which all Medicaid recipients other than those receiving long-term care services would have drug co-payments comparable to those required in BHP. Families with incomes over 200 percent of the federal poverty level whose children are ineligible fo r federally funded medical coverage because of their immigration status will be required to pay a premium e qual to the average state cost in order to enroll in state-sponsored medical programs. $9 million (2 percent) of the state general fund re ductions ($17 million total funds) are from an approximately 3 percent reduction in state agency staffing, and from the state employee salary and benefit reductions described in other sections of this document. Special Commitment Center The 2011-13 biennial budget adjusted the funding for the Special Commitment Center (SCC), providing a total of $95.4 million state general funds for the operations of S CC. SCC operates both a main facility on McNeil Island and two Secure Community Transitional Facilities for civilly committed sexually violent predators. Major savings items include: $3.2 million through staff reductions and efficiencies; $1.1 million through changes to residential and community programs; $3.8 million through modification to staffing at the Secure Community Transitional Facilities pursuant to Chapter 19, Laws of 2011 (SHB 1247). Additionally, $6 million was provided to SCC for Mc Neil Island operations. Due to the McNeil Island Correctional Institute closure in April 2011, SCC sole ly operates the McNeil Island functions including water treatment, road maintenance, and ferry operations. 399 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Other Human Services Department of Corrections A total of $1.7 billion is provided for the Department of Corrections (DOC) to incarcerate an average of 18,000 inmates per month and to supervise an average of 15,225 offenders in the community per month for the 2011-13 biennium. This represents a decrease of $73.4 million (4 .3 percent) in corrections spending from the 2009-11 biennium and savings of $137.3 million (7.6 percent) from the 2011-13 maintenance level. The budget provides $6 million for prison safety enhancements , including: a study to standardize a body alarm or proximity card system statewide; pilot projects for a body alarm system and a proximity card system; upgrades to the radio system to add panic buttons; expanded use of pepper spray; development a nd implementation of training for supervisors on enhanced security awareness; additional staff counselor positions; and the addition of custody staff at the Monroe Correctional Complex and the Wash ington State Penitentiary who are responsible for monitoring the whereabouts of all prison employees. Funding is reduced by $53.6 million General Fund-State to reflect savings from continuing reductions begun in fiscal year 2011 as a result of the Governor's across-the- board reductions and enactment of Chapter 1, Laws of 2010, 2 nd sp.s. (HB 3225). These continued savings include: ($18.6 million); reducing administrative million); changing agency structure ($7.2 million); holding positions vacant ($7.9 million); reducing Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative bed utilization ($3.4 million); and achieving additional program savings ($7.8 million). Funding is reduced to reflect net savings of $18.3 million General Fund-State in the 2011-13 biennium from the closure of the McNeil Island Corrections Center (MICC) on April 1, 2011, consistent with the policy included in HB 3225. The savings from the closure of MICC are partially offset by the opening of a unit at the Larch Correctional Center in Yacolt. The budget assumes savings of $9.4 million General Fund- State due to changes in community supervision consistent with the following policy changes included in Chapter 40, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESSB 5891): Elimination of supervision for certain offenders from jail, saving $1.9 million. Excluded from this group are sex offenders, offenders in treatment programs, offenders with a high-risk profile, and certain offenders with a conviction of a domestic violence offense. Elimination of \"tolling\" or pausing the term of co mmunity custody while an offender is confined for violating a sentencing condition, saving $5.2 million. The length of an offender's supervision will run continuously regardless of whether an offender is incarcer ated for violating the terms of their supervision. The practice of tolling will continue for sex offenders. Reduction in the length of community supervision for offenders on the First Time Offender Waiver program from 24 and 12 months to 12 and 6 months, saving $2.3 million. The budget assumes savings of $15.5 million General Fund-State related to costs for housing community supervision violators. DOC will negotiate lower contr act amounts for housing offenders in local and tribal government jails. The rate must not exceed $85 per day per offender, saving $7 million. In addition, the budget assumes a lower demand for violator beds attributable to the reduction in the number of offenders on supervision and the elimination of tolling, saving $8.5 million. Funding is reduced by $4.0 million General Fund-State to reflect savings from early deportation of certain non-citizen drug and property offenders, c onsistent with Chapter 206, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1547). The 400 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview reduction assumes that qualifying non-citizen offenders are deported and that qualifying newly-sentenced non- citizen offenders are processed for deportati on upon arrival to the state prison system. Criminal Justice Training Commission The budget provides $30.3 million from General Fund-State to the Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC) for training and certification of local law enforcement and corrections officers and pass-through funds to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC). This funding level is an 11.1 percent reduction from General Fund-State expenditures in the 2009-11biennium. Major items include: Funding is reduced by $1.3 million to reflect a 25 percent partial reimbursement of the basic law enforcement academy costs by law enforcement agencies that send cadets for training. The budget assumes total funding of $5.2 million for eight basic law enforcement academies in fiscal year 2011 and nine academies in fiscal year 2012. Funding is reduced by $2.5 million for pass-through programs administered by WASPC. The reduction is partially backfilled with $1.7 million in funding from the Washington Auto Theft Prevention Account, for a net reduction of $803,000. $2.0 million is provided for grants to counties histori cally underserved by federally-funded narcotics task forces. Department of Health The Department of Health (DOH) has a total budget of $1.1 billion to provide educational and health care services, administer a variety of health care licensure programs, regulate drinking water and commercial shellfish production, respond to infectious disease outbreaks, support local public health jurisdictions, and operate the state's public health laboratory. In 2007, the Legislature increased funding to local pu blic health jurisdictions by $20 million based on the recommendation of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Health Care. The funding was accompanied by a mandate to define core public health functions and for local public health jurisdictions to report on outcomes. This program is reduced by $10 million in the 2011-13 biennium. Local public health jurisdictions will receive a total of $73.2 million in discretionary fund ing from DOH for the 2011-13 biennium. DOH provides family planning funding to a network of local providers throughout the state. These funds can be used for a variety of family planning activities and ser ve clients who earn 250 percent or less of the federal poverty level. Funding for these grants is reduced by 11.25 percent ($2.3 million Near General Fund-State). Employment Security Department The Employment Security Department has a total bu dget of $715 million to administer Washington's unemployment insurance system, operate the WorkSource system, operate the Washington Service Corps program, and conduct labor mark et and economic analysis. Savings of $33.2 million in state general fund are achieve d by delaying the implementation of the Family Leave Insurance Program by three years until October 2015, pursuant to Chapter 25, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (ESSB 5091). A total of $35.6 million in federal funds is provided for implementing the second phase of the new unemployment insurance tax information computer system, which w ill replace the current system that was originally implemented in 1984. 401 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Labor and Industries The Department of Labor and Industries has a total budge t of $638 million to administ er Washington's workers' compensation system, manage the occupational health and safety program, operate the crime victims' compensation program, and license and enforce safe building practices. Savings of $1.6 million in state general fund are achieve d by eliminating payment awards provided as permanent partial disability benefits and benefits for home and vehicle modifications given to victims of criminal acts pursuant to Chapter 346, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (SSB 5691). A total of $26.9 million in state industrial insurance funds are provided for implementing changes to the workers' compensation program pursuant to Chapter 37, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (EHB 2123). The legislation makes a number of changes including authorizing claim resolution st ructured settlement agreements for workers age 55 or older with a phase-in to younger workers over time. Savi ngs of $600 million in industrial insurance trust funds are assumed as well as $6 million in state general fund fro m reduced workers compensati on charges to the state. Department of Veterans' Affairs A total of $114.8 million total funds is provided for ve terans' services for soldiers and their families. The appropriated amount reflects a General Fund-State reduction of $245,000 to headquarters administration and a General Fund-State increase of $85,000 for updating information technology systems. The budget assumes an additional $660,000 in revenue generated by the impl ementation of Chapter 352, Laws of 2011 (SB 5806 - Veteran Lottery Raffle). Proceeds from a newly-created a nnual raffle will be used to provide support, including emergency financial assistance, for returning combat veterans through the Vetera ns' Innovation Program. 402 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Natural Resources Water Resources and Watershed Protection Puget Sound Cleanup and Restoration The sum of $18.0 million in federal funds are provided for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to protect and restore marine and nearshore habitats of Puget Sound. Funding provided by the U.S. EPA will be distributed to state and local partners through a competitive process to fund projects that improve the effectiveness of existing regulatory and stewardship programs, implement protection and restoration projects, prevent or reduce the threats posed by invasive species and oil spills, and address ecosystem problems. Additionally, the Puget Sound Partners hip is provided $1.9 million in federal expenditure authority for new grant awards. Specific work to be completed with these grants includes: tracking progress in implementing the Puget Sound Action Agenda; completing the 2011-13 Biennial Sc ience Work Plan and the 2012 Puget Sound Science Update; implementing the Puget Sound Monitoring Program; and providing grants to local organizations to carry out the Puget Sound Action Agenda at the local level. Furthermore, the Department of Ecology (DOE) partners with local governments to help businesses correct practices related to hazardous waste management, sp ill prevention, storm water pollution, and other environmental regulations. Approxima tely $2.0 million in state funds are provided to manage DOE's portion of these activities to support efforts to decrease toxins that en ter Puget Sound. Within the amount provided, ongoing grant funding of $1 million is provided from the Local T oxics Control Account to support local government staff in conducting hazardous waste and storm water technical assistance visits. Shoreline Master Program Updates Pursuant to a negotiated legal settleme nt in 2003, DOE and local governments are in the process of updating local shoreline master programs. Base operating funding is insufficient to complete Shoreline Master Program updates in time to meet statutory and legal settlement deadlines. DOE is provided $3.6 million in state funding to speed up completion of Shoreline Master Prog ram updates during the 2011-13 biennium. Watershed Planning and Water Resources Reduction Approximately $6.0 million in funding is reduced for wate rshed planning technical assistance and grants to local governments in DOE's Shorelands and Environmental Assi stance Program. This reduction represents nearly a 50 percent reduction to the Watershed Pl anning Program and will affect technical assistance and grants to local partners conducting work on the state' s Watershed Inventory Resource Areas. The sum of $2.5 million is reduced from DOE's Water Resources Program (WRP). Additionally, budget language directs $2.15 million of the state general fund appropriation for WRP to process the backlog of pending water right permit applications. The biennial statutory transfer of $4 million General Fund-State to the Flood Control Assistance Account is reduced by one-half. DOE will provide fewer grants to cities and counties for local flood control planning and maintenance. 403 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Pollution Mitigation and Abatement The sum of $1.5 million in state and federal funding is provi ded for DOE to reduce air pollution in areas at risk of becoming out of compliance with the U.S. EPA's air quality st andards. U.S. EPA is expected to adopt tougher air quality standards during the 2011-13 biennium. DOE anticipates that several areas of the state will be at risk for violating the new standards, including the greater Puge t Sound area, Yakima, Darrington, and potentially Spokane and Clark counties. Ongoing funding and staff are provi ded for DOE to identify sources that contribute to each community's pollution levels and develo p and implement strategies that will keep these areas in compliance with federal law. One-time state funding of $500,000 is provided for c ontinuing Attorney General services and expert-witness costs associated with the Pakootas et al. v. Teck Cominco, Ltd. case concerning a toxic cleanup site on the Upper Columbia River. DOE and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation are co-plaintiffs in this litigation. The case addresses the liability under federal law for cleanup and natural resource restoration costs at a smelter complex located in British Columbia, Canada. The sum of $463,000 in state funding is provided to impl ement Chapter 122, Laws of 2011 (E2SHB 1186), which requires DOE to engage in rulemaking to establish additi onal contingency planning and enhanced requirements to prevent oil spills from large ships, as well as to develop the formation of a vessels of opportunity system to be used as a volunteer coordination structure to enhance the state's ability to respond to an oil spill in navigable waters. Natural resource damages are increased for v essels discharging 1,000 or more gallons of oil. The legislation also provides for state notification of vessel em ergencies resulting in the discharge of oil or the threat of oil discharge. Land and Species Management Recreational Land Access Passes (Discover Pass and Day-Use Permits) Chapter 320, Laws of 2011 (2SSB 5622), creates the annua l Discover Pass and Day-Use Permit and requires these permits to be visible in any vehicle located at state r ecreational sites or recreation lands managed by the State Parks and Recreation Commission (Parks), WDFW, and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Proceeds from fees are expected to raise approximately $68 million per biennium to support the maintenance and operation of state recreational lands. This legislation was associat ed with state general fund savings of approximately $48 million due to the provision of $20 million to Parks to assist in the transition to reliance on fees from the sale of the Discover Pass and Day-Use Permits during the 2011-13 biennium. Hunting and Fishing License Fees Pursuant to Chapter 339, Laws of 2011 (SSB 5385), revenue in the State Wildlife Account is increased by making a variety of changes to licenses and endorsement fee sche dules. The revenue generated in this legislation, primarily by adjusting fishing and hunting fees, is estimat ed to increase revenue to the State Wildlife Account by $18 million and mitigate a projected shortfall of $10.5 milli on in the State Wildlife Account largely related to the expiration of a 10 percent surcharge on fishing and hunting licenses enacted during the 2009-11 biennium. Fire Suppression Funding Fire Suppression funding is reduced by $1.6 million Gene ral Fund-State. DNR will reduce discretionary fire training, freeze wages for exempt firefighters, and reorga nize administrative support positions in its fire control program. Other Reductions and Efficiencies The Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Litter Control A ccount funds litter prevention and pickup activity within DOE. Appropriation authority in this Account is redu ced by $7.0 million during the 2011-13 biennium, and this amount is transferred to the state general fund on a one-time basis. Remaining resources of approximately 404 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview $6.3 million will allow DOE to operate a scaled-back litter pickup program, maximizing the use of correctional crews. Savings of $3.0 million General Fund-State are realized by reductions to regulatory programs in DNR and WDFW: $2.0 million is reduced for DNR's Forest Practic es Program, which provides re gulatory information and permits for the harvest of timber; and $1.0 million is decreased for WDFW's Hydraulic Project Approval Program, which provides regulatory information and permits for constructi on activity that will use, divert, obstruct, or change the natural flow or bed of state waters. Approximately $2.7 million state general fund savings are achieved via the consolidation of administration activities, the assumption of collocation savings and e fficiencies, and reductions to executive management positions. These reductions affect the following natural resource agencies: DOE, Parks, WDFW, DNR, and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA). The sum of $1.5 million General Fund-State is reduced from the State Conservation Commission's budget: $400,000 for grants to conservation districts; and the remaining $1.1 million of this reduction will be achieved through savings related to vacant positions, service delivery to conservation districts, and reductions in information technology expenditures. In addition, existing staff will take one temporary layoff day each month for the 2011-13 biennium. Funding is eliminated for the WSDA's Domestic Marke ting Program, saving $911,000 General Fund-State. The Program assists farmers and food producers in identifyi ng and accessing new markets within the state and nation. Funding is reduced by 50 percent ($880,000) for the Climate Policy Group (CPG) in DOE. CPG works on the state integrated climate change response strategy, mainta ining scientific and technical information on the impacts of climate change in the state, developing greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies, and collaborating with national and regional organizations to a ddress issues related to climate change. 405 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Transportation The majority of the funding for transportation services is included in the transporta tion budget, not the omnibus appropriations act. For additional information on funding for these agencies and other transportation funding, see the Transportation section of the Legislative Budget No tes. The omnibus appropriations act only includes a portion of the total funding for the Washington Stat e Patrol (WSP) and the Department of Licensing. Washington State Patrol The budget reduces the general fund appropriation by $5.8 million. The savings are achieved through reductions in agency administration and staffing, reductions in funding for the Methamphetamine Response program and Special Weapons and Tactics program, among others. A total of $8 million state general fund is provided to WSP for costs related to fighting wildfires. An increase of $1.06 million in state funding is provided to WSP for increased costs of DNA analysis kits and testing. Department of Licensing Pursuant to Chapter 298, Laws of 2011 (SHB 2017), the admi nistration of the Master License Service Program is transferred from the Department of Licensing to the Department of Revenue (see Business Licensing Transfer under the Governmental Operations section for details). 406 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget Public Schools Summary Statistics on Total and Percentage Changes in the K-12 Budget 2009-11 2nd Supp Enacted 2011-13 Enacted Percent Near-General Fund-State: General Fund, Education Legacy Trust Account, and Pension Funding Stabilization Account. ** Total budgeted figures include a 1-day delay in a portion of the June general apportionment payment to school districts. This delay has the effect of reducing the budget by $128 million in fiscal year 2011, and increasing the budget by the same amount in fiscal year 2012. Maintenance & Carryforward Level Changes Enrollment, Workload, and Inflation State funding in the amount of $687 million is provided for pension rate increases, student enrollment increases, inflation of non-employee related costs, school bus replacement costs, and other workload adjustments projected for the 2011-13 biennium. Included in this cost is $428 million for the cost of adopting the pension rates recommended by the Pension Funding Council, $36 million for projected increases in school bus replacement costs, $16 million to cover reduced revenue offsets to ge neral apportionment due to the anticipated non-renewal of the federal Secure Rural Schools Act funding, $ 31 million for projected increases in teachers earning certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, among other small changes. Additional costs are incurred at maintenance level to cover the rising scoring and contractor costs of the state's assessment system ($53 million). As compared to the 201 0-11 school year enrollment, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) students is expected to increase by 6, 455 in the 2011-12 school year and 16,722 in the 2012-13 school year. In addition to maintenance-level changes, net increases of $276 million are funded for technical carryforward level adjustments. These changes include funding both y ears of ongoing increases that were made in 2009-11, increasing funding for enrollment and workload, and providing an additional $78 million for levy equalization for the increase in the base local levy lid from 24 percen t to 28 percent enacted by the 2010 Legislature. I-732 Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) Initiative 732 (I-732) requires an annual COLA increase for school employees based on the Seattle Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the prior calendar year. Based on the most recent CPI data, these COLA increases are estimated at 0.3 percent for the 2011-12 school year a nd 2.5 percent for the 2012-13 school year. Additionally, statute requires a catch-up COLA increase resulting fro m the I-732 suspension during the 2009-11 biennium. This requirement adds an additional 1.2 percent in each school year. Total maintenance-level costs associated with these requirements are $283 million for the 2011-13 bi ennium. These requirements are suspended in the final 2011-13 enacted budget. 407 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview I-728 Student Achievement Fund Allocations Initiative 728 (I-728), approved by voters in 2000 and later amended by the Legislature, allocates a per-student dollar amount to districts to be used for class-size redu ction, extended learning opportunities, early-learning programs, or professional development. If not suspended, per-student allocations woul d have been approximately $477 per student for the 2011-12 school year and $484 per student for the 2012-13 school year. The maintenance-level budget includes approximately $861 m illion to fulfill these requirements. These requirements are suspended in the final 2011-13 enacted budget. Policy Level Reductions Suspend I-728 Student Achievement Program Allocations I-728, approved by voters in 2000, allocates a per-stude nt dollar amount to districts to be used for class size reduction, extended learning opportun ities, early learning programs, or professional development. I-728 allocations to school districts are suspended for the 2011-13 biennium, resulting in General Fund-state budget reductions of $861 million. Plan 1 Uniform COLA Changes Public Employees' and Teachers' Retirement Systems Plan 1 (PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1) members benefits are no longer increased through the Uniform COLA above th e amount in effect on July 1, 2010, unless a retiree qualifies for the basic minimum benefit. Members of PER S Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 that qualify for the minimum benefit formulas in the plans will continue to receive the Uniform COLA. Within th e K-12 budget, the change decreases spending by $275 million. Suspend I-732 COLA I-732 requires an annual COLA increase for school empl oyees based on the Seattle CPI for the prior calendar year. The I-732 COLAs are suspended for the 2011-13 bienni um. In addition, the provision is eliminated that required catch-up funding from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015 for the 2009-11 COLA suspension, resulting in total state budget reductions of $266 million. 1.9 Percent Salary Reductions for Certificated Instructional & Classified Staff, and 3 Percent Reductions for Administrative Staff Allocations to school districts for K-12 employee salaries are reduced by 1.9 percent for certificated instructional and classified staff and 3.0 percent for administrative staff in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years, or a total state reduction of $179 million. Eliminate K-4 Class-Size Reduction Continuing the policy in Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, Pa rtial Veto (ESHB 1086), funding for the K-4 class size reduction is eliminated for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school y ears. The formula for allocating funding to districts is adjusted to reflect the following changes in average class sizes: gr ades Kindergarten through Grade 3 will become 25.23, up from 23.11; and Grade 4 will become 27, up from 26.15. This reflects minimum statutory funding levels in grades K-4 for general education st udents and reduces General Fund-state funding by $170 million. Separately, partial class-size reduction funding is restored for high-poverty schools (see below). National Board Bonus Changes Two changes are made to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) bonus program. Beginning in the 2011-12 school year, the Office of Supe rintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) must pay bonuses on July 1 of each school year, achieving a one-time savings in fiscal year 2012 of approximately $58 million. Additionally, first-year nati onal board bonuses will be prorated by a factor of 60 percent (a 40 percent reduction); to reflect the percentage of the school y ear newly NBPTS-certified teachers are certified. The proration produces a first year base bonus amount of $3,054 , and a first year high-poverty school bonus of $3,000. 408 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget With the exception of the first year proration, the $5,090 base bonus and $5,000 hi gh-poverty school bonus are fully funded in the 2011-13 biennium. National Board bon us changes result in General Fund-state savings of $61 million. Assessment System Changes State funding for student assessments is reduced by $51 million to reflect several changes: the implementation of modified graduation requirements in math and scien ce, reductions to assessment staffing, reductions in collections-of-evidence costs, and a shifting of diagnostic testing costs from state to federal sources. Chapter 22, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESHB 1410), requires students, starting with the class of 2015 rather than 2013, to meet the state standard on the high school sci ence assessment to earn a Certificate of Academic Achievement (CAA), which is required for graduation. It also establishes the Biology end-of-course (EOC) assessment as the high schoo l science assessment. Chapter 25, Laws of 2011 (HB 1412), allows students in the classes of 2013 and 2014 to pass one math EOC assessm ent (rather than two) for purposes of high school graduation and also specifies that retakes of the ma th assessment will be based on an EOC test, not a comprehensive math test. In addition to the savings resulting from ESHB 1410 and HB 1412, which total $37.3 million, the reductions also include $1.4 million in assessment staff reductions, $6.4 million in assessment contract cost savings, and $4.4 million from eliminating state allocations for diagnostic assessments funding. Included in the savings estimate for ESHB 1410 and HB 1412 are reductions to the pe r-test rates paid for collections-of-evidence (COE), as well the impact of limiting the state subsidy to one COE per student in each subject area. An additional savings of approximately $1 million is assumed by re stricting payment for collections, which do not meet minimum submission requirements. Alternative Learning Experience (ALE) Changes Funding is adjusted downward by $41 million to reflect the changes to ALE programs in Chapter 34, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESHB 2065). The ALE programs include online learning programs, as well as parent partnership and contract programs where most education occurs outsi de the traditional school setting in a more flexible, non- seat time based learning program. Funding is reduced, in ag gregate, by 15 percent for ALE programs. OSPI is tasked with determining the methodology for achieving the savings based on specific criteria established by ESHB 2065 and requires that no particular ALE program take less than a 10 percent reduction or more than a 20 percent reduction. Eliminate Maintenance, Supplies, and Operating Cost s (MSOC) from K-4 Class-Size Reduction Funding Continuing the policy in Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1086), funding is adjusted to eliminate that portion of MSOC funding for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school ye ars that is an enhancem ent above levels required by statute. The new K-12 funding formula adopted purs uant to Chapter 236, Laws of 2010, Partial Veto (SHB 2776), changed the allocation methodology for non-salary related items. In the prior formula, funding was allocated on a per-certificated staff unit basis. Beginning September 1, 2011, non-salary funding is allocated on a per-student basis. As a result of the new formula, $24 million of the funding for MSOC for 2011-13 is considered an enhancement to basic education, because it was previously allocated on the basis of non-basic education staff units, and is eliminated in the enacted budget. Reduce Food Service Funding Continuing the policy in Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, Pa rtial Veto (ESHB 1086), $6 million in state funds for the National School Lunch Program previously used to meet state matching requirements for federal funding are eliminated. School food-service programs in the education reform budget are transferred to the school food-services budget for the purpose of meeting the federal match requirements. 409 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Running Start Running Start is a dual-credit program that allows high sc hool juniors and seniors to attend class at institutions of higher education and earn high school and postsecondary cr edits simultaneously. The enrollment and funding rules for the Running Start Program are adjusted to establish a combined enrollment cap of 1.2 FTEs. Currently, students can participate in running start programs up to a combined enrollment cap of 2.0 FTEs, allowing full-time enrollment in running start programs, as well as fu ll-time high school enrollment. The budgeted savings of $6 million, General Fund-state, assumes an overall enrollment reduction of 680 student FTEs per year. Policy Level Enhancements K-3 Class Size in High Poverty Schools Funding is provided for lower class sizes in grades K- 3 in high-poverty schools. The funding amount of $34 million assumes class sizes of 24.1 in grades K-3 in schools that have free and reduced-price lunch eligible student populations exceeding 50 percent in the most recently completed school year. Implement New Funding Formula Implementation of the new prototypi cal school model has established new funding formulas for a number of programs, including General Apportionment, the Learning Assistance Program, the Highly Capable Program, and the Transitional Bilingual Program. State funding of $25 million is provided to hold districts harmless, in total, to per-student funding amounts resulting from these formula changes, after adjustments for staff mix, and other caseload factors. The policy calculates the hold harmless amount before considering new funding provided through inflationary increases to maintenance, supplies, and other operating costs, but after considering new funding provided through the K-3 class size enhancement in high poverty schools. Because of the high correlation of districts with large high-poverty school pop ulations and districts receiving hold harmless funding, the K-3 class size funding for high-poverty schools reduces hold harmless funding at approximately a 2:1 ratio. Full-Day Kindergarten Phase-In A total of $5 million, General Fund-state, is provided to continue phasing in full-day kindergarten programs in high-poverty schools. The funding supports approximately 21 percent of kindergarten enrollment in the 2011-12 school year, and 22 percent of kindergarten enrollment in the 2012-13 school year. This is calculated to add 265 total FTE students in the 2011-12 school year, and 835 students in the 2012-13 school year. The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction will phase in ne w schools within the limits of these additional student FTEs. Implement Transportation Cost Model Formula Chapter 236, Laws of 2010, Partial Veto (SHB 2776), im plements a new state formula to allocate funding to districts for pupil transportation to and from school. P upil transportation allocations are converted to the new formula, and base funding levels are enhanced by $5 m illion, in addition to maintenance-level increases for student enrollment and staff pension costs. Additionally, Chapter 27, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s., Partial Veto (ESSB 5919), modifies the pupil transportation funding formula to: include only statistically significant cost factors in the funding formula utilizing regression analysis; utilize state allocations for compensation rather than district actual expenditures; and clarify that the indirect cost rate referenced in the formul a is the federal restricted indirect rate. Information Technology K-12 Academy Funding of is provided for an Information Technology (IT) Academy Program, which provides free educational software, as well as IT certification and software traini ng opportunities for students and staff in public schools. The academy provides access to software licenses, and Web- based e-Learning and course materials. Topics range from computer basics to high-level programming, along with information and communications technology management. Students, as well as teachers and administrati on personnel, can use the training to get certified in a wide variety of IT areas, including Microsoft Office (which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access) as 410 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget well as advanced technical topics including programmi ng, network administration, web development, and database development. The funding amount of $4 million re presents the state match requirement for the program, which is the product of a public-private partnership. Pay for Actual Student Success (PASS) Act Program Funding in the amount of $3 million is provided to im plement the PASS Program established in Chapter 288, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (E2SHB 1599). The PASS Program establishes performa nce metrics for measuring extended graduation rates and promotes investment in four dropout prevention and intervention programs. Teacher and Principal Performance-Based Evaluation Pilots Funding in the amount of $3 million is provided to su pport district participation in the development and implementation of improved teacher and principal eval uation systems under reforms initiated in Chapter 235, Laws of 2010 (E2SSB 6696). Other June 2011 Apportionment The 2011-13 operating budget delays $128 million of the June 2011 apportionment payments to school districts from the last business day of June 2011 to the first business day of July 2011. Additionally, the 2011 supplemental budget also provides $13 milli on in financial contingency funding for districts that meet specific financial hardship criteria resulting from the June 2 011 apportionment shift. The 2011-13 biennial budget assumes repayment of this funding during fiscal year 2012. The net increase for the 2011-13 budget, combining the apportionment delay with the repayment of contingency funds, is $115 million. Various Reductions A total of $64 million in additional savings are realized through a variety of other budget reductions. The largest of these reductions and adjustments include continuation of policy reductions (such as elimination of K-4 class size enhancements) made in the 2010-11 school year for July and August of the 2012 fiscal year ($20.9 million), adjusting full day kindergarten allocations for reduced pe nsion and salary rates, increased class size, and other general apportionment factors ($8.4 million), projected savings from a teacher retirement incentive program offering $250 monthly stipends for health benefit costs ($7.2 million), elimination of math and science professional development grants ($3.9 million), reductions to the alterna tive route program ($3.2 million), and elimination of state funding for th e focused assistance program ($3.0 million), among other smaller changes. 2011 Session Bills The 2011-13 budget includes funding for the following bills (see table starting on the next page): 411 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview 2011 Session Bills Funded in Omnibus Appropriation Act Bill Number Chapter Law Funding in Millions Description 2SHB 1163 Chapter 185, Laws of 2011 0.112 Creates a workgroup on school bullying and harassment prevention to develop, recommend, and implement strategies to improve the school climate and create respectful learning environments. The bill also requires suicide prevention education to be included in health and fitness classes. ESSB 5919 Chapter 27, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s., PV -3.1 Makes several changes to K-12 funding formulas and amends requirements for two statewide programs. Clarifies that increases in instru ctional-hour minimum requirements will not occur prior to the 2014-15 school year. Makes changes or clarifications to the pupil transportation funding formula including requiring: the use of budgeted rather than actual salary and benefit growth in formula calculations; exclusion of statistically non-significant factors in the funding formula; the use of the federal restricted indirect rate as the designated indirect cost rate; and exclusion of in-lieu bus depreciation payments from prior year expenditures for contracting districts. Additionally, the bill amends bilingual funding formulas so the size of the per-student allocation may be scaled based on fluency level and need, with the intent of maintaining the overall program funding level. Finally, the bill provides that SPI is responsible for staffing Career & Technical Education (CTE) student organizations only to the extent that funds are available and sets the expiration date of the special services pilot program for March 1, 2011, instead of June 30, 2011. Savings include $284,000 by assuming that, in school year 2012-13, every bilingual student will be tested for proficiency and historical exit rates will apply; $2.7 million from expiration of the special services pilot; and $194,000 in staffing cost reductions for support of CTE student organizations. ESHB 1410 Chapter 22, Laws of 2011 1 st sp.s. -20.5 Requires students starting with the class of 2015, rather than 2013, to meet the state standard on the high school science assessment to earn a Certificate of Academic Achievement (CAA), which is required for graduation. Establishes the Biology end-of-course assessment (EOC) as the high school science assessment. Funding reduction primarily reflects reduction in test scoring costs and collections-of-evidence costs. HB 1412 Chapter 25, Laws of 2011 -16.8 Allows students in the classes of 2013 and 2014 to pass one math end-of-course assessment (rather than two) for purposes of high school graduation. Provides that retakes of the math assessment will be based on an EOC, not a comprehensive math test. Funding reduction primarily reflects reduction in test scoring costs and collections-of-evidence costs. SHB 1431 Chapter 192, Laws of 2011 0.166 Directs OSPI to convene the Educational Service Districts (ESDs) to conduct an analysis and recommend a clear legal framework and process for dissolution of a school district on the basis of financial insolvency. E2SHB 1599 Chapter 288, Laws of 2011, PV 3.0 Creates the PASS Program to invest in proven prevention programs and provide a financial award for high schools that demonstrate improvement in dropout reduction indicators. Directs OSPI to create a metric to measure improvement and assign a dropout prevention score. Specifies four programs for investment in dropout prevention and intervention, subject to funding. Partial Veto: the intent section was vetoed. Proviso language in budget prohibits use of funding in 2011-13 for funding awards based on dropout prevention. 2SSB 5427 Chapter 340, Laws of 2011 0. 900 Beginning 2012-13, to the extent funds are avai lable, requires state-funded full-day kindergarten programs to use the WAKIDS kindergarten readines s assessment. Authorizes OSPI to make the assessment available on a voluntary basis in 2011-12. Directs OSPI and the Department of Early Learning to ensure a fairness and bias revi ew has been conducted. Adds a waiver process for school districts. Funding amount assumes availability of private and federal funding. HB 1131 Chapter 17, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. -861 Suspends allocations to the Student Achievement Program during the 2011-13 biennium. Eliminates \"catch up\" provision that required additional allocations to make up for prior program suspensions. 2SHB 1132 Chapter 18, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. -265 Suspends cost of living salary adjustments to school districts for school district employees and certain higher education employees, as well as \"make-up\" adjustments from prior biennia. Suspends requirements for COLA for bonuses paid to staff earning certification from the NBPTS , among other smaller adjustments. 412 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget 2011 Session Bills Funded in Omnibus Appropriation Act Bill Number Chapter Law Funding in Millions Description ESHB 2065 Chapter 34, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. -41 Reduces funding for ALE programs by 15 percent, overall. OSPI is tasked with determining the methodology for achieving the savings and requires that no particular ALE program take less than a 10 percent reduction or more than a 20 percent reduction. Makes a variety of other programmatic changes. SHB 2021 Chapter 362, Laws of 2011 -275 PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 member benefits are no longer increased through the Uniform COLA above the amount in effect on July 1, 2010, unless a retiree qualifies for the basic minimum benefit. Note: This legislation is not limited to the K-12 budget and is additionally summarized in the compensation section of the budget notes, along with other global budget items. ESHB 1354 Chapter 4, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. -128 Enables a one-day delay in a portion of the June school apportionment funding payment to school districts. This has the effect of reducing fiscal year 2011 expenditures by $128 million and increasing fiscal year 2012 expenditures by the same amount. 413 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Higher Education Overview Overall, 2011-13 biennial state appropriations to the public colleges and universities are $658.5 million (23.6 percent) below the level appropriated in the 20 09-11 biennium. Approximate ly $376.4 million of this reduction will be offset by tuition increases. Revenue from tuition increases are assumed to be 16 percent per year at the University of Washington (UW), Washington State University (WSU), and Western Washington University (WWU); 14 percent each year at Central Washington University (CWU) and The Evergreen State College (TESC); 11 percent each year at Eastern Washingt on University (EWU); and 12 percent each year at the community and technical colleges. State supported four-year institutions were also provided full tuition setting authority beginning in the 2011-13 biennium through the 2017-19 biennium pursuant to Chapter 10, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s., Partial Veto (E2SHB 1795 - Higher Education Opportunity Act). In addition to resident undergraduate tu ition setting authority, this legislation requires institutions to negotiate a performance plan with the Office of Financial Management that, at a minimum, includes expected outcomes for time and credits to degree; retention and success of students from low- income, diverse, or underrepresented communities; baccalaureate degree production of resident students; and degree production in high-demand fields of study. Additionally, any four -year institution th at increases tuition beyond the levels assumed in the omnibu s appropriations act will be require d to mitigate any additional tuition increase, as prescribed in the legislation, for those students with incomes be low 125 percent of the median family income. Major Increases Maintain Financial Aid Policy Funding of $124.4 million is provided for the State Need Gr ant and State Work Study programs to offset the cost to recipients of resident undergraduate tuition incr eases of 16 percent each year at UW, WSU, and WWU; 14 percent each year at CWU and TESC; 11 percent at EWU; and 12 percent each year at the community and technical colleges. Worker Retraining A total of $9.0 million in funding is provided for an additional 970 worker retraining slots each year at community and technical colleges. Worker retraining programs provide financial aid and other support services to jobless workers who need to change careers in order to re-enter the workforce. Opportunity Scholarships Pursuant to Chapter 13, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s (ESHB 2088 - Opportunity Scholarship Board), a total of $5.0 million in state matching funds are provided to match private contributions to the Opportunity Scholarship Program, which provides scholarships to low- and middle-income students who pursue a four-year degree in a high-demand field of study. Washington/Wyoming/Alaska/Montana/Idaho (WWAMI) Medical Education Program A total of $900,000 is provided for development of integrated medical curriculum for the WWAMI Medical Education Program at UW and for expansion of the program at WSU. 414 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget Aerospace Training Scholarships and Loans A total of $500,000 is provided to implement a loan program for students in certain aerospace training or educational programs pursuant to Chapter 8, Laws of 2011 (ESHB 1846 - Aerospace Student Loans). Institutional Reductions A total of $535.5 million in savings will be achieved with general reductions to the institutions and an additional $82.1 million in savings will be realized as a result of a 3 percent salary reduction. These reductions will be partially offset by tuition increases of $376.4 million, for an overall net reduction of 5.1 percent. For additional information on the salary reductions, please see the Sp ecial Appropriations Section of this document. Financial Aid Reductions State Work Study A total of $31.0 million in funding for the State Work Study program is reduced by: 1) making permanent changes made during fiscal year 2011, including increasing the required employer share of wages and discontinuing non-resident student eligibility for the program; and 2) adjusting employer match rates and revising distribution methods to institutions by taking into consideration other factors such as off-campus job development, historical utiliza tion trends, and student need. State Need Grant A total of $16.7 million in funding for the State Need Grant program is reduced by: 1) aligning increases in awards given to private institutions with their average annual tuition increase experience of 3.5 percent each year, as opposed to increasing private institution award amounts at the same rate as for public institutions; and 2) reducing the awards given to for-profit institutions by 50 percent, although students currently receiving these awards will be held harmless for the length of their program. Additional Financial Aid Reductions State funds are reduced by $18.8 million for a variety of smaller financial aid programs administered by the Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB), including su spending new awards in the Washington Scholars and Washington Award for Vocational Excellence (WAVE) pr ograms; suspension of new awards from the health professionals and future teacher conditional scholarship pr ograms; elimination of the funds for the Educational Opportunity Grants pursuant to Chapter 215, Laws of 2009, Partial Veto (E2SHB 2021), which placed the eligibility of this program into the State Need Grant; and suspension of Community Scholarship Matching Grant Program, the Foster Care Endowed Scholarship, and student support fees provided via the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. Students who are curre ntly receiving awards through Washington Scholars, WAVE, the health professionals' conditional scholarship pr ogram, or the future teacher conditional scholarship program will not be impacted by this reduction. Other Reductions Community and Technical Colleges Efficiencies General fund savings of $7.5 million are achieved from various efficiencies implemented in the community and technical college system including: consolidation of college districts; consolidation of administrative and governance functions including, but not limited to, human resources, budget and accounting services, and president's offices; consolidation of student service functions including, but not limited to, financial aid services, student advising, and libraries; compensation reductions; and other administrative efficiencies including, but not limited to, greater use of telephone and vide o conferencing and reduced travel costs. 415 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Elimination of the Higher Education Coordinating Board Pursuant to Chapter 11, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s., Partial Veto (E2SSB 5182 - St udent Financial Assistance), in fiscal year 2013, the HECB is eliminated and replaced w ith two state agencies: the Council for Higher Education and the Office of Student Financial Assistance. Savings of $2.6 million in general fund are achieved as a result of eliminating, or shifting to other entities, a number of policy, planning, coordination, and research activities previously conducted by HECB. Life Transitions Program Funding is eliminated for the Displaced Homemaker pr ogram, also known as the Life Transitions Program, for a total savings of $824,000. This program is administered by the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges and assists individuals who are dealing with the challenges of re-entering the workforce after a divorce or the death or disability of a spouse or partner. 416 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget Other Education Department of Early Learning Savings of $3.0 million state general fund are achieved through the elimination of the Career and Wage Ladder program. The program contracted with approximately 55 ch ildcare centers in the state to provide increases in pay for employees, based on education and longevity. Funding for the Early Childhood Education and Assistan ce Program (ECEAP) is increased by $2.3 million. The increased funding is a result of a greater award in the federal Child Care and Development Fund Block Grant. Funding for home visiting services is increased by $3.9 million total funds ($1.3 million General Fund-State) is provided in the 2011-13 biennium. Funds are directed for deposit into the Home Visiting Services Account. The Medicaid Treatment Child Care program is transfe rred to the Department of Early Learning from the Department of Social and Health Services Children's Ad ministration. This is a transfer of $9.4 million ($5.0 million General Fund-State). Arts and Heritage Agencies Funding Shift All Near General Fund-State support for the operating expenses of the Arts Commission, the Washington State Historical Society, and the Eastern Washington State Hist orical Society are eliminated and supplanted with funds from the Washington State Heritage Center Account. Over $9.4 million in operating expenses for these agencies are supported by the fee revenue previously collected for the Heritage Center project, a facility in the planning stages of construction on the Capitol Campus that would h ouse the State Library and Archives. The redistribution of funds is one-time and ongoing fee revenue rema ins dedicated to the Heritage Center project. 417 2011-13 Operating Budget Overview Special Appropriations Employee compensation related changes are displayed in individual agency budgets, including the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the institutions of higher education. Special Appropriations (Non-Compensation Related Items) Central Services Efficiencies The Department of Enterprise Services, created in Chapter 43, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. Partial Veto (ESSB 5931), will achieve $1.9 million in state general fund savings by more efficiently delivering services. Savings may be generated from eliminating under-utilized services, reviewing rates charged to agencies, eliminating or merging duplicated services, procuring services differently, includi ng contracting for services, and other efficiency measures. Workers Compensation Savings of $6 million state general fund are achie ved pursuant to Chapter 37, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (EHB 2123). The legislation makes a number of changes including authorizing claim resolution structured settlement agreements for workers age 55 or older with a phase in to younger workers over time. The state general fund savings are from reduced workers compensation charges to the state. Special Appropriations (C ompensation Related Items) Health Care Authority K-12 Health Benefits Consolidated Purchasing Implementation Plan Funding of $1.2 million is provided to the Health Care Au thority (HCA). HCA must develop a plan to implement a consolidated health benefits system for K-12 empl oyees for the 2013-14 school year. HCA is required to deliver a report to the Legislature by December 15, 2011, that sets forth the implementation plan. The report prepared by HCA shall include a comparison of the costs and benefits, both long and s hort term, of the current K- 12 health benefits system, the creation of a new K-12 em ployee benefits pool, and the prospect of enrolling K-12 employees into the health benefits pool for state employees. State Employee Compensation Average Final Salary Adjustme nts for Retiring Employees Funding of $0.7 million state general fund and $0.6 million in other funds is provided fo r the pension rate impacts from adjusting Average Final Compensation for state or local government employee members of the state retirement systems who have reduced compensation duri ng the 2011-13 biennium due to reduced work hours, mandatory leave without pay, temporary layoffs, or salary reductions that affect pension benefit calculations and would otherwise have reduced benefits, pur suant to Chapter 5, Laws of 2011, 1st sp.s. (HB 2070). Additional funding for the impact on state-funded employees in the K-12 system is included in school district allocations. Eliminate Future Plan 1 Annual Increases Savings are assumed from changes pursuant to Chapter 362, Laws of 2011 (SHB 2021). The Public Employees' Retirement System Plan 1 and the Teachers' Retirement System Plan 1 (PERS and TRS Plans 1) annual increase amount, commonly referred to as the \"Uniform COLA\" was created in 1995 and is an automatic, annual, service- based adjustment paid every July 1. 418 2011\u00036XSSOHPHQWDO\u00032SHrating Budget The annual increase amount is payable o n the first calendar year in which the recipient turns age 66 and has been retired for one year. The annual increase amount is not a percentage increase but instead is a fixed dollar amount multiplied by the member's total years of service. The do llar amount of the annual increase is currently $1.88 and increases by 3 percent every year on July 1. For a me mber with 30 years of service, this would have most recently increased the member's benefit by $56.40 per month. Statute specifies that members and retirees do not have a contractual right to future annual increases. Savings are achieved by ending future automatic benefit increases in the PERS and TRS Plans 1 consistent with the passage of Chapter 362, Laws of 2011 (SHB 2021). The basic minimum benefit amount in the plans continues to be increased by the annu al increase amount, and the alternative minimum benefit is raised to $1,500 per month. The unfunded accrued actuarial liability in PERS and TRS Plans 1 is reduced by about $4 billion. 3 Percent Salary Reduction for State Employees Savings of $175.8 million state genera l fund and $85.4 million in other funds are achieved as a result of a 3 percent cost savings in employee salaries, excluding several groups of employees including: those earning less than $2,500 per month; certain employees of the Washi ngton State Patrol and the Washington State Department of Transportation; and others, consistent with Chapter 39, Laws of 2011, 1 st sp.s. (ESSB 5860). The reduction is temporary through the 2011-13 biennium only. The reductions will be implemented c onsistent with collective bargaining agreements ratified for the 2011-13 biennium, or for represented groups that are considered for fiscal year 2012 to be in the \"tail\" or continuing year of a 2009-11 collective bargaining agreement, the reduction will be implemented according to the terms and conditions of the 2009-11 agreements. Employees subject to the 3.0 percent reduction in salary and otherwise eligible for leave will receive temporary salary reduction leave of up to 5.2 hours per month. For fiscal year 2013, funding levels in agency budgets ar e reduced to reflect a 3.0 percent temporary reduction for all salary expenditures not exempted by ESSB 5860. State institutions of higher education are similarly required to implement compensation reductions equivalent to the 3 percent reduction amounts referenced in the omnibus appropriations act. Management Efficiencies Savings of $14.2 million state general fund are achieve d based on management efficiencies. Agencies are required to implement management and administrative re forms, such as de-layering and streamlining of support functions that will result in increased efficiency and redu ce agency expenditures. For most agencies, management reductions of 7 to 10 percent are expected to be achie ved over the course of the biennium. State agencies can anticipate continuous legislative policy and fiscal committ ee examination of the architecture and cost of the state's career and executive workforce and shall be prepared to provide relevant information in hearings and work sessions. 419 2011-13 Operating Budget OverviewWashington State Omnibus Operating Budget 2011 Supplemental Budget TOTAL STATE (Dollars in Thousands) Near General Fund-Sta te Total All Funds 2009-11 2011 Supp * Rev 60,082,507 * Includes Omnibus Operating Budget appropriations enacted in December 2010 and from the 2011 legislative session -- Chapter 1 , Laws of 2010, 2nd sp.s.

Of the 421 projects paid for by the 2003 Transportation ( Nickel ) and Transportation Partnership Account (TPA) revenue, almost 300 have been completed. The sum of $4.1 billion is provided in the 2011-13 biennial budget for all highway improvements, including the continued implementation of these projects started by the 2003 and 2005 Legislatures. Additionally, substantial investments are made to preserve and maintain the state's highway system ($1.1 billion). The transportation budget also makes sig nificant investments in passenger rail ($426 million), ferry terminal and vessel projects ($283 million), freight mobility and rail projects ($38 million), and transit and bike/pedestrian grant programs ($110 million). Transportation revenue sources have continued to grow more slowly than expected, with projected revenues for the 2011-13 biennium $100 million less than what was assumed a year ago (a roughly 2 percent decrease). For the 10-year outlook, the revenue forecast changes resulted in a downward correction of about $860 million (about 4 percent ) over a 10-year period with respect to state revenues. I n combination with changes in assumptions about the utilization of federal funding, the cost to deliver Nickel and TPA projects, and the need to issue bonds, the forecast changes increased the gap over a 10-year period between expected resources and outlays by another $600 million (on top of the known $1.1 billion at the end of the 2010 session) to a to tal gap of about $1.7 billion. Accountability Measures With the completion of the Nickel and TPA construction programs in sight and the continuing erosion of underlying transportation revenues, the transportation budget emphasizes accoun tability and efficiency measures. State transportation agencies are directed to reduce administrative and overhead costs and seek new means of partnering with the private sector to deliver public services. The state will need to demonstrate that current resources are well managed before new revenues may be raised for future investments. Increased Partnerships with the Private Sector The transportation budget directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to transition to a smaller, more efficient technical and engineering workforce. DOT will reduce its workforce levels by 400 full -time equivalent (FTE) employees by the end of the 2011-13 biennium, with an eventual reduction of 800 FTEs. The Joint Transportation Committee will conduct a study to evaluate the potential for financing state transportation projects using innovative financing methods, including public private partnerships. The study will evaluate whether public private partnerships are in the public interest, including the effects of private versus public financing on the state's bonding capacity. Ferry System Accountability At the bargaining table, Washington State Ferr ies (WSF) management and labor successfully reached an agreement to bring marine employee benefits more in line with represented general government employee benefits. These efforts are estimated to save $10 million per year. In addition, labor representa tives have committed to starting these savings during the 2009-11 biennium, saving the system an additional estimated $500,000. Reductions in headquarters and administrative activities will save an additional $4.1 million. All in 2011-13 Transportation Budget Overview 432all, savings in the ferry system budget total almost $25 million but are not sufficient to balance the operating account for the next biennium. As a result, $90 million will have to be transferred from other transportation accounts to ensure continuous, sustainable service. In addition to the WSF budget changes, the Marine Employees Commission will be consolidated into the Public Employee Relations Commission resulting in $400,000 savings to the transportation budget. Reductions in Transportation Budgets To help close the t ransportation deficit, transportation agencies are asked to trim ongoing daily operations. This initiative will achieve $25.8 million in biennial budget savings. Efficiencies in contracted services for Tacoma Narrows Bridge tolling operations will save an estimated $4.5 million. Effective February 2011, a new statewide Customer Service Center (CSC) opened to replace the existing CSC. Costs for this contract will be allocated among the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (TNB), State Route (SR) 167, and the SR 520 Br idge. Consistent with policies enacted in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, a temporary 3 percent reduction in salaries is expected to save $17.9 million for the 2011-13 biennium, and $13.6 million will be saved by suspending the cost- of-living allowances f or members of the Plan 1 retirement systems. The Amtrak Cascades passenger rail service, a service sponsored by the state, expects $7.5 million in Amtrak credit savings during the 2011 -13 biennium. Operating Investments in Transportation in the 2011-13 B iennium The transportation operating budget for the 2011-13 biennium includes expenditure authority of $3.2 billion, an increase of about $300 million from the enacted 2009-11 biennial budget as amended in 2010. Investments in Information Technology and Equipment The amount of $7.4 million is provided through short- term financing (certificates of participation [COPs ]) for an online fuel tax collection system. The Department of Licensing collects fuel tax revenue of over $1.2 billion a year. The current system requires labor -intensive manual processes and results in an estimated loss of revenue of $3 million to $6 million a year. In addition to increased revenue, a new system will provide customer benefits such as electronic filing and improved quality and availability of information. The elimination of paperwork processing is expected to eliminate the need for 10 FTEs and provide savings in processing costs beginning in fiscal year 2014 . The $10.8 million Enterprise Time Keeping system will support WSF 's ability to manage employee time, leave, and benefit usage, an important tool in the effort to respond to criticism of the ferry system's ability to manage its own employees. The system will replace existing personnel and payroll systems at DOT . The Washington State Patrol's (WSP) Mobile Office Platform is funded at $7.3 million through COPs. When fully implemented, all highway system troopers will have computer access in their patrol cars, allowing queries to the electronic driver and vehicle da tabases. The troopers will also have access to digital cameras to record video evidence. These tools will increase officer efficiency and data accuracy, officer and public safety, and liability mitigation. For WSP, the transportation budget fully funds the equipment, infrastructure, and systems integration costs related to complying with the Federal Communications Commission's narrowbanding requirements. The investment will allow WSP to maintain continuity of radio coverage upon the change on January 1, 2013. In all, $40.1 million is provided through COPs. 433 The above four projects will be completed during the 2011- 13 timeframe. Multimodal Investments The transportation budget includes continued support of the Regional Mobility Grant program at $40 million. The Regional Mobility Grant program supports local efforts to improve transit mobility and reduce congestion on our most heavily traveled roadways. Eligible agencies include transit agencies (including Sound Transit), cities, and counties. The ne xt cycle of these grants will focus on construction projects that achieve the interconnectivity goals of the state program. Rural Mobility grants are continued at $17 million. Half of this funding is distributed to transit systems to address sales tax collections disparity. The other half is awarded on a competitive basis to providers of rural mobility service in areas not served or underserved by transit agencies. For 2011-13, the vanpool program will receive $6 million to purchase 288 vans, of which 20 will be dedicated for use in the Joint Base Lewis -McChord corridor. During its first six years, the statewide vanpool program has doubled the number of vanpools in our state. With the economic downturn, the focus of the program is turning to replacement vans. For the Safe Routes to School and Pedestrian/Bike Safety grant programs, $11 million in state funding is provided for new projects. Washington's Safe Routes to School program provides technical assistance and resources to cities, counties, scho ols, school districts, and state agencies for improvements that get more children walking and bicycling to school safely. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety program objective is to improve the transportation system to enhance safety and mobility for people who choose to walk or bike. Other Investment Priorities The budget provides direction to restore ferry service that has been proposed for reduction. The restoration, expected in the next supplemental budget, would occur through a shift of funds that would otherwise be used to begin work on a second 144- car class vessel. To address the emerging issue of congestion in the region of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the transportation budget includes $630,000 for a couple of initiatives in addition to the afor ementioned vanpools. First, DOT will collaborate with the affected transportation planning organizations and transit agencies to develop a plan to reduce vehicle demand and increase public transportation options. Also, to reduce collisions and travel del ays, DOT will complete the ramp -metering project at on -ramps in the northbound direction of Interstate 5 in the Joint Base area. For stormwater permit compliance, the transportation budget provides $10.2 million. DOT's February 2009 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit expands coverage to more than 100 cities and counties across the state, increasing the number of regulated state highway centerline miles by 40 percent from 1,140 to 1,600. The new permit establishes 51 specific performance indicators and 396 specific compliance actions. An additional $6.9 million is invested in the highway maintenance backlog, building on the previous bienni um's commitment to the stewardship of the state's roadways, for a total of $22.7 million . The backlog was estimated in 2008 to be approximately $85 million. Almost $64 million is provided for increased fuel costs at WSP , the ferry system, and for the maintenance program at DOT. The ferry system is exempted from bio -fuel usage for the 2011-13 biennium. 2011-13 Transportation Budget Overview 434Capital Construction Investments in Transportation in the 2011- 13 Biennium During the 2011-13 biennium, the transportation budget will invest $5.9 billion in transportation capital construction (highways, rail, and ferries). Within this amount, just over $2 billion is provided to address the safety issues posed by the SR 520 Bridge and the SR 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct. The remaining funds will ensure busy 2011 and 2012 summer construction seasons all around the state. Higher Speed Rail Washington State continues to attract federal funds for its higher speed rail program. In addition to the $590 million in federal funds awarded in 2010, Washington State won $145 million from funds given back by Ohio and Wisconsin. With these funds, the Amtrak Cascades program will be able to add service, reduce delays, and increase on -time performance by improving track quality and reliability. These investments come at a time when rail ridership is at its highest levels in the 16 years the program has been in existence. Freight Mobility and Rail Investments The transportation budget continues support of the strategic investments in projects identified by the Freight Mobility and Strategic Investment Board (FMSIB). About $38 million is provided for this purpose. For the 2011-13 biennium, the transportation budget continues support of the Freight Rail Investment Bank Loan program ($5.8 million) and the Freight Rail Assistance grant program ($2.75 million). Both programs seek to improve the freight rail system in the state, and projects must benefit the state's interests. Ferries The transportation budget provides sufficient funding to begin construction of a 144-car vessel with $124 million in 2011-13. In addition, WSF will take delivery of the last of three new Kwa- di Tabil class ferries, the MV Kennewick, in January 2012. The sum of $32 m illion is included in the transportation budget for the completion of this vessel. Highway Construction The transportation budget reflects the apex of the construction of investments under the Nickel and TPA packages enacted in 2003 and 2005, respectivel y. On the improvements side, over $4.1 billion is provided, addressing both minor and major investment priorities, such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement and the North Spokane Corridor development. For preservation activities, the transportation budget includes over $750 million. These include asphalt and chip seal road overlays, bridge repair to address seismic and scour issues, concrete roadways preservation, spot intersection improvements to address safety issues, emergency slides and floods, guardrail retrofit, and many other aspects of necessary, ongoing preservation work. 4352011-13 Transportation Budget Chapter 367, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1175) Total Appropriated Funds (Dollars in Thousands) COMPONENTS BY FUND TYPE Total Operating and Capital Budget Federal 14.3%Local 0.9%Federal ARRA 3.9% Bonds 34.1% 2011-13 Transportation Budget Overview 4362011-13 Transportation Budget Chapter 367, Laws of 2011, Partial Veto (ESHB 1175) Total Appropriated Funds (Dollars in Thousands) MAJOR COMPONENTS BY FUND SOURCE AND TYPE Total Operating and Capital Budget SR 520 - T 10.9%HWY Bnd - S 10.2%MVF - S 9.7%TranPar - S S 5.2% S - S 2.0% HSF - S 1.7% Other Appropriated Funds 13.0% Major Fund Source Transportation Partnership Account - Bonds (TranPar - T) 1,427,696 Motor Vehicle Account - Federal (MVF - F) 1,113,832 SR 520 Corridor Account - Bonds (SR 520 - T) 987,717 Highway Bond Retirement Account - State (HWY Bnd - S) 920,560 Motor Vehicle Account - State (MVF - S) 878,432 Transportation Partnership Account - State (TranPar - S) 621,814 Puget Sound Ferry Operations Acct - State (PSFOA - S) 468,226 Transportation 2003 Acct (Nickel) - Bonds (Nickel - T) 443,148 State Patrol Highway Account - State (SPHA - S) 350,387 Multimodal Transportation Account (Multmd - 8) 311,845 Transportation Improvement Account - State (Trn Imp - S) 182,560 Highway Safety Account - State (HSF - S) 149,171 Other Appropriated Funds 1,172,024 Total 9,027,412Tran Par - S 21.4% MVF - F 12.3% 4372011-13 Washington State Transportation Budget Fund Summary TOTAL OPERATING AND CAPITAL BUDGET (Dollars in Thousands) P.S.

(ESHB 2020). ESHB 1497 appropriated $1.7 billion to support new capital projects from sources other than bond proceeds. ESHB 2020 appropriated $1.1 billion in new state general obligation bonds and a uthorized the State Finance Committee to issue general obligation bonds to support the new bond appropriations. Net reductions in the 2011 Supplemental Budget totaled $33.5 million for 2009-11 new appropriations and $16.7 million for reappropriations for prior biennia. General state revenues are increased due to passage of Chapter 334, Laws of 2011 (HB 2019). This bill eliminated the statutory dedication of the $0.60 per pack cigarette tax that was previously deposited in the Education Legacy Trust Account. Beginning on July 1, 2010, revenues from the cigarette tax are deposited in the state general fund, re sulting in an increase to general state revenues. In addition, general state revenues in fiscal year 2011 only are increased by the amount of Public Works Assistance Account tax revenue that was transferred to the state general fund in the 2009 -11 Operating Budget. These changes expand debt capacity but do not affect the operating budget near general fund balance sheet. The Legislature assumed an 8.75 percent working debt limit to avoid the possibility of exceeding the 9 percent constitutional debt limit in the event that general state revenues decline or interest rates rise, and to leave capacity to address emergencies and unforeseen circumstances. Public School Construction A total of $661.3 million is appropriated for K-12 School Construction Assistance grants from the following sources: $345.8 million from state general obligation bonds and $315.6 million from the Common School Construction Account (CSCA).

For the 2011 -13 biennium, the following amounts are expected to be deposited into CSCA to support the 2011-13 appropriations: $135.3 million from state trust land revenues; $53.2 million from the Trust Land Transfer Program; and $600,000 in federal revenue. Investment income from the common school permanent fund into the account is mostly offset by debt service payments on skills center bonds appropriated in prior biennia. A total of $39.9 million is appropriated for projects at the state's vocational skills centers including: $28.5 million for t he Yakima Valley Technical Skills Center; $7.1 million for the Pierce County Skills Center; $3 million for Skills Center minor works projects statewide; $1.2 million for the Tri -Tech Skills Center in Walla Walla; and $100,000 for the Clark County Skills Center addition. Funding in the amount of $20 million is provided for energy efficiency improvements in K 12 public schools. School districts may apply to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for energy efficiency project grants that lead to energy and operational cost savings. Additionally, $5 million is provided for urgent school facility repair and renovation grants to address unforeseen health and safety needs. Higher Education The 2011-13 Capital Budget includes $512.9 million in total funds for higher education, including $290.7 million in state bonds.

Prison Bed Expansion and Maple Lane School Closure The Legislature appropriated $42.5 million to construct two housing units and a kitchen expansion at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla and $6. 2 million to design a new Westside reception center. The Department of Social and Health Services is appropriated $1.34 million in the 2011 Supplemental Budget to complete design and planning to provide capacity as a result of the closure of Maple Lane School.

The funds will be used, respectively, to purchase 50 -year conservation easements along riparian areas from family forest landowners and to repair or remove fish passage barriers on forest road crossings over streams. The sum of $3.2 million is provided to the State Conservation Commission and conservation districts to assist agricultural landowners with installation and maintenance of riparian buffers under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and with planning and implementation of livestock nutrient management practices. These state dollars leverage federal investments; for example, the federal government pays for 90 percent of the project costs under CREP , and once the installation beco mes established, compensates the landowner for 15 years for taking land out of production. Local Government Infrastructure Funding is provided to assist local governments in repairing and developing infrastructure systems. Funding of $324.6 million is provided for loans through the Public Works Board (PWB) to finance the construction, repair, and rehabilitation of local infrastructure systems such as water, storm and sanitary sewers, roads, streets and bridges, and solid waste.
