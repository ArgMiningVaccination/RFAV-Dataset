To see the cycle of seasons - the frozen ground of winter giving way to the optimism of spring and the abundance of summer - is to know true balance. Naturopathic Medicine assumes the same opportunity for balance exists in us and that the human body has the ability and intrinsic desire to heal itself under the right circumstances. Unfortunately, many of us bombard our bodies every day with a blend of toxic substances or behaviors. Unhealthy substances may be in the food we eat, or in the air we breathe. Sometimes the stress and emotional imbalances that are the byproduct of busy lives become our toxins. As Naturopathic Doctors, we begin to reconcile these two states of being - the fundamental potential of our body to repair itself, and the stressors to which we are subjected. We create a plan for better health that gives the body's natural functions the ability to perform as they are designed. Naturopathic physicians hold true to the time-honored oath that doctors should, above all else, do no harm. For that reason, we seek the least invasive treatment plan possible, opting for science-based natural approaches over pharmacological agents or surgery. We believe that treatments should be holistic and take your body make-up, personality and beliefs into account. Our doctors embrace the role of teachers who will guide you toward better health through your personalized program. When you are informed, you can make proactive decisions that positively impact your wellness today and have far-reaching implications for your vitality tomorrow. Ideally, the most effective way to help our patients is through Preventive Medicine, which identifies nutrition and lifestyle components that can be changed in the present. We understand that people come to our practice with varying levels of health and wellness, and we are prepared to meet you where you are and help you get to where you want to be. We can serve as your primary care physicians, or in consultation with your current healthcare team to make sure you are doing all you can to achieve your goals, receiving balanced, science-based guidance.
