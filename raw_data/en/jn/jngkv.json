INTRODUCTION 1.1 Objective This guideline is intended to aid in planning pharmacovigilance activities, especially in preparation for the early postmarketing period of a new drug (in this guideline, the term \"drug\" denotes chemical entities, biotechno logy-derived products, and vaccines). The main focus of this guideline is on a Safety Specification and Pharmacovigilance Plan that might be submitted at the time of licence application. The guideline can be used by sponsors to develop a stand-alone document fo r regions that prefer this approach or to provide guidance on incorporation of elem ents of the Safety Specification and Pharmacovigilance Plan into the Common Technical Document (CTD). The guideline describes a method for summarising the important identified risks of a drug, important potential risks, and impo rtant missing information, including the potentially at-risk populations and situations where the product is likely to be used that have not been studied pre-approval. It prop oses a structure for a Pharmacovigilance Plan and sets out principles of good practice for the design and conduct of observational studies. It does not describe other methods to reduce risks from drugs, such as risk communication. The guideline takes into consid eration ongoing work in the three regions and beyond on these issues. This guideline does not cover the entire scop e of pharmacovigilance. It uses the WHO definition of the term 'pharmacovigilance' as \"the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prev ention of adverse effects or any other drug related problems.\" This definition encompasses the use of pharmacoepidemiological studies. 1.2 Background The decision to approve a drug is based on its having a satisfactory balance of benefits and risks within the conditions specified in the product labeling. This decision is based on the information available at the time of approval. The knowledge related to the safety profile of the product can change over time through expanded use in terms of patient characteristics and the number of patients exposed. In particular, during the early postmarketing period the product might be used in settings different from clinical trials and a much larger population might be ex posed in a relatively short timeframe. Once a product is marketed, new informat ion will be generated, which can have an impact on the benefits or risks of the product; evaluation of this information should be a continuing process, in consultation with regulatory authorities. Detailed evaluation of the information generated through pharmacovi gilance activities is important for all products to ensure their safe use. The bene fit-risk balance can be improved by reducing risks to patients through effective pharmacovigilance that can enable information feedback to the users of medicines in a timely manner. Industry and regulators have identified th e need for better and earlier planning of pharmacovigilance activities before a product is approved or a license is granted. This ICH guideline has been developed to encourage harmonisation and consistency, to prevent duplication of effort, and could be of benefit to public health programs throughout the world as they cons ider new drugs in their countries. Pharmacovigilance Planning 2 1.3 Scope The guideline could be most useful for ne w chemical entities, biotechnology-derived products, and vaccines, as well as for signific ant changes in established products (e.g., new dosage form, new route of administration, or new manufacturing process for a biotechnologically-derived product) and fo r established products that are to be introduced to new populations or in significant new indications or where a new major safety concern has arisen. The purpose of this guideline is to propose a structure for a Pharmacovigilance Plan, and a Safety Specification that summarises the id entified and potential risks of the product to be addressed in the Plan. The guidelin e is divided into the following sections: Safety Specification; Pharmacovigilance Plan; Annex - Pharmacovigilance Methods. It is recommended that company pharmacovigilance experts get involved early in product development. Planning and dialogue with regulators should also start long before license application. A Safety Specification and Pharmacovigilance Plan can also be developed for products already on the ma rket (e.g., new indication or major new safety concern). The Plan could be used as the basis for discussion of pharmacovigilance activities with regulators in the different ICH regions and beyond. For products with important identified risk s, important potential risks or important missing information, the Pharmacovigilance Plan should include additional actions designed to address these concerns. For pr oducts for which no special concerns have arisen, routine pharmacovigilance as describe d in section 3.1.2 should be sufficient for post-approval safety monitoring, without the need for additional actions (e.g., safety studies). During the course of implementing the vari ous components of the Plan, any important emerging benefit or risk information should be discussed and used to revise the Plan. The following principles underpin this guideline: Planning of pharmacovigilance activities throughout the product life-cycle; Science-based approach to risk documentation; Effective collaboration between regulators and industry; Applicability of the Pharmacovigilance Plan across the three ICH regions. 2. SAFETY SPECIFICATION The Safety Specification should be a summary of the important identi fied risks of a drug, important potential risks, and important missing information. It should also address the populations potentially at-risk (where the product is likely to be used), and outstanding safety questions which warrant further investigation to refine understanding of the benefit-risk profile during the post-approva l period. This Safety Specification is intended to help industry and regulators id entify any need for specific data collection and also to facilitate the construction of the Pharmacovigilance Plan. The Safety Specification can be built initially during the pre-marketing phase and, at the time Pharmacovigilance Planning 3 approval is sought, it should reflect the stat us of issues that were being followed during development. The Common Technical Document (CTD), especially the Overview of Safety [2.5.5], Benefits and Risks Conclusions [2.5.6], and the Summary of Clinical Safety [2.7.4] sections, includes information relating to the safety of the product, and should be the basis of the safety issues identified in the Safety Specification. Sponsors should support the Safety Specification with references to specific pages of the CTD or other relevant documents. The Safety Specification c an be a stand-alone document, usually in conjunction with the Pharmacovigilance Plan, but elements can also be incorporated into the CTD. The length of the document will generally depend on the product and its development program. Appendices can be added if it is considered important to provide a more detailed explanation of important risks or analyses. 2.1 Elements of the Specification It is recommended that sponsors follow the structure of elements provided below when compiling the Safety Specification. The elemen ts of the Safety Specification that are included are only a guide. The Safety Spec ification can include additional elements, depending on the nature of the product and its development program. Conversely, for products already on the market with emerging new safety concerns, only a subset of the elements might be relevant. The focus of the Safety Specification should be on the identified risks, important potential risks, and important missing inform ation. The following elements should be considered for inclusion. 2.1.1 Non-Clinical Within the Specification, this section should present non-clinical safety findings that have not been adequately addressed by clinical data, for example: Toxicity (including repeat-dose toxicity , etc.); Drug interactions; Other toxicity-related information or data. If the product is intended for use in special populations, consideration should be given to whether specific non-clinical data needs exist. 2.1.2 Clinical a. Limitations of the Human Safety Database Limitations of the safety database (e.g., related to the size of the study population, study inclusion/exclusion criteria) should be considered, and the implications of such limitations with respect to predicting the safety of the product in the marketplace should be explicitly discussed. Particular reference should be made to populations likely to be exposed during the intended or expected use of the product in medical practice. Pharmacovigilance Planning 4 The world-wide experience should be briefly discussed, including: The extent of the world-wide exposure; Any new or different safety issues identified; Any regulatory actions related to safety. b. Populations not Studied in the Pre-Approval Phase The Specification should discuss which popu lations have not been studied or have only been studied to a limited degree in the pre-appr oval phase. The implications of this with respect to predicting the safety of the prod uct in the marketplace should be explicitly discussed (CTD 2.5.5). Populations to be considered should include (but might not be limited to): Children; The elderly; Pregnant or lactating women; Patients with relevant co-morbidity such as hepatic or renal disorders; Patients with disease severity different from that studied in clinical trials; Sub-populations carrying known and relevant genetic polymorphism; Patients of different racial and/or ethnic origins. c. Adverse Events (AEs) / Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) This section should list the important identifi ed and potential risks that require further characterisation or evaluation. Specific refere nces should be made to guide a reviewer to where clinical safety data are presented (e.g., relevant sections of the CTD 2.5.5 and 2.7.4). Discussion of risk factors and potential mechanisms that apply to identified AEs/ADRs should draw on information from any part of the CTD (non-clinical and clinical) and other relevant information, such as other dr ug labels, scientific literature, and post- marketing experience. Identified risks that require further evaluation More detailed information should be incl uded on the most important identified AEs/ADRs, which would include those that are serious or frequent and that also might have an impact on the balance of benefits and risks of the product. This information should include evidence bearing on a caus al relationship, severity, seriousness, frequency, reversibility and at-risk groups, if available. Risk factors and potential mechanisms should be discussed. These AEs/ADRs should usually call for further evaluation as part of the Pharmacovigilance Pl an (e.g., frequency in normal conditions of use, severity, outcome, at-risk groups, etc.). Potential risks that require further evaluation Important potential risks should be described in this section. The evidence that led to the conclusion that there was a potential risk should be presented. It is anticipated that for any important potential risk, there should be further evaluation to characterise the association. Pharmacovigilance Planning 5 d. Identified and Potential Interactions, Including Food-Drug and Drug- Drug Interactions Identified and potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions should be discussed. For each, the evidence supporting the interaction and possible mechanism should be summarised, and the potential heal th risks posed for the different indications and in the different populations should be discussed. e. Epidemiology The epidemiology of the indication(s) should be discussed. This discussion should include incidence, prevalence, mortality and relevant co-morbidity, and should take into account whenever possible stratification by age, sex, and racial and/or ethnic origin. Differences in the epidemiology in the different regions should be discussed (because the epidemiology of the indication(s) may vary across regions), if this information is available. In addition, for important adverse events that may require further investigation, it is useful to review the incidence rates of these events among patients in whom the drug is indicated (i.e., the background incidence rate s). For example, if condition X is an important adverse event in patients who are trea ted with drug Y for disease Z, then it is useful to review the incidence of condition X in patients with disease Z who are not treated with drug Y; this is the background rate of condition X among patients with disease Z. Information on risk factors for an adverse event (condition X) would also be useful to include, if available. f. Pharmacological Class Effects The Safety Specification should identify risks believed to be common to the pharmacological class. 2.2 Summary At the end of the Safety Specification a summary should be provided of the: Important identified risks; Important potential risks; Important missing information. Sponsors are encouraged to summarise specif ic ongoing safety issues on an issue-by- issue basis, including both non-clinical and clinical data that are pertinent to the problem. 3. PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN This section gives guidance on the structure of a Pharmacovigilance Plan. The Pharmacovigilance Plan should be based on th e Safety Specification. The Specification and Plan can be written as two parts of the same document. The Plan would normally be developed by the sponsor and can be disc ussed with regulators during product development, prior to approval (i.e., when th e marketing application is submitted) of a new product, or when a safety concern arises post-marketing. It can be a stand-alone document but elements could also be incorporated into the CTD. For products for which no special concerns have arisen, routine pharmacovigilance as described in section 3.1.2 should be suffi cient for post-approval safety monitoring, Pharmacovigilance Planning 6 without the need for additional actions (e.g., safety studies). However, for products with important identified risks, important potentia l risks, or important missing information, additional actions designed to address these concerns should be considered. The length of the document will likely depend on the product and its development program. The Pharmacovigilance Plan should be updated as important information on safety becomes available and milestones are reached. 3.1 Structure of the Pharmacovigilance Plan Outlined below is a suggested structure for the Pharmacovigilance Plan. The structure can be varied depending on the product in question and the issues identified in the Safety Specification. 3.1.1 Summary of Ongoing Safety Issues At the beginning of the Pharmacovigilance Pl an a summary should be provided of the: Important identified risks; Important potential risks; Important missing information. This is important if the Pharmacovigilance Pl an is a separate document from the Safety Specification. 3.1.2 Routine Pharmacovigilance Practices Routine pharmacovigilance should be conducte d for all medicinal products, regardless of whether or not additional actions are approp riate as part of a Pharmacovigilance Plan. This routine pharmacovigilance should include the following: Systems and processes that ensure that information about all suspected adverse reactions that are reported to the pers onnel of the company are collected and collated in an accessible manner; The preparation of reports for regulatory authorities: o Expedited adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports; o Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). Continuous monitoring of the safety profile of approved products including signal detection, issue evaluation, updating of labeling, and liaison with regulatory authorities; Other requirements, as defined by local regulations. In some ICH regions, there might be a regu latory requirement to present within the Pharmacovigilance Plan an overview of the company's organisation and practices for conducting pharmacovigilance. In the absen ce of such a requirement, a statement that the company's routine pharmacovigilance practi ces include the elements outlined in the bulleted list above should be sufficient. Pharmacovigilance Planning 7 3.1.3 Action Plan for Safety Issues The Plan for each important safety issue shou ld be presented and justified according to the following structure: Safety issue; Objective of proposed action(s); Action(s) proposed; Rationale for proposed action(s); Monitoring by the sponsor for safety issue and proposed action(s); Milestones for evaluation and reporting. Any protocols for specific studies can be provided in the CTD section 5.3.5.4 Other Clinical Study Reports or other sections as appropriate (e.g., Module 4 if the study is a non-clinical study). 3.1.4 Summary of Actions to be Completed, Including Milestones An overall Pharmacovigilance Plan for the prod uct bringing together the actions for all individual safety issues should be presented. Whereas section 3.1.3 suggests presenting an action plan by ongoing safety issue, for this section the Pharmacovigilance Plan for the product should be organised in terms of the actions to be undertaken and their milestones. The reason for this is that one proposed action (e.g., a prospective safety cohort study) could address more than one of the identified issues. It is recommended that milestones for completion of studies and other evaluations, and for submission of safety results, be included in the Pharmacovigilance Plan. In developing these milestones one should consider when: Exposure to the product will have reache d a level sufficient to allow potential identification/characterisation of the AEs/ADRs of concern or resolution of a particular concern; and/or The results of ongoing or proposed safety studies are expected to be available. These milestones might be aligned with regulatory milestones (e.g., PSURs, annual reassessment and license renewals) and used to revise the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 3.2 Pharmacovigilance Methods The best method to address a specific situat ion can vary depending on the product, the indication, the population being treated and the issue to be addressed. The method chosen can also depend on whether an iden tified risk, potential risk or missing information is the issue and whether si gnal detection, evaluation or safety demonstration is the main objective of further study. When choosing a method to address a safety concern, sponsors should employ the most appropriate design. The Annex provides a summary of the key methods used in pharmacovigilance. This is provided to aid sponsors considering possi ble methods to address specific issues identified by the Safety Specification. This list is not all-inclusive, and sponsors should use the most up-to-date methods that are relevant and applicable. Pharmacovigilance Planning 8 3.2.1 Design and Conduct of Observational Studies Carefully designed and conducted pharmac oepidemiological studies, specifically observational (non-interventional, non-experimental) studies, are important tools in pharmacovigilance. In observational studie s, the investigator \"observes and evaluates results of ongoing medical care without 'con trolling' the therapy beyond normal medical practice.\"1 Before the observational study that is part of a Pharmacovigilance Plan commences, a protocol should be finalised. Experts from relevant disciplines (e.g., pharmacovigilance experts, pharmacoepidemiologists and biostatist icians) should be consulted. It is recommended that the protocol be discussed with the regulatory authorities before the study starts. It is also suggested that the circumstances in which a study should be terminated early be discussed with regulatory authorities and documented in advance. A study report after completion, and interim re ports if appropriate, should be submitted to the authorities according to the milestones within the Pharmacovigilance Plan. Study protocols should, as a minimum, include the study aims and objectives, the methods to be used, and the plan for analysis. The final study report should accurately and completely present the study objective s, methods, results, and the principal investigator's interpretation of the findings. It is recommended that the sponsor fo llow good epidemiological practice for observational studies and also internatio nally accepted guidelines, such as the guidelines endorsed by the Internat ional Society for Pharmacoepidemiology.2 In some of the ICH regions, local laws and guidelines also apply to the design and conduct of observational studies and should be followed. The highest possible standards of professional conduct and confidentiality should always be maintained and any relevant national le gislation on data protection followed. 4. REFERENCES 1.

Pharmacovigilance Planning 9 ANNEX - Pharmacovigilance Methods 1. Passive Surveillance Spontaneous Reports A spontaneous report is an unsolicit ed communication by healthcare professionals or consumers to a comp any, regulatory authority or other organisation (e.g., WHO, Regional Centres, Poison Control Centre) that describes one or more adverse drug reactions in a patient who was given one or more medicinal products and that does not deri ve from a study or any organised data collection scheme.1 Spontaneous reports play a major role in the identification of safety signals once a drug is marketed. In many instances, a company can be alerted to rare adverse events that were not detected in earlie r clinical trials or other pre-marketing studies. Spontaneous reports can also provide important information on at-risk groups, risk factors, and clinical feat ures of known serious adverse drug reactions. Caution should be exercised in evaluating spontaneous reports, especially when comparing drugs. The data accompanying spontaneous reports are often incomplete, and the rate at which cases are reported is dependent on many factors including the time since launch, pharmacovigilance-related regulatory activity, media attention, and the indication for use of the drug. 2, , ,345 Systematic Methods for the Eval uation of Spontaneous Reports More recently, systematic methods for the detection of safety signals from spontaneous reports have been used. M any of these techniques are still in development and their usefulness for identifying safety signals is being evaluated. These methods include the calculation of the proportional reporting ratio, as well as the use of Bayesian and other techniques for signal detection 6, ,78. Data mining techniques have also been used to examine drug-drug interactions9. Data mining techniques should always be used in conjunction with, and not in place of, analyses of single case reports . Data mining techniques facilitate the evaluation of spontaneous reports by usin g statistical methods to detect potential signals for further evaluation. This tool does not quantify the magnitude of risk, and caution should be exercised when comparing drugs. Further, when using data mining techniques, consideration should be given to the threshold established for detecting signals, sinc e this will have implications for the sensitivity and specificity of the method (a high threshold is associated with high specificity and low sensitivity). Confounding factors that influence spontaneous adverse event reporting are not removed by data mining. Results of data mining should be interpreted with the knowledge of the weaknesses of the spontaneous reporting system and, more specifica lly, the large differences in the ADR reporting rate among different drugs and the many potential biases inherent in spontaneous reporting. All signals should be evaluated recognising the possibility of false positives. In addition, the absence of a signal does not mean that a problem does not exist. Case Series Series of case reports can provide eviden ce of an association between a drug and an adverse event, but they are generally more useful for generating hypotheses than for verifying an association between drug exposure and outcome. There are Pharmacovigilance Planning 10 certain distinct adverse events known to be associated more frequently with drug therapy, such as anaphylaxis, aplastic anemia, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome10,11. Therefore, when events such as these are spontaneously reported, sponsors should place more emphasis on these reports for detailed and rapid follow-up. 2. Stimulated Reporting Several methods have been used to encour age and facilitate reporting by health professionals in specific situations (e.g., in -hospital settings) for new products or for limited time periods12. Such methods include on-line reporting of adverse events and systematic stimulation of reporting of adve rse events based on a pre-designed method. Although these methods have been shown to improve reporting, they are not devoid of the limitations of passive surveillance, espe cially selective reporting and incomplete information. During the early post-marketing phase, companies might actively provide health professionals with safety information, and at the same time encourage cautious use of new products and the submission of spon taneous reports when an adverse event is identified. A plan can be developed before the product is launched (e.g., through site visits by company representatives, by direct mailings or faxes, etc.). Stimulated adverse event reporting in the early post-marketi ng phase can lead companies to notify healthcare professionals of new therapies and provide safety information early in use by the general population (e.g., Early Post-marketing Phase Vigilance, EPPV in Japan). This should be regarded as a form of spontaneous event reporting, and thus data obtained from stimulated reporting cannot be used to generate accurate incidence rates, but reporting rates can be estimated. 3. Active Surveillance Active surveillance, in contrast to passive su rveillance, seeks to ascertain completely the number of adverse events via a continuous pre-organised process. An example of active surveillance is the follow-up of patients tre ated with a particular drug through a risk management program. Patients who fill a prescription for this drug may be asked to complete a brief survey form and give permission for later contact 13. In general, it is more feasible to get comprehensive data on individual adverse event reports through an active surveillance system than through a passive reporting system. Sentinel Sites Active surveillance can be achieved by re viewing medical records or interviewing patients and/or physicians in a sample of sentinel sites to ensure complete and accurate data on reported adverse events from these sites. The selected sites can provide information, such as data from sp ecific patient subgroups, that would not be available in a passive spontaneous reporting system. Further, information on the use of a drug, such as abuse, can be targeted at selected sentinel sites 14. Some of the major weaknesses of sentinel sites are problems with selection bias, small numbers of patients, and increased costs. A ctive surveillance with sentinel sites is most efficient for those drugs used mainly in institutional settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, haemodialysis ce ntres, etc. Institutional settings can have a greater frequency of use for certain drug products and can provide an infrastructure for dedicated reporting. In addition, automatic detection of abnormal laboratory values from comput erized laboratory reports in certain Pharmacovigilance Planning 11 clinical settings can provide an efficien t active surveillance system. Intensive monitoring of sentinel sites can also be helpful in identifying risks among patients taking orphan drugs. Drug Event Monitoring Drug event monitoring is a method of a ctive pharmacovigilance surveillance. In drug event monitoring, patients might be identified from electronic prescription data or automated health insurance claims. A follow-up questionnaire can then be sent to each prescribing physician or patient at pre-specified intervals to obtain outcome information. Information on patient demographics, indication for treatment, duration of therapy (including start dates), dosage, clinical events, and reasons for discontinuation can be included in the questionnaire 12, , ,151617. Limitations of drug event monitoring can include poor physician and patient response rates and the unfocused nature of data collection, which can obscure important signals. In addition, maintenance of patient confidentiality might be a concern. On the other hand, more detailed information on adverse events from a large number of physicians and/o r patients might be collected. Registries A registry is a list of patients presenting with the same characteristic(s). This characteristic can be a disease (disease registry) or a specific exposure (drug registry). Both types of registries, which on ly differ by the type of patient data of interest, can collect a battery of inform ation using standardised questionnaires in a prospective fashion. Disease registries, such as registries for blood dyscrasias, severe cutaneous reactions, or congenital malformations can help collect data on drug exposure and other factors associated with a clinical condition. A disease registry might also be used as a base for a case-control study comparing the drug exposure of cases identified from the re gistry and controls selected from either patients with another condition within the registry, or patients outside the registry. Exposure (drug) registries address populations exposed to drugs of interest (e.g., registry of rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed to biological therapies) to determine if a drug has a special impact on this group of patients. Some exposure (drug) registries address drug exposures in specific populations, such as pregnant women. Patients can be followed over time and included in a cohort study to collect data on adverse events using st andardised questionnaires. Single cohort studies can measure incidence, but, with out a comparison group, cannot provide proof of association. However, they c an be useful for signal amplification, particularly for rare outcomes. This type of registry can be very valuable when examining the safety of an orphan drug indicated for a specific condition. Pharmacovigilance Planning 12 4. Comparative Observational Studies Traditional epidemiologic methods are a ke y component in the evaluation of adverse events. There are a number of observational st udy designs that are useful in validating signals from spontaneous reports or case se ries. Major types of these designs are cross- sectional studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies (both retrospective and prospective)12,15. Cross-Sectional Study (Survey) Data collected on a population of patients at a single point in time (or interval of time) regardless of exposure or disease st atus constitute a cross-sectional study. These types of studies are primarily used to gather data for surveys or for ecological analyses. The major drawback of cross-sectional studies is that the temporal relationship between expo sure and outcome cannot be directly addressed. These studies are best used to examine the prevalence of a disease at one time point or to examine trends over time, when data for serial time points can be captured. These studies can also be used to examine the crude association between exposure and outcome in ecologic analyses. Cross-sectional studies are best utilised when exposures do not change over time. Case-Control Study In a case-control study, cases of disease (or events) are identified. Controls, or patients without the disease or event of interest, are then selected from the source population that gave rise to the cases. The controls should be selected in such a way that the prevalence of exposure among the controls represents the prevalence of exposure in the source population. The exposure status of the two groups is then compared using the odds ratio, which is an estimate of the relative risk of disease in the two groups. Patients can be identified from an existing database or using data collected specifically for the purpose of the study of interest. If safety information is sought for special populations, the cases and controls can be stratified according to the population of interest (the elderly, children, pregnant women, etc.). For rare adverse events, existing large population-based databases are a useful and efficient means of providing needed drug exposure and medical outcome data in a relatively short period of time. Case-control studies are particularly usef ul when the goal is to investigate whether there is an association between a drug (or drugs) and one specific rare adverse event, as well as to identify risk factors for adverse events. Risk factors can include conditions such as renal and hepatic dysfunction, that might modify the relationship between the drug exposure and the adverse event. Under specific conditions, a case-control study can provide the absolute incidence rate of the event. If all cases of interest (or a well-defined fraction of cases) in the catchment area are captured and the fraction of co ntrols from the source population is known, an incidence rate can be calculated. Cohort Study In a cohort study, a population-at-risk fo r the disease (or event) is followed over time for the occurrence of the disease (or event). Information on exposure status is known throughout the follow-up period for each patient. A patient might be exposed to a drug at one time during follow-up, but non-exposed at another time point. Since the population exposure during follow-up is known, incidence rates Pharmacovigilance Planning 13 can be calculated. In many cohort studie s involving drug exposure, comparison cohorts of interest are selected on the bas is of drug use and followed over time. Cohort studies are useful when there is a need to know the incidence rates of adverse events in addition to the relative risks of adverse events. Multiple adverse events can also be investigated using the same data source in a cohort study. However, it can be difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of patients who are exposed to a drug of interest (such as an orphan drug) or to study very rare outcomes. Like case-control studies, the identification of patients for cohort studies can come from large automated databases or from data collected specifically for the study at hand. In addition, cohort studies can be used to examine safety issues in special populations (the elderly, children, patients with co-morbid conditions, pregnant women) th rough over-sampling of these patients or by stratifying the cohort if sufficient numbers of patients exist. There are several automated databases available for pharmacoepidemiologic studies12, ,1518. They include databases which contain automated medical records or automated accounting/billing systems. Databases that are created from accounting/billing systems might be linke d to pharmacy claims and medical claims databases. These datasets might include millions of patients. Since they are created for administrative or b illing purposes, they might not have the detailed and accurate information needed for some research, such as validated diagnostic information or laboratory data . Although medical records can be used to ascertain and validate test results and medical diagnoses, one should be cognizant of the privacy and confidentia lity regulations that apply to patient medical records. 5. Targeted Clinical Investigations When significant risks are identified from pr e-approval clinical trials, further clinical studies might be called for to evaluate the mechanism of action for the adverse reaction. In some instances, pharmacodynamic and ph armacokinetic studies might be conducted to determine whether a particular dosing in struction can put patients at an increased risk of adverse events. Genetic testing c an also provide clues about which group of patients might be at an increased risk of adverse reactions. Furthermore, based on the pharmacological properties and the expecte d use of the drug in general practice, conducting specific studies to investigate potential drug-drug interactions and food-drug interactions might be called for. These stud ies can include population pharmacokinetic studies and drug concentration monitoring in patients and normal volunteers. Sometimes, potential risks or unforeseen benefits in special populations might be identified from pre-approval clinical trials, but cannot be fully quantified due to small sample sizes or the exclusion of subpopulations of patients from these clinical studies. These populations might include the elderly, ch ildren, or patients with renal or hepatic disorder. Children, the elderly, and patients with co-morbid conditions might metabolise drugs differently than patients typically enrolle d in clinical trials. Further clinical trials might be used to determine and to quantify the magnitude of the risk (or benefit) in such populations. To elucidate the benefit-risk profile of a drug outside of the formal/traditional clinical trial setting and/or to fully quantify the risk of a critical but relatively rare adverse event, a large simplified trial might be conducted. Patients enrolled in a large simplified trial are usually randomized to avoid selection bias. In this type of trial, though, the Pharmacovigilance Planning 14 event of interest will be focused to ensu re a convenient and practical study. One limitation of this method is that the outco me measure might be too simplified and this might have an impact on the quality and ultimate usefulness of the trial. Large, simplified trials are also resource-intensive. 6. Descriptive Studies Descriptive studies are an important componen t of pharmacovigilance, although not for the detection or verification of adverse even ts associated with drug exposures. These studies are primarily used to obtain the background rate of outcome events and/or establish the prevalence of the use of drugs in specified populations. Natural History of Disease The science of epidemiology originally focu sed on the natural history of disease, including the characteristics of diseased patients and the distribution of disease in selected populations, as well as estimating the incidence and prevalence of potential outcomes of interest. These outcomes of interest now include a description of disease treatment patte rns and adverse events. Studies that examine specific aspects of adverse events, such as the background incidence rate of or risk factors for the adverse event of interest, can be used to assist in putting spontaneous reports into perspective 15. For example, an epidemiologic study can be conducted using a disease registry to understand the frequency at which the event of interest might occur in specific subgroups, such as patients with concomitant illnesses. Drug Utilisation Study Drug utilisation studies (DUS) describe ho w a drug is marketed, prescribed, and used in a population, and how these factors influence outcomes, including clinical, social, and economic outcomes 12. These studies provide data on specific populations, such as the elderly, children, or patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction, often stratified by age, gender, concomitant medication, and other characteristics. DUS can be used to determ ine if a product is being used in these populations. From these studies denominat or data can be developed for use in determining rates of adverse drug reaction s. DUS have been used to describe the effect of regulatory actions and media attention on the use of drugs, as well as to develop estimates of the economic burden of the cost of drugs. DUS can be used to examine the relationship between recomm ended and actual clinical practice. These studies can help to determine whether a drug has the potential for drug abuse by examining whether patients are taking escalating dose regimens or whether there is evidence of inappr opriate repeat prescribing. Important limitations of these studies can include a lack of clinical outcome data or information of the indication for use of a product. Pharmacovigilance Planning 15 REFERENCES 1. ICH Guideline.
