Malert, CAE Director, Governance SUBJECT: Procedures for Use at Joint BOC -BOS Business Meetings For nearly a decade, the Board of Councilors (BOC) and the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS) have jointly conducted parts of their business meetings. Joint BOC -BOS Committees now consider proposed A AOS advisory opinions, proposed AAOS resolutions, proposed AAOS bylaws amendments, and proposed revisions to the AAOS Standards of Professionalism (SOPs). Over time, certain procedural rules have developed to govern the process of considering and vot ing on these matters. They are attached. In summary, when it comes to the joint BOC/BOS Business Meeting, the BOC and the BOS hear the complete discussions on the recommendations of the Joint BOC -BOS Committees, as well as any amendments involving these re commendations. To preserve the autonomy of each group, the BOC and the BOS vote separately on all amendments (if any) and on the final proposal. The final results of the voting - on both amendments and the main motions - are not to be shared until both groups have voted. The attached document highlights the proposed process that will be used during this meeting. Thank you for your support, and your efforts on behalf of America's orthopaedic surgeons and their patients.

Whereas : Climate change is recognized as a threat to the wellbeing of billions of people around the world and countless ecosystems (i). Pollution has been implicated in up to 9 million premature deaths around the world annual ly, and it is increasingly being viewed by experts across the world as a medical emergency. (ii,iii) In order to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a rapid reduction in GHG emissions is required. (iv) (v,vi). Whereas : Orthopaedic procedures accounting for roughly 25% of the over 17 million invasive procedures performed annually, and orthopaedic surgeries and procedures are likely a significant contributor to GHG emissions nationally. (vii) Whereas : Much of orthopaedic care delivery requires anesthesia and the delivery of anesthetic gases. The effects of volatile anesthetic agents and their contribution to warming are well documented. (viii) Anesthetic gases possess potencies that are orders of magnitude greater than that of carbon dioxide when assessing t heir potential for atmospheric warming. The anesthesia contribution to GHGs should be considered under the umbrella of orthopaedic care, since examination of other surgical procedures have indicated that anesthetic gas contribute the greatest load of carbo n footprint consumption. (ix) Whereas: The exact numbers and statistics of the environmental footprint of orthopaedics are yet undefined, certainties exist on which we can base recommendations. Therefore, be it Resolved : We as orthopaedic surgeons and AAOS members and Fellows acknowledge: 1) Less is less. If we use less equipment, supplies or implants during a procedure, our environmental footprint will decrease. This and all suggestions assume that changes are made which do not affect the patient's clini cal outcome or other aspects of their care. 2) Less travel equals fewer emissions. The less the patient, doctor and staff have to travel for visits, the fewer GHG will be created. 3) Using less water saves water. AAOS Advisory Opinion Last Updated: 2021 Combined NOLC/ Fall Meeting Page: 2 4) Using fewer inhaled anesthetic agents in orthopae dic cases reduces carbon footprint. Resolved : That the Board of Directors (BOD) consider the consequences of environmental impact of orthopaedic practice related to procedures, surgeries, to patient visits, to practice habits as a whole. In addressing the impact of orthopaedics, we ask the BOD to take steps to address this as an organization, the AAOS as the Academy and as the Association. Resolved: In the BOD addressing the environmental impact of orthopaedic surgery, we recommend identifying position statements, task forces, and committees that address further scrutiny of the impact we have and identify future steps to become environmentally sustainable as a profession. Recommendations to shape next steps include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: 1) In the absence of evidence -based data to the contrary suggesting superior clinical outcomes, surgeons are encouraged to minimize the use of implants, drapes, trays, instruments, positioners and any other item used in the delivery of orthopaedic care. 2) In the absence of evidence -based data to the contrary suggesting superior clinical outcomes, surgeons are encouraged to deliver care while minimizing patient travel including for office visits, physical therapy, lab draws and pre/post -operative evaluations. This includes utilizing video and telephone appointments in lieu of in -person visits when clinically appropriate. 3) In the absence of evidence -based data to the contrary suggesting superior clinical outcomes, surgeons should minimize wa ter usage by using waterless scrub when possible and minimizing the number of instruments used in each case. 4) In the absence of evidence -based data to the contrary suggesting superior clinical outcomes, surgeons should engage our anesthesia colleagues in d iscussion regarding minimizing use of inhaled anesthetic agents and performing procedures under regional or local anesthesia when possible. i IPCC, 2019: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems [P.R.

(Travel guidelines for members of the Board of Directors and the Council \\ Chairs are outlined in a separate policy.) The AAOS recognizes that volunteers give generously of their time and spend time away from their practices to participate in AAOS event s. When this dedication is added to the fact that more than 3,000 trips are made by AAOS volunteers in the course of a year, it becomes paramount that the AAOS travel policy be fair, consistent, and easily understandable. In addition, it must provide for p rompt and accurate reimbursement of expenses incurred. Finally, it must fulfill certain obligations required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and also adhere to principles of prudent management. 2 Air Travel Travelers are strongly encouraged to use Cor pTrav, AAOS' official travel agent, to make their travel arrangements for AAOS business. In doing so, the airfare and agent fees are charged directly to the AAOS, though travelers retain any reward miles that may apply. Round -trip travel should be booked o n one airline whenever possible (the same airline going and returning). If a ticket exceeds $600, CorpTrav will contact the AAOS Travel Specialist to determine authorization of the requested ticket. Discounted, non -refundable and non -transferable coach cl ass tickets for scheduled meetings should be purchased at least 21 days prior to travel, as this generally will yield the lowest fare available. Non -refundable does not mean that the ticket can't be changed. If a non -refundable ticket is cancelled, CorpTra v will receive credit for the cost of the ticket, to be applied to future travel for the same individual on the same airline. The fee to book the ticket is $12 if the ticket is purchased online and $32 if acquired over the phone - i.e., agent -assisted boo king. There is an additional $15 charge for agent - assisted booking if done between 7:00 pm -7:00 am. The AAOS will reimburse for checked bags up to a two bag maximum. Overweight baggage fees will not be reimbursed. Flight changes will be reimbursed up to $ 200 per round trip. Use of a private airplane is strongly discouraged due to liability issues as the AAOS' insurance will neither cover the volunteer traveling aboard a private airplane on AAOS business nor will the AAOS. 3 Flight Upgrades Upgrade purchases are not reimbursable, including upgrades to Economy Plus. Travel Policy for Combined NOLC/Fall M eeting Last Updated: 8/11/2021 Copyright \u00a9 2017, The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Page: 2 4 International Flights Volunteers traveling on behalf of the AAOS can travel Business Class on all international trips. (For purposes of this policy, flights to/from Canada, Hawaii and Alas ka are considered domestic.) 5 E-Tickets Vs. Paper Tickets Please avoid requesting paper tickets when making travel arrangements. The airlines have created interlining agreements (to facilitate flight changes that occur because of aircraft delays or weather problems) that have diminished the usefulness of paper tickets. In addition to the $50 fee for issuing paper tickets, there also is a charge to send the ticket via express mail services. If a ticket is lost, there is an additional fee to replace it . If the ticket is unused, it must be returned to CorpTrav, who will charge a fee to refund the unused ticket. 6 Automobile Travel The AAOS will reimburse individuals traveling to/from the Combined NOLC /Fall Meeting via personal automobile at the published I RS rate per mile ($0.56 per mile effective 01/01/ 2021 ). If a personal vehicle is used in lieu of airline travel, mileage reimbursement may not exceed the cost of the commercial 21 -day discounted Coach airfare. Automobile rental for travel in conjunction wi th the Combined NOLC /Fall Meeting is prohibited. Hotel shuttle vans and taxis are the preferred mode of ground travel . 7 Train Train fares may not exceed the cost of a commercial 21 -day discounted coach airfare.

Reimbursement checks typically are issued within two weeks of receipt of vouchers. Reimbursement requests exceeding $25 without receipts will be reimbursed at $25. Exhibit A Internet access procedures when traveling Travelers will be reimbursed for Internet use for AAOS b usiness or AAOS -related research. Some computer systems do not support all methods of Internet connection. Internet access In order to be reimbursed for Internet connectivity, the traveler must utilize one of the following: The hotel's local Internet service provider to access the Internet at the hotel's stated per diem rate. It is the responsibility of the hotel guest to obtain this information and specifics regarding log -on and/or passwords upon check -in, or His/her own Internet service provider if that provider has a local access number or toll -free access for the area where the individual is traveling. It is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that this option is a viable alternative prior to trav eling. Most national Internet service providers (ISPs) have areas on their websites where local access or toll -free access numbers can be found. Please note that when using the service provider's toll -free access number in lieu of a local access number, a surcharge or per - minute charge is typically added to the subscriber's monthly bill. This will be the subscriber's responsibility to pay and is not reimbursable. Many national ISPs also have a customer service number to call for the local access number f or a given travel destination. Small providers may not have a national access network. The traveler should contact his/her individual service provider for more details. 13 Right to Modify Policy The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons reserves the right to modify this Travel Policy for Combined NOLC/Fall Meeting at any time.
