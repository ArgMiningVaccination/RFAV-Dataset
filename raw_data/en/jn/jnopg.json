About the Healing Nature Center Inspired by the nature-based healing practices of indigenous people and contemporary research findings on nature's healing powers, the Healing Nature Center and Trail are designed to foster nature-based physical and emotional healing. Therapists have been seeking a supportive place to work with clients in nature, and the Trail-Center complex has been created to meet their special needs as well. The Center offers retreat space, workshops, and Healing Nature Trail guided tours to the general public. Our Welcome Center features trail maps, healing books, woodland aromatherapy essential oils, and handouts on a variety of topics (including labyrinths, conscious breathing, and animal guides).
