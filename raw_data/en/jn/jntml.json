It's important to understand what cancer is, so you can understand your treatment better . What is Cancer? Our body is made up of many cells. Healthy cells follow the \"rules\" when they divide at a normal pace and stop growing and die when the body doesn't need them. Cancer happens when cells start to grow out of control. When these cells grow and divide, they can form a lump called a tumour . Not all tumours are cancer. Some are non-cancerous (also called benign ). We'll use an example of a garden for a simple explanation: Cancer cellsGood cellsA Healthy Body Imagine your body as a garden. The soil is your immune system, the good plants are your good cells, and the weeds are the cancer cells. When you're healthy, the good plants grow and the soil helps keep the weeds away. When the odd weed starts to grow, the body is able to get rid of it by itself. Healthy cells dividing: Normal CellsCancer Cells Image \u00a9 Alberta Heatlh ServicesJust Diagnosed 4 Cancer cellsGood cells A Body with Cancer Cancer cells are like weeds in your garden. Sometimes the body cannot get rid of the weeds and needs help. There are many different types of treatments used to treat cancer: surgery, radiation treatment, and systemic treatment. One type of systemic treatment is called immunotherapy. Systemic treatment is any medication that travels through your body in the bloodstream with the aim of destroying cancer cells. Systemic treatment can be used alone or combined with other treatments. Immunotherapy is different than other cancer treatments \u2014 instead of attacking the cancer cells directly, it turns your immune system on and trains it so it so that it can attack the cancer cells. In this book, we talk about a type of immunotherapy called Checkpoint Inhibitor . Cancer cellsGood cells Immunotherapy Immunotherapies are like adding a fertilizer to the soil. They make the soil (immune system) stronger to restore the garden's health and remove the weeds.Image \u00a9 Alberta Heatlh Services Find out about all types of cancer treatment in the book: Newly Diagnosed With Cancer Image \u00a9 Alberta Heatlh Services5 Just Diagnosed Checkpoint Inhibitors Checkpoint inhibitors are a type of immunotherapy and are different than other cancer treatments. Instead of attacking the cancer cells directly, it turns your immune system on and trains it so that it can attack the cancer cells. What is the immune system? The immune system is made up of many cells and tissues found all over your body and works together to keep you healthy. It protects the body from invaders such as bacteria, viruses, fungi (like mold or yeast), and cancer. It usually does a good job of keeping people healthy and preventing infections. Sometimes problems with the immune system happen which can lead to illness or infection. One of the important cells is called a white blood cell (WBC). There are different types of WBCs, but the main one that checkpoint inhibitors target is called a lymphocyte . WBCs have different jobs they do when dealing with cancer cells: The locator \u2014 looks for cancer cells and calls other cells for more help if needed. The helper \u2014 flags the cancer cell so that the fighter cells have an easier time finding the cancer cells. The fighter \u2014 destroys the cells that are flagged by the helper cells.The memory \u2014 remembers what the cancer cells look like so if they show up again, the attack is quicker.

The WBCs find, fight and kill cells that are not normal or do not belong, like cancer. Why didn't my immune system catch the cancer at the start? Cancer cells sometimes act like they are part of the healthy body's system and hide in plain sight. WBCs do not recognize the cancer as an enemy, so the cancer cells are able to continue to grow. How do checkpoint inhibitors work? The checkpoint inhibitor turns on the immune system. The immune system is then able to remove the \"blindfold\" so that the WBCs can see and recognize the cancer cells and attack them.

Systemic treatment means that the treatment travels throughout your body in the bloodstream. Checkpoint inhibitors are one type of systemic treatment. What are the goals of checkpoint inhibitor? The goals are different for everyone and they can also change over time. The 3 goals for treatment are to: Become cancer-free \u2014 to get rid of the cancer from your body Get control \u2014 to stop the cancer from growing and spreading to other parts of your body Relieve or reduce symptoms the cancer may cause such as pain, or shortness of breath How are treatment decisions made? You and your healthcare team will talk about your treatment options together. The options depend on the type of cancer you have and where it is in your body. Research has shown us which treatments work best for different types of cancer. Other things we look at include your overall health, if you had treatment before, and what you would like to do. Write down the goals you make with your oncologist here: Terrie's Tip ~ cancer survivor: \"Feel secure and cared for in the treatment plan that has been created with you.\" Just Diagnosed 8 Consenting to Treatment Your Medical Oncologist may recommend checkpoint inhibitors as part of your cancer treatment, but you need to decide if you want to have a checkpoint inhibitor. To help make your decision, you need to know the: Goals for treatment Risks and benefits to getting the treatment Other possible treatment options other than a checkpoint inhibitor Possible outcomes if you do not have treatment How will I get my checkpoint inhibitor treatment? You will most likely get the treatment using an IV (intravenous) \u2014 the medication is put directly into a vein. Most patients get a temporary IV inserted and at the end of the treatment appointment, the IV is taken out. You may get a central line. This is inserted into a vein and stays in until you no longer need treatment. Your doctor will prescribe this for you if needed. Common Questions Where will I go to get my checkpoint inhibitor treatment? Most patients go to their local cancer centre. A nurse will monitor you during your treatment. After your treatment is done, you should feel well enough to go back home or to work and continue with your day. How long will my treatment appointments be? Some treatments only take a few minutes, while others can take a couple of hours. Your nurse will tell you how long your treatment will take. Preparing you for the treatment takes time, so you will be at the treatment appointment longer than just the amount of time it takes to give you the medication.You can use the free AHS My Care Conversations app to prepare for your next appointment and to audio record conversations with your healthcare team. You can listen to your recordings at home and share with family or trusted friends. Download it from the App Store or Google Play. Before the nurse starts your treatment, or even after treatment has started, you can say stop at any point if you have concerns. If the nurse has any concerns, he or she may also stop the treatment. We want you to feel safe. 9 Just Diagnosed How often will I get my treatment? In general, treatments are given in cycles. A cycle may be every 2, 3, 4 or 6 weeks, but this may vary. Your treatment will be given on the first day of each cycle. This allows the treatment to wake up your immune system and attack the cancer cells. After each treatment, you will take a break for the rest of the cycle. Your immune system continues to attack the cancer cells before you move on to the next cycle. Your doctor will recommend the number of cycles you will need. Is checkpoint inhibitor treatment painful? There is usually no pain other than a needle prick at the start. Sometimes your vein may get irritated or discoloured. If you feel any burning, redness or swelling while you get your treatment, tell your nurse right away. Can I take other medications when I'm on checkpoint inhibitor treatment ? Tell your healthcare team (doctor, nurse or pharmacist) about any other pills, injections, or medicines you take, including vitamins, or herbal remedies. Some checkpoint inhibitors do not mix well with other medications and can become less effective in killing the cancer cells, or can make side effects worse. Tell your healthcare team if you have any changes to your medications. (See pages 11-12 ) Your treatment cycle starts The treatment wakes up the immune system to attack the cancer cellsBreak from treatment \u2014 lets the immune system continue its jobNext Cycle After you leave your appointment, if you notice pain, redness or swelling in the arm that received the treatment, call the contact number your healthcare team gave you. Pregnancy If you think you are pregnant talk to your medical oncologist before you start your treatments. We recommend that both men and women use some form of birth control before and during treatments since we do not yet know how checkpoint inhibitors affect an unborn baby. Ask your oncologist when it would be safe to try to become pregnant after treatment. In Treatment 10 In Treatment B. Your Treatment Appointment The Day Before Your Appointment Check your appointment slip for your appointment time and to see if there are any special instructions Pick up your anti-nausea medications or other pre-medications from your local pharmacy if needed Have your questions ready, arrange your ride, confirm who is coming with you, just in case you do not feel up to driving yourself home The Day Of Your Appointment Food : Eat a meal - your body needs nutrition and you will feel much better if you have something in your stomach Medications: Take your regular medications as you normally would, unless you were told not to Take your anti-nausea medications or \"pre-meds\" as instructed (some may need to be taken during your appointment) Bring all your medications to your appointment What to bring: Money or a way to pay for food or parking. You can also bring food to your appointment This booklet - the nurse can review questions you may have and go over some important points you need to be aware of Government identification and your healthcare card A book or electronic device (tablet/iPad) to help pass the time Questions you have written down to ask your healthcare team Bring all your medications to your appointmentDrink 2-3 glasses of water more than you normally do the day before your appointment. Drinking water helps \"plump up\" your veins making them easier to find, and may mean less pokes when you get your bloodwork done or an IV started. Wear comfortable clothes Don't schedule other activities or appointments for the first treatment day 11 In Treatment Can I bring family or friends to my appointment? Friends and family are important but we have limited space. If you plan to bring more than 1 person, check with your healthcare team before your appointment to see if there are any limits with how many people you can bring. Can I bring children? Children 15 years of age or younger should not come for safety reasons. If you have difficulty getting childcare, call your cancer centre and ask to speak with a social worker to see what resources are available in your community. After Your Appointment Follow any special directions your healthcare team gave you Keep track of how you feel using your symptom tracker ( Keeping Track of Your Symptoms ) Call your cancer centre if you have any questions or concerns Information about Your Medications Keep a Medication List Carry a current list of your medications. Some medications do not work well with others and can affect your treatment. Your healthcare team can review your list to make sure this doesn't happen. Let your healthcare team know if your medications change, including those prescribed outside of the cancer centre, such as from your family doctor.For more information, check \"Your Systemic Treatment Appointment\" pamphlet that came with this booklet. Keep your list up to date Share your list with your healthcare providers at your appointments Know what time of day you take each medication, how much (dose) and how often Make sure you understand your medications and how to take them safely For medication lists and tools, go to: https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/ medicine-tracking-tools.aspx If you need refills on prescriptions not related to your cancer treatment (such as high blood pressure pills, or allergy medications), talk to your family doctor. In Treatment 12 What do I put on my medication list? Anything prescribed for you such as: Pills Liquids Patches Inhalers Eye/ear/nose drops Creams, lotions, and ointments Samples of medicationAnything you buy over the counter, such as: Pain killers Cold medications Laxatives Vitamins, minerals or supplements Others: Homeopathic, natural, or herbal remedies Any recreational drugs, such as alcohol or marijuana (cannabis) Flu Shot (Influenza Immunization) Talk to your oncologist first if you: have not yet started treatment are on treatment now finished checkpoint inhibitor treatment in the past 6 months Pharmacy Services at your Cancer Centre The pharmacy at your cancer centre only provides cancer treatment medications. You need to pick up all other medications at your local pharmacy like those that treat or prevent nausea, hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, or pain medications. Remember to tell the pharmacist and healthcare team if you have any allergies to medications. We also want to know what kind of reaction you had \u2014 was it a rash, or did you have difficulty breathing. You can find information and resources to help you learn more. https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/know-your-medications.aspx Do not discontinue or change the dose of any medication unless you talk with your doctor. Take only the medications that have been prescribed or approved for you. If you have any questions or concerns, about any medications, talk to your healthcare team or a pharmacist. Tell your healthcare team if you have any allergies to medications. 13 Possible Side Effects Possible Side Effects C. Are there side effects from checkpoint inhibitors? There are possible side effects. Your healthcare team will talk to you about them, but it does not mean you will have all or even any of them. Everyone is different. Different checkpoint inhibitor drugs may have different side effects. How does checkpoint inhibitor treatment cause side effects? When checkpoint inhibitors wake up the body's immune system, the immune system may become over activated and also attack some of the body's normal cells, which can cause side effects. These are called immune-related side effects. If you notice something different with your body, or how you feel, tell your healthcare team right away. They can help you manage or treat the side effects. When will the side effects happen? Side effects can happen anytime during treatment and may even happen after you stop treatment. You should know what side effects are possible so you can recognize them. Always talk to your healthcare team if you notice anything different. What should I tell an emergency room doctor or family doctor about my treatment? If you ever have to go to the emergency room, bring your emergency letter with you to give the healthcare staff. This letter lets the healthcare staff know they should contact your medical oncologist to find out how to manage your side effects. Checkpoint inhibitors are special medications and medical oncologists are experts in knowing how to manage them. You should also bring your letter when you see your family doctor. If your doctor prescribes you new medications, such as antibiotics, tell your cancer team \u2014 they need to make sure they will not interfere with your treatment. This side effects section is split up into 2 categories: 1. Possible side effects from checkpoint inhibitors (pages 14-17) 2. Other general side effects \u2014 these are side effects that are common for people with cancer . They may be caused by the treatment, or some may be caused by the actual cancer itself. (pages 18-26 ) Side effects are different for everybody. You may get a lot of side effects, or just a few. Sometimes the side effects may be severe, or you might not notice them at all. Carry your emergency letter with you, or take a picture of it with your phone so you always have it with you. Possible Side Effects 14 Possible Side Effects of Checkpoint Inhibitors What side effects can I expect? The types of side effects and how severe they are will depend on which checkpoint inhibitor you receive, and how your body responds to the treatment. Your healthcare team will review the side effects with you and what you can do about them. It's important to remember that these are possible side effects only . Immune-Related Side Effects Immune-related side effects often do not get better on their own. Make sure you tell your healthcare team if you have any of the side effects listed in the table below or on the next page. They can help you get the treatment you need, so do not try to manage these yourself. Area affected: What to watch for: Stomach and IntestinesTalk to your healthcare team if you have: Stomach pain Cramps Burning feeling in your stomach Heartburn Indigestion NauseaGo to the Emergency Room if you have: Severe diarrhea (see page 17) LungsTalk to your healthcare team if you have a: Cough with or without mucous Cough that is different than usual Cough with or without feverGo to the Emergency Room if you have: Difficulty breathing Chest pain Shortness of breath Remember to take your emergency letter with you if you need to go to the emergency room. 15 Possible Side Effects Skin Talk to your healthcare team if you have: Rash Blisters Hives Itchiness Muscles, joints and nervesTalk to your healthcare team if you have: Aches and pains Severe muscle weakness/fatigue Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Liver Side effects can happen to the liver, but usually you will not notice them. Your healthcare team will use blood tests to make sure there is no change in your liver function. Talk to your healthcare team if your: Eyes or skin turn yellow Stools (poop) become lighter in colour EyesTalk to your healthcare team if you have: Burning/pain Blurred vision Irritated eyes Sensitivity to light Reddened eyes Discharge Itchiness Kidneys Side effects can happen to the kidneys, but usually you will not notice them. Your healthcare team will use blood tests to make sure there is no change in your kidney function. Hormones See page 16 for more information on hormones and the side effects You know your body best, and you can tell when you're feeling well or unwell. Tell your healthcare team right away if you have any of these side effects so they can help you with them. You might need medication to help treat them. Possible Side Effects 16 Hormones Hormones are made by the endocrine glands in our bodies. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel in the body and help control how cells and organs work. They help the body work the way it's supposed to. Checkpoint inhibitors can affect these glands in the endocrine system, and cause side effects. These can include: Fever (page 17) Chills Headache \u2014 new or will not go away Change in your appetite (page 18) Cracked or dry skin/hair Change in your blood sugars Nausea and vomiting Fatigue or weakness (page 20) Weight change (gain or loss) Change in your mood or behaviour Trouble sleeping (page 26) Change in blood pressure Sometimes these side effects can be caused by other things, so talk to your healthcare team if you experience any. Go to the Emergency Room if you have difficulty seeing out of the sides of your eyes (loss of peripheral vision) 17 Possible Side Effects Fever Fever may be a normal response to treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor . If you have a mild fever, use acetaminophen such as Tylenol\u00ae to help reduce your symptoms. Call the contact number your healthcare team gave you if your temperature is 38.9\u00b0C/102\u00b0F or higher with any of the following: It lasts longer than 24 hours You feel unwell You have other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, pain, dizziness, nausea or diarrhea Diarrhea Diarrhea is an increase of 2 to 3 watery or loose stools (poops) above your normal number of bowel movements. You may have cramps, pain, or feel bloated. Diarrhea is serious because you can lose a lot of fluid and nutrients, which can cause you to become dehydrated and tired. If diarrhea goes on long enough, or is severe enough, it can damage your intestines or kidneys. It's very important to call your cancer centre if: your diarrhea does not go away after more than 24 hours (1 day) you notice blood in the diarrhea or bleeding in your rectal area you have dark, tarry stools you have severe cramps you cannot drink enough fluids to replace the fluid lost in your diarrhea Go to the Emergency Room if your diarrhea is severe \u2014 4 or more times a day Possible Side Effects 18 Other General Side Effects Appetite Changes Some medications can cause you to lose your appetite. A poor appetite that lasts longer than a few days can lead to a loss of weight, muscle and strength. You also won't have the nutrition your body needs to heal and repair itself to fight the cancer. Things that can cause you to lose your appetite: Changes to how your body breaks down your food and uses it for energy Advanced cancer A buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) that may make you feel full Other medications, such as medications to treat pain What can I do to maintain or improve my appetite? Try new foods and drinks to find flavours that taste good to you. Make a list of foods you like. Eat them often, even if you eat the same foods. over and over for awhile. Choose soft foods that need less chewing. Don't eat foods that taste bad to you. If your mouth is dry, try to increase the amount of fluids you drink to 8 cups (2 litres) each day. This will help keep your mouth moist and improve your appetite. If you have been told to limit your fluids, speak with your doctor or dietitian. Brush your teeth and tongue with a soft toothbrush before and after each meal. Wait 10-15 minutes after you brush to eat \u2014 this will help \"wake up\" your taste-buds. Try not to use tobacco products \u2014 they can make food taste bad (page 35).If you have a poor appetite and are eating only small amounts or not eating at all, talk to your healthcare team or a dietitian. 19 Possible Side Effects Blood Clots Blood clots are also called Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a blood clot that forms in the veins of the body or in the lungs. People with cancer are 5-7 times more likely to develop a clot than someone who does not have cancer. The most common vein blood clots are: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) : A blood clot forms in a vein of the leg or pelvis It may partially or totally block the flow of bloodPulmonary Embolism (PE) : A blood clot forms in the lungs Or A blood clot forms somewhere else in the body. It then travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. Once it gets to the lungs, it can get stuck there and cut off the blood supply to the lungs What are the signs and symptoms of a clot? Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Pain or tenderness in the calf, behind the knee, along the inner thigh to groin Swelling A change in the colour of your skin (a blue, purple or red colour) in the area around the site of the clot The area feels warm to touchPulmonary Embolism (PE) Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Chest pain or upper back pain, especially when you breathe Coughing up blood Unexpected rapid heart rate Dizziness or feeling faintGet more tips from the booklet Blood Clots and Cancer at your cancer centre or online at www.cancercarealberta.ca If you have any of these symptoms, go to your nearest emergency centre right away. Possible Side Effects 20 Fatigue Fatigue (or tiredness) is a very common side effect related to treatment and cancer. It is best treated with regular exercise and good nutrition. Fatigue may make you feel: worn out, tired, sleepy, no energy can't concentrate or think lack of interest in doing anything with friends or family no interest in sex or being intimate with your partner depressed, disconnected or not interested in anything short of breath What can cause fatigue? weight loss stress cancer treatment cancer poor nutrition or getting enough calories and protein changes in your daily schedule or interrupted sleep schedule How can I manage my fatigue? Stay as active as possible before and during treatment. Exercise may be a simple walk once or twice daily. See Physical Activity (page 34) for more ideas Set a goal of 8 hours night time sleep. A good sleep is more likely when you go to bed at the same time every night and follow a routine. Pace yourself day by day. Prioritize and plan your activities according to how you feel that day. You may not be able to do everything on your list so decide what's most important for you and ask for help from others to complete the remaining tasks. Eat smaller, more frequent meals and snacks Eat a balanced diet, with protein rich foods Ask to speak to a registered dietitian to learn how nutrition can help manage fatigueFor more information on how to manage cancer-related fatigue, visit bit.ly/fatigue-videos Get more tips at from the booklet How to Manage Cancer-Related Fatigue at your cancer centre or online at www. cancercarealberta.ca Christine's Tip ~ cancer survivor: \"I booked appointments with myself to go for walks. This really helped, especially when I was exhausted and knew it was the only thing that would help get my energy back. I couldn't break a date with myself!\" 21 Possible Side Effects Fertility Fertility is the ability to get someone pregnant or to get pregnant and carry a child to a healthy birth. Cancer and cancer treatment can sometimes damage the reproductive organs such as the ovaries and testicles. These changes can have short-term or long-term effects on your fertility. Cancer treatment can cause changes to the reproductive organs like: decreased sperm quality, number, and motility irregular periods, or it may stop women from having periods early menopause Talk to your doctor or visit: www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment \u00bb Managing Side Effects \u00bb Sexual Health Questions to get the conversation started: How will my cancer treatments affect my fertility? What are my fertility preservation options? How will I know if I am fertile after treatment? If I don't preserve my fertility before treatments, what are my options after treatment? Do I have a type of cancer that can be passed on to my children? After my cancer treatments finish, how long do I need to wait before becoming pregnant or fathering a child? Before you start your treatment , check with your healthcare team to find out what your options are for preserving your fertility. Possible Side Effects 22 Pain Cancer can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. You may feel pain all of the time or only some of the time. Only you know how much pain you feel and how it affects you. Getting relief from your pain is important. Treating your pain will help you: Sleep and eat better Enjoy time with family and friends Do your work and hobbies Pain is different for everyone but the symptoms are similar depending on where it is coming from. If you can tell your healthcare team how it feels, it will help us figure out how to treat it quicker . Bone pain \u2014 a deep throbbing pain that can be sharp at times. It may get worse when you move around.Neuropathic pain \u2014 may feel like a burning, shooting, piercing, stabbing or like an electric current. It might feel like pins and needles or tingling. It is caused from damage to your nerves. It can hurt when things like clothing, water or wind touch your skin.Visceral pain \u2014 might feel like a dull, deep squeezing pain. It is caused from damage to the organs inside your body. It can be hard to tell exactly where the pain is coming from. What causes cancer-related pain? cancer tumour or symptom stress or anxiety cancer treatments medical procedures and tests other symptoms like constipation or nausea other health factors emotional, social and spiritual impact of cancer medicationsYou do not have to accept uncontrolled pain as a normal part of living with cancer. Tell your healthcare team if you have pain so they can help you manage it properly. Some people think they should save their pain medication in case the pain gets worse later. Pain should be treated early, so make sure you take the medication as prescribed. Your doctor can change your dose of pain medication, or the type of medication you take if you need. Continued on next page23 Possible Side Effects What can I do to manage my pain? Take your medications as prescribed. Sometimes it may take more than 1 type of medication to help decrease and control your pain. Talk to your pharmacist if you have a hard time remembering what medications to take and when \u2014 they may have helpful suggestions. Keep track of when you take your pain medications \u2014 this will help to see if the dose is the right amount for you or if it needs to change. Be active and exercise. Even a small amount of exercise, such as walking up and down your hallway, will help with your pain. Find support. It is normal to feel upset and frustrated when you are in pain. You can find support in your community, with family and friends, and through your healthcare team. Relaxing activities and managing stress may help to control your pain. There may be other treatments to help you but it is important to speak with your healthcare team before you try them. Is it normal to feel nervous about taking pain medications? Some people do not take pain medications because they worry about getting addicted. If you take your medication as your doctor prescribed, you should not worry. Addiction happens when a person takes medications for reasons other than pain. Side effects of pain medications: Nausea and vomiting Drowsiness Constipation Possible Side Effects 24 Problems with Memory It is common for people with cancer to have problems remembering things, or taking a longer time to understand information. This is called \"brain fog\". Often it's temporary, but sometimes it can last months to years after treatment is done. Things that can sometimes cause brain fog are: Medications Dehydration - not drinking enough fluids Anxiety Fatigue Depression Impaired sleep Signs and symptoms of brain fog are: Difficulty: focusing, concentrating, and paying attention remembering names, phone numbers, or words understanding information understanding directions problem solving like doing simple math or balancing a check bookFeeling: like your thoughts are jumbled and words are difficult to find when you are speaking confused What can I do to help with brain fog? Write things down in a journal Make lists Complete a task before you start another one Keep a calendar of when you have appointments and important events Get adequate sleep Drink enough fluids and eat a healthy diet (page 32) Physical Activity (page 33) Put things back in the same spot you always do, for example keep car keys in the same drawerIf you notice any of these symptoms, please tell your healthcare team. 25 Possible Side Effects Sexuality and Intimacy Sexual health affects people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, cultures and beliefs.
