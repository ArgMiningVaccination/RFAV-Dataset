This sickness sets in with every attempt to get clean can be the greatest obstacles to recovery. Although physical dependence and addiction are not precisely the same thing, we know how they go hand in hand and that recovery from addiction cannot even be approached until the physical dependence is broken. At IMI Addiction Medicine (IMI-AM), we have vast experience and expertise in the medical management of withdrawal syndromes from every dependence inducing drug. What Is A \"Detox Program\"? When we refer to \"detox\" in terms of addiction treatment we are actually describing the often uncomfortable and sometimes medically challenging syndrome of withdrawal that the body and mind experience when the drug of abuse is withdrawn. When we \"detox\" a patient we prescribe precise and effective medication to alleviate all of the unpleasant symptoms of withdrawal. By doing this we are removing a powerful obstacle to healing and making recovery possible, because it is only after detox that recovery begins. Our goal at IMI Addiction Medicine is to accomplish detox in the simplest but most effective way. A Supportive Program For Drug And Alcohol Detox Our goal at IMI-AM is to accomplish detox in the simplest but most effective way. Our services range from office based, to outpatient or inpatient detox treatments. Below are some of the types of drugs we have encountered and conquered, some on a daily basis, with excellent results and ever improving increase of opiate abuse and dependence is the primary reason that drug overdose surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of death among young adults since 2014. Whether the result of medically prescribed painkillers or previously rare middle-class experimentation with fentanyl spiked heroin, opiate addiction is a deadly epidemic. Utilizing a specially designed buprenorphine is extra safe in an expertly designed taper to deliver safe and comfortable opioid withdrawal management. Benzodiazepine Detox Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Klonopin. These drugs were never intended for long term use but their over-prescription and over-use has brought many people to a dangerous place of crippling dependence. Although these drugs are indeed powerful anxiolytics, studies show that long term use actually worsens overall anxiety. And withdrawal from benzodiazepines can not only bring nightmarish symptoms of overwhelming anxiety and insomnia, in severe cases it can cause seizure, coma and death. Yet, carefully monitored, tapering doses of reliable medication can bring about a safe and comfortable, outpatient liberation from the bondage of sedative dependence. Often, the patients granted freedom from sedative dependence at IMI-AM take advantage of the world class care of our addiction specialist, led by Dr. Gary Ruelas, to achieve lasting and safe treatment of their anxiety and other mood disorders. Alcohol Detox After tobacco, the number one cause of sickness and death among addictive drugs is good old fashioned, fully legal alcohol - available absolutely everywhere you go. Alcohol withdrawal, like sedative withdrawal, can be severe and lead to medical emergency. We have found that, after carefully determining the safety of each case, that alcohol withdrawal can quite often be managed in an outpatient setting, perhaps in a majority of cases. Dr. Ruelas is MCV trained physician/neuropsychologist and take the greatest care to ensure the safety and comfort of our patients seeking help with getting sober. Kratom Detox A new and controversial, psychoactive plant product from Southeast Asia that narrowly missed being outlawed recently by the DEA, kratom is promoted and sold as a \"natural high\" or even an aid in opiate detox. In truth it contains a powerful chemical called mitragynin that stimulates opioid and other receptors in the central nervous system and can be powerfully addictive with a wicked physical dependence. Kratom withdrawal can be like a combination of opioid and sedative withdrawal, not something anyone would want to face alone. DXM, high potency hashish, bath salts, research chemicals We have seen it all and can help you, no matter what. Detox alone has never been shown to bring real and lasting recovery from addiction. All detox services at IMI-AM are tied to a full and ongoing plan of treatment and recovery support. At IMI-AM we support you to take the first step, improve your mental health and stop risking your life. How Medical Detoxification Can Help For most addicts, the miserable physical, mental and emotional deluge that inevitably comes with any attempt to get clean makes it so hard to gather the courage and energy to try one more time to escape the prison of addiction. We want to completely remove this obstacle and we know it can be done. In fact, our philosophy is that suffering through withdrawal never prevented any addict from relapsing, but the fear of it keeps so many living in miserable captivity. We want to make getting clean as easy as possible. - - Take The First Step - Your brain can't heal until you stop using. Getting clean puts you on the path to real recovery from the disease of addiction; it makes recovery possible. - Improve Your Mental Health - The constant barrage we unleash on our brains when we abuse drugs can make mental health issues impossible to solve. Accurate diagnosis and effective psychiatric care are impossible with drugs scrambling the signal. In fact, chronic use of alcohol and drugs can often create mental illness where no organic illness really exists. - Stop Risking Your Life - Every time a person is intoxicated with drugs or alcohol, they become a danger to themselves and to everyone around them. Every time you go back out there to get more you risk your safety, you put yourself in harms way, and you risk the lifelong consequences of being on the wrong side of the law. Prevent significant complications from occurring in the future. Interested in One of Our Effective Medical Drug Detoxification Treatments?
