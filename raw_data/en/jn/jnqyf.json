But most sore throats are caused by a minor illness and go away without medical treatment. Several conditions can cause a sore throat. Viral infections Sore throats may be caused by a viral illness, such as: - The common cold. Colds are the most common type of [viral infection](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stv15687#stv15687-sec). - Infection of the voice box ( [laryngitis](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.zm6119#zm6119-sec)). [Mononucleosis](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stm159638#stm159638-sec). This is also called mono, or \"the kissing disease.\" It's a viral infection that tends to cause a persistent sore throat. - Other viral infections, such as [mumps](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stm159632#stm159632-sec), [herpangina](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.d77718398#d77718398-sec), or [influenza](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sti150769#sti150769-sec). Bacterial infections A [bacterial infection](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stb117002#stb117002-sec) may also cause a sore throat. These kind of infections include: [Strep throat](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts15170#sts15170-sec). Strep throat usually does not cause congestion or a cough. - Inflammation or infection of the tonsils ( [tonsillitis](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.ut1057#ut1057-sec)) and sometimes the adenoids (adenoiditis). - the tissues around the tonsils [peritonsillar abscess](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.hw54290#hw54290-sec)). - Inflammation of Inflammation of the uvula ( [uvulitis](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tw12593#tw12593-sec)). - In rare cases, a [sexually transmitted infection (STI)](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts14709#sts14709-sec), such as [gonorrhea](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stg124257#stg124257-sec)or [chlamydia](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stc123684#stc123684-sec). These infections can happen if you've engaged in high-risk sexual behavior. Irritants and injuries A sore throat that lasts longer than a week is often caused by irritants or an injury. Examples include: - Throat irritation from low humidity, smoking, air pollution, yelling, or nasal drainage down the back of the throat ( [postnasal drip](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tp12162#tp12162-sec)). - Breathing through your mouth when you have allergies or a stuffy nose. - Stomach acid that backs up into the throat. This may be a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( [GERD](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stg124308#stg124308-sec)). GERD often occurs with [heartburn](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sth149644#sth149644-sec), an acid taste in your mouth, or a cough . But sometimes a sore throat is the only symptom. - An injury to the back of the throat. Examples include a cut or puncture from falling with a pointed object in your mouth. Treatment for a sore throat Treatment for a sore throat depends on the cause. You may be able to use home treatment to get relief. Because viral illnesses are the most common cause of a sore throat, it's important not to use antibiotics to treat them. Antibiotics do not help with viral infections. Using an antibiotic when you don't need to exposes you to other risks, such as having an [allergic reaction](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sta123211#sta123211-sec) and having side effects from the medicine. Examples of side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and yeast infections. Antibiotics also may kill good (beneficial) bacteria and allow [antibiotic-resistant](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.std139567#std139567-sec) bacteria to grow. For sore throats caused by strep, treatment with antibiotics may be needed. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or nonbinary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [How sick](#tf6955)do you think your baby is? [trouble breathing](#abj7487)? [clearing the nose with or mild](#tf6940)? [dehydrated](#tf7095)? [severe, moderate, or mild](#tf6938)? [drooling and unable to swallow, cry, or make sounds](#tf6956)? [symptoms of difficulty breathing in an older child](#abj7485)may be different than [symptoms in a baby or young child](#abj7487). [severe, moderate, or mild](#tf6940)? [drooling and not nose)? [severe, moderate, [dehydrated](#tf7088)? [symptoms in an adult or older child](#tf6937)are different than the [symptoms in a baby or toddler](#tf6938). [how you took the temperature](#tf6957). [How high](#tf7100)do you think fever is? [weakens his immune system](#tf6964)? [how you took temperature](#tf6945). [How high](#tf7018)do fever is? [weakens your immune system](#tf6944)? [Signs of pain in a baby or toddler](#tf7019)are different than [signs of pain in an older child or adult](#tf7017). Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, herbal remedies, or supplements can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel. Try Home Treatment You have answered all the questions. Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home. - Try home treatment to relieve the symptoms. - Call your doctor if symptoms get worse or you have any concerns (for example, if symptoms are not getting better as you would expect). You may need care sooner. Symptoms of difficulty breathing can range from mild to severe. For example: - You may feel a little out of breath but still be able to talk (mild difficulty breathing), or you may be so out of breath that you cannot talk at all (severe difficulty breathing). - It may be getting hard to breathe with activity (mild difficulty breathing), or you may have to work very hard to breathe even when you're at rest (severe difficulty breathing). Symptoms of difficulty breathing in a baby or young child can range from mild to severe. For example: - The child may be breathing a little faster than usual (mild difficulty breathing), or the child may be having so much trouble that the nostrils are flaring and the belly is moving in and out with every breath (severe difficulty breathing). - The child may seem a little out of breath but is still able to eat or talk (mild difficulty breathing), or the child may be breathing so hard that he or she cannot eat or talk (severe difficulty breathing). Pain in children under 3 years It can be hard to tell how much pain a baby or toddler is in. - Severe pain (8 to 10): The pain is so bad that the baby cannot sleep, cannot get comfortable, and cries constantly no matter what you do. The baby may kick, make fists, or grimace. - Moderate pain (5 to 7): The baby is very fussy, clings to you a lot, and may have trouble sleeping but responds when you try to comfort him or her. - Mild pain (1 to 4): The baby is a little fussy and clings to you a little but responds when you try to comfort him or her. Pain in adults and older children - Severe pain (8 to 10): The pain is so bad that you can't stand it for more than a few hours, can't sleep, and can't do anything else except focus on the pain. - Moderate pain (5 to 7): The pain is bad enough to disrupt your normal activities and your sleep, but you can tolerate it for hours or days. Moderate can also mean pain that comes and goes even if it's severe when it's there. - Mild pain (1 to 4): You notice the pain, but it is not bad enough to disrupt your sleep or activities. Severe trouble breathing means: - The child cannot eat or talk because he or she is breathing so hard. - The child's nostrils are flaring and the belly is moving in and out with every breath. - The child seems to be tiring out. - The child seems very sleepy or confused. Moderate trouble breathing means: - The child is breathing a lot faster than usual. - The child has to take breaks from eating or talking to breathe. - The nostrils flare or the belly moves in and out at times when the child breathes. Mild trouble breathing means: - The child is breathing a little faster than usual. - The child seems a little out of breath but can still eat or talk. Severe trouble breathing means: - You cannot talk at all. - You have to work very hard to breathe. - You feel like you can't get enough air. - You do not feel alert or cannot think clearly. Moderate trouble breathing means: - It's hard to talk in full sentences. - It's hard to breathe with activity. Mild trouble breathing means: - You feel a little out of breath but can still talk. - It's becoming hard to breathe with activity. Temperature varies a little depending on how you measure it. For adults and children age 12 and older, these are the ranges for high, moderate, and mild, according to how you took the temperature. Oral (by mouth) temperature - High: 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) and Mild: 100.3\u00b0F scanner is usually 0.5\u00b0F (0.3\u00b0C) to 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) lower than an oral temperature. Ear temperature - High: 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C) and Mild: 99.3\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C) and lower Certain health conditions and medicines weaken the immune system's ability to fight off infection and illness. Some examples in children are: - Diseases such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and congenital heart disease. - Steroid medicines, which are used to treat a variety of conditions. - Medicines taken after organ transplant. - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. - Not having a spleen. If you're not sure if a fever is high, moderate, or mild, think about these issues: With a high fever: - You feel very hot. - It is likely one of the highest fevers you've ever had. High fevers are not that common, especially in adults. With a moderate fever: - You feel warm or hot. - You know you have a fever. With a mild fever: - You may feel a little warm. - You think you might have a fever, but you're not sure. Certain health conditions and medicines weaken the immune system's ability to fight off infection and illness. Some examples in adults are: - Diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS. - Long-term alcohol and drug problems. - Steroid medicines, which may be used to treat a variety of conditions. - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. - Other medicines used to treat autoimmune disease. - Medicines taken after organ transplant. - Not having a spleen. Sudden drooling and trouble swallowing can be signs of a serious problem called epiglottitis. This problem can happen at any age. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue at the back of the throat that you can't see when you look in the mouth. When you swallow, it closes to keep food and fluids out of the tube (trachea) that leads to the lungs. If the epiglottis becomes inflamed or infected, it can swell and quickly block the airway. This makes it very hard to breathe. The symptoms start suddenly. A person with epiglottitis is likely to seem very sick, have a fever, drool, and have trouble breathing, swallowing, and making sounds. In the case of a child, you may notice the child trying to sit up and lean forward with his or her jaw forward, because it's easier to breathe in this position. Babies can quickly get dehydrated when they lose fluids because of problems like vomiting or fever. Symptoms of dehydration can range from mild to severe. For example: - The baby may be fussy or cranky (mild dehydration), or the baby may be very sleepy and hard to wake up (severe dehydration). - The baby may have a little less urine than usual (mild dehydration), or the baby may not be urinating at all (severe dehydration). Severe dehydration means: - The baby may be very sleepy and hard to wake up. - The baby may have a very dry mouth and very dry eyes (no tears). - The baby may have no wet diapers in 12 or more hours. Moderate dehydration means: - The baby may have no wet diapers in 6 hours. - The baby may have a dry mouth and dry eyes (fewer tears than usual). Mild dehydration means: - The baby may pass a little less urine than usual. If you're not sure if a child's fever is high, moderate, or mild, think about these issues: With a high fever: - The child feels very hot. - It is likely one of the highest fevers the child has ever had. With a moderate fever: - The child feels warm or hot. - You are sure the child has a fever. With a mild fever: - The child may feel a little warm. - You think the child might have a fever, but you're not sure. Temperature varies a little depending on how you measure it. For children up to 11 years old, here are the ranges for high, moderate, and mild according to how you took the temperature. Oral (by mouth), ear, or rectal temperature - High: 104\u00b0 F (40\u00b0 C) and higher - Moderate: 100.4\u00b0 C) 103.9\u00b0 F (39.9\u00b0 C) - Mild: 100.3\u00b0 F (37.9\u00b0 C) and lower A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5\u00b0 F (0.3\u00b0 C) to 1\u00b0 F (0.6\u00b0 C) lower than an oral temperature. Armpit (axillary) temperature - High: 103\u00b0 F (39.5\u00b0 C) Moderate: 99.4\u00b0 C) 102.9\u00b0 F (39.4\u00b0 Mild: 99.3\u00b0 F (37.3\u00b0 C) and lower Note: For children under 5 years old, rectal temperatures are the most accurate. A baby that is extremely sick: - May be limp and floppy like a rag doll. - May not respond at all to being held, touched, or talked to. - May be hard to wake up. A baby that is sick (but not extremely sick): - May be sleepier than usual. - May not eat or drink as much as usual. You can get dehydrated when you lose a lot of fluids because of problems like vomiting or fever. Symptoms of dehydration can range from mild to severe. For example: - You may feel tired and edgy (mild dehydration), or you may feel weak, not alert, and not able to think clearly (severe dehydration). - You may pass less urine than usual (mild dehydration), or you may not be passing urine at all (severe dehydration). Severe dehydration means: - Your mouth and eyes may be extremely dry. - You may pass little or no urine for 12 or more hours. - You may not feel alert or be able to think clearly. - You may be too weak or dizzy to stand. - You may pass out. Moderate dehydration means: - You may be a lot more thirsty than usual. - Your mouth and eyes may be drier than usual. - You may pass little or no urine for 8 or more hours. - You may feel dizzy when you stand or sit up. Mild dehydration means: - You may be more thirsty than usual. - You may pass less urine than usual. You can use a small rubber bulb (called an aspirating bulb) to remove mucus from your baby's nose or mouth when a cold or allergies make it hard for the baby to eat, sleep, or breathe. To use the bulb: - Put a few saline nose drops in each side of the baby's nose before you start. - Position the baby with his or her head tilted slightly back. - Squeeze the round base of the bulb. - Gently insert the tip of the bulb tightly inside the baby's nose. - Release the bulb to remove (suction) mucus from the nose. Don't do this more than 5 or 6 times a day. Doing it too often can make the congestion worse and can also cause the lining of the nose to swell or bleed.

It can help reduce swelling and relieve discomfort. Gargle with 1/2 tsp of salt dissolved in 1 cup of warm water. If you have postnasal drip, gargle often to prevent more throat irritation. - Drink fluids. Fluids may help thin secretions and soothe an irritated throat. Hot fluids, such as tea or soup, may help decrease throat irritation. - Try moist air. Try a [vaporizer or humidifier](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.zj1490#zj1490-sec)to add moisture to the room. Warm or cool mist may help relieve symptoms. Follow all cleaning instructions and precautions for the machine. - Try medicines for a stuffy nose. You can try a [decongestant](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sig48021#aco0774)or a [steroid nasal spray](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.abg7041#abg7041-sec)if you have a stuffy nose (congestion). These medicines make it easier to breathe by shrinking swollen mucous membranes in the nose. This helps let air pass through. They also help relieve a runny nose and [postnasal drip](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tp12162#tp12162-sec), which can cause a sore throat. These medicines may not be safe for young children or for people who have certain health problems. Before you use them, check the label. If you do use these medicines, always follow the directions about how much to use based on age and, in some cases, weight. - Use nonprescription throat lozenges. Medicated throat lozenges or sprays have medicine (local anesthetic) that numbs the throat to soothe pain. Hard candy may also help. Think about buying the sugar-free kind. - Don't smoke. Don't use other tobacco products either. And avoid [secondhand smoke](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts14447#sts14447-sec). When to call for help during self-care Call a doctor if any of the following occur during self-care at home: - New or worse trouble breathing. - Being unable to drink fluids. - New rash or fever. - Severe pain. - Symptoms occur more often or are more severe.
