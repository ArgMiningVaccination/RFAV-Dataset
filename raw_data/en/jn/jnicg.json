At the time, the WHO noted that vaccine hesitancy, defined as \"the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,\" threatened to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio.1 The WHO's warning came nearly a year before the first cases of COVID-19 were identified and two years before a vaccine was available in the U.S. Today, vaccine hesitancy is a common and controversial topic across kitchen and exam tables alike. Increasingly, it's become a complicating factor in providing the best care to hematology patients. \"Pre-COVID, we routinely talked about getting the flu shot, getting your pneumonia shot, and so that's not a new conversation. We've had that for a long time and there's always been some hesitancy there and we've encouraged people,\" said Gabrielle Rocque, MD, an associate professor of medicine in the Divisi on of Hematology and Oncology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who recently performed an analysis of cancer patients' acceptance of the COVID vaccine. \"It's different this time, though, because the stakes are so much higher.\" For patients with blood cancers, those stakes include a higher risk for severe illness and death than what is seen in the general population. A recent analysis of more than 1,000 patients in the ASH Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology revealed that 17% of patients with hematologic malignancies who had a COVID-19 infection died from the COVID-related illness.2 This is more than a 10-fold increase in risk compared with the general U.S. population, for which the case fatality rate is about 1.2%, according to information from Johns Hopkins University.3 Dr. Rocque recalled a recent encounter with a patient who came to her office citing a series of articles that she said supported her decision not to be vaccinated against COVID-19. While Dr. Rocque said she normally encourages patients to bring in any information they want to discuss about their treatment, the conversations about COVID vaccination have been different because of the sheer volume of misinformation about COVID, as compared to false or misleading information on cancer treatments. The other difference is trust, she said. \"This is the first time that I can think of in my practice where we are dealing with a lot of patients who don't really trust us in some ways. It's difficult when I'm recommending a life-saving treatment - because that's what the vaccine is - and having them be very dismissive of it,\" she said. Drivers of Vaccine Hesitancy At the beginning of December 2020, around the time the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) surveyed more than 6,500 patients with blood cancers and survivors from its database about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The survey's topline finding - that 17% of respondents were unlikely or very unlikely to get vaccinated - sounded alarm bells about vaccine acceptance among this vulnerable population.4 The two most common reasons that respondents cited for not wanting to be vaccinated (both 54%) were side effects and concerns that the vaccine was not tested properly. The next most common response, cited by 47% of respondents unlikely to get the vaccine, was that it was too risky for their health. A follow-up survey, which was conducted in June 2021 and had not been published as of January 2022, found that among more than 6,300 patients with blood cancers and survivors, 89% had been vaccinated, explained Elisa S. Weiss, PhD, senior vice president of education, services, and health research at LLS. While the number of vaccine-hesitant respondents declined between the two surveys, some of the same concerns persisted. Among those who had not been vaccinated, nearly 60% said the vaccine was too risky for their health, with some believing that it could contribute to the spread of their cancer or interfere with their treatment. About 52%, down only slightly from the original survey, said they were worried about vaccine side effects. Notably, 51% of those who had not been vaccinated reported that their oncology provider had recommended against it. \"That could be true for any number of reasons, or it could be miscommunication, which we're seeing is not uncommon between patients and physicians, especially around COVID,\" Dr. Weiss said. The follow-up survey also collected \"trust\" data for the first time. \"Who do they trust the most? Their oncologist,\" Dr. Weiss said. In total, 89% trusted their oncologist for information about COVID and the vaccines. \"I think it's really important that oncologists are looked to for this information,\" she added. Dr. Rocque and her colleagues found even greater vaccine hesitancy when they analyzed survey responses from 429 past or current patients with cancer. The survey was conducted in December 2020 by the nonprofit Patient Advocate Foundation, a group that provides case management and financial aid to patients with chronic illness.5 Overall, 48% of respondents reported being \"unlikely/unsure\" about accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. The primary concerns were vaccine safety, reported by 32% of respondents, and concern about their health conditions, reported by 12% of respondents. Survey respondents who were vaccine hesitant were more likely to be Black, Indigenous, and people of color, between the ages of 36 and 55, and female. Having below average trust in the media also made respondents significantly less likely to accept vaccination, the researchers reported. After conducting the initial survey, the researchers added some questions and followed up on whether hesitant patients got vaccinated. \"Early in the pandemic, there was a lot of hesitancy,\" Dr. Rocque said. \"Ultimately many of those patients did go on to get the vaccine . . . [but] there were still a substantial portion of people that didn't, despite being high risk.\" Of those patients who remained unvaccinated, many raised concerns about how the vaccine would affect their cancer or their cancer treatment, Dr. Rocque said. Researchers at the University of Illinois conducted a similar survey on vaccine attitudes among 60 patients with hematologic malignancies, in which more than 70% of respondents identified as Black or Hispanic. Rates of vaccine hesitancy in December 2020-January 2021 were about 40%, but some of the reasons given differed from other surveys of patients with cancer. In this group, convenience of getting the vaccine and the potential price of the vaccine were important factors in deciding whether to be vaccinated.6 \"All together this highlights how in this patient population, factors related to financial toxicity and convenience are super important in making decisions, even despite knowing the importance of this intervention,\" said Karen Sweiss, PharmD, a clinical pharmacist at the University of Illinois and the lead author of the study, which was presented at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Patient Attitudes The results of another survey, which looked at attitudes among parents of patients with cancer and cancer survivors, reaffirmed the complexity of vaccine decision making when a chronic illness is involved. Researchers at Duke Cancer Institute partnered with Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation to conduct the survey from February-April 2021, as the COVID-19 vaccines were rolling out for adults but had not yet been authorized in children. In total, 130 families completed the survey.7 Nearly 30% of parents and caregivers said they were hesitant to vaccinate their child with cancer against COVID-19. For some hesitant parents, the major concern was the speed with which the vaccines were developed, said Kyle Walsh, PhD, an associate professor of neurosurgery and pediatrics at Duke who led the research team. This group wanted to adopt a \"wait-and-see\" approach until longer-term outcomes data in children became available. Another segment of the vaccine-hesitant parents had concerns related specifically to their child's cancer. These parents were concerned about potential vaccine side effects in their immunocompromised child, possibly without the benefit of generating an anti-COVID immune response. These parents noted that vaccine research was conducted in healthy children, not children with cancer or survivors of childhood cancer. \"The media has a tendency to want to portray vaccination decision making as being somewhat simplistic. The reality was, at least in our relatively small cohort, that these were highly informed parents,\" Dr. Walsh said. \"They recognize that currently there is not a ton of data, but many of them would change their decision on whether or not to vaccinate their child as those new data emerge, particularly if they show that the risk-benefit profile is favorable.\" Making the Case for Vaccines The survey data provide important insights into the patient perspective, as well as opportunities for persuading hesitant patients to be vaccinated, experts said. Dr. Weiss said the LLS survey highlighted that many patients with blood cancers still harbor misperceptions about the vaccines, including that there are significant side effects or that the vaccine is too risky for their health. \"That's something that oncologists can focus on,\" she said. \"There is a relatively small number of blood cancer patients who should not be receiving the vaccine right now because of their current treatment, which will block their ability to fully respond to the vaccine. However, current evidence suggests that the vaccines are just as safe for patients with blood cancer as they are for the general population, and there is no evidence that the vaccines interfere with treatment.\" Lee Greenberger, PhD, chief scientific officer at LLS, said that in a large study with more than 1,000 patients with blood cancer, about 25% failed to mount an antibody response after the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia most likely not to have an antibody response to vaccination.8 Treatment with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab, which eliminate B cells, can also block an antibody response. However, a third dose of the vaccine appears to help jumpstart antibody response in some of these patients. In total, 43% of patients whose disease failed to respond to the initial vaccine regimen were producing antibodies after a third dose, according to research presented at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting.9 \"For those who are worried that the vaccine won't protect them, we have plenty of data now showing who it is likely to protect,\" Dr. Greenberger said. For Dr. Rocque, one of the key takeaways of her survey research was that while many patients had distrust of institutions and the media, many also continued to trust their physicians. \"Many of these patients are still citing that their physician is their most trusted source of information . . . about their health conditions,\" she said. While some of Dr. Rocque's patients have disregarded her vaccination advice, she said it hasn't been the norm. Dr. Rocque said she tries to bring up the COVID vaccine with every patient at every visit, unless she knows they have completed all their doses and boosters. With boosters especially, patients are often waiting to get reassurance from their oncologist that they should go ahead with another vaccination. For those patients who are truly hesitant, Dr. Rocque said she frames the conversation in the context of their overall cancer treatment goals. \"I bring it up and I say, 'I recommend this because I care about how you do. We're treating your cancer to help you live longer and live better and I want you to be able to do that. It would be really sad if you end up having a major complication or passing away from COVID in spite of all the other things that you're doing to take care of yourself,'\" she said. \"I really do bring it back into that context. For some people it's successful.\" Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients Who Are Immunocompromised To help hematologists advise their patients on COVID-19 vaccination, ASH has compiled a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that review the special considerations and current recommendations for individuals who are immunocompromised. The document, which is updated regularly, features a list of currently authorized/approved vaccines in the U.S., factors affecting vaccine response in hematology-oncology patients, current recommendations for a third dose of vaccine in immunocompromised patients and the related dosing intervals, and the impact of breakthrough infections and monoclonal antibody treatment on the timing of additional vaccine doses. The FAQ also addresses general principles such as the timing of vaccination in relation to providing chemotherapy, transplant, antibody therapy, and splenectomy. For instance, for patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy, ASH advises vaccination six months after the patient has been taken off therapy to increase the likelihood of developing an immune response. Inactivated vaccines have shown low incremental risks for graft-versus-host disease, so they can generally be started three to six months after allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation. \"If SARS-CoV-2 infection rates are low in a community and a given patient is expected to have improved immune status in upcoming months, clinical judgment is appropriate when weighing the desire for protection as early as possible versus delaying vaccination to give the best chance for response,\" the FAQs state. \"Most experts recommend vaccination if the vaccine is safe for use, even if the expected protection rate is lower than the general population.\" ASH has also partnered with the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) on a separate FAQ addressing special considerations for COVID-19 vaccination in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.

John Burke, MD, a hematology-oncology specialist at Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Aurora, Colorado, also makes it a point to bring up COVID-19 vaccination at every visit. While the large majority of his patients have been enthusiastic about the vaccine, he's encountered several patients who did not want to be vaccinated. Many of the reasons boiled down to \"mistrust of the system\" or a mistaken belief that they were at low risk from COVID, he said. For patients who seem persuadable, Dr. Burke said he makes the case for the vaccine by focusing on the data, explaining that the benefits outweigh the risks. \"For those who come to me asking for my opinion, I will pull up the original articles in The New England Journal of Medicine and show them the data about how effective the vaccines appear to be.\" He also tells his patients with hematologic malignancies that they are at high risk for poor outcomes if they develop COVID-19. \"I tell them that in my practice I've lost count of how many patients I've lost to COVID-19. I've probably lost way more patients to COVID-19 than I have to actual cancer in the last two years,\" Dr. Burke said. \"I think that's another thing that may help my patients to recognize the severity of the disease in them and how high risk they are.\" Hesitancy Among Patients With SCD Julie Kanter, MD, director of the Adult Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an associate professor in the division of hematology and oncology, has seen a lot of vaccine hesitancy among her patients with sickle cell disease. Age is certainly a factor, with patients ages 20-40 being less likely to choose to be vaccinated. But a lack of information is also a big driver, she said. For that reason, she focuses on sharing vaccine information that they may not have heard before, such as the large number of people who were enrolled in vaccine trials. \"I think people truly don't realize that this vaccine was tested with more people than any other vaccine ever had been prior to release,\" Dr. Kanter said. \"So, I explain a lot about how things happened, how we get drugs approved, but also how vaccines are normally tested over years and since we didn't have years, they went out and tested this on thousands of people as opposed to the hundreds that would have gotten it before. That's been fairly impactful.\" For patients who are concerned about how the vaccine will affect their sickle cell disease, those are generally easier conversations, and those patients can be persuaded to be vaccinated when given more information. Dr. Kanter said she also shares with patients that she chose to have her children vaccinated against COVID-19. \"That does seem to be something that resonates somewhat with them. They understand that I wouldn't have done anything I didn't trust in my kids,\" she said. In some cases, the vaccine hesitancy conversation is about more than just the data. \"This is a very emotional topic,\" Dr. Weiss said. \"[Patients] are scared and I think recognizing the fear and that it's emotional is important, too. This is not just about presenting facts; it's presenting them with information but also understanding their fears.\" Protecting the Doctor-Patient Relationship COVID-19 has taken a dramatic toll on the health-care workforce. Continuous conversations about vaccines, in which patients sometimes outright reject medical advice, can also affect the doctor-patient relationship. \"It's really hard; I almost don't have another word for it,\" Dr. Kanter said. \"We spend a lot of time with our patients feeling like we fight for them, so it's hard to have their disbelief. I think it's been trying on us in a lot of ways.\" Despite the challenges, Dr. Kanter urged physicians not to let vaccine hesitancy or refusal damage the physician-patient relationship. \"This is not something that should come between you and your patients, recognizing that they likely have gotten information that was different [from medical advice],\" she said. \"Our patients have a lot of reasons in a lot of respects to be distrustful. I get that. I would say that you keep trying, you don't stop recommending it, you don't stop bringing it up.\" Colleen Morton, MBBCh, section chief for classical hematology at Vanderbilt University and vice chair of the ASH Committee on Practice, said she has seen a decline in vaccine resistance as the pandemic has progressed. But the introduction of workplace vaccine mandates prompted some of her patients to reach out seeking medical exemptions from vaccination. Since none of her patients qualified for the exemption, she had to reject the requests. \"It is awkward when you have a relationship with someone and they come asking for a medical exemption,\" she said. \"I tell them that there are very few true medical exemptions, so medically/legally I can't write you a letter. It does hurt that relationship because they are coming to you for help. A lot of them are afraid to get it and you're not giving them what they thought they would get.\" But Dr. Morton said that in some ways the pandemic, and the discussions about vaccines, has helped to solidify the doctor-patient relationship. Most of the vaccine questions she gets are around concerns over potential blood clotting issues. She counsels her patients that COVID-19 itself poses a higher risk of blood clots than any of the vaccines. \"Most of them were reassured and went ahead and got the vaccine,\" Dr. Morton said. Dr. Burke said he tries to not take rejection of vaccine advice personally, just as he doesn't let it affect the doctor-patient relationship when a patient disagrees with his cancer treatment advice. \"I've always had the philosophy that my role as a physician is to educate patients about their options and the benefits and risks of each of those options. Most of the time the patients agree with those recommendations, but sometimes they don't and sometimes they do their own thing,\" he said. \"The vaccine is really another example of that. I make recommendations, but until our government says they have to do this and it's mandatory, it's their body and they get to make the choice.\" The only difference, he noted, is that when patients choose to reject the vaccine, they are missing out on the social benefit of protecting others from the spread of the virus.
