In recent years, the pendulum has changed directions in response to a growing de-mand for cosmetic products that contain natural ingredients. In many instances, manufacturers have responded by em- ploying modern technology to enhance the beneficial effects ofnatural substances or to minimize or eliminate potentially detri-mental effects. Today, myriad examples of\"improved\" natural ingredients can be foundin the field of cosmetics, including: Soy. In its natural state, soybeans have specific, active, non-denatured componentsthat have documented benefits for the skin.Advances in cosmetic manufacturing usingspecialized propriety processing ensures thatthe integrity of the soy is maintained afterprocessing so that the benefits of the natur-al ingredients are delivered to the skin. Soyhas many beneficial skin components in-cluding antioxidants, lipids which moistur-ize to smooth skin texture and proteinswhich help in skin depigmentation. Feverfew. Valued in folklore medicine as an herbal treatment for fever and headache,topical cosmetics containing feverfew can help in reducing (or al-leviating) facial redness and skin irritation. However, feverfew con-tains a parthenolide component which is a potential sensitizer,but removal of the parthenolide allows for the antioxidant andanti-irritant benefits of the herb to be available safely to the skin. Oatmeal. Oatmeal baths have long been recommended for patients with a variety of sensitive skin conditions, providinga soothing, comforting effect while enhancing the protectivebarrier and promoting improved skin health. Development ofcolloidal oatmeal, a coarse version of the popular grain, has ledto multiple applications in cosmetics and cosmetic dermatol-ogy. Colloidal oatmeal has a texture and protein and lipid con-tent that makes it well suited for use in moisturizers, topicalanti-inflammatory compounds, cleansing soaps, and otherproducts that help clean, soothe, and preserve the skin. Retinol. A modified derivative of vitamin A, retinol has won favor as a key ingredient in topical preparations for wrinkles,age lines, and other age-related skin conditions. Advances intechnology have resulted in well-stabilized formulations andimproved delivery of retinol to the skin. The cosmetics industry's ability to improve products with mod- ified natural ingredients hints at the research that underlies mod-ern product development. Critics of the current enthusiasm for natural or organic skin care products often scoff at what they per-ceive as a lack of research basis for these products. In reality, mostof these products have evolved from an extensive research back-ground, both in the laboratory and in the clinic. Unfortunately, the supporting research data for cosmetic products often is difficult to locate. Some of the work has re-mained unpublished. Some has involved proprietary informa- tion that manufacturers are reluctant toshare publicly. However, in many cases, theresearch has been done and can be found byanyone who has sufficient motivation to lookfor it. For example, an investigation of a soy-derived serine protease inhibitor demon-strated (PAR-2) mightoffer an effective new approach to depig-mentation. 1A similar study showed that soymilk may also inhibit PAR-2 and inducedepigmentation. 2 More recently, a topical total soy prepa- ration was evaluated as a potential treatmentfor photodamaged skin. 3The 12-week study showed that daily treatment the soypreparation led to significant ( P<0.05) im- provement in multiple parameters, including facial skin bright-ness, smoothness, overall skin tone and texture, mottled hy-perpigmentation, and wrinkling. Dermatology investigatorsnoted improvement within 2 weeks of initiating treatment. In my column \"Cosmeceutical Critique,\" which has been pub- lished monthly in S KIN AND ALLERGY NEWSfor more than 5 years, I discuss the research on the various \"natural\" cosmetic ingredi-ents. My goal is to make this research more accessible to anyoneinterested in skin care. In this manner, it will become obvious tothe reader which ingredients have research to support their mar-keting claims and which ones do not. Obviously, the manufac-turing technology and the products have continued to improveover the past 5 years, and all of the latest developments mightnot be captured in the following summaries. For an overview ofsome of the recent developments, go to http://www.aveeno.com. A major obstacle to cosmetics clinical research relates to the inherent difficulties of clinical studies. A well-designed clini-cal study has carefully matched experimental and controlgroups, which can be difficult to achieve in that patients in thetwo groups would have to exhibit nearly identical skin char-acteristics, including similar types and degrees of aging, envi-Introduction Applying Nature to Dermatology Practice Leslie Baumann, MD Continued on page 232MJJCOS_9_11_06.qxd 9/11/2006 8:14 PM Page 3In Western culture, rosemary is regarded primarily, if not ex- clusively, as a spice. It is typically used to flavor food and somebeverages but is increasingly included as an ingredient in cos- metic products. Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L. ) is cultivated throughout the world and is considered a common household herb. Thisaromatic evergreen shrub is native to western Asia and south-ern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean area (Indian J. Exp.Biol. 1999;37:124-30). In traditional or folk medicine dating as far back as 1,000 years, rosemary was used to treat headaches,colds, respiratory disorders, dysmenorrhea, and-as an antispasmodic-renal colic. Other tradi-tional uses were as rubefacient, and hair Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1999;37:124-30). Research conducted during the past 2 decades has shown that the herb exhibits significant po-tential for treating or preventing several med-ical conditions, including atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer,cataracts, ischemic heart disease, hepa-totoxicity, high phenolic content and correspondingly high antiox- idant activity characteristic of rosemary ethanolic extracts andessential oil are believed to be responsible for antimutagenic andhepatoprotective activities associated with this increasingly re-searched botanical (Int. J. Food Sci. Nutr. 1999;50:413-27). Antineoplastic Action Several other studies have shown that rosemary's extracts or theiractive constituents have anticarcinogenic properties, includingthe ability a decade ago, a wide-ranging evaluation of rosemary leaves showed that the plant inhibits tumor formation. Specifi-cally, a methanol extract of leaves applied to mouse skin inhib-ited the covalent binding of benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP) to epidermal DNA, as as tumor by BaP and 7,12-dimethyl-benz[ a]anthracene (DMBA) (Cancer Res. 1994;54:701-8). Furthermore, the investigators conducted a parallel study in which a group of mice was topically treated with BaP to ini-tiate and 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to pro- mote tumors while another group underwent the same treat-ment after first receiving topically applied rosemary extract. Application of 1.2 mg or 3.6 mg of rosemary extract low-ered the number of tumors per mouse by 54% and 64%, re- spectively. Rosemary was also found to inhibit inflammation,hyperplasia, and tumor promotion all induced by TPA, as wellas arachidonic acid-induced inflammation. In addition, the herb inhibited ornithine decarboxylase ac- tivity, which is interesting because this is the mechanism of ac-tion of the drug eflornithine (Vaniqa), which is approved bythe Food and Drug Administration for slowing hair growth(Cancer Res. 1994;54:701-8). When skin tumors were initiated by DMBA and promoted with TPA, treatment with rosemary concurrentwith TPA significantly inhibited the numberof TPA-induced tumors in a dose-dependentmanner. The investigators also found that the topical application of two constituents isolated fromrosemary\u2014carnosol and ursolic acid\u2014inhibit-ed TPA-induced ear inflammation and tumorpromotion, thus reducing the number of tu-mors per mouse in the initiation/promotion model (Cancer Res. 1994;54:701-8). In a study of the effects of rosemary extract on BaP-induced carcinogenesis in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B),the whole extract or equivalent concentrations of carnosol orcarnosic acid (the strongest antioxidant components of rosemary)effectively inhibited DNA adduct development. The researchers also noted that carnosol triggered expression of the phase II enzyme glutathione S-transferase, which detox- ifies a carcinogenic derivative of BaP . Rosemary and its con-stituents emerged from this study as viable components of achemopreventive anticarcinogenic approach, according to theinvestigators (Carcinogenesis 1995;16:2057-62). Carnosic acid displays antimutagenic activity in bacteria and anticarcinogenic activity in various cell and animal models, andhas been shown to inhibit the proliferation of HL60 and U937human myeloid leukemia cells without induction necrotic cell death (Nutr. Cancer 2001;41:135-44). Antioxidant Action A decade ago, the actions of rosemary in biologic systems andfoods were characterized as antioxidant compound inhibited superoxide anion production in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase acid protect- 44 Cosmeceutical Critique Compendium Rosemary2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 cells against oxidative hemolysis (Planta Med. 1995;61:333-6). The key constituents of rosemary are thought to be the phe- nolic acid caffeic acid and its derivatives such as rosmarinic acid,as well as carnosol and carnosic acid, all of which exhibit an-tioxidant activity. Rosmarinic acid, which is well absorbed via the gastroin- testinal tract and the skin, increases prostaglandin E 2produc- and decreases leukotriene B4 leukemia cell lines(Cancer Lett. 2001;170:33-9). In a study examining the roles of oxida- tive stress and sulfhydryl (SH) groups in heatshock protein 70 (HSP70) induction in hu-man skin fibroblasts and effect of antioxidants, rosemaryextract significantly protected against stress-induced alterationsof cellular SH and carbonyl content, allowing for stability inthe functional levels of cytoprotective HSP70. The authors concluded that the antioxidant activity of hy- drophilic rosemary extract has the potential to confer cosmet-ic benefits while efficiently reducing skin damage caused byfree radicals (Int. J. Tissue React. 2001;23:51-8). A great deal of other recent research has demonstrated that rosemary is a potent source of antioxidant activity Chem.2000;48:5548-56; Food Chem. Toxicol. 1996;34:449-56;Xenobiotica 1992;22:257-68). Indi-an J. demonstrated significant dermatologic results inrecent studies. In a study evaluating the photoprotective potential of sev-eral dietary antioxidants in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to UVA, carnosic acid was found to UVA-induced el-evation in matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Free Radic. Biol. Med.2002;32:1293-303). Rosemary extract displayed antioxidant properties in a study of human surface lipids, when skin treated with the extract wasfound to be less susceptible to oxidative stress caused by t-butyl hydroperoxide (Br. J. Dermatol. 2003;149:681-91; J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000;48:5548-56). In a recent in vitro and in vivostudy, a natural alcoholic extract derivedfrom rosemary protected against free radical-induced skin damage, inhibiting oxidativechanges to skin surface lipids (Int. J. TissueReact. 2000;22:5-13). Rosemary is considered an effective con- ditioner for greasy hair, a general tonic pro-viding body and sheen to hair, and an ef-fective dandruff treatment when used incombination with sage (Phytother. Res.2003;17:987-1000). Other Benefits Rosemary has been shown to confer anti- septic, antispasmodic, astringent, antidepressant, carminative,cholagogue, and as well as antimicrobial activity (Microbios1995;82:171-2). In addition, rosemary extract has been found to enhance the production of nerve growth factor in T98 human glioblastomacells (Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003;26:1620-2). In a study of the effect of aromatherapy on cognition and mood in healthy adults, the essential oil of rosemary was asso-ciated with significant improvement in subjective reports ofmood and in performance assessments of overall quality of mem-ory and secondary memory factors, although it seemed to re-duce the speed of memory compared with controls (Int. J. Neu-rosci. 2003;113:15-38). Like most of the herbal sources covered in this column, rose- mary is now a common ingredient in cosmetic and cosmeceu-tical products. There appears to be reason for optimism re-garding the role of rosemary in the medical\u2014 and particularlythe dermatologic\u2014armamentarium, with recent findings war-ranting additional research. Much more knowledge is necessary,however, to ascertain the relative significance of this popularherb in the therapeutic realm. I Reprinted from S KIN& A LLERGY NEWS, May 2006.

This plant extract has shownantioxidant and photoprotective effects found in abundance in the Honduran rain for- est as well as throughout the tropics of Central and South Amer-ica and the Caribbean. Various parts of the fernare used in traditional medicine in these regionsfor many indications, including tumors, psori-asis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, rheumatoidarthritis, and arthritis. Early evidence supporting the traditional uses of P . leucotomos extract (PLE) was seen more than 20 years ago in 304 psoriasis patients(Med. Cutan. Ibero. Lat. Am. 1983;11:65-72). In the 1990s, Dr. Thomas Fitzpatrick and his team at Harvard Medical School heard that this substance, whengiven orally, had utility in the treatment of vitiligo. They test-ed it and found, to their surprise, that it did not help vitiligo,but when they gave it to patients with vitiligo who were re-ceiving psoralen-UVA (PUVA) treatment, the recipients de-veloped less erythema from the PUVA. Dr. Fitzpatrick had spent years looking at -carotene as a pho- toprotective agent and found it inadequate, so he was excitedto discover that PLE had this capacity. This excitement even-tually led to the published studies, making this botanical ex-tract one of the best studied of the antioxidants. I first heard about P . leucotomos in 2001 at a cocktail party hosted by the American Academy of Dermatology, where Dr.Fitzpatrick told me about his PLE findings. Since then, manystudies evaluating this extract have been published. Photoprotection Investigators evaluated PLE's free-radical-scavenging activityas part of a study of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxi-dation. The authors reported that the fern extract exhibited an-tioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and photoprotective activityagainst photooxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Testing human and guinea pig skin, they showed that the topical application of PLE significantly inhibited the erythe-mal response induced by UVB, as well as the phototoxic reac-tion to PUVA after topical or oral administration of a photo-sensitizer (Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1996;12:45-56). The researchers concluded from their results that the appar-ent photoprotection exhibited by PLE against reactive oxygen species may have potential clinical applications against sunburnand phototoxic reactions. Current research seems to support thatconclusion. In a recent study, researchers evaluated the capacity of oral PLE to reduce the clinical and histologic damage to human skininduced by PUVA treatment. Ten healthy patients with skintypes II-III were exposed to PUVA alone and to PUVA with7.5 mg/kg of oral PLE. Clinical results showed consistently lower phototoxicity in PLE-treated skin after 48-72 hours, and lesspigmentation after 4 months. Histologic resultsrevealed notable differences in PLE-treated skin,with significantly fewer sunburn cells, preser-vation of Langerhans cells, and reduction in va-sodilation and tryptase-positive mast cell infil-tration (J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2004;50:41-9). The authors concluded that the PLE con- ferred significant protection to the skin againstthe known harmful effects of PUVA. This study was clearly small, but its encouraging results led the teamto further investigate the fern constituent. In research reported later that year by the same group, nine healthy people with skin types II-III were exposed to differentdoses of artificial UV either without or following oral admin-istration of 7.5 mg/kg of PLE. At 24 hours after exposure, the investigators evaluated ery- thematous reactions and obtained paired biopsy specimens fromPLE-treated skin and untreated skin. Significantly less erythe-ma was seen in the skin treated with PLE. The biopsy specimensshowed fewer sunburn cells, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, andproliferating epidermal along with less mast cell infiltra-tion. Signs of Langerhans cell preservation were also noted. This small study supported the team's earlier findings, as they concluded that oral PLE imparts significant systemic protec-tion to the skin against UV radiation (J. Am. Acad. Derma-tol. 2004;51:910-8). Other evidence buttresses the reports of PLE's photoprotec- tive effect on human cells. A recent in vitro study showed thatthe hydrophilic PLE efficiently and in a dose-dependent man-ner preserved human fibroblasts and restored their proliferativecapacity when the cells were exposed to UVA. PLE conferred the same photoprotection on the human ker- atinocyte cell fibroblasts werealso protected from UV-induced morphologic changes. The authors concluded that PLE could play an important role in preventing sunburn and skin disorders mediated by UV ex-posure (J. Photochem. Photobiol. B 4:00 6Cosmeceutical Critique Compendium 77reported photoprotective effects in vitiligo treatment, set out to assess the photoprotective effects of the topically or orallyadministered extract. The investigators exposed 21 healthy vol-unteers\u2014previously untreated or treated with oral pso-ralens\u2014to solar radiation, and evaluated immediate pigmentdarkening (IPD), minimal erythema dose (MED), minimalmelanogenic dose (MMD), and minimal phototoxic dose (MPD)before and after topical or oral PLE administration. They discovered that the extract was effective in both forms, with PLE increasing the UV doses required for IPD, MED, andMPD. An immunohistochemical assessmentshowed that Langerhans cells and oralformulations (Photodermatol. Photoim-munol. Photomed. 1997;13:50-60). The investigators concluded that PLE should be considered as a possible approachfor systemic photoprotection, and may serveas an adjuvant to photochemotherapy andphototherapy, perhaps enhancing the safetyand efficacy of PUVA or UVB. Effects on Cell Expression Researchers used fibroblasts and ker-atinocytes to test the effects of PLE\u2014in the presence of UVAor UVB\u2014on membrane damage, lipid peroxidation, and theexpression of elastin and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1). The cell samples were separately irradiated with a single ex- posure of UVA or UVB radiation and then incubated with orwithout PLE (0.01%, 0.1%, and 1%). Although UV did notsignificantly influence membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation,or MMP-1 expression, PLE did significantly enhance membraneintegrity, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and inhibit MMP-1 ex-pression in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Elastin expres-sion was increased by UV radiation and PLE (J. Dermatol. Sci.2003;32:1-9). The authors suggested that PLE concentrations less than 0.1% may help combat photoaging by ameliorating membraneintegrity and hampering MMP-1 expression without promot-ing elastin expression, whereas concentrations greater than 0.1%may reverse natural elastic fiber degradation. Researchers recently showed that PLE partially inhibits the production of cytokines that exhibit a Th1 pattern (IL-2, pe- ripheral blood mononuclear cells. At all doses tested, PLE completely eliminated production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. A second experiment by thesame laboratory demonstrated that topically applied PLE sig-nificantly lessened mast cell infiltration and the angiogenesispromoted by chronic UVB irradiation in hairless albino SKH- 1 mice (Anticancer Res. 2000;20:1567-75). The that PLE's moderate inhibition of the immunologic Th1 response accounts for the immunosuppres-sive, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties previouslyascribed to the fern extract. Furthermore, they inferred that thedemonstrable inhibitory effect on TNF- and IL-6 production may account PLE's inhibition of angiogenesis and protec-tion of human Langerhans cells from depletion initiated by so-lar irradiation. They speculated that PLE may be a po- tential treatment for autoaggressive and in-flammatory conditions characterized by ag-gravated Th1 responses. Antitumor Activity Researchers looked at whether topical PLEcould prevent or ameliorate cutaneous UVB-induced damage and photoaging in hairlessmice. The results showed that mice treatedwith PLE had significantly reduced skinfoldthickness and dermal elastosis, comparedwith untreated controls. A reduction was also seen in the number of mice that had skin tumors 8 weeks after cessation of UV ex-posure (Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1999;15:120-6). The investigators concluded that PLE treatment improved or mitigated the histologic damage linked to skin photoagingand reduced UVB-induced skin tumor prevalence in mice. Products P . leucotomos extract is available in an oral supplement market- ed as Heliocare. It is sold by pharmacists behind the counterbut without a prescription. The directions say to take one perday, but I tell my patients to take one per day except on dayswhen they anticipate significant sun exposure, in which casethey should take two per day. Conclusion Many studies suggest the efficacy of both oral and topical an-tioxidants in protecting the skin against photodamage (J. In-vest. Dermatol. 2005;125:xii-xiii). One study showed that acombination topical and oral antioxidants has a synergisticeffect (Biofactors 2003;18:289-97). I believe that antiaging regimens should include an oral an- tioxidant in addition to a topical antioxidant. Long-term stud-ies are required to test this theory. I Reprinted from S KIN& A LLERGY NEWS, February 2006. In a recent study, there was consistently lower phototoxicity in PLE-treated skin after 48-72 hours, and less pigmentation after 4 months.2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:02 PM Page 788 Cosmeceutical Critique CompendiumPropolis, also known as bee glue, is an extract of beehives that has been used for hundreds of years in naturopathicmedicine. Currently, some radiation therapists use propo- lis stomatitis and mucositis 2004;23:133-45), but this bee product is usedmore often for wound care and minor cutaneous indicationsas well as for a dietary supplement. In folk remedies, it hasserved as a potent anti-inflammatory agent (Cancer Res.1993;53:1255-61) and its use dates back andRome (Wurzbg. Medizinhist. Mitt. 2004;23:133-45). Greekwords \"pro\" (before) and \"polis\" (city), and re-flects the ancient observation that bees builtwalls of the substance near the entrance of theirhives. It was considered the third natural prod-uct of bees, in addition to honey and wax.Propolis is a resinous material that originatesin the buds of certain trees, mostlypoplars (Wurzbg. Mitt. 2004;23:133-45), (Anticancer Res. 1996;16:2669-72). Propolisstabilizes beehives intruders (Wurzbg. Medizinhist.Mitt. 2004;23:133-45). In traditional medicine, propolis was most successful in treat- ing a wide range of wounds because of its antiedematous andanti-infectious properties, presumably. Propolis was also usedin the ancient world for muscle, tendon, and joint pain. Moregermane to this column, bee glue was used to treat cutaneousconditions such as lichens and condylomata (Wurzbg. Mediz-inhist. Mitt. 2004;23:133-45). In a recent investigators evaluated the reputed an- timicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and scar-healing capacity of ahigh-grade Brazilian propolis cream. Patients presenting withbilateral superficial second-degree burns over less than 20% oftheir body surface\u2014with wounds of similar depth and quali-ty\u2014were admitted into the study within 48 hours of their in-juries and then treated with propolis cream on one wound andsilver sulfadiazene (SSD) applied to a similar wound on the oth-er side. Wounds were debrided and dressings changed on thefollowing morning. Patients returned to the clinic at 3-day in-tervals to have their wounds checked and dressings changed,with reapplication of the ointment taking place only at thesevisits. In addition, investigators cultured the wounds for mi-crobial growth and took photographs to record inflammationand scar formation. No significant differences were noted in mi-crobial colonization, but wounds treated with the propolis creamshowed less inflammation and quicker scar formation, comparedwith the SSD-treated burns. While noting the beneficial effectsof propolis on burns, the researchers speculated that more fre- quent changing of wound dressings would have evinced an-timicrobial results also (J. Altern. Complement. Med. 2002;8:77-83). Propolis was recently evaluated for efficacy in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes simplex virus type 2. Ninety adults,all with local symptoms, participated in a randomized, single-blind, masked-investigator, controlled study at seven medicalcenters in which Canadian propolis ointment containing nat-ural flavonoids was compared with ointments of acyclovir and placebo, with 30 people randomized to eachgroup. Study ointments were applied four timesdaily. Participants were examined on the 3rd,7th, and 10th days of treatment for clinicalsymptoms, including the number and size ofherpetic lesions, with lesions classified into fourstages: vesicular, ulcerated, crusted, and healed.On day 3, 15 members of the propolis group hadcrusted lesions as opposed to 8 in the acyclovirgroup and 0 on placebo. Local symptoms were noted in three propolis group members, eight acyclovir indi-viduals, and nine on placebo. On day 7, healing was observedin 10 propolis patients, 4 acyclovir patients, and 3 in the place-bo group. Investigators reported that 24 propolis patients and14 acyclovir patients healed by day 10. Overall, the propolis oint-ment was considered more effective in healing lesions and re-ducing local symptoms (Phytomedicine 2000;7:1-6). In an ear-lier study of 65 patients, a topical ointment containing propolis(Nivcrisol-D) showed a significant therapeutic effect against re-current herpes and zona zoster, with patients who used the studydrug healing from outbreaks in an average of 4 days, while pa-tients using placebo took an average of 8 days to heal from out-breaks (Virologie 1988;39:21-4). Various components of propolis have also been isolated and found to possess anticarcinogenic properties. Flavonoid aglyconesare some of the significant constituents of propolis that are be-lieved to contribute antitumorigenic properties (Anticancer Res.1996;16:2669-72). A study with a fractionated methanol ex-tract of a Brazilian propolis resulted in the isolation of a tumor-icidal substance characterized as a new clerodane diterpenoid,which reduced the growth and number of skin tumors inducedby 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthracene (DMBA) application on mouse back skin by inhibition of DNA synthesis (AnticancerRes. 1996;16:2669-72).

The use of oats in skin care dates back to 2000 B.C. in Egypt and the Arabian peninsula. Oats have been used internally andexternally for conditions such as insomnia, anxiety, and skinconditions, and in forms ranging from tea to baths. Oatmeal baths were frequently used in the 19th and early 20th centuries for various cutaneous conditions, particularlypruritic inflammatory outbreaks. Although there is a dearth of information in the literature on the therapeutic benefits of oatsand oat products (Cosmet. Toiletries 1995;110:63-70), recent research seems to bear out theanti-inflammatory properties that are ascribed tooats in folk medicine and clinical practice. Avena sativa is also believed to promote the release of luteinizing hormone, which is inte-gral in the production and release of sex hor-mones such as testosterone. This might explainthe traditional use of oats as an aphrodisiac and, in turn, shedlight on the origin of the expression \"sowing wild oats.\" In ad-dition, oatmeal is one of the few natural products or ingredi-ents acknowledged by the Food and Drug Administration tobe an effective skin protectant. The Science Behind Colloidal Oatmeal As a component in the modern dermatologic armamentarium,colloidal oatmeal has replaced rolled oats and oatmeals. For decades, colloidal grain suspensions have been used as ad- juncts in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Am. J. ContactDermat. 1997;8:207-9). Generally, better benefits are seen withthe use of oat fractions rather than whole oatmeal (Phytother.Res. 2003;17:987-1000). The composition of colloidal (60%-64%), proteins inhibitors, flavonoids,and vitamins. Colloidal oatmeal has found to be safe, cosmetically sta- ble, and nonirritating. Evidence suggests that this modern ver-sion of the traditional elixir is effective in protecting and re-pairing skin and hair that has been damaged by environmentalinsults such as ultraviolet radiation, smoke, bacteria, and freeradicals. Colloidal oatmeal also eases cutaneous inflammationand Evidence also shows that colloidal oatmeal repairs damage from other chemicals, such as alpha hydroxy acids, surfactants,and bleaches (Cosmet. Toiletries 1998;113:45-52). The biologic activity of oat compounds appears to be quite dynamic. Whole oat flour is believed to be cleansing and protective in nature, with antioxidant properties and the ability to inhibitprostaglandin synthesis. Another oat compound, oat -glucan, is believed to be immunomodulatory. Oat proteins exhibit var-ious capacities and effects, including emulsifying activity, fat-binding activity, water-hydration capacity, low foaming poten-tial, and activity of superoxide dismutase).Oat lipids may influence viscosity and pasting properties and may decrease transepidermal water loss. In a double-blind, randomized patch study of two concentrations of colloidal oat and ricegrains (0.007% and 0.7%), the products wereapplied topically to the backs of 65 Italian chil-dren (43 atopic, 22 normal) who were aged 6months to 2 years old. Both topical colloidalgrains demonstrated efficacy as adjuncts in thetreatment of mild atopic dermatitis, with no inducing sensitization (Am. J. Con- tact Dermat. 1997;8:207-9). The Studies Recent evidence points toward an expanding range of indica-tions for colloidal oatmeal. A clinical study compared the ef-fectiveness of two shower and bath oils\u2014one containing liquidparaffin, and the other containing liquid paraffin with 5% col-loidal oatmeal\u2014to alleviate pruritus that was experienced by 35acute burn patients. Analysis of patient assessments of pain(recorded twice daily) and the daily number of their antihista-mine requests demonstrated that the colloidal oatmeal group re-ported significantly less pruritus and requested significantly lessantihistamine (J. Burn Care Rehabil. 2001;22:76-81). In an influential study on 12 healthy individuals, researchers evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of two topically ap-plied oatmeal extracts, Avena sativa the trademarked Rhealba. Using the sodium lauryl sulfate irritation model,the researchers found that both extracts exhibited preventiveeffects on skin irritation (Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol.2002;15:120-4). Another study focused on the anti-inflammatory effect of oat- meal extract oligomer on skin fragments (from plastic surgery)that were stimulated by the inflammation-inducing neurome-diator vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In that study, researchers found that application of VIP re- sulted in significant increases in vasodilation, but subsequentapplication of oatmeal extract oligomer significantly 2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:03 PM Page 9Results from the few available studies suggest that oatmeal compounds provide relief for several conditions. Clinical indi-cations for colloidal oatmeal include poison ivy, poison oak,sumac, insect bites, chicken pox, eczema, rashes, hives, dermatoses, xerosis, and epidermolysis bullosa.Oatmeal extracts also confer modulating effects in the sodiumlauryl sulfate skin irritancy model. Oatmeal on the Shelf New oatmeal-containing skin care products have recently be-come available at pharmacies and drug outlets in the wake ofrecent scientific evidence. Most products come in the form of colloidal baths. Aveeno, a division of Johnson & Johnson, derived its name from theLatin name for the oat plant ( avena ), and of their prod- Bath ($6.29 for an eight-packetbox) is a colloidal oatmeal formulation indicated for most of the conditions discussed above. Other brands also contain colloidal oatmeal, including Queen Helene's Batherapy 100% for 7 ounces), manufactured by Para Laboratories Inc. As part of a daily skin care regimen, colloidal oatmeal is suit- able for cleansing (especially dry, sensitive, or atopic skin), mois-turizing, and providing protection to the skin. Tradition and Anecdotal Evidence Given all the evidence, it looks as if oatmeal isn't just for break-fast anymore! In fact, oatmeal has a surprisingly long traditionin skin care. Although there are few trials demonstrating the efficacy of oatmeal products in the clinical setting, anecdotal evidence iscompelling regarding the therapeutic uses of oatmeal and itsderivatives in dermatologic practice.

CAPE was found to strong- ly inhibit several TPA-mediated oxidative processes consideredsine qua non for tumor promotion, including polymorphonu-clear leukocyte infiltration into mouse skin and ears; hydrogenperoxide (H 2O2) production; and formation of oxidized bases in epidermal DNA. In addition, researchers noted inhibitionof edema and ornithine decarboxylase induction in CD-1 andSENCAR mice CAPE application, as well as the inhibi-tion of TPA-induced H 2O2production in bovine lenses. Re- searchers concluded that CAPE appears to have potent chemo-preventive capacity, particularly in treating disorders associatedwith strong inflammatory and/or oxidative stress processes, suchas cancer and cataracts (Cancer Res. 1993;53:1255-61). In a different study on skin tumors, CD-1 mice were initi- ated with DMBA and then treated twice weekly with topical-ly applied TPA, resulting in 18.8 skin papillomas per mouse.Subsequent topical application of CAPE to the backs of the micetogether with TPA twice a week for 20 weeks inhibited thenumber of skin papillomas and reduced tumor size in a dose-dependent manner. The same combination also decreased thelevel of 5-hydroxymethyl-2\u00b4 deoxyuridine (HMdU) in epider-mal DNA produced through the previous initiation withDMBA. In addition, in vitro CAPE introduction to culturedHeLa cells inhibited DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Allof these inhibitory effects conferred by CAPE were deemed byinvestigators to be potent (Carcinogenesis 1996;17:761-5).In a more recent study on polyphenolic compounds and an- titumorigenic properties, a water-soluble derivative of propo-lis, caffeic acid (CA), CAPE, and quercetin administered to miceresulted in a reduction in the number of lung tumor nodules.Researchers related the antitumor properties of the tested sub-stances to their immunomodulatory capacity, cytotoxicity totumor cells, and ability to induce apoptosis and necrosis, sug-gesting that propolis, CA, CAPE, and quercetin show promis-ing potential for combating tumor growth (J. Ethnopharma-col. 2004;94:307-15). There are several commercially available products\u2014such as creams, shampoos, lipsticks, toothpastes, and mouthwash-es\u2014that contain propolis as an active ingredient. It is also usedas a dietary supplement. Conclusion Although the body of research on propolis is comparatively mea-ger at the present time, the reports on this resinous substanceappear very promising. I am particularly encouraged by the re-ports on its potential uses as an anticarcinogenic agent and anantiherpetic agent. Of course, much more research, in the formof randomized, controlled trials, is needed prior to incorporat-ing propolis into the armamentarium as a first-line therapy. Giv-en its historical or traditional uses, propolis is probably moreeffective in that context as compared with its use as an ingre-dient in new topical cosmeceuticals. In the latter case, researchand efficacy remain to be established. I Reprinted from S KIN& A LLERGY NEWS, July 2005.

For as long as it has been a component of the human diet, olive oil ( Olea europaea ) has also been used for its beneficial ef- fects on the skin. Ancient Greeks bathed with olive oil (Phy-tother. Res. 17[9]:987-1000, 2003), and the essential oil wasalso used in a variety of ways by the ancient Egyptians and Ro-mans, including uses as a food, cosmetic, anointing oil, mas-sage oil for athletes, and salve for soothing wounds. In contemporary times, the topical applica- tion of olive oil has reportedly been success-ful xerosis, rosacea, psoriasis, atopicdermatitis, diaper area), (including severe cas-es on the hands and feet), seborrhea, and var-ious inflammations, burns, and other skindamage (Phytother. Res. 17[9]:987-1000,2003). Abounding With Antioxidants Olive oil contains a variety of potent compounds, many withantioxidant properties. Those compounds include polyphenols,squalene, fatty acids olive oil areknown to scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species activein human disease. Whether the influence of these compoundsextends beyond the extracellular environment is unknown, how-ever (Life Sci. 69[10]:1213-22, 2001). The chief components of the unsaponifiable fraction of vir- gin olive oil include erythrodiol, -sitosterol, and squalene. The major components of the polar fraction include the oleuropein, tyrosol, antioxidant characteristics of these phenolic compounds are well established (Life Sci. 69[10]:1213-22, 2001). A study of the topical application of olive oil revealed anti- inflammatory effects (Z. Naturforsch. [C] 55[9-10]:814-19,2000). Other studies have also demonstrated that polypheno-lic compounds in olive oil yield protective effects against in-flammation (Phytother. Res. 17[9]:987-1000, 2003; Inflamm.Res. 50[2]:102-106, 2001). Olive oil is a very weak irritant, and adverse side effects from topical use are rare (Contact Dermatitis 36[1]:5-10, 1997). The primary phenolic compounds found in olive oil\u2014all of which lignans acetoxypinoresinol and pinoresinol (Lancet Oncol. 1:107-12, 2000). High consumption of extra-virgin olive oil, which is laden with antioxidants from these polyphenols as well as other com-pounds, may offer protection against oxidative stress and its ef-fects, such as aging and skin and other cancers (Lancet Oncol.1:107-12, 2000). A subsequent study also found that the high consumption of olive oil, along with vegetables and legumes, conferred protec-tion against actinic damage (J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 20[1]:71-80, 2001). Counter to Skin Cancer? Researchers recently examined the capacity ofextra-virgin olive oil to combat reactive oxygenspecies and skin tumors induced by UV lightexposure. Topical application of the oil to micebefore or after repeated exposure to UVB re-sulted in delayed onset of skin tumors, com-pared with control mice. As UVB exposures in- creased, differences between control mice and mice pretreatedwith olive oil diminished. Mice that were treated with olive oil after UVB exposure, however, showed significantly fewer tumors than mice in thecontrol group. Researchers concluded that topical application of olive oil fol- lowing UVB exposure is effective in mitigating murine skintumors caused by UVB exposure (Carcinogenesis 21[11]:2085-90, 2000). Similar results were obtained in another study. Researchers set out to determine if topical application of olive oil delays the on-set and reduces the number of UV-induced skin cancers. Theauthors speculated that extra-virgin olive oil, but not regularolive oil (which neither delayed nor reduced skin cancer devel-opment), may work by reducing free-radical-induced 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine formation, known to be responsible for gene mu-tation (J. Dermatol. Sci. 23[Suppl. 1]:S45-50, 2000). Marketing Beyond the Mediterranean Olive oil is now found in most types of over-the-counter skincare products, including soaps, lip balms, shampoos, and mois-turizers. There are even a few lines that feature olive oil as theprimary active ingredient. The Macrovita Face Products with Olive Oil line includes Olive Oil and Calendula Cleansing Milk, Olive Oil and Cal-endula Tonic Lotion, Olive Oil and Propolis Deep CleansingLiquid Soap, Olive Oil and White Tea Beauty Peel-Off Mask,and various other products such as hydrating cream, eye-con-Olive Oil Continued on page 132MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:05 Page 111122 Cosmeceutical Critique CompendiumDexpanthenol, also known as provitamin B 5, is the sta- ble alcohol form of pantothenic acid\u2014a key player inmaintenance of epithelial function and skin regrowth. Not found naturally, synthetic dexpanthenol is converted to pantothenic acid in the skin, stimulating skin regeneration ina manner comparable to vitamin A. This process of cell divi-sion and formation of new skin tissue restores skin elasticityand promotes wound healing. Water-soluble dexpanthenol is therefore used topically to ad- vance wound healing. It is also used in a wide range of cosmeticproducts, usually to moisturize the skin, and isformulated in some intramuscular and intra-venous products. The topical application of dexpanthenol also acts to prevent transepidermal water loss whilemoisturizing the skin. Dermatologists reportthat it is well tolerated and poses minimal riskof irritation or sensitivity. Studies have shown that dexpanthenol is a versatile compound that is effective in treatingvarious dermatoses. Alone, it is used most often as a moisturizing agent. Dex- panthenol also has been used in combination therapy for thetreatment of rhinitis (Laryngorhinootologie 79[3]:151-54,2000). In addition, a prospective, randomized, double-blindstudy showed that the prophylactic, continued use of an emol-lient containing dexpanthenol ameliorated the effects of Dermatol. 146[6]:983-91, 2002). In ad-dition, dexpanthenol has been shown to promote fibroblastproliferation both in vitro and in vivo (Am. J. Clin. Dermatol.3[6]:427-33, 2002). In a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled study, researchers assessed the effectiveness of dexpan-thenol in protecting against skin irritation in 25 healthy vol-unteers aged 18-45 years (Contact Dermatitis 49[2]:80-84,2003). In another study, when a product containing either 5%dexpanthenol or placebo was applied twice daily for 26 days tothe inner aspect of both forearms, the dexpanthenol-contain-ing product was shown effective in treating skin irritation. Ina different study, treatment with dexpanthenol over 3-4 weeksresulted in significant amelioration in skin as and fis-sures (Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 3[6]:427-33, 2002). Several other benefits to the skin have been associated with dexpanthenol. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-trolled study, treatment with topical dexpanthenol over in enhanced stratum corneum hydration and de-creased transepidermal water loss (Arzneimittelforschung50[7]:659-63, 2000).According to a recent study, formulations containing dex- panthenol were shown to stimulate epithelialization and gran-ulation an antipruritic, (Am. J. Clin. Dermatol.3[6]:427-33, 2002). Dexpanthenol confers soothing effects to formulations for the treatment of sunburn and other types of burns. Topically ap-plied dexpanthenol is considered safe, with minimal associa-tion with local skin reactions or sensitization. However, prod-ucts with a high concentration of dexpanthenol may be contraindicated in people with hemophilia. Dexpanthenol is included as an ingredient in a variety of topically applied skin creams andshampoos. In fact, this form of vitamin B 5has long been considered an effective ingredient incosmetic products. The foundation for the use of dexpanthenol in shampoo\u2014and anecdotal reports that its userestores color to gray hair\u2014stems from a studyseveral years ago evaluating dexpanthenol de- ficiency in rats. Deficiency was correlated with hair turning grayor falling out. Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is exceedingly rare, though, and is not likely associated with hair changes, accord-ing to nutritional studies by Nora Plesofsky-Vig. Clearly, theetiologies of hair graying and baldness are not related to thisvitamin. Also, no oral or topical formulations containing pan-tothenic acid or dexpanthenol as the main active ingredient havebeen shown to prevent gray hair or balding in humans. Nev-ertheless, it is believed that dexpanthenol penetrates well intothe hair shaft, promotes luster and elasticity, and renders thehair easier to comb. Dexpanthenol is an important component in several types of skin and hair care products. Panoplex Hydrogel Wound Dress-ing (Sage Laboratories) is a water-based gel formulated with aloevera and dexpanthenol. It's recommended for the managementof pressure and dermal ulcers, first- and third-degree burns, ra-diation therapy burns, cuts, abrasions, postoperative incisions,partial- and full-thickness wounds, and skin conditions relat-ed to peristomal care. The Roche Bepanthen product line is a fairly extensive group of formulations containing dexpanthenol for its healing prop-erties. The line includes Bepanthen Ointment for baby skin andbreast care, Bepanthen Cream for minor injuries and stressedskin, Bepanthen Plus for disinfecting and for treating crusted nasalmucosa, Bepanthol Body Lotion for reddened skin, BepantholIntensive Body Lotion for especially dry and sensitive skin,Bepanthol Bepanthol Compendium 1133tour cream, skin-reinforcing oil complex, and shampoo for dry scalps. The 7 Wonders Miracle Oil and Lotion line also con-tains olive oil as the primary active ingredient in various oilformulations (body, bath, baby, tanning, massage, cuticle, andhot oils). The abundance of glycerides and fatty acids in olive oil render it gentle enough touse even on sensitive skin, according to themanufacturers of the Jardin de l'Olivierproducts. This diverse line includes Bath &Shower Cr\u00e8me, Bath Oil, Body Lotion,Hand Cream, Cr\u00e8me Shampoo, Tonic Lo-tion, Cleansing Cream, and Dry Skin Cream,with olive oil as the chief component. MedAssist Therapeutic Skin Cremes is a line of products made from all-natural in-gredients. Their varied line of olive oil formulations includesOlive Branch Moisturizing Cr\u00e8me, Olive Branch Hydrating Lo-tion, Olive Branch Soothing Oil, Olive Branch RevitalizingCleanser, Olive Branch Hair and Scalp Treatment, OliveEssence Hand and Body Lotion, Olive Essence Silky Moistur-izing Body Spray, and Olive Essence Gentle Cleansing HerbalShampoo. Country Rose Soap Co. uses blends of olive, coconut, palm,castor, and jojoba oils, with all of the products containing a high percentage of olive oil (such as 100% Olive Oil Castile Soap).Besides these specific lines, there are numerous companies fea-turing olive oil as an active ingredient in select products. The wider benefits of olive oil, like many other botanical in- gredients, were known in the ancient world and are just in theprocess of being rediscovered. As is the case with the plethora of herbal ingredients, olive oil has been incorporated into a wide arrayof topical products. The presence in olive oil of several com- pounds with known antioxidant activity,along with the results of a few studies sug-gesting anti-inflammatory and anticarcino-genic effects, provide a rationale for furtherresearch. As is often the case with herbal products, however, there is a dearth of randomized,double-blind, controlled trials on the topi- cal application of olive oil. Olive oil is highly regarded as a healthy food and cooking oil. If it turns out to be even half as well regarded as an an-tioxidant ingredient in topical formulations, it might leap tothe head of the growing list of potent herbal antioxidants be-ing used and studied in medicine.

Dormer 211 Moisturizers, which feature exclusive high-mol- ecular-weight hyaluronic acid complexes in its formulations, alsocontain dexpanthenol as a main ingredient in its Face & HandCream (70 mL; light texture), Cream (110 mL and 500 mL; max-imum moisturizer), Cream SPF 15 (60 mL; protection), andCream and UVB protection). Eucerin's pH5 Soft Creme contains high- ly concentrated dexpanthenol that is said tobe rapidly absorbed by the skin, improvingits regeneration capacity and overall stratumcorneum barrier function. The formulationis also touted as an effective moisturizer. Dexpanthenol acts as a humectant in a new night firming product, Olay's Total Effects Night Firming Cream, also con-taining niacinamide, tocopherol acetate, and hydrolyzed wheatprotein, that was introduced late in 2002. The formulation issaid to lessen transepidermal water loss according to stud-ies performed by the manufacturer, Procter & Gamble. Dexpanthenol is even included, as a moisturizer, in Cellulite Attack thigh cream by Nutrition Farm. Few controlled clinical trials have been conducted evaluating the efficacy of topical formulations containing dexpanthenol in- tended for skin care. Despite a dearth of ran-domized, double-blind, case-controlled stud-ies establishing the efficacy of such products,current data warrant further study and sup-port the conclusion that dexpanthenol as anactive ingredient at least confers some bene-fit as a moisturizer. There is an increasing body of anecdotal, empiric evidence also suggesting significant potential additional contributions by provitamin B 5as an in- gredient in topical formulations. More studies are needed to ex-plore other potential benefits of this active ingredient. I Reprinted from S KIN& A LLERGY NEWS, April 2004.

Pinus proanthocyanidins, usually referred to assimply proanthocyanidins. Proanthocyanidins have captured the popular imagination, convincing many that grape seed extract can improve skin elas-ticity and tone, prevent or ameliorate scars and stretch marks,and prevent or reduce wrinkling by protectingagainst UV radiation. Proanthocyanidins, whichbelong to the flavonoid family, are found in sev-eral plant sources, including pine bark, grapeseed, grape skin, bilberry, cranberry, black cur-rant, green tea, and black tea. These polyphenolic bioflavonoids reportedly boast a wide range tannins, said tohave the capacity to stabilize collagen and elastin and thus en-hance the elasticity, flexibility, and appearance of skin. Anecdotal Effectiveness Much of the anecdotal evidence regarding the use of grape seedextract comes from Europe, where proanthocyanidins have beenused therapeutically for decades to improve circulatory disor-ders such as atherosclerosis, vascular insufficiency, and varicoseveins. Europeans have also used preparations containing proan-thocyanidins to treat edema, particularly when associated withsurgery. Proanthocyanidins are considered by many to have the abil- ity to enhance vision and protect the skin against UVB dam-age. Proanthocyanidins and other tannins have also been shownto foster wound healing. In one study, a combination of grape seed extract and resver- atrol was shown to promote vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) expression, which is an important step in wound an-giogenesis (Ann. N.Y . Acad. Sci. 957:239-49, 2002). Earlier re-search suggested that grape seed extract, by inducing VEGF ex-pression in keratinocytes, shows the potential to confer beneficialresults in dermal wound healing and related skin problems (FreeRadic. Biol. Med. 31[1]:38-42, 2001). Topical application hasalso been shown to improve the sun protection factor in humanvolunteers (Toxicology 148[2-3]:187-97, 2000). Respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and si- nusitis have been treated with grape seed extract, with vary-ing degrees of success. Allergic reactions are believed to be treat- able with proanthocyanidins, which may inhibit histamine pro-duction and reduce susceptibility to pollens and food allergens. Promising research suggests that the anti-inflammatory ef- fects of grape seed extract may make it suitable for wound heal-ing and the treatment of arthritis. Supplementation withgrape seed extract has also been shown to improve chronic pan-creatitis in humans (Toxicology 148[2-3]:187-97, 2000). The most popular use of grape seed extract is as a supplement for the treatment of cutaneous aging. Data do suggest that grapeseed extract is a significantly more potent scavenger of free rad- icals than are vitamins C and 95[2]:179-89, 1997).The bioflavonoids in grape a symbiotic relationship for the othernutrients, promoting the body's ability to absorbthe vitamins. In fact, in vitro and in vivo research have shown grape seed extract to be highly bioavail-able, conferring much more protection againstfree radical-induced lipid peroxidation and DNA damage than vitamin C, vitamin E, or -carotene (Tox- icology 148[2-3]:187-97, 2000). Despite the reported beneficial effects of grape seed proan- thocyanidins, little is understood about their mechanism of ac-tion. Research has shown, however, that exposure to grape seed proanthocyanidins was associated with a significant reductionin apoptosis in response to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.Investigators believe also data to suggest that the proanthocyanidin-rich polyphenol fraction of grape seed extract effectively achieves bal-ance between the cell-mediated types of action in protectingLDL cholesterol against oxidation (Free Radic. Res. 37[5]:573-84, 2003). The most promising research on grape seed proanthocyanidins might be in the realm of anticarcinogenesis. Researchers haveshown that grape seed extract displays cytotoxicity toward hu-man breast, lung, and gastric adenocarcinoma cells while pro-moting growth of normal gastric mucosal cells (Toxicology148[2-3]:187-97, 2000). Extracting Sales Manufacturers that include grape seed extract in their topicalcosmetic formulations tout the antiaging effects that the in-gredient is believed to confer.

Seeds of the lavender shrub were transported from their na- tive Mediterranean region to England and France through hu-man migration hundreds of years ago. However, several speciesof lavender have actually been used for therapeutic, cosmetic,and commercial purposes for thousands of years. Though all 28 lavender species are believed to confer some de- gree of therapeutic benefit, Lavandula officinalis is the species used in medicinal formulations. The active chemical components thatgive lavender its reputed medicinal properties in-clude tannins, coumarins, flavonoids, and triter-penoids. Linalool phyto-chemical constituent of lavender (Phytother.Res. 13[6]:540-42, 1999). Derived from the Latin word \"lavare,\" mean- ing \"to wash,\"the lavender plant was named forits practical applications in the ancient world.Lavender blossoms were used by ancient Greeksand Romans to scent bath water, bathe wounds,and prevent infections at communal baths. Traditionally, lavender was hung in the home to repel mosqui- toes, flies, and other insects, and placed in linen closets to repelmoths. Its disinfectant and fumigant properties also were usefulfor sanitizing floors. Other actions and properties associated withlavender oil include anticonvulsive, antidepressant, antibacterial,and carminative effects (Phytother. Res. 16[4]:301-08, 2002). In addition, the essential oil distillate of lavender has been used to treat wounds, bites, burns (including sunburns), lacerations, andeven acne, psoriasis, fungal conditions, and herpes. The Research Findings Studies have shown that lavender has beneficial effects on hu-man skin. Investigators studying perineal pain among womenwho had recently given birth found an association between useof lavender oil in baths and reduced discomfort (Mod. Midwife5[3]:31-33, 1995). Although the treatment record for alopecia areata is check- ered at best, there is a report in the literature of lavender oil(among several other essential oils) being used with moderatesuccess for this condition. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, 86 patients re- ceived daily scalp massage treatments with either essential oil ina mixture of carrier oils or carrier oil only for 7 months. Six of 41patients in the control group showed improvement, whereas 19of 43 patients in the treatment group exhibited significant im-provement (Arch. Dermatol .134[11]:1349-52, 1998). There are no reports of significant adverse effects from the useof lavender for therapeutic or cosmetic purposes. Mild contact dermatitis has been identified, though, from the use of driedlavender flowers to scent items such as pillows and to disinfectambient air (Contact Dermatitis 43[3]:157-60, 2000). Conversely, researchers have shown, in vivo and in vitro, that lavender oil has the capacity to mediate sudden allergic reac-tions by inhibiting mast cell degranulation (J. Pharm. Phar-macol. 51[2]:221-26, 1999). Products for the Skin Lavender is an ingredient in a wide variety of skin care prod- ucts including soaps, moisturizers, lotions,bath gels, lip balms, hand creams, shampoos,and hair conditioners. The Softsoap line of products features a body wash touting the therapeutic effects of laven-der and chamomile. Softsoap Relaxing BodyWash with Moisture Beads, Lavender andChamomile is available in most grocery storesand large retail chains that sell personal careitems. Life Tree Lavender Soft Skin Body Wash ($33 per gallon) is a wild lavender soap that is also available. Profaces Body Contour Gel ($39) contains lavender as well as seaweed, grape seed, green tea, licorice extract, and essential oilsof mandarin, rosemary, and lemon, and is recommended for skinfirming and toning, according to the company. DermAlive Skin Recovery Formula with Lavender (2 oz, $15) contains lavender oil, among numerous other ingredients, in analoe vera base. Miss Rona's Lavender Anti-Aging Cr\u00e8me with SPF18 ($60 per ounce) also contains lavender. Lavender is also an in-gredient in many bath salts and candles. Clinically Significant Benefits? Topical products that contain lavender appear to be safe, withmild allergic reactions as the most likely adverse responses. Re-search has established a scientific and clinical foundation forthe traditional uses of lavender. It remains to be seen if double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trials will establish the use of lavender for derma-tologic purposes. While it's unlikely that commercially available topical formu- lations including lavender are harmful, it appears just as unlikelythat such products confer clinically significant benefits. Linking a well-regarded plant\u2014known for its soothing, even potentially therapeutic qualities\u2014to their products remains aneffective marketing strategy that manufacturers employ withlavender and several other herbal ingredients.

Lavender 2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 5:30 PM Page 151166 Cosmeceutical Critique CompendiumChamomile is one of the seven most commonly used med- icinal herbs. Native to Western Europe, Western Asia,and India, and now abundant throughout North Amer- ica, this sweet-scented plant has been recognized for its thera-peutic properties since the age of Hippocrates in 500 B.C. Theancient Greeks and Egyptians used crushed chamomile flow-ers to treat erythema and dry skin brought on by harsh, dryweather (J. Sch. Nurs. 16[3]:53-58, 2000). The generic designation \"chamomile\" is derived from the Greek words \"khamai\" (on the ground) and \"melon\" (apple).Two species of this bittersweet herb, cutita ), have been labeled as the true chamomile because of their therapeutic applications andsimilar appearance. Roman chamomile is con-sidered therapeutic for burns, boils, and smallcuts and reputed to foster the natural healingof acne, dermatitis, and athlete's foot. Howev-er, the official medicinal chamomile is Germanchamomile, with even broader applications. The flowers of German chamomile, which contain the key ac- tive ingredient chamazulene -bisabolol in the highest concen- tration among all the chamomiles, have been used throughouthistory as an herbal treatment for various skin ailments. Chamazu-lene -bisabolol promotes wound healing and exhibits anti-in- flammatory activity, according to the \"Physician's Desk Refer-ence for Herbal Medicines\" (Montvale, N.J.: Medical EconomicsCo., 1998). As a result, companies include chamomile in sever-al cosmetic products that are intended to soothe the skin. Despite a long history of traditional use, chamomile has only been subjected to the rigors of the scientific method during thepast 40 years. Chemistry Chamazulene (-), - -bisabolol, bisabololoxides, farnesenes are theprimary active components of Matricaria recutita that are deemed medically important (Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharma-cokinet. 24[4]:303-08, 1999). Fatty acids, cyanogenicglyco-sides, choline, tannin, derivatives also are amongthe notable phytochemical constituents. Chamazulene is a transformation product of matricine. Both of these constituents of chamomile extracts have shown anti-inflammatory activity in vivo (Planta Med. 60[5]:410-18,1994). It is believed that chamazulene contributes thisprocess by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis (Planta Med60[5]:410-18, 1994). Levomenol is another key anti-inflammatory component found in great abundance in German chamomile. It is believedto confer significant effects on skin, such as ameliorating tex-ture and elasticity and diminishing pruritus and signs of pho-todamage. Further, the combined effects of levomenol, a nat-ural moisturizer, and chamazulene are said to soothe skinexhibiting eczema, allergic effects, and sunburn. A study was conducted with Wistar albino rats in which in- flammation was induced via the injection of carrageenan andprostaglandin E1 to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of freeze-dried plant extracts of four differentherbs. All four, including chamomile ( Matri- caria chamomilla ), were found to suppress both the inflammatory effect and the leukocyte in-filtration (Vet. Med. Nauki 18[6]:87-94,1981). In addition to reports of anti-inflam-matory effects, chamomile is said to have someantioxidant properties, which have been iden-tified through chemical assays (J. Agric. FoodChem. 50[17]:4947-52, 2002). Indications Chamomile is notably versatile in the medicinal realm, withthe dried flowers of Matricaria recutita conferring sedative and spasmolytic anti-inflammatory, carminative, and tonic. Thetraditional indications for chamomile and its various teas andtopical formulations range from stomach cramping and pains,menstrual cramping, and diarrhea to inflammatory skin and eyeproblems, mood disorders, and even the flu. Chamomile is oneof the most commonly used herbs for treating morning sick-ness, but there is contradictory evidence amid an overall dearthof data on whether use of chamomile is safe during pregnancy(Midwifery 16[3]:224-28, 2000). As an essential oil adminis-tered via skin absorption and inhalation used in aromatherapy,chamomile has been shown to be effective in alleviating the painrelated to childbirth (Complement Ther. Nurs. Midwifery6[1]:33-34, 2000). As an infusion, chamomile has also been traditionally used to ease colic and teething in babies, and to calm restless chil-dren. In addition, this bittersweet herb has been shown to beeffective in relieving acid indigestion, intestinal gas, consti-pation, and peptic ulcers. The use of chamomile tea as an eye-wash for conjunctivitis and other external ocular symptomsis a traditional remedy (Ann. Allergy 65[2]:127-32, 1990).Chamomile also is effective when used in a vaginal douche,in a mouthwash for oral ulcers, and in a rinse to enhance haircolor.Chamomile 2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:19 PM Page 16Cosmeceutical Critique Compendium 1177Side Effects The use of chamomile in any form is considered generally safe,with few side effects reported. Chamomile is one among theseveral herbs that can interact with warfarin, elevating the riskof bleeding or other adverse effects for a patient on warfarin ther-apy (Am. J. Health Syst. Pharm. 57[13]:122-27, 2000). Therehave been some reports of contact dermatitis following the top-ical application of chamomile products, and allergic conjunc-tivitis also has been linked to eye washing with chamomile tea(Ann. Allergy 65[2]:127-32, 1990). Products Chamomile is included in a wide array of cosmetic productsfor various purposes. In skin formulations, chamomile oftenis added as an emollient and to provide anti-inflammatory andsoothing activity for sensitive skin. Chamomile also is used inseveral hair products intended to enhance the color of blondehair. The Murad line of skin products includes chamomile in sev- eral formulations. Moisture Rich Skin Cleanser ($22/6 oz) andSensitive Skin Smoothing ($48/1.7 oz) include chamomile ex-tract to soothe the skin. The Hydrating Toner ($16/6 oz) claimsto confer the anti-inflammatory and soothing properties ofchamomile. Chamomile also is included in products in the Wildflower Natural Care line of vegan skin products for babies and youngchildren. Chamomile Baby Lotion ($8.99/8 oz) is a moisturiz- er intended to provide the soothing and anti-inflammatory char-acteristics of chamomile. Chamomile Cleansing Lotion ($8.99/8oz) is a soap-free, extra-gentle cleanser enriched with chamomileextract to help prevent irritation. The European company Camocare manufactures a line of skin products largely centered on chamomile. The company claimsits patented product Camillosan is the most potent chamomileextract available. Camocare's Ultimate Body Therapy for Ex-tra Dry Skin fl. oz) contains components. Camocare Gold Facial Ther-apy ($21.95/2.4 oz) is said to combine the benefits of chamomileand an alpha lipotene antioxidant. Conclusion While the popular consciousness most often associates thehealth benefits of chamomile with chamomile tea, there is a longhistory of effective, therapeutic application of chamomile to theskin. The body of scientific research on chamomile is relative-ly slim, but it appears to support traditional beliefs. Never-theless, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are necessary toestablish the range of therapeutic potential of this hardy herb,and to evaluate the relative efficacy of products featuring it asan active component.

California North's Appellation grape seed moisturizer ($28.75 for 4 ounces) is a nongreasy, oil-free, pH-balancedmoisturizer containing several naturally derived extracts. Ac-cording to the company, this formula also reduces the ap-pearance of fine lines. Appellation microfine grape seed scrub($24.50 for 4 ounces) is a pH-balanced exfoliating facial scrubcontaining high levels of vitamins C and E from grape seedextract intended for healthy cell turnover and regeneration, aswell as moisturization. Another herbal cocktail product aimed at removing dead skin cells and smoothing complexion is Aubrey Organics' blue greenalgae with grape seed soothing mask ($8.75 for 4ounces). This is an antioxidant clay mask with active enzymesintended to draw out excess oil and debris and tone the skin,according to the manufacturer. A product line that features grapefruit, Archipelago Botanicals' Yuzu (Japanese grapefruit) Collection, offers several products inwhich grape seed extract is a primary active ingredient. Products from the line containing grape seed extract include: antioxidant body soak ($18 for 11 ounces), refreshing body mist($14 for 12 ounces), antioxidant body lotion ($25 for 17ounces), antioxidant body scrub ($18 for 16 ounces), antioxi-dant moisturizing creme ($15 for 3.2 ounces), soap in tin ($13 for 8.8 ounces), body wash ($18 for 32 ounces), conditioner ($11for 16 ounces), and relaxing bath salts ($16 for 16 ounces). There are no significant reports of adverse effects from the use of products containing grape seed extracts. In fact,flavonoids generally and proanthocyanidins specifically are notassociated with any side effect patterns. Potent Protection? Preliminary research, anecdotal evidence, and even early ex-perience with grape seed extract products suggest beneficialeffects on vascular disease and wound healing. They may eventurn out to have a preventive effect against some cancers. Atthis stage, results are convincing that grape seed extract con-fers potent protection against oxidative stress and free radi-cal-mediated tissue damage. Several European authors con-tend that proanthocyanidins inhibit enzymes integral to thebreakdown of the skin, such as collagenase, elastase, andhyaluronidase. Much more research in the form of double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials is necessary before grape seed extractwarrants recommendation as a primary ingredient in topical cos-meceuticals.

Some also believe that soy has the potential todecrease aging of the skin and prevent skin cancers through theestrogen-type and antioxidant effects of its metabolites. The components of soy have been suggested to have a vari- ety of effects that may make them useful in skin care products.Small proteins such as soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and Bow-man-Birk inhibitor (BBI) have been suggested to inhibit skinpigmentation, while large proteins have beenfound to smooth and soften the skin. Unsaturated fatty acids found in soy are be- lieved to provide antioxidant benefits, and soylipids, lecithins, and phytosterols are believedto restore barrier function mois-ture. Natural soy surfactants such as saponinsand lecithins are thought to provide cleansingactivity, according to a poster presented at theannual meeting of the American Academy ofDermatology, held in Washington, D.C., in March. In another recent study, STI, BBI, and soy milk were found not only to have depigmenting activity but also to prevent UV-induced pigmentation both in vitro and in vivo. The investigators found that these proteins inhibit the cleav- age of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2). PAR-2 is a sev-en-transmembrane, G that is by a serine protease cleavage. It is expressed inkeratinocytes but not in melanocytes. By inhibiting thiscleavage, STI and BBI are believed to affect melanosome trans-fer and thus pigmentation (J. Invest. Dermatol. 116[4]:587-95, 2001). These data suggest that soy might be a useful adjuvant for treating hyperpigmentation disorders; melasma, however, is anexception. Because soy exerts some estrogen-type effects andmelasma is somewhat estrogen mediated, the use of soy mightbe deleterious in this situation. Various studies in animal and human cell cultures have shown genistein and diadzein\u2014the primary metabolites of soyisoflavones\u2014to be phytoestrogens, which are plant compoundsthat have a weak estrogenic effect (Int. J. Oncol. 16[2]:333-38, 2000). When estrogen levels in the body are high, they may work by competing for and binding to the body's estrogen receptorsites, causing excess circulating estrogen to be sent to the liv-er for elimination. When the body is low in estrogen, as is thecase during menopause, phyto-estrogens such as genistein anddiadzein may substitute for the lack of human estrogen, miti-gating the effects of its absence.Estrogen receptor levels are highest in the granular layer of the skin. Multiple studies have shown that postmenopausalwomen have a measurably thinner dermis and less collagenthan premenopausal women. Topical estrogen has beenshown to decrease the skin thinning and collagen loss seenin postmenopausal patients not on hormone replacementtherapy. Because of this, it is believed\u2014but has not yet been shown\u2014that supplementation with phytoestrogens could havethe same beneficial effects on the skin as topical estrogen. Several studies have suggested that genistein in particular is a potential anticancer agent. Dr.Huachen Wei and colleagues at Mount SinaiMedical Center in New York demonstrated thatgenistein significantly inhibited chemical car-cinogen-induced reactive oxygen species, ox-idative DNA damage, and protooncogene ex-pression, as well as the initiation and promotionof skin carcinogenesis in mouse skin (J. Am.Acad. Dermatol. 39[2, pt. 1]:271-72, The investigators also found that genistein potently inhibitedUVB-induced erythema in human skin. Because most researchon topical genistein has been limited to mouse skin\u2014exceptfor one human-skin study\u2014its effect on human skin must beconsidered unknown. These scientific findings have prompted cosmetic companies to include soy and soy derivatives in sometimes extremely ex-pensive products, including some from Johnson & Johnson(such as Aveeno skin brightening daily moisturizer), Soy SoftInc. (Soy Soft daily moisturizing lotion), and Woodridge LabsInc.'s Soylutions line. Another poster presented at the annual AAD meeting claimed that test subjects did not exhibit any irritation, al-lergy, and photoreactivity to a number of soy formulationsstudied. Although studies are promising, more research needs to be done to determine the safety and actual benefits of topical soyuse. Until then, soy products should be considered a safe andpossibly effective treatment for post-menopausal female patientsand patients with hyperpigmentation disorders other thanmelasma. Although it has not been reported to have an effect on tu- mor growth, soy use should be avoided in patients at high riskfor or with a history of estrogen-sensitive tumors, such as breastor uterine cancer.

All of the natural andsynthetic derivatives of vitamin A are included in a group known as the retinoids. The retinoids have many important biologic effects: They reg- ulate growth and differentiation of epithelial cells, inhibit tu-mor promotion during experimental carcinogenesis, diminishmalignant cell growth, decrease inflammation, and enhance theimmune system (J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 39[4, pt. 1]:611-25,1998). Retinoic acid, or tretinoin, is now known to reverse photoaging by reducing wrinkles andsmoothing skin texture as well as decreasing ac-tinic keratoses and lentigines (Dermatol. Clin.18[4]:699-709, 2000). Retinoids have also been shown to improve the appearance of striae and improve skin dis-coloration (J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 39 [2, pt.3]:S1-122, 1998). Long-term studies have shown that the vis- ible skin changes found with tretinoin use result primarily froman increase in dermal collagen, a decrease in abnormal elastin,increased dermal and epidermal mucin, an improved dermal-epidermal junction, and decreased melanin (Dermatol. Clin.18[1]:99-112, 2000). Tretinoin also decreases the transcription factor AP-1, lead- ing to reduced levels of collagenase and other metalloproteinases(N. Engl. J. Med. 337[20]:1419-28, 1997). Tretinoin, however, is available by prescription only. It has two approved uses: treating acne and improving photodamagedskin. Because tretinoin is expensive and usually not covered by pre- scription drug insurance, many patients are interested in us-ing over-the-counter products that contain retinoids. palmitate or retinol. Retinyl has not been found to be biologically ac- tive in the skin (J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. cleavage of its ester bond and then conversion toretinoic acid in order to exert an activity when applied topi-cally. Many products that claim to contain retinol actually con-tain retinyl palmitate. Retinol, on the other hand, is highly useful in skin care. Retinol is a pro-drug that can be converted to retinoic acid bythe skin. The change to all- trans retinoic acid within the ker- atinocytes is essential for retinol to be active (J. Biol. Chem.269[52]:32821-27, 1994). Early reviews of retinol found it to be ineffective; however, further research determined that this was due to the molecule'sphotoinstability. Upon exposure to light, retinol degrades into a biologically inactive molecule. This breakdown can be pre-vented by adding an antioxidant or by incorporating retinol intoan oxidation-resistant vehicle. Recent investigations of retinol in an appropriate vehicle and in the correct concentration have shown it to be as effective astretinoin for the same indications. In one study, unoccluded retinol at 0.25% was found to in- duce the same cellular and molecular changes observed withthe application of 0.025% tretinoin\u2014without the irritation usually seen with tretinoin. In addition, the in-vestigators found that retinol penetrated theskin better than tretinoin (J. Invest. Dermatol.109[3]:301-05, 1997). Side effects have been found to be fewer than those seen with tretinoin; therefore, retinol maybe an excellent alternative for patients with sen-sitive skin. In addition, vitamin A is alsoknown to be a humectant moisturizer andtherefore is a useful additive in products meant to moisturize the skin (Dermatol. Clin. 18[4]:597-607, 2000). While prescription-strength retinoids are known to be suc- cessful in reversing and preventing the signs of aging, it is im-portant to remember that properly formulated retinol productscan be efficacious as well. These products must be packaged inspecial low-light conditions to ensure stability. They should bepackaged in lightproof aluminum tubes. Most over-the-counterproducts contain 0.04%-0.08% retinol. It is impossible to ascertain by reading the label which prod- ucts are manufactured and packaged properly, so it is best tostick with reputable brands that you can trust. In order to better guide our patients, we went to a local phar- macy and purchased every product containing or claiming tocontain retinol. For each, we examined the packaging and theproduct inside as well as any labeling or marketing from thecompany. Two examples of brands that are manufactured and pack- aged properly are RoC Retinol Actif Pur and NeutrogenaHealthy Skin. I feel comfortable recommending these to mypatients. Advise your patients to use retinol products at night, when degradation by light is minimal. Some products are marketedwith added sunscreens for daytime use. It is very important forpatients on retinoids of any kind to apply sunscreen daily, asretinoid use is associated with increased photosensitivity. I Reprinted from S KIN& A LLERGY NEWS, May 2001. Melissa Lazarus, a research fellow at the University of Miami, contributed tothe column.Vitamin A, CompendiumVitamin E is frequently found in cosmeceutical products. It functions as a preservative, has excellent moisturiz-ing capabilities, and has been promoted most recently for its photoprotective effects. However, its use has been alsoassociated with a high incidence of contact dermatitis. Vitamin E includes the tocopherols and the tocotrienols. It is found naturally in many vegetables, corn, oils, seeds, soy,wholewheat flour, nuts, and margarine. It is also found in somemeat and dairy products. The biologically active forms are -tocopherol and -toco- pherol; free -tocopherol is the most biologi- cally active form. These forms act as lipid-sol-uble antioxidants. Vitamin E is found naturally in the mem- branes of cells and organelles. It protects cellmembranes from peroxidation and scavengesfree radicals; therefore, it is believed to help pre-vent cardiovascular disease and the \"aging\" ofthe arteries. While studies outside the field of dermatol- ogy have convincingly suggested the benefits of oral vitaminE supplementation, the dermatologic benefits are still unknown. A study by Dr. Karla Werninghaus and her colleagues at Boston University showed that oral supplementation with 400IU vitamin E was not photoprotective in humans and did notincrease vitamin E levels in skin biopsy specimens after 1month and 6 months of supplementation (Arch. Dermatol.130[10]:1257-61, 1994). Conversely, a study by C. Weber and colleagues at the Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, showed that vitamin E levelswere depleted in animal skin exposed to UV radiation, and thisdepletion was prevented by the topical application of vitaminE (Free Radic. Biol. Med. 22[5]:761-69, 1997). Further, a study by Beth Anne Jurkiewicz and her colleagues at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, showed that topical to-copherol provided significant protection against UV-radia-tion-induced damage to animal skin (J. Invest. Dermatol.104[4]:484-88, 1995). While it has been suggested that topical application of - tocopherol confers an SPF of 3 after multiple applications, thiseffect is believed to be due to its ability to marginally absorblight (Cosmet. Dermatol. 12[9]:17-20, 1999). Inhibition of UV-induced skin erythema and edema with the use of topical vitamin E has not been shown in human skin. Ifvitamin E provides any photoprotective effect at all, it may re-quire interaction with other antioxidants to do so, particular-ly since other antioxidants (such as vitamin C, selenium, andthiols) are essential for the recycling of tocopherol. It has also been suggested that vitamin E may exert anti-in-flammatory effects on the skin through the inhibition of chem- ical mediator production and release. Vitamin E stabilizes lyso-somes, reduces prostaglandin E 2synthesis, and increases in- terleukin-2 production. This results in anti-inflammatory effects (J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 39[4, pt.1]:611-25, 1998). Topically applied vitamin E has been associated with sever- al different adverse reactions at the application site, eczematous dermatitis, and erythema multi-forme-like reactions (Cutis 47[3]:193-96, 1991). While the majority of these adverse reaction reports are anecdotal, a study conducted by M.Jenkins and colleagues at the Shriners Burn In-stitute in Cincinnati on the use of topical vit-amin E for postoperative scarring showed thatlocal reactions occurred in 20% of cases (J. BurnCare Rehabil. 7[4]:309-10, 1986). A study that I conducted on the use of vita- min E for scars showed a 33% rate of localizedreaction in study patients (Dermatol. Surg. 25[4]:311-15, 1999). The addition of vitamin E to cosmetic and hygiene products has spurred reports of adverse reactions. A Swiss study in 1992 examined 1,000 cases of an unusual papular and follicular contact dermatitis caused by vitamin Elinoleate that was used as an additive to cosmetic products. Theinvestigator concluded that oxidized vitamin E derivatives couldact synergistically Mennen E aerosol deodorant was removed from the market also following many reports of allergic contact dermatitis (Ri-etschel, R., and Fowler, J. \"Fisher's Contact Dermatitis,\" 4thed. [Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 1995]). Even though vitamin E appears to be a very effective an- tioxidant when taken systemically, its role as a topical antiox-idant remains unclear. A study conducted by H. Kappus andA.T. Diplock of Free University Berlin suggests that daily dos-es up to 400 mg are completely safe and that doses between400 mg and 2,000 mg are not likely to cause adverse side ef-fects (Free Radic. Biol. Med. 13[1]:55-74, 1992). However, doses greater than 3,000 mg daily when taken over a long period may cause side effects. Patients on anticoagulanttherapy and patients undergoing surgical procedures shouldavoid doses of vitamin E greater than 4,000 IU (J. Am. Acad.Dermatol. 39[4, pt. 1]:611-25, 1998). In addition, vitamin E should be stopped 10 days prior to collagen injections, and other treatments that can cause bruis-ing, in order to decrease the chance of bruising.Vitamin E Continued on page 232MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:20 PM Page 20Cosmeceutical Critique Compendium 2211Green tea is a popular beverage that is consumed world- wide. It is also a popular ingredient found in beautyproducts, including moisturizers, cleansers, shower gels, toothpastes, depilatories, shampoos, and perfumes. Its inclusion in such products is due to the purported an- tioxidant effects of polyphenols that occur naturally in the greentea leaf. Antioxidants have the ability to decrease free radicals, in turn preventing lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inflamma-tion. Via this mechanism, these ingredients are believed to haveanti-inflammatory, antiaging, and anticarcino-genic effects. Green tea is made from the steaming and dry- ing of the fresh leaves of the tea plant Camellia sinensis , a process that preserves its polypheno- lic components. The majority of these compounds are fla- vanols, commonly known as catechins, whichare considered to be the active ingredients inthe leaves. catechins include epicatechin,epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, and shown mod-ulate biochemical pathways that are important in cell prolif-eration, inflammatory responses, and responses of tumorpromoters (Arch. Dermatol. 136[8]:989-94, 2000). The anticarcinogenic effects of green tea on human skin have not been demonstrated but have been suggested by multiplestudy findings. Individuals who consume green tea frequent-ly have a lower rate of gastric cancer (Jpn. J. Cancer Res.79[10]:1067-74, 1988). In mouse skin, green tea phenols werefound to inhibit both stage I and II of skin tumor promotion(Carcinogenesis 14[12]:2641-43, 1993). Studies in mice found that green tea phenols inhibit the bio- chemical markers of tumor initiation, scavenge the activatedmetabolites of carcinogens, and inhibit biochemical markers oftumor promotion (J. Invest. Dermatol. 102[1]:3-7, 1994). Hasan Mukhtar, Ph.D., found that in human skin, topical treatment with EGCG before UV exposure led to decreased for-mation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (Pro-ceedings of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists annual scientif-ic meeting, New York, 1999). Green tea has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and an- tioxidant effects in both human and animal skin. As inflammation and oxidative stress are believed to play a role in the aging process, green tea may also have antiaging ef-fects by decreasing inflammation and scavenging free radicals. Ronald L. Prior, Ph.D., and Dr. Guohua Cao of the Jean May- er Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts Uni-versity, Boston, found that green tea was able to increase antiox- idant status in vivo through oral consumption of 8-10 oftea per day (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 220[4]:255-61, 1999). In human skin, Dr. Mukhtar and associates found that topi- cally applied EGCG before exposure to UVB radiation blockedUVB-induced infiltration and reduced myeloperoxidase activity. They also found that UVB-induced erythema was decreased in skin previously treated with topical EGCG. In mice, topi-cal administration of EGCG to exposed areas was shown to de-crease UV-induced hyperplastic response and free radical pro- duction, as well as decreasing the infiltrationof inflammatory leukocytes and the inhibitionof contact hypersensitivity response (Proceed-ings of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists annualscientific meeting, 1999). Another interesting aspect of green tea con- sumption is that oral ingestion of green tea mayexert an effect in the skin. Drinking green teahas been shown to increase green tea phenol lev-els in skin as demonstrated by tape-stripping analysis (Interview with Dr. Mukhtar at the Society of CosmeticChemists annual scientific meeting, 1999). Chronic oral feeding of green tea phenols to mice followed by UVB irradiation was found to result in protection againstUV-induced cutaneous erythema and prevention of the deple-tion of antioxidant defense enzymes. Green tea was also found to decrease prostaglandin produc- tion by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity (Proceedings of theSociety of Cosmetic Chemists annual scientific meeting, 1999). Products containing green tea extracts can be easily obtained by the consumer. They can be found at department store cos-metic counters, in drugstores, and in supermarkets. While evidence is mounting as to the effectiveness of green tea phenols as antioxidants, most products containing these in-gredients have not been tested in controlled clinical trials. Theconcentration of phenols in these products is not standardized,nor is it known for the majority of these products. It is also not clear if the inclusion of products containing green tea extracts in cosmeceuticals is advantageous to patients.In addition, these products can be extremely expensive due tothe difficulties in extracting EGCG. Despite these drawbacks, green tea is a relatively harmless ingredient with much promise as an antioxidant. Although more studies need to be performed, patients should be encouraged to consume green tea and should not bediscouraged from using topical formulations, as many patientsfind the scent alone appealing. Green tea also appears to be safe, and contact allergy has notGreen Tea Continued on page 232MJJCOS_9_15_06.qxd 9/15/2006 2:27 PM Page 212222 Cosmeceutical Critique CompendiumThe essential oils in dermatology is rapidly acceler- ating throughout the world, and tea tree oil is one suchessential oil that is finding its way into many new cos- meceutical products. Although three species of coniferous Myrtaceae in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia are called tea trees, only theessential oil derived from the needles of the Australian Melaleu- ca alternifolia is used in medical and cosmetic products. Aromatherapists use the essential oils of all three species, but only M. alternifolia's oil has been extensively tested for toxici- ty and evaluated for antimicrobial activity(Phytother. Res. 14[8]:623-29, 2000). Tea tree oil, a clear liquid that ranges from colorless to faint yellow and has a distinct aro-ma, contains more than 100 natural com-pounds. Indigenous Australians have used it forcenturies as an herbal medicine, topical anti-septic, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. In recent years, a more expansive demo- graphic has come to use tea tree oil for a widerange of indications\u2014from acne, psoriasis, fungal infections,and vaginal infections to tinea, lice, rashes, cold sores, cuts,scratches, burns including sunburn, and dental applications. Tea tree oil is also being studied for its potential effective- ness against herpes simplex virus (J. Antimicrob. Chemother.48[3]:450-51, 2001). Tea tree oil is considered safe for use by most patients, and its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity has been acknowl-edged with increasing frequency in literature (J. Appl. Mi-crobiol. 88[1]:170-75, 2000; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.46[6]:1914-20, 2002). Given its reputation and anecdotal reports of effectiveness, tea tree oil has been incorporated into antifungal formulationsin soaps and shampoos, dental products (such as mouthwashand toothpaste), veterinary products (to ward off fleas and ticks),and various household and industrial disinfectants. Other potential applications include use as a laundry deter- gent ingredient (to eliminate mites) and as an antioxi-dant\u2014though one study suggests that tea tree oil lacks an-tioxidant activity (Phytother. Res. 14[8]:623-29, 2000). In an often-cited tea tree oil study by I.B. Bassett and col- leagues, both 5% tea tree oil and 5% benzoyl peroxide exhib-ited significant effects in improving patients' acne by reducingthe number of inflamed lesions, both open and closed comedones. Although tea tree oil's onset of action was slower, patients who were treated with tea tree oil had fewer side effects (Med.J. Aust. 153[8]:455-58, 1990). A recent study demonstrating the effectiveness of lipophilic tea tree oil in blocking the conversion of Candida albicans fromthe yeast to the pathogenic mycelial form suggests that tea tree oil may be a suitable agent for treating fungal mucosal and cu-taneous infections (J. Chemother. 13[4]:377-83, 2001). It also may have potential as an effective means of attacking several of the microbes typically associated with otitis externaand otitis media, though some ototoxicity is feared (Audiol.Neurootol. 5[2]:64-68, 2000). Despite favorable reports on tea tree oil's many beneficial ef- fects, there is little research showing the positive effects of teatree oil on dermatologic conditions. In one study, neither aloe vera gel nor tea tree oil was effective in treating atopic dermatitisand chronic venous insufficiency (Am. J. Clin.Dermatol. 3[5]:341-48, 2002). In a review of four randomized clinical trials, researchers acknowledged that tea tree oil mightbe effective in treating acne and fungal infections,but they said that there is no compelling evi-dence showing that tea tree oil is truly effectivein treating any dermatologic condition (Forsch. Komplementarmed. Klass. Naturheilkd 7[1]:17-20, 2000). In fact, tea tree oil may be implicated in triggering mild al- lergic reactions, such as allergic contact dermatitis. Cineole and terpinen appear to be the key medicinal com- ponents in tea tree oil, though terpinen has been implicated inallergic contact reactions. Several cases of sensitization to teatree oil have been reported in the last decade. Photoaged M. alternifolia , in particular, has emerged as a strong sensitizer (Ann. Dermatol. Venereol. 128[2]:123-26, 2001). Photooxidation within a few days to several months of ex- posure leads to the production of peroxides, epoxides, and en-doperoxides, such as ascaridol and 1,2,4-trihydroxymen-thane\u2014the in allergic contact dermatitis (Am.J. Contact Dermat. 10[2]:68-77, 1999). The increased use oftea tree oil over the last 15 years is expected to contribute toa higher incidence of contact dermatitis and eczema, accord-ing to some authors (Am. J. Contact Dermat. 11[4]:238-42,2000; J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 30[3]:423-27, 1994). Some components of tea tree oil, however, may actually re- duce hypersensitivity reactions, according to recent studies onmice conducted by C. Brand and colleagues. In one study, twocomponents of topical tea tree oil\u2014terpin-4-ol and alpha-ter-pineol\u2014were found to regulate the edema associated with theefferent phase of a contact hypersensitivity reaction (Inflamm.Res. 51[5]:236-44, 2002). Terpin-4-ol was also shown, in adifferent study by the same author, to be effective in control-ling the histamine-induced edema often linked to type 1 al-lergic reactions (Inflamm. Res. 51[6]:283-89, 2002). As always, it is important for dermatologists to be aware ofTea Tree Oil 2MJJCOS_9_7_06.qxd 9/8/2006 4:09 PM Page 22Cosmeceutical Critique Compendium 2233the products that patients might be using on their own. Many people view tea tree oil as a panacea for a long list of cutaneous conditions, as well as a potentweapon against many bacteria and fungi(Australas. J. Dermatol. 39[4]:244-47, 1998). Melaleuca oil\u2014which is widely available, particularly in health-food establishments\u2014appears to be generally safe for healthy skin.The most adverse reactions so far have beenmild cases of allergic contact dermatitis andeczema. More research into the different components of tea tree oil should yield a greater understanding among product develop-ers about how to reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions. In the meantime, expect tea tree oil to be included in anexpanding list of cosmeceuticals. Gillette, for example, now touts tea tree oil as the key ingredient in its new shaving gels and foams. The company included tea tree oilfor its astringent effect, claiming that the oilshould render the skin \"clean and fresh.\" With the paucity of reliable research in the Western medical canon, traditional practicesand anecdotal reports fill the knowledge gaps. Considerably more research\u2014particularly randomized, double-blind, controlled tri-als\u2014is necessary to establish the efficacy of products with tea tree oil in the treatment of dermatologic con-ditions for which patients are now self-treating.

Clin. 18[4]:597-607, 2000). It has also beenshown to prevent light damage to products while they are onthe shelves in stores and is added for preservative benefits.

Even when thepatient groups are matched appropriately, a trial to evaluate pre-vention of aging would take at least 20 years to complete. Physicians do not expect cosmetic clinical research to meet the exact same requirements that regulatory agencies have es-tablished for prescription drugs. Patient usage and physiolog-ic response are distinctly different with cosmetic products com-pared to prescription drugs. However, cosmetic clinical studiesthat demonstrate dermatologic benefits of an active product ver-sus a vehicle can still prove valuable to clinicians by establish-ing a basis for recommending specific cosmetic products to pa-tients. In the process, the patients' historical beliefs about naturalingredients can be supported with published scientific results. The content of this supplement to S KIN AND ALLERGY NEWS reflects some of the success stories in the development of cos-metic products based on natural ingredients or natural ingre-dients that have been improved by science. Cosmetic derma-tologists will find the information readily applicable to clinicalpractice. The information can help improve practitioners'knowledge of cosmetic products that patients hear about on aregular basis and then apply that information to make informed decisions about prescribing and patient counseling. Although I hope practitioners find useful information in each of the articles, much of the basis for this supplement lies in thediscussion of the 16 skin types that I have identified in my clin-ical and research experience in cosmetic dermatology. 4To make a truly informed decision about selecting and using skin care prod-ucts\u2014or to counsel patients about those products\u2014requires iden-tification and understanding of an individual's specific skin type.A questionnaire found in the book The Skin Type Solution can be used to accurately determine the skin type and what ingredientsare appropriate for that type. The key to effective skin care is toknow the patient's skin type and to choose the products and in-gredients that are most appropriate for that specific skin type. I References 1.
