Candidates will be contacted with further details. - - Who can apply You can apply for a Senior Research Fellowship if you're already leading your own independent research programme and you are an emerging global leader in your field. You should have a higher degree (PhD or equivalent) and significant research experience. You should be able to show: - you have a track record of holding independent funding such as project, programme or fellowship support - you have made important contributions to your area of research, for example publications, patents, software development or an impact on health policy or practice - your work is important, original and has impact - you have a strong rationale for needing a research fellowship rather than taking up an established post - you're committed to developing and mentoring less experienced researchers. You must have sponsorship from a head of department or equivalent at an [eligible host organisation](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/eligibility-information-applicants#eligible-host-organisations). Your host organisation must be located in one of the following: - UK - Republic of Ireland - a [low- or middle-income country](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries)apart from mainland China (only nationals of low- or middle-income countries have this third option). If you hold, or have recently held, a senior fellowship supported by another funding body, you can apply for a Senior Research Fellowship renewal of up to 5 years. You will need a 50% salary contribution from your host organisation. After this, you can't apply for a renewal. Please contact the relevant [Science team](https://wellcome.org/about-us/teams/science-teams)to discuss this and to find out how to apply. See the 'What we offer' section on this page for an update on renewals. If you've been away from research (for example for a career break, maternity leave, shared parental leave or long-term sick leave), we'll take this into account when we consider your application. Your research proposal All research proposals must: - be within our [science remit](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/science-remit) - describe an innovative and ambitious programme of work - explain the approaches that will be used to deliver that programme of work - be distinct from activities already supported by other awards. If you are a national of a low- or middle-income country and you propose to work in a low- or middle- income country, your research proposal must also focus on a health priority in that country. We will review: - your research contributions as an independent researcher relative to your career stage and taking into account any changes of discipline, career-breaks, periods of leave, or part-time work - the importance of your research question(s) - the feasibility of your proposal - the suitability of your research environment(s). Who can't apply You are not usually eligible if: - you have a permanent or rolling employment contract in the UK or Republic of Ireland, although we're willing to consider an application to move to a new organisation if you have a strong justification for it - you are a national of a low- or middle-income country proposing to work in a low- or middle- income country, and you have a permanent or rolling contract. If either of the above apply to you, please contact the relevant person in our [Science team](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/teams/science-teams)before you apply. If you don't, your application is likely to be rejected. In addition, you can't usually apply if: - you are currently applying for another Wellcome award for your research programme - you have already held the equivalent of two senior research fellowships from another funder - you are a researcher in India - instead go to the [Wellcome Trust/Department of Biotechnology India Alliance website](https://www.indiaalliance.org/). If you've already been unsuccessful with a full application for this scheme or one of the following schemes, please contact us before you apply again. - Senior Research Fellowships in Basic Biomedical Science - Senior Research Fellowships in Clinical Science - Senior Research Fellowships in Public Health and Tropical Medicine You can't apply to carry out activities that involve the transfer of grant funds into mainland China. What's expected of your host organisation Your host organisation must administer the fellowship for the full duration of your award. Your sponsor at the host organisation must be a head of department or equivalent. You also need a sponsor at every additional location you propose to work in if: - you spend more than a year at a different host organisation - your host organisation is in the UK or Republic of Ireland but you propose to work in a low- or middle-income country. Your sponsor and host organisation must guarantee that you'll get: - the support you need to lead your own independent research team - the space and resources you need - this must be agreed at the application stage and made available from the start date through to the end date of your award - the same status and benefits as other academic staff of similar seniority. See the 'What we offer' section on this page for an update on renewals. Your sponsor's support should be part of a longer-term commitment to help you achieve your career aspirations. We expect you to spend about 80% of your time on research-related activities. The rest of your time can be spent on other activities, such as clinical commitments, teaching or administration. If you are a clinician and you need additional time to maintain your clinical skills, please contact the relevant [Science team](https://wellcome.org/about-us/teams/science-teams)to discuss this. Other schemes Investigator Awards in ScienceEnabling independent researchers with a compelling research vision to tackle the most important questions in science. [Full details of Investigator Awards in Science](/grant-funding/schemes/investigator-awards-science) [Scheme finder](/funding/scheme-finder) - - A Senior Research Fellowship is typically 5 years, but can be up to 7 years if scientifically justified. New applicants who are awarded this fellowship after 1 October 2020 will no longer be able to apply for a renewal at the end of their award. Current Senior Research Fellows can apply for a renewal if they are on their first award and it ends on or before 31 October 2022. They must submit their application by 1 July 2021 (see the 'key dates' section on this page). We will cover 50% of their salary and direct research costs. The fellowship may be held on a part-time basis. The award includes: - - We will fund the total cost of your salary for the entire period of the grant. You can only receive one salary. If you're working in a low- or middle-income country of which you are a national and you already have a salary, your host organisation may use it to pay the person who replaces you. You should ask your host organisation to calculate your salary. It should: - reflect the skills, responsibilities and expertise needed to carry out the role - be based on the pay scales of the host organisation that will be employing you - be enough to allow you to focus full-time on research - be justified by the head of the organisation. Your salary should include: - your basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (eg National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You shouldn't include: - any potential promotion costs - any Wellcome fellowship supplement that was part of a previous grant. If your host organisation is in a low- or middle-income country and you will be working in a high-income country for four weeks or more, you should be paid at an appropriate rate for that country, according to your age and experience. You should only allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. These should be based on pay awards already agreed: if you don't know what the pay award is yet then use our inflation rate of 2.0%. From Year 2 onwards, we will automatically increase your salary, based on our current inflation allowance rates. If you are a clinical academic, your salary should be appropriate to your clinical status and within the salary scale for academic and senior clinical lecturers. If you're paid on a non-clinical salary scale, your basic salary should be in line with academics of a similar seniority.

You can ask for larger items of equipment if they're not available at your host organisation. If a complete piece of equipment costs \u00a3100,000 or more, we expect a contribution of at least 25 per cent from the host organisation or another source. In some cases we may expect a larger contribution. We'll discuss this with you after we've assessed your application. Contributions can include benefits in kind, such as refurbishment or the underwriting of a key support post. Equipment maintenance We will cover maintenance costs for equipment if: - you are requesting it in your application - it is existing equipment that is: - funded by us or another source - essential to the proposed research project - more than five years old - cost effective to keep maintaining it. We won't cover maintenance costs for equipment if there is a mechanism in place to recoup these costs through access charges. Computer equipment We will cover the cost of one personal computer or laptop per person up to \u00a31,500. We won't pay for: - more expensive items, unless you can justify them - installation or training costs. - - - You can ask for the cost of access to shared equipment or facilities if they're essential to your research project. These may include materials and consumables, plus a proportion of: - maintenance and service contracts - staff time costs for dedicated technical staff employed to operate the equipment or facility. We don't cover the costs of: - estates and utilities - depreciation or insurance - other staff eg contributions towards departmental technical, administrative and management staff time.

If you're based at a UK university you can't ask for overheads for sub-contracted activity if your university will include the sub-contracted funding in its annual report to the UK Charity Research Support Fund. Overheads can include: - estates, for example building and premises - non-project dedicated administrative and support staff - administration, for example finance, library, and room hire. The total cost for overheads should not be more than: - 20% of the direct research costs if you're based in a low- or middle-income country - 15% of the direct research costs if you're based anywhere else. These costs must directly support the activity funded by the grant. How to apply for these costs In your grant application you must: - give a full breakdown of costs (you can't ask for a percentage of the research costs) - explain why these costs are necessary for your research - include a letter from the finance director of your host organisation, or the sub-contracted organisation, confirming that the breakdown is a true representation of the costs incurred. - - - Travel costs Conference attendance You can ask for a contribution towards the costs of attending scientific and academic meetings and conferences, including registration fees and the costs to offset the carbon emissions of your travel.
