The demographic and health survey in 2010 showed th at our vision of reducing the infant and child mortality is not a dream (infa nt mortality :from 86 deaths in 2005 to 50 deaths/1000 live births in 2010; under 5 mortali ty from 152 deaths in 2005 to 76 deaths/1000 live births in 2010 ); This is not a re sult of mere chance, so many things have been done to improve health of our citizens, with o ther interventions we have to mention introduction of new vaccines in routine imm unization, supplementary immunization activities, improvement of access of c hild to health care using Community Health Workers during community IMCI, etc. This revised comprehensive multi year plan of Vacci ne Preventable Diseases Division 2013-2017 has taken into consideration opi nions from various people and actors in immunization activities and replace the existing one in which the new vaccines were not included. The Ministry of health will ensure th at all activities are being done as planned and this document will help us, as a dashbo ard that will also help to implement the health sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III) at least the part on child health. The government of Rwanda through the ministry of health , expresses thanks to all stakeholders, both individuals and organizations in volved in promotion of child health, together we can achieve the millennium development goals and do even more. Dr Agnes BINAGWAHO Minister of Health 6I. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Geopolitical Background Information Rwanda is situated in central Africa, south of the Equator, between 1\u00b04' and 2\u00b051' latitude South and 28\u00b053' longitude East. With a s urface area of 26,338 square kilometres, it is bordered to the North by Uganda, to the South by Burundi, to the West by the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to the Eas t by Tanzania. Lacking access to the sea, Rwanda is land-locked and is located, as t he crow flies, 1200 km from the Indian Ocean and 2000 km from the Atlantic Ocean. Its top ography is mountainous and the average altitude is 1700 meters. In terms of climate, Rwanda enjoys a temperate, sub -equatorial climate with average yearly temperatures around 18.5\u00b0C.The average annua l rainfall is 1,250 millimeters, which occurs over two rainy seasons of differing le ngths that alternate with one long and one short dry season. The climate varies somewhat f rom region to region, depending on the altitude. The volcano range and northern highla nds are generally cooler and wetter, with an average temperature of 16\u00b0C and an average rainfall above 1,300 millimeters. The maximum rainfall is 1,600 millimeters above the Divide and the volcanic range. The hilly central region receives an average of 1,000 t o 1,300 millimeters of rain per year, while rainfall on the eastern plateau, where the cl imate is relatively warmer and drier, generally falls below 1,000 millimeters and can be as low as 800 millimeters. Although Rwanda enjoys more or less constant temperatures, t he climate is known to vary from year to year, with extreme variations in rainfall s ometimes resulting in flooding or, more often, drought. These extremes have a profound impa ct on agricultural production ( Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey, 2010). Administratively, Rwanda is divided into four provi nces plus the city of Kigali, 30 districts, and 438 health units. The smallest admi nistrative unit is the cell. 1.2 Socio-demographic data According to the report from the general census of the population and habitat (RGPH), conducted in 2002, the population of Rwanda was est imated to 8,128,553 inhabitants. (RGPH, 2002) Taking into account the national population growt h rate of 2.6%, the population of Rwanda was estimated to 9,981, 415 in habitants in 2010. Projection for 2011 estimated the same population to be 10,240,932 inhabitants. The census data in 2002 indicated that 52% of the population was femal e and 48% of the population was male (approximately 91.5 men for every 100 women). The majority of Rwandan populations live in rural s ettings (83.3%). In terms of urbanization, Rwanda has one of the least urbanized populations in Africa. However, the census figures showed that the urban population has grown rapidly, increasing from 5.5% to 16.7% of the total population from 1991 to 2002. 7 1.3 Organization of health services delivery system Services are provided at different levels of the he alth care system (community health, health posts (HP), health centres (HC), district ho spitals (DH) and referral hospitals) and by different types of providers (public, confession al, private-for-profit and NGO). At all levels, the sector is composed of administrative st ructures (Boards / Committees) and implementing agencies. At village level, the Community Health Workers (CHW ) are supervised administratively by those in charge of social services and technical ly by those in charge of health centers. CHW receive a compensation for their work from the PBF through formally established local cooperatives. At sector level, there are HC Committees providing oversight on the work of the various units in the Health Centre, its outreach and superv ision activities and general financial control. At District level, agencies are District Hospitals (DH), pharmacies, community based health insurance (CBHI) and HIV/AIDS committees. Fo r clinical services they report to the Director of the District Hospital. However, for administrative matters, the agencies are under the supervision of the responsible for So cial Affairs of the district. Each district has a District Health Unit (DHU), being an administ rative unit in charge of the provision of health services in the district and responsible for planning, monitoring, supervision of implementing agencies, intersectoral collaboration and coordination with DPs operating in the district (through the Joint Action Developme nt Forum (JADF). The DHU is composed of two technical staff members (Planning a nd M&E) and reports to the responsible for Social Affairs or to the District C ouncil if applicable. The Director of the District Hospital reports to th e DHU on the performance of the DH. Rwanda currently has 4 referral hospitals, 42 distr ict hospitals and 438 health centers. 8 1.4 Vaccine Preventable Diseases Division, Organiza tion and functionality Due to the reform occurred in Ministry of Health as well as in other ministries of Rwanda in 2010, Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) gathering d ifferent programs of MoH; was created and include former EPI which is now called Vaccine Preventable Diseases Division (VPDD) The overall goal of the national VPDD (Former EPI) is to contribute to the improved well-being of the Rwandan people through reduction of child morbidity and mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases. Created in 1978, EPI in Rwanda became operational in 1980. It is comprised of three principal component s: routine vaccination, supplemental immunization activities, and surveillance for targe t diseases. Since 1996, EPI has had a functioning Interagency C oordinating Committee (ICC). This group includes senior officials from the Ministry o f Health, representatives from different funding partners (WHO, UNICEF, USAID, etc.), and ot her parties interested in participating in this committee. The ICC remains op ened to new members who have interest in joining it. The ICC for immunization i s active and, above all, plays technical and advocacy role in support of the program. ICC m eetings are regularly held and their proceedings are approved through formal written min utes. The VPDD works in close collaboration with other di visions of RBC and directorates of the Ministry of Health, as well as with districts H ospitals. The program also maintains partnerships with different ministries, seeking the ir engagement in social mobilization, especially for national or local vaccination campai gns. At the community level, the program supports a network of community volunteers called \"Community Health Workers \", whose assistance is increasingly relied upon, particularly in the areas of community sensitization and reduction of immunizati on drop-out rates. Immunization activities are fully integrated into t he routine health services within each health facility. Routine immunization is intended to reach all infants 0-11 months of age with nine available vaccines to protect them from the fo llowing vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) b, measles, streptococcus pneumonia and rotavirus infections ---. In addition, all the adol escent girls 10-14 years of age are targeted to be protected from cervical cancer with human pap illoma virus vaccine (HPV) and pregnant women to be protected from tetanus, during the antenatal care visits, according to the WHO immunization schedule with toxoid tetanu s (TT). In 2002, Rwandan VPDD expanded its immunization sch edule to include the pentavalent vaccine, a DPT containing vaccine (DPT-HepB+Hib), g iven to all children at the same time with oral polio vaccine (OPV). In April 2009, a new vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was also introduced to Nati onal Immunization Program. In 2011, HPV vaccine was added to the routine immuniza tion program in order to protect adolescent girls from cervical cancer using a schoo l-based immunization approach. In May 2012, VPDD introduced one more life-saving vacc ine, the rotavirus vaccine, into its routine program and, finally, in 2013, measles-rube lla vaccine (MR vaccine), a measles containing vaccine (MCV), will be introduced in th e routine program as a second dose of measles vaccine and, to take the same opportunity o f accelerating measles elimination 9activities to introduce a rubella containing vacci ne (RCV). With the introduction of rotavirus vaccine (introduced in 2012) and of the M R vaccine as a second dose of measles vaccine and rubella vaccine, the Rwandan im munization schedule will be as follows: Table 01 : National VPDD immunization schedule Currently Available Vaccines Vaccine Total doses Age and interval BCG 1 Birth OPV 4 Birth, 6, 10, 14 weeks DTP or DTP-HepB-Hib 3 6, 10, 14 weeks Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 3 6, 10, 14 weeks Rotavirus vaccine 1 3 6, 10, 14 weeks Measles-rubella (MR vaccine) 1 9 months Measles vaccine 2 1 12 months TT (pregnant women) 2 During pregnancy HPV 3 3 3 doses of HPV for each cohort of girls 9-14 yrs old The Rwandan national EPI, known as a Vaccine Preven table Disease Division (VPDD) comprises a very small team of 8 technical staff an d a division supportive team. The technical staffs are: EPI Coordinator and Head of the VPDD, one (1) Epidemiologist, one (1) Data Manager & Monitoring Officer, two (2) VPD Surveillance Officers, one (1) Director of immunization Unit working with a Cold C hain / vaccine storage Officer and a Storage Management / Vaccine procurement Officer, o ne (1) \"International vaccination\" Officer dealing with yellow fever vaccination for t ravellers. The supportive team is comprised of one Accountant, one administrative ass istant, one driver and 2 Messengers. The organizational chart for the division is shown in the figure bellow. The program is planning to hire the following addit ional staff:, Logistics Assistant, a Dry store keeper and a second driver. 1 Rotavirus vaccine is given in 3 doses, the first d ose no later than 15 weeks of age and the last dose by 32 weeks of age 2 Second dose of measles vaccine will be introduced in 2013: MR vaccine at 9 month and measles vaccine alone at 12 months of age 3 Human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV) will use a school based vaccination campaign approach ORGANIZATIONAL CHART FOR VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEAS ES DIVISION (Immunization System Unit) DIRECTOR OF IMMUNIZATION SYSTEM AND SAFETY(C S) Cold Chain and Vaccine Storage officer (P) (VPDD) HEAD OF VACCINE Epidemiologist Specialist (CS) Store Management and Vaccine procurement (o fficer (P) Accountant (P) IHDPC VPD Surveillance service -Surveillance Officer (CS) - Surveillance sample collection and reporting officer (P) Administrative Assistant (C S) C.S International Vaccination Officer (P) Data Quality Supervision and reporting System Desk (P) Support Staff - Messengers (P) - Drivers (P) - Store Keeper Assistant (P) II. VPDD SITUATION ANALYSIS The current VPDD situation analysis takes into co nsideration the following components: Service delivery, Surveillance of vaccine preventab le diseases and of the AEFIs, Vaccine supply and quality, Cold chain & Logistics, Communi cation / social mobilization, Management, Capacity building and Finance. 2.1. Service Delivery Immunization activities remain part of the minimum package of interventions which are integrated within a health facility unit. In order to reach high proportion of target population, national EPI uses the following strateg ies: integration of immunization services at fixed health centres, combination of se veral approaches to reach the unreached in health catchment's areas especially in the hard to reach areas. However, more than 90% of Rwandan's children are immunized at the fixe d immunization sites 4. The outreach strategy has been revitalized in most of h ealth facilities, using financial support made available by Government and GAVI Alliance. Sin ce 2005, RED approach was introduced in all health districts. In 2007, ITN di stribution and vitamin A supplementation were integrated with immunization s ervices at heath centres. In 2005, PBF, which includes an overall of about 24 health i ndicators, among which the one targeting fully immunized children was, introduced at the health centre and community health worker levels. The following tables and graphs show the trends of immunization indicators in the country. 2.1.1. Administrative vaccination coverage data Graph 01: Routine immunization coverage data by ant igen, Rwanda, 2002-2011 020 40 60 80 100 120 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Coverage (%) Years BCG Penta 3 PCV 3 OPV 3 Measles data, national EPI Rwanda, 2 012 4National Immunization Coverage Survey, conducted in 2007 12 According to the graph above, the immunization cove rage for almost all antigens increased and was maintained at a higher level (exc ept for TT2+) from 2002 to 2007. From 2008, however, coverage started to decline whi le the surveillance indicators (except for the measles) were at a good level (no wild poli ovirus case was detected, incidence rate of MNT case remained lower than 1 per 1000 liv e births). Given this situation, in August 2010, a joint team from the Ministry of heal th and the WHO country office conducted a survey in 4 districts where the very lo w level of immunization coverage was reported. Findings from this survey showed the foll owing results: a) The proportion of under one year children was 2.6% (survey) instead of 4.1% as reported by health management information system (H MIS); b) The number of recorded children < 1 year old was 31 588 (survey) compared to 53 336 estimates used by HMIS ; c) Penta 3 coverage was 100% (survey) compared to 66% as reported by HMIS. Findings from this survey showed that the denominat or used to calculate administrative coverage data was over estimated (4.1% as estimated by projection from the 2002 census, around 9 years ago). The low proportion of children < 1 year of age (2.6% of the total population) is probably due to the improvement of F amily Planning coverage (use of contraceptive methods which passed from 5% in 2002 to 51% in 2010). In 2011, immunization coverage started to rise again and sho wn on the graph n\u00b0 01. For TT2+ coverage, the low coverage rate may be rel ated to the recording system. The recording system in place doesn't allow the health workers to record appropriately TT doses as TT3 or TT4 or TT5. The PCV vaccine was introduced late in April 2009 b y provincial phased approach; in addition, it took about 4 months, from April to Aug ust 2009, to cover the entire country with this vaccine. The proportion of the annual coh ort infants (< 1 year of age) who received the first dose of PCV7 and the third dose of PCV7 in 2009 was respectively 54.4% and 40.2%. From 2010 to 2011, PCV coverage im proved and reached the same level as the one of penta vaccine. Drop-out pneumo1 -3, which started at 71% in June 2009, declined rapidly to reach the level of 3.1% i n 2011. The same year, PCV coverage increased and reached the same level as for Penta 3 (82%). Table 02: District performance, Rwanda, 2009-2011 District performances Number of districts 2009 2010 2011 Penta 3 < 50% 0 0 0 Pneumo 3<50% 0 0 Penta 3 50% <80% 5 26 14 Pneumo3 50% <80% 26 14 Penta3 80% 25 18 18 Pneumo3 80% 18 18 13 In addition, Rwandan EPI started to report high num ber of children who failed to receive 3rd dose of Penta vaccine. The number of unimmunized c hildren which declined from 2002 to 2006, started to increase again from 2007 t o 2010. As response to these findings, the staff from VPDD and partners intensified supportive supervision visits in the hard-to-reach areas, work ed with health workers and members of the community to identify the hard-to-reach childre n and immunize them. As result to this intervention, in 2011, the number of unimmuniz ed children started to decrease as shown on the following graph. 2.1.2. Drop-outs (D.O.) Table Rwanda, 2003-2011 D.O. rates 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 10% for Pneumo 100% 97 Source: EPI data base, 2012 14 From 2003-2010, all districts were performing well, related to this indicator. In 2011, however, for both vaccines, in 3% of districts, dro p-out rate penta 1-3 and pneumo were greater than 10%. 2.1.3. Supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) In 2003, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011 measles SIA, int egrated campaign (polio, measles, vitamin A, mebendazole and ITN distribution) and HP V vaccine were conducted and reached respectively high proportion of children as shown in the table 04 below. Table 04: Integrated measles campaign, Rwanda, 2003 , 2006 and 2011 Interventions Coverage 2003 2006 2009 2010 2011 Measles campaign 97% Polio **98% ***99% in Rusizi district in July 20 10 ** Polio campaign integrated with MCH week in Novem ber 2010 ***Mini Polio campaign in 3 bordering districts at high risk: Rusizi, Nyamasheke and Rubavu in Decembe r 2011 High proportion of children was reached during the measles catch-up campaign in 2003 (97%). Again, for the measles follow-up campaign an d other interventions - vitamin A supplementation and deworming conducted from 2006 t o 2011, the coverage exceeded the 100% (probably due to the unknown denominator). In 2011, a 3 round-campaign of HPV vaccination were conducted and targeted adolesc ent girls aged 9 -14 years. For each round of the campaign, more than 95% of the targete d population was reached with HPV dose. Table below shows HPV coverage rate by round in 2011. 15 Table 05: HPV vaccination coverage by round, admini strative data, Rwanda, 2011 HPV 1st dose HPV 2nd dose HPV 3rd dose Target No of immunized girls 91,752 89,704 88,927 Percentage (%) 2.2. Surveillance Immunization surveillance system, in Rwanda, is int egrated with other disease surveillance which report cases and deaths to the E pidemic and infectious diseases division (EIDD) / RBC. Despite the fact that the va ccine preventable diseases are reported though the EIDD, measles, polio and neonat al tetanus are reported directly to VPDD in order to avoid delay the decision making pr ocess in case of outbreak. Monthly coordination meetings are held between VPDD and oth ers services (national reference laboratory, EIDD and lab of the University teaching hospital of Kigali). Global initiatives: polio eradication (documentation on polio certification) , MNT elimination since 2004 and measles control) are key areas where surveillance data is being collected routinely. The following table shows the reported performance indicators for AFP, wild polio virus, suspected and confirmed measles cases, indicators f or maternal neonatal tetanus (MNT), suspected and confirmed cases of severe gastroenter itis due to rotavirus and finally the paediatric bacterial meningitis. Table 05: Surveillance indicators for Vaccine Preve ntable Diseases Division , Rwanda, 2005-2011 Diseases Years Indicators 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Polio No polio AFP cases/100,000 people < 15yr 1.9 2.25 2.65 2.4 3.6 3.2 2.6 WPV 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measles % districts with suspected measles cases 50 93 90 80 93.3 100% 100% # lab confirmed cases reported 25 43 13 5 5 55 23 Rubella Suspected cases NR NR 147 186 254 517 318 Confirmed cases NR NR 4 37 36 NR NR NR NR 16 Diseases Years Indicators 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 MNT # districts with suspected cases 4 2 1 1 0 0 1 # cases/1000 live births < 1 < 1 < 1 < 1 < 1 <1 <1 Diarrhoea 5 Diarrhoea cases with stool samples 32 262 Rotavirus + 10 133 Data from HMIS, in 2008, have shown that diarrheal disease is among the most leading causes of child deaths in Rwanda. Since 2002, Rwanda initiated the paediatric bacteri al meningitis surveillance system (PBMS) in one site (University teaching hospital of Kigali). The same year, the National Immunization Program introduced the Hib and HepB va ccines, combined to DTP vaccine (Pentavalent vaccine). In 2009, S. pneumonia\u00eb surveillance was integrated to the PBMS. The following table gives figures from the sentinel site. Since pentavalent vaccination started in 2002 and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in April 2009, the Haemophilus influenzae , type b and the S. pneumoniae figures after 2009 are post- introduction. Table 06: Confirmed Meningitis cases by pathogen, CH Kigali, 2009- 2011 5 Data from CHU of Kigali, March, 2012 17 2002-Oct 2009 Nov-Dec 2009 2010 2011 Cases Deaths Cases Deaths Cases Deaths Cases Deaths Hib 5 2 0 0 S. pneumoniae 29 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 N.meningitidis 17 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 Other pathogens 7 2 1 0 1 0 2 0 Negative 861 67 49 4 54 0 27 1 Total 902 89 50 4 55 5 29 1 % of 02- 2011 Cervical cancer , the most common cancer among women in Rwanda, is an important national public health concern. The World Health Or ganization ranks Rwanda among the countries worldwide with the highest cervical cance r incidence*, estimated at 49.4/100,000 .6 This incidence estimate is consistent with cervical cancer incidence found in Eastern African overall (42.7/100,000 women/year ). Data from a population-based cancer registry in But are which functioned during the early 1990s showed cervical cancer responsible for 22.5% of cancers among women 7 . In a retrospective study of cancer cases from two univer sity teaching hospitals (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Cent re Hospitalier Universitaire de Butare [CHUB]) seen from 2000 through 2004, cervica l cancer accounted for 27.3% of cancers among the women and was the most common mal ignancy encountered in all age groups .8 2.3. Vaccine supply, management and quality Traditional vaccines are procured by the Government through UNICEF channel on basis of annual forecast estimates. Penta vaccine (introd uced in 2002), PCV vaccine (introduced in 2009) and rotavirus vaccine are co-f inanced between Government and GAVI Alliance. For HPV vaccine, Rwanda signed a MOU with Merck, Co and received HPV vaccine donation for three years (2011-2013). Vaccines are supplied to the national Program twice a year. Once every month, district hospitals using their own vehicles, come to the cen tral level and collect vaccines upon their request and get the required amount. In case of emergency and during Supplemental immunization campaigns, central level distributes t he needed amount of vaccines to the identified health districts using the VPDD's refrig erated truck. Health centres, using the same requisition system, collect vaccines from the district hospital cold stores using Health centre's motorbikes . *age-standardized 6 Castellsagu\u00e9 X, et al.

The table below summarized stocks of vaccines recei ved, distributed and remaining stock at central level in 2011. District hospitals and health centres record all va ccines and diluents separately at stock ledgers; central vaccine store, however, does not r ecord any information about diluents. Table 07: Vaccine supply and distribution, Central cold store, Rwanda, 2011 Vaccines Stock on Jan 1 st 2011 # doses received in 2011 Total stock in 2011 Distributed in 2011 Stock on Dec 31, 2011 % distributed in 2011 % in stock end 2011 BCG 375 300 600 000 975300 628 800 346 500 70 30 OPV 1 301 700 1 160 000 2461700 1 358 400 1 101 600 55 45 DPT-HepB-Hib 206 400 1 344 800 1551200 1 060 420 490 780 68 32 PCV 506 225 1 324 800 1831025 1002 200 828 825 55 45 Measles 274 360 443 900 718269 408 160 310 100 57 43 TT 156 700 530 000 686700 473 500 213 200 69 31 HPV 0 522420 522420 289720 232700 55 45 Source: National cold store, Rwanda, 2012 Looking at this table, except for BCG, Penta and TT vaccine which 70%, 68%, and 69% of available doses were distributed respectively du ring the year, the other vaccines, less than 60% of the available doses was distributed for each in 2011 (ranging from 55% to 57%) with the big amount of vaccine remaining at th e central level. This situation might have a link with the fact that more than the needed vaccines were ordered; for this reason, vaccine forecasting approach might have played a ne gative role in vaccine management process (inappropriate vaccine wastage rates used, unknown target population used or inappropriate distribution approach used in the cou ntry). A functional computerized stock management system is needed for the central store w ith the definition of Min, Max and Alert stock level and their monitoring. Cold chain equipment at central level (cold rooms) does not have automatic continuous temperature recorders. Temperatures are being monit ored manually, twice a day and during the weekend and holidays. At district and he alth facility levels, temperatures are monitored by health workers, twice a day, unfortuna tely temperatures data are not 9 EVM conducted in 2011 19 analyzed. Most often, icepack are not conditioned b efore distribution of liquid vaccines at the lower level. 2.4. Cold chain and Logistics In 2011, Rwandan EPI, with technical support from p artners, conducted Effective Vaccine Management survey (EVM) to assess vaccine m anagement, cold chain situation and logistics issues. Findings from this assessment were used to develop an improvement plan which the program started to implement immedia tely as the Program was getting ready to introduce rotavirus vaccine. EVM identified the following areas of improvement: (a) temperature monitoring, (b) cold and dry storage, (c capacity, (d) cold chain building, (e) stock management, (f) distribution and vaccine management. The following activities were carried o ut as part of improvement plan after the EVM. The multilog devices was procured awaiting to be in stalled Non function fridge tag replacement was initiated Additional shelves in the cold rooms is in the tend ering process The UNICEF accepted to procure three cold units for cold rooms A functional computerized stock management system h as been put in place, training on SMT done and put in use at central level. Vaccine package for transportation is now done acco rding to WHO guidelines with proper ice pack conditioned during transportation 2.4.1. Cold and Dry stores At central level, vaccines are kept in 4 positive w alk-in cold rooms and one freezer room. Additionally there is one chest freezer to keep ret urning campaign OPV vials. In October 2007, WHO Consultant and the MOH/EPI sta ff conducted a cold chain & logistics assessment (VMA and Rapid Assessment Tool were used) and identified the gaps for new vaccine introduction (PCV7). In order to accommodate the PCV7 vaccine, MOH and one of its partners (USAID) procured additi onal cold chain equipment for all levels. One additional walk-in-cold room of 15m3 wa s purchased and installed bringing the total up to 4 cold rooms - 3 positive and 1 neg ative - and hundreds of refrigerators, cold boxes, vaccine carriers and spare parts and di stributed to district hospitals and health centres. Current net capacity of the cold rooms can be improved with additional shelves. All cold rooms and freezer rooms at central cold st ore should be fitted with dual refrigeration units. Continuous temperature monitoring devices should be used at all levels. 30 day temperature monitors (Fridge-Tag) should be procure d for all refrigerators used at district hospitals and health centres. The Multilog devices provided by UNICEF should be installed at the central cold store (CS) as soon as possible. 20 The Rwandan's VPDD doesn't have regional cold store for vaccines. All vaccines are directly collected from national cold store and sto red at district hospital cold stores. Each district hospital received additional cold chain eq uipment to accommodate new vaccines. VPDD, in addition to HPV vaccine, introduced rotavi rus vaccine in May 2012 and plans to introduce measles-rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) a s a second dose for measles vaccination in 2013. Before the introduction of HPV and rotavirus vaccines, districts and central level received new equipment to accommodate these new vaccines. Based on the findings from updated cold chain inventory, inform ation was analysed using the WHO Logistics Forecasting Tool and estimated the additi onal equipment needed for MR vaccine accommodation. Based on these assessments, the following cold chain equipment needs were identified: Table 08: Additional cold chain equipment needed an d received, EPI Rwanda, 2013-2014 Level Cold chain equipment 2013 2014 Total needed Total received Partners Central Cold room 1 0 1 Electric refrigerators 4 0 4 Icepacks 4000 0 4000 Districts TCW 3000 24 22 46 CB/INO/B3/90 40 40 80 Health facilities Sibir V170 EK 50 81 131 Vaccine carriers 250 250 500 21 Table 8.1: Capacity and cost (for positive storage) National vaccine store Formula 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 A Annual positive volume requirement, including new vaccine (specify:__________) (litres) Sum-product of total vaccine doses multiplied by number of shipments per year required for the actual cold chain capacity A/B 2.07 2.13 2.28 2.38 2.50 2.56 D Number of consignments / shipments per year Based on national vaccine shipment plan 4 4 4 4 4 4 E Gap in liters ((A/D) - B) -26,576 litr - 19,771 litr F Estimated additional US $ $0 $0 $39,584 $46,389 $39,584 $39,584 22 Table 8.2 : Capacity and cost (for negative storage) National vaccine store Formula 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 A Annual negative volume requirement, including new vaccine (specify:_______) (litres) Sum-product of total vaccine doses multiplied by packed minimum number of shipments per year required for the actual cold chain capacity A/B 0.28 0.29 0.31 0.32 0.34 0.34 D Number of consignments / shipments per year Based on national vaccine shipment plan 2 2 2 2 2 2 E Gap in litres ((A/D) - B) - 5,879 litr F Estimated US $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 23 24 2.4.2 Transport (national and district levels) At the national level, refrigerator's truck is avai lable for vaccine distribution in case of emergency and two 4WD vehicles for supportive super vision activities with two drivers. (A second driver just hired in 2012). The program n eeds one more vehicle and one additional drivers in order to cover effectively it s needs. In most of the cases, staff from district hospitals comes to collect vaccines and other medical supplies once every month. At this level, a n ambulance and a 4WD vehicle are available for vaccine, drug distribution, and for s upervision activities. At the health facility level, motorcycles are avail able and bicycles for community health workers. Staff from health facility level goes to c ollect vaccines, other medical supplies and bring reports, once every month, at the distric t hospital level. 2.4.3. Maintenance Contracts of maintenance were signed with private c ompanies for all equipments of the division at the national level. At district level, some staffs were trained for preventive maintenance of cold chain equipments and spare part s are provided as needed. 2.5. Advocacy, Communication / Social Mobilization There is a Communication Center for Health Sector i n Rwanda (RHCC). The Center was created in 2002 and since then, provides technical support to all health programs / services. VPDD provide technical and relevant infor mation to RHCC, Concerning the routine immunization program; however the efforts h ave to be amplified like the accent is made mostly for Supplementary Immunization Activiti es (SIAs). The Center works with the following different organ izations: Red Cross works with community, especially during t he mass campaigns. URUNANA Development which works with BBC and Europe an Union PROFEMME TWESE HAMWE which sensitizes population at the community level There is no communication plan for immunization fou nd at the national level (EPI). However, at the community level, about 13,000 commu nity volunteers are working at the peripheral level with health workers, tracking defa ulters and promoting immunization activities. During the preparation of pneumococcal conjugate va ccine introduction, a communication subcommittee was put in place and add ressed the main concerns of parents and of the health workers for the introduct ion of this vaccine. The subcommittee developed and pre tested key messages for parents b efore and immediately after immunization session. 25 2.6. New and Underutilized vaccine introduction a) Rotavirus vaccine Given the prevalence of diarrheal diseases in Rwand a, the availability of effective rotavirus vaccines and the WHO recommendation to al l countries of all regions, to introduce this life-saving vaccine into the routine EPI programs, Government of Rwanda just introduced successfully rotavirus vaccine in i ts routine immunization program. On May 25, 2012, a 3-dose rotavirus vaccine (Rota Teq vaccine) was introduced. Focus for the country now is the intensification of supportiv e supervision to make sure that more eligible children are being vaccinated and the moni toring of AEFI related to the new vaccine is effective. b) Measles second dose (MSD) and rubella containing vaccine (RCV) introduction In 2011, EPI Rwanda reported administrative measles vaccination coverage of 77%, nationwide. Because of the theoretical measles vacc ine efficacy of 85%, only 65% would be protected among the immunized children; about 35 % of immunized children failed to seroconvert and remained at risk of being infected by measles virus. In addition to the non-protected vaccinated children, the unreached ch ildren with measles vaccine (about 23%) were also at risk of getting measles. The accu mulation of this susceptible population for measles virus can explain the occurr ence of measles outbreaks observed in some health districts. VPDD Rwanda conducted measles vaccination campaign in districts where the outbreak occurred, targeting all children 0-59 months of age , and vaccinated most of children who already received first dose of measles vaccine (MCV 1). Unfortunately, for some unknown reasons, some were not protected. In additi on, EPI team reached some other who missed the first dose of measles vaccine. Based on the experience of measles campaign and of the WHO recommendation, EPI Rwanda decided to introduce a second dose of measles vaccine into its routine EPI system . Based on global burden of rubella infection, of the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and of the proven efficacy and safety of RCVs, WHO recommends that countries take the available opportunity to accelerate measles control or elimination activities by introducing the rubella containing vaccine (RCVs). For this reason, EPI Rwanda plans to introduce a second dose of measles vaccine (MSD/RCV ) in its routine immunization system. c) Human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV) In April 2011, VPDD Rwanda received a donation of H PV vaccine from a manufacturer (Merck, Co) for a three year-period (2011-2013). Ac cording to the MOU signed between Merck and GOR, Merck was supposed to provide the va ccine for a period of 3 years and Government of Rwanda to pay for injection material and all the operational costs. HPV vaccine received from Merck as a donation will end in 2013. Given the opportunity provided by GAVI for this vaccine, Rwanda would lik e to take the available opportunity, develop and submit a proposal to GAVI to continue t he use of this vaccine in the routine beyond 2013. 26 As for the previous introduced vaccines (Pentavalen t vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, rotavirus vaccine and HPV), EPI team with support f rom partners have already updated the cold chain inventory and assessed for additiona l cold chain equipment needs to accommodate new vaccines, HPV vaccine and MR vaccin e for an initial catch-up campaign and as a second dose (MSD/RCV) based on th e WHO recommendation. MSD/RCV and HPV vaccine introduction plans were dev eloped in order to identify the relevant and specific key activities for the introd uction process. Among the planned activities are the following: (a) For MSD/RCV: a. Review epidemiology of rubella, including suscepti bility profile of the population, b. Establish a system to collect and assess the burden of CRS in Rwanda, c. Advocate for a strong political commitment to the e limination of rubella and CRS and sustainable financing for vaccination and surveillance activities (b) For HPV vaccine: a. Revise the current plan (developed in 2011) in orde r to continue with HPV immunization of adolescent girls beyond 2013 (c) For both of them, reinforce the coordination with E PI partners, address the remaining issues related to technical, financial and logistic s. (d) Organize and identify technical, logistics and soci al mobilization needs as the country is getting ready to introduce these new and under u sed vaccines (training of health workers, revision of all EPI data collection and ma nagement tools, development of key messages, dissemination of key information in c ommunity, etc. 2.7. Program management 2.7.1. Planning process Planning process is conducted by each health progra m. Developed plans are sent to the MOH for consolidation. MOH integrates different pla ns received from health programs/services and come up with the national hea lth plan. EPI is part of this plan which comes from the cMYP (where all the objectives and strategies were defined for every specific year of the life cycle of the cMYP). 2.7.2. Human resource management VPDD staff comprises a small team which works with the districts to implement immunization activities. In most of the time, VPDD team relays on external support to carry out some key activities. National VPDD develo ps policy and strategies and helps districts to implement immunization activities. 27 2.7.3. Administration and Coordination Immunization activities are coordinated at the nati onal level by the national Interagency Coordinating Committee (ICC), which works with all the technical partners on a routinely basis. At a very high level, ICC is chair ed by the Permanent Secretary of health and meets on a quarterly basis. 2.7.4. Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation Several monitoring meetings are being held, at the district level, between staff from VPDD and those from districts, district hospitals a nd health centres. Districts also hold the same review meetings once every semester and re ports to the community representatives. Once every quarter, national VPDD sends a feedback to all districts Supervision visits are planned by the central level to districts quarterly. At the end of each supervision visit, a verbal feedback is provid ed to the visited district followed by a written feedback. District hospitals supervise the health facilities. 2.8. Capacity building In 2005, two staff from national EPI and two profes sors from University were trained for MLM course, unfortunately no follow-up action was t aken to continue with this training at the country level (adaptation of training module s at the country level, training of health workers at all levels and integration of immunizati on course in the cursus of medical student training program). In 2011, the MLM trainin g modules were revised by WHO/AFRO and partners and tested. Two staff from th e country attended this important training and will need to adapt the modules and tra in more staff within the country. About 80 staff from districts were trained for RED approa ch and 60 staff (2 by district) trained for data quality self-assessment (DQS). During the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, HPV and rotavirus vaccine introduction process, tra ining covering all technical areas of the EPI was organized (2009, 2011 and 2012) at all levels (training of trainers at central and district levels and training of health workers at the very operational level. In addition to these training sessions, supportive supervisions are being carried out at lower levels. 2.9. Financing Rwandan national EPI is financed by the Government and its partners (GAVI, WHO, UNICEF, USAID). The Government already pays all th e traditional vaccines and co- finances the new and under used vaccines. 28 The table bellow shows the baseline indicators rela ted to immunization specific costs in 2011. Baseline Indicators 2011 Total Immunization Expenditures $4,098,345 Campaigns $68,591 Routine Immunization only $4,029,754 per capita $0.4 per DTP3 child $12.8 % Vaccines and supplies 37.1% % Government funding 44.4% % Total health expenditures 0.8% % Gov. health expenditures 5.1% % GDP 0.03% Total Shared Costs $0 % Shared health systems cost TOTAL $4,098,345 29 The graph bellow shows the baseline financing profi le of the program by partners and the Government role in of GAVI Vaccine WHO UNICEF USAID GAVI MERCK 2.10. Strengths and Weaknesses Based on the above situation analysis, following st rengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats were identified: STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES Service delivery 1. Vaccination coverage which started to decline since 2008, started to increase in 2011. 2. High coverage achieved for most of antigens of the program and 1. Unknown denominator makes it very difficult to assess the key indicators of the program with accuracy.

Two VPDD staff and two professors from University trained for MLM course (2005). New VPDD staff and partners participated at a second MLM course using the revised modules 2. Training of health professionals, at all levels, was conducted prior to pneumococcal, HPV and rotavirus vaccine introduction was conducted 3. Training took into account major technical areas of immunization (vaccine management included) 4. Supportive supervision visits are being conducted at all levels of health system 1. No continuation of MLM course within the country (adaptation of training modules, integration of immunization course for the medical student training) Finance 1. VPDD is fully financed by the Government and partners (GAVI and ICC partners) 2. Government has a budget line available for vaccine procurement and other immunization supplies / services 2.11. Opportunities and Threats OPPORTUNITIES THREATS 1. Government commitment and involvement in achieving MDGs (for MDG 4,5,6) 2. Presence of engaged traditional for VPDD (GAVI, WHO, UNICEF, USAID, etc.) 3. Donation of HPV vaccine from MERCK Company for three years 4.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION MECHANISMS 7.1. Implementation The cMYP, once developed and approved by all ICC me mbers, will need to be printed and largely disseminated to all partners and to the implementers at district level. The cMYP will serve both as a management and advocacy t ool for the Ministry of Health / VPDD and help partners to better understand their i nvolvement while making decision to support the immunization program. Develop an operational plan for the first year of i mplementation. This will be done every year, with much attention focused on the year's obj ectives and strategies as developed in cMYP. Detailed activities and key indicators will b e defined. Support to health districts for micro planning sess ions with particular attention to a very detailed situation analysis and to the objective de finition. Planned activities will need to be concrete and those which address the planned obj ectives. 7. 2. Monitoring and Evaluation Country will be required to develop a monitoring an d evaluation plan. The plan will define and list key indicators to be followed on a regular basis. Periodic follow-up meetings will be organized at all levels. Annual an d mid-annual reviews will also be planned and carried-out in order to assess progress made toward the planned objectives, identify the weaknesses and update the plan as need ed. A feedback will always be provided to VPDD focal points at all levels. The following table shows some key indicators that will be followed by Program: Strategy Key indicators Polio OPV3 coverage Non-polio AFP rated >2 per 100,000< 15 years MR / Measles Routine first dose measles coverage 44 Strategy Key indicators Routine second dose measles coverage % of districts that report at least one suspected c ase MNT TT2+ coverage Number of districts reporting at least 1 case per 1000 live births Vaccination coverage and districts with Penta1-Penta3 drop-out rate >10 % % of districts with Penta1-Penta3 drop-out rate <10 % of districts with DTP1-measles drop-out rate >10% % of districts with DTP1-measles drop-out rate < 10 VPD surveillance % Completeness of reports % Timeliness of reports Cold chain and logistics % of districts with functioning cold chain equipmen t Injection safety % of districts with sufficient su pply of AD syringes % districts using AD syringes Supply of vaccines and injection supplies Stock-outs of vaccines Stock-outs of syringes Stock-outs of diluents Communication/social mobilization Existence of annual plan Integration with other health interventions Integrated interventions Human resources Number of vaccinators per 100,000 population Sharps waste management % of health facilities with functioning incinerator per districts? % of health facilities with safety boxes Interagency Coordinating Committee Number of meetings held per year Financial sustainability Proportion of coming 5-year's total program costs s ecured (trend indicator) Proportion of EPI routine costs funded through Govt own resources Proportion of Govt funding to routine program costs , (minus pentavalent vaccine) 45 VIII. BUDGET, FINANCING AND FINANCING GAPS FOR cMYP 8.1. Methodology and inputs into program costing This section presents the budget, financing and fin ancing gap analysis for the program, based on the expected activities to be carried out. The methodology is based on deriving costs of different program inputs (such as vehicles needed, or vaccines), and activities to be carried out (such as trainings, etc). Informatio n is collected in a pre-designed costing, financing and gap analysis tool for cMYP, supplied by WHO. The following is a brief summary of the information incorporated. 8.1.1. Health sector analysis The country Gross Domestic Products (GDP), which wa s estimated to US$ 259 per capita in 2006, increased during the last 4 years and reac hed US$ 536 per capita in 2009. In 2011, it increased and reached US$ 1,137 per capita . The total health expenditure is estimated at US$ 48 per capita, with the Government expenditure at 47% of this. The 1US= 600 FRW as of in October 2011. Regarding key demographic indicators, the most rece nt census, conducted in 2002 has estimated the population to 8,128,553 inhabitants. Using the population grow rate of 2.6%, the estimated population for 2010 was estimat ed to 9,981,415 inhabitants. In 2011, this population was estimated to 10,240,932 inhabit ants. The births represented 4.1% of the total population and surviving infant 3.8%. Wo men of child bearing age represent 23.6% of the total population. The infant mortality which was estimated at 107/1000 up to 2005, down to 86/1000 in 2006 is now estimated t o 50/1000 live births (2010). 8.1.2. Vaccines and injection supplies costs The country uses surviving infants for forecasting for all antigens, apart from BCG and TT. The estimated number of surviving infants in 20 11 is 398,884 . Antigens used in the country, with the coverage and wastage targets for the period of the multi-year plan, are already highlighted in section IV. Key cost related highlights include: - Costs for respective doses of antigens, and supplie s are based on current contracts between manufacturers and UNICEF. Prices are update d as per 19 Apr 2010. AD syringes validity is 31/8/2011; Safety boxes price validity is 30/9/2011. - The country is carrying out preventive polio campai gn in 2011 and in 2014 and a follow-up measles campaign in 2012 and in 2015. 8.1.3. VPDD personnel The personnel for VPDD at the national level are: 1 VPDD Head of Division, 1 Epidemiology specialist, 1 Monitoring/Evaluation of ficer, 2 Surveillance officers, 1 Logistician, 1 Cold chain officer, 1 International vaccination officer, 1 Accountant, 46 Administrative Assistant, 1 Driver, 2 messengers an d 1 cleaner. These all spend 100% of their time on VPDD and some spend on average 2 day s per month on supervision, apart from the International vaccination officer, messeng ers and cleaner. Program will add 3 more staffs this year in order t o effectively fit the needs of the program (Logistics Assistant, Dry store keeper and a second Driver). Attempt will be made through strategic ICC team and see if the addi tional staff can be added in 2013. At the district level, the District and Hospital he alth officers are estimated to spend 20% of their time on VPD, while the selected VPD focal point spends 40% of time on EPI. At the health facilities, the health officer spends an estimated 20% of their time on VPDD, while the selected VPDD focal point spends 40% of t heir time. The community volunteers also spend 20% of their time on VPDD rel ated activities. These volunteers don't get salaries, as with all the other staff ass ociated with EPI, but get allowances when they provide outreach activities. 8.1.4. Vehicles and transport costs Fuel price is US$ 1.7, with the maintenance expense s estimated at 15% of the fuel expenses. Vehicles useful life is estimated at 5 ye ars. The program uses 4WD vehicles, and motorcycles. The 4WD vehicles are used at the c entral level (100% for VPDD) and district level (20% for VPDD). Motorcycles are used at district (20% for VPDD) and health facility (20% for VPDD) levels. Cold room tr uck available at the central level for vaccine distribution in case of emergency There are 2-4WD vehicles at the central level for V PDD and a third is planned for 2012. On the other hand, each district has on average 1 v ehicle and 1 motorcycle. 8.1.5. Cold chain equipment Cold chain storage capacity was increased in 2008 w ith the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine. Additional walk-in-cold room, hundreds of refrigerators, cold boxes, vaccine carriers and spare parts were procured and distribu ted to all levels (central, district hospitals and health centers). However, in order to accommodate HPV and rotavirus vaccines, more cold chain equipment were procured a nd distributed. With respect to MR vaccine introduction (wide campaign and its introdu ction in the routine), more cold chain equipment are needed at central level, at some dist rict hospitals and to some extend at some health facility levels. 8.1.6. Campaign operational costs Measles and rubella (MR) catch-up campaign are to b e carried out in 2013. Measles- rubella campaign will target all children aged 9 mo ths to adolescent up to t14 years of age, probably integrated campaign with other public hea lth interventions such as (ITN distribution, mebendazol, and Vitamin A supplementa tion). 47 8.1.7. Costs of activities The table below illustrates the estimated costs of the different program activities to be carried out in the period of the multi year plan. 8.2.
