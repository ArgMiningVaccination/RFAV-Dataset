Many of this plant's most popular claims relate to male sexual performance, including the ability to improve erectile dysfunction. While concrete scientific evidence regarding potential health benefits of tongkat ali is sparse, proponents of the herb claim that, in addition to being an aphrodisiac, it may benefit stress management, exercise recovery, blood sugar regulation and malaria management. Read on to learn what the latest research concludes about tongkat ali, including potential benefits, side effects and dosing information. What Is Tongkat Ali? Tongkat ali is a tropical herbal plant native to Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. The plant's leaves and roots can be harvested, each with potential purported benefits. This popular plant contains various types of bioactive compounds, all of which may have different properties that can affect sexual health, immunity and even inflammation, according to research. Today, tongkat ali is sold worldwide as a health supplement in different forms, such as tinctures and extracts, capsules and root powder. Potential Benefits of Tongkat Ali Tongkat ali is used to assist a variety of health-related goals both in hormonal health and beyond the reproductive system. Individuals can purchase tongkat ali through major online retailers without a prescription or recommendation from a medical provider, although dosages and forms of the supplement may vary. Some providers, such as registered dietitian nutritionists and holistic health practitioners, may recommend this supplement for various purposes. Sexual Performance and Health in Males The majority of tongkat ali's health claims stem from its potential use in supporting male sexual performance. \"A 2021 randomized controlled trial [observed an] increase [in] testosterone in young males after two weeks of supplementation with tongkat ali,\" says Amy Archer, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Wellness RD, a nutrition counseling practice located in Campbell, California [[1]](#footnote_1). Tongkat ali's roots contain a bioactive compound named eurycomanone, which may help inhibit the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, potentially resulting in a decrease in overall testosterone levels over time\u2014impacting male hormone levels and even [male fertility](https://www.forbes.com/health/mens-health/male-infertility/). Additionally, a 2017 meta-analysis in the Chinese Journal of Natural Medicine examining 11 studies determined tongkat ali supplementation may support individuals with [erectile dysfunction](https://www.forbes.com/health/mens-health/erectile-dysfunction/) and other sexual health concerns through its ability to [boost testosterone levels](https://www.forbes.com/health/mens-health/how-to-increase-testosterone/) [[2]](#footnote_2). Stress and Mental Health Support While tongkat ali is mostly well-known due to its potentially positive effects on sexual performance, its benefits may extend to mental wellness and stress management. A small study in 2022 including 33 healthy adults analyzed stress markers and sleep quality. In this placebo-controlled study, researchers found increased markers of stress management, such as vigor and friendliness, as well as improved sleep quality [[3]](#footnote_3). Exercise Performance and Recovery Because of its potential effects on testosterone, cortisol and other biochemical markers related to metabolic health and stress, tongkat ali may be a suitable supplement to enhance both exercise performance and recovery. Lower cortisol and higher testosterone levels can positively influence exercise by reducing fatigue, enhancing mood, improving resilience to stress and more. Additional Benefits While research into its efficacy varies, tongkat ali was traditionally used for the management of several conditions, including [diabetes](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/diabetes/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes/), malaria, chronic pain, low energy, fever and infection. However, there is minimal scientific evidence to support these potential benefits, and it is important to understand any potential side effects or medication interactions that tongkat ali can cause. Potential Side Effects of Tongkat Ali Because of limited research on tongkat ali, potential side effects are not yet fully understood. However, due to its demonstrated effect on testosterone levels, tongkat ali may not be beneficial for individuals who already have elevated levels of the hormone. Tongkat ali may further elevate testosterone in men and women, which can contribute to various symptoms. Men with elevated testosterone levels may face hair loss and prostate enlargement. Meanwhile, women with elevated testosterone levels may experience symptoms ranging from acne and hair loss to anxiety and depression and even infertility. According to research, additional potential side effects include: - Interactions with medications and supplements - Excess heavy metal exposure from mercury or other compounds in certain supplements - Risk of a supplement containing undisclosed prescription sexual health medications, which the FDA reported in 2019 [[4]](#footnote_4). What Is the Correct Dosage of Tongkat Ali for You? Researchers haven't defined an optimal dosage of tongkat ali for males or females. As further human trials progress, more data may shed light on appropriate doses for various health benefits and outcomes. In Malaysia, where tongkat ali is historically harvested, the Ministry of Health of Malaysia recommends 50 milligrams to 200 milligrams of tongkat ali daily for healthy individuals, but no current research supports this recommendation [[5]](#footnote_5). \"Dosages of 200 milligrams to 600 milligrams per day have been used in studies with minor side effects,\" says Wan Na Chun, a registered dietitian with One Pot Wellness in Indianapolis, Indiana. Meanwhile, tongkat ali's extraction and processing methods may influence dosing, leading to additional challenges when it comes to standardizing a dose for this supplement. \"[Tongkat ali] is commonly sold in the form of a powder, extract, drink or capsule and contains various chemical compounds that are thought to be responsible for its many claimed health benefits,\" says Chun. Who to Speak With About Tongkat Ali When it comes to tongkat ali, it's best to consult a health care provider familiar with the supplement or a registered dietitian nutritionist to determine if this supplement is appropriate for an individual's unique health-related goals, as well as to assess any potential drug or supplement interactions. Tongkat ali is widely used in different specialties, including nutrition and dietetics, herbal medicine, integrative and functional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Some practitioners may have more experience with tongkat ali and a greater understanding of this supplement. If one is interested in adding tongkat ali to their supplement regimen, they might start by asking about their provider's experience with and confidence in the herb's dosages and overall use or asking for a referral to a practitioner with more experience.
