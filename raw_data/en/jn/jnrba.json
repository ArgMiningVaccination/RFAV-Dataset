And the global COVID-19 pandemic, now in its second year, has imposed new challenges for patients and health care providers. Having cancer can increase the risk of serious illness from COVID-19, which has led to additional stress for patients, their caregivers and their families. Like hospitals across the country, the Rogel Cancer Center instituted changes throughout the entire organization in the wake of COVID-19 \u2014 some visible, some behind-the-scenes \u2014 to ensure we continue to provide excellent care while protecting patients and sta . \"We know that right now, the thought of going to a hospital or clinic might be causing some additional anxiety \u2014 so we want to reassure those patients that we are putting every possible precaution in place,\" says radiation oncologist Lori J. Pierce, M.D. WHAT'S CHANGED Since the pandemic began, we've implemented changes that include: creating more physical distance in waiting rooms and infusion centers expanding virtual visits for many types of patients, so they don't have to come in person spacing out visits by extending clinic days and hours limiting the number of visitors and companions \"We've had to get creative because any change you make has a ripple e ect across all the interlocking components it takes to provide truly multidisciplinary cancer care,\" says oncologist David C. Smith, M.D., who oversees the cancer center's clinical operations. And while more virtual visits have made some things safer, easier and faster, they're not perfect, acknowledges Daniel Hayes, M.D., who treats patients with breast cancer. \"The hardest part for me is that you can't look a patient in the eye, hold their hand or give them a hug,\" Hayes says. \"Building relationships with patients and their families is one of the most rewarding parts of being an oncologist.\" WHAT PATIENTS NEED TO KNOW Patients should speak with their providers about their individual situations and concerns. We encourage medically eligible patients and their caregivers to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and to take whichever variety of vaccine is o ered to them. Those whose immune systems are weakened by treatment, however, may not achieve a full measure of protection. The cancer center o ers resources and services to help cope with the stress of treatment \u2014 from mental health to nutrition and nances \u2014 especially during this uncertain time.

This disparity exists for COVID-19, too \u2014 and for many of the same reasons. We asked Michigan Medicine's John Carethers, M.D., to explain the similar factors behind racial disparities in both diseases and to discuss how the pandemic has a ected e orts to close the inequality gap.Shared Inequalities Similarities in racial disparities in cancer and COVID-19, and how the pandemic has a ected e orts to close the inequality gap. BY SHELLEY ZALEWSKI Q: What do doctors mean when they talk about health disparities? When a certain health outcome is more likely to occur in one group of people than another, and the diff erence can be explained, at least in part, by social or economic disadvantage \u2014 in income, education, employment, or access to housing, transportation, health insurance or medical care \u2014 that's a health disparity. Q:Can you give an example? Becoming infected with COVID-19 is a health outcome. About 13% of Americans are Black, and about 17% are Latino \u2014 together, that's about a third of our population. All things being equal, you would expect they'd account for about a third of COVID-19 cases. But all things aren't equal. And together, these groups make up more than 50% of COV ID-19 cases. Receiving a COVID-19 vaccination is another health outcome. Th is spring, about 1 of every 3 adults in the state of Michigan had been vaccinated. But in the largely African- American city of Detroit, fewer than 1 in 5 had received the vaccine. Q:And similar disparities are seen in cancer? When it comes to health disparities, the parallels between cancer and COVID are uncanny. Th e same societal barriers are putt ing the same groups at greater risk. Why, for instance, are fi ve-year cancer survival rates for Black people lower than for those who are white? Th ose same social and economic disadvantages I mentioned make it more diffi cult for communities of color to access preventive tools like screening, and resources to manage risk factors like diet, weight, tobacco and alcohol use. As a result, they have poorer outcomes. FORUM | Shared Inequalities 5 SUMMER 2021Shared Inequalities Q: Can you share speci cs from your own clinical experience? My main focus is the genetics of colorectal cancer, but I also study how health disparities impact cancer outcomes in African Americans. I see patients with strong family histories of colorectal cancer. Regular screening is the key to managing their inherited cancer risk. Screening appointments defi nitely fell off during the pandemic, and some people are still reluctant to make medical appointments. Th ere are real consequences \u2014 and not just for people with genetic risk \u2014 in delaying regular cancer screening. Researchers project that delaying regular cancer screenings for just six months will result in an additional 10,000 breast and colon cancers down the road. Percentages are likely to be higher in people of color, as they already did not achieve the same screening rates as whites before the pandemic. Q: You co-authored a recent study on the health disparities shared by cancer and COVID-19. What are the key takeaways? In both diseases, the biggest challenges are insurance coverage and medical access to preventive health services to combat conditions like obesity, diabetes and cancer. Our recommendations include increasing diversity in clinical trial participants; supporting the safety net hospitals that serve the medically underserved; and improving access to technology so all populations can access telehealth services. Q: Can you tell me more about the telehealth recommendation? Th e pandemic has challenged \u2014 and changed \u2014 how doctors and patients interact. At the Rogel Cancer Center, we're embracing the change. We hope that our investments in telehealth technology will not only help us bett er serve our existing patients but will also connect us to patients in underserved areas. Q: How do you feel about the future? I'm optimistic. While we have a long way to go to overcome racial inequality in health care, I have seen fi rsthand that the right interventions, even modest ones, can move mountains. Like a recent program that matched 10,000 patients with patient navigators \u2014 people trained to educate and motivate them to get colorectal cancer screening, as well as provide guidance on whom to communicate with and where to go to get the screening. Big results came from that added support. Screenings of both white and Black participants increased, mortality dropped for both groups, and both had the same incidence of colorectal cancer.How the pandemic shaped one man's cancer journey BY MARY CLARE FISCHER Into the Unknown On the fi rst day of Chris Cauley's cancer journey, he had an appointment at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center to check out the lump on his neck. Th e 51-year-old's mother and younger sister had died of lung cancer at young ages, so he was vigilant about going to see the doctor when anything seemed off . On the sixth day, he met otolaryngologist Andrew Shuman, M.D. On the seventh day, Shuman did a biopsy of the mass. On the 13th day, March 10, 2020, Shuman told Cauley he had a squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of throat cancer. Th e same day, a state of emergency was declared in Michigan due to the escalating COVID-19 crisis. On the 14th day, the World Health Organization dubbed the coronavirus a pandemic. \"It was gett ing really scary at that time,\" Cauley recalls. \"We worried that some of our services would temporarily be halted, and wanted to get him cared for as quickly as we could,\" Shuman says. It took some quick thinking and coordination, but Cauley's care team was able to start radiation treatment less than three weeks aft er his fi rst interaction with the cancer center, even as COVID-19 was tearing across the state. With operations at the Brighton Center for Specialty Care near Cauley's home in Howell paused, he commuted to Ann Arbor \u2014 Monday through Friday for seven weeks \u2014 for radiation treatment. He recalls lying on the table, uncomfortable mouthguard in, waiting for the beam from the linear accelerator to destroy his cancer cells. Th ere was always a quiet pause before the machine buzzed to life. A devout Lutheran, Cauley used that time to pray. And then, the music began. Sometimes, Cauley requested Lynyrd Skynyrd. But oft en, the tunes would 6 SUMMER 2021How the pandemic shaped one man's cancer journey BY MARY CLARE FISCHERbe courtesy of Zach Williams, a rock musician who found a second life as a Christian artist. Cauley's go-to Williams track was called \"Survivor.\" While the radiation went to work, he'd sing along in his head: Now I'm alive and born again Rescued from the grip of sin God your love came crashing in And pulled me out of the fire I'm a survivor. LEARNING TO TAKE A BREAK Cauley knew he was in expert hands at Michigan Medicine. Yet there was another hospital where he would have rather spent his time. That was the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System. At the time of his cancer treatment, Cauley was its chief operating officer. In 25 years of work, he had never taken two weeks off. In 2020, he took four months of leave. The idea of taking a break didn't sit well with Cauley. As the COO, he was supposed to be in charge of the crisis response for the pandemic. He had trained for this type of critical situation. \"I'll work all the way up until I just don't feel good,\" Cauley told his supervisor. \"Chris, no offense, but I do not want to see you in here. You only get one chance to get it right,\" he recalled her saying. So Cauley stayed home, except for medical appointments that needed to be in person, like the radiation treatment and blood work. He designed a chicken coop \u2014 and hoped he would eventually feel good enough to build it. He had 16 virtual visits on his iPad, far more than the pre-pandemic norm for a cancer patient. \"The appointments were seamless,\" he says. He revived his love of golf. He teared up on Father's Day when his daughter and son bought him a new set of patio furniture, so he'd be more comfortable when he sat outside. He listened when Ren\u00e9e \u2014 his wife and steadfast advocate \u2014 reminded him that it was OK to rest every once in a while. Well, he sort of listened. 7 SUMMER 2021COVER | Into the UnknownBACK TO WORK AND CANCER-FREE In July 2020, Cauley's forced sabbatical ended. He went back to work and eventually transitioned to become the CEO of the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center in Saginaw. In August 2020, scans revealed he was cancer-free. \"You feel like you're in the middle of something that's never going to end,\" Ren\u00e9e Cauley says, \"and all of a sudden it's over, and you can breathe again.\" Michigan Medicine providers continue to monitor Chris Cauley, but Jennifer Shah, M.D., his radiation oncologist, says there's little physical evidence he even 8 SUMMER 2021underwent radiation. (Th e lingering side eff ects, namely dry mouth and changes in food preference, including a newfound distaste for ham and bacon, remind Cauley that he did indeed go through radiation.) \"It was an experience that obviously I'll never forget,\" Cauley says. \"I don't want to go through it again, mind you. But everybody treated you like family. Even during COVID when people were scared, these were front-line folks doing their jobs well.\" In fact, he was moved enough to become a member of the cancer center's Patient and Family Advisory Committ ee. \"I've been a professional mentor for a very long time,\" Cauley says, \"but now that I've been on the other side, I wanted to be a peer mentor, too. Having had a great experience, I wanted to give back.\" t 9 SUMMER 2021Chris and Ren\u00e9e Cauley enjoy spending family time with their daughter, Kristen, and son, Jacob.COVER | Into the UnknownFEATURE | Artful Medicine The unexpected bene ts when art therapy goes virtual BY MARY CLARE FISCHER 10 SUMMER 2021 FEATURE | Artful Medicine Theresa Gougeon was angry, furious even. In the past 18 months, she'd dealt with an antibiotic- resistant superbug (twice) and treatment for ovarian cancer \u2014 plus the su ocating fear that involves leaving your house when you're immunocompromised during a pandemic. She was exhausted from being in \"fi ght-fl ight-freeze mode,\" she told Sandra Drabant, an art therapist at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center. \"Th ink about a color that would fi t with that feeling,\" said Drabant from Gougeon's computer screen. \"Th ink about some marks. Th ink about some lines. Take a few minutes and just express that.\" So that's what Gougeon did, scribbling in the sketchbook on her dining room table, releasing her frustration through jagged lines that shot from her pen. Drabant watched, remotely. Technically, she and Gougeon were separated by many miles and the heightened risk from COVID-19 for people with cancer. But a click of a butt on brought Drabant into Gougeon's home, where she was needed most. \"To be sitt ing in my own castle, with the moat outside,\" Gougeon says, \"nobody could get in or out. But I could see her.\" When Gougeon was done, she lift ed the paper up to her webcam to show Drabant, and they talked about diff erent elements of her drawing and the feelings each portion evoked. When they hung up aft er the hour-long Zoom, Gougeon was smiling again. \"I call her my art doctor,\" Gougeon says, \"because she's the doctor who gives me the medicine that takes me into a comfortable place \u2014 who brings me into the light.\" ART THERAPY GOES VIRTUAL Last year, as COVID-19 became a more serious threat, the cancer center's patient and family support services staff realized they needed to pivot. Th ey could no longer hold their support groups or individual therapy sessions in person. So, why not take them online? Except... could art therapy really be done virtually? Drabant typically relies on watching the body language of her patients as they paint or sketch or mold clay into fi gures, so she can ask appropriate questions and guide them in the right direction. She could only do so much of that on Zoom. Plus, there was the logistical question of how to get patients the art supplies they needed to express themselves. But Drabant was determined to keep seeing as many patients as she could. \"I put my hand up and said, 'I will fi gure out a way to make this work,'\" Drabant says. furious even. \"Th ink about a color that would fi t with that feeling,\" said Drabant from Gougeon's So that's what Gougeon did, scribbling in the sketchbook on her dining room table, releasing her frustration through jagged lines that shot from her pen.

On Zoom, the camera angles were tricky to fi gure out, but the benefi t of virtual art therapy was easily apparent. Not only did patients like Gougeon feel more protected from the coronavirus, many were also more comfortable sharing personal details in the privacy of their own homes. \"Th ey talk about all kinds of things that feel a litt le more sensitive to discuss when there's another patient sitt ing two feet away from you in an infusion area,\" Drabant says. \"In some ways, the work I'm doing on Zoom has allowed patients to be more emotionally supported.\" Plus, the verbal coaching Drabant has done more of over Zoom nudges patients to verbalize their thoughts while making art. \"It's actually helped them understand it more,\" Drabant says.

She's made Zentangles, mesmerizing sketches made up of patt erns that repeat basic strokes like lines, dots and curves. She's craft ed what she calls memory stones, which resemble miniature paperweights. \"Th e memory stone helps me remember to, when I see something that works for me, embrace it,\" Gougeon says. \"If it doesn't, I let it be.\" She keeps her artworks in an accordion fi le in her dining room or on the table where she sits during art therapy sessions. Th at way, she can access them easily if she needs to calm herself down. When she goes to the doctor, Gougeon takes her sketchbook or uses a memo app on her phone to doodle a shell shape that reduces her anxiety.

Recommendations have evolved as the impacts of COVID-19 have continued into their second year. Rogel Cancer Center dietitians stress the importance of eating a balanced, nutritious diet during and after treatment. Here are some best-bet tips for patients and caregivers. DELEGATING If you are a patient, ask a caregiver or a friend to go grocery shopping on your behalf if possible. The highest risk posed to people with cancer comes from potential airborne transmission of the virus. So, avoiding crowded markets is best. Those who are homebound may also be eligible to receive meals through the Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels program (734-998-6686), or a similar program in your area. DELIVERY/PICK UP Take advantage of home delivery or curbside pick-up options o ered by some grocery stores. Many allow you to pay in advance and o er no-contact delivery options. The risk of getting COVID-19 from food packaging is very low, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's no recommendation that you need to disinfect all the items you buy, but you should wash your hands after handling bags and putting groceries away. TAKEOUT The risk of contracting COVID-19 from takeout food is also very low, the CDC says. Cut the risk further by washing your hands before and after handling takeout bags and containers, and transfer food onto your own dishware. Mail-order meal kit companies, like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, also o er healthy options with minimal preparation. Beyond COVID-19, the American Cancer Society recommends those in treatment avoid take-out foods at higher risk for bacteria, such as deli meats and cheeses, and raw fruits and vegetables \u2014 including salads and salsas. Look to your care team for guidance. SHOPPING If you can't avoid in-person shopping, wear a mask, try not to touch your face and wash your hands before and after. And bring sanitizing wipes to disinfect your shopping cart. Other risk-reducing tips include: making a list to help you get in and out fast; shopping at farmer's markets and other open-air venues when the weather allows; shopping early, when stores are less crowded; and taking advantage of special store hours for people at higher risk.A /T_h ought for Food What caregivers and people with cancer should know about safely buying food during the pandemic BY IAN DEMSKYPREBIOTICS MAY HELP PROTECT AGAINST IMMUNOTHERAPY- INDUCED COLITIS Prebiotics are an intriguing potential approach to curbing some of the severe side e ects that life-saving immunotherapy treatments can wreak on the gut, according to an analysis of recent studies and clinical trials by researchers at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center. Rather than trying to introduce bene cial strains of bacteria directly into a patient's digestive tract \u2014 via fecal transplant, enema or probiotic supplements, each of which have drawbacks \u2014 evidence points to prebiotics as a potentially safe and e ective strategy. This would mean giving patients foods that are known to stimulate the growth of certain bacteria that can, in turn, produce larger amounts of protective metabolites. \"There are several advantages to a prebiotic approach,\" says hematology/oncology fellow Amy Chang, M.D., the lead author of an article on the topic in Trends in Cancer. \"Compared to other methods, they're easy to administer, safe and inexpensive. One study showed that oat bran, for example, increased production of a metabolite called butyrate and resulted in improved symptoms for patients with bowel ailments similar to those seen in patients receiving immunotherapy.\" The researchers' review of existing studies and clinical trials raised the possibility that butyrate-promoting prebiotics may help reduce immunotherapy-induced infl ammation in the colon, and might even be able to improve the e ectiveness of the therapy by increasing patients' tolerance to it through the promotion of bene cial microbes.HOW USEFUL IS NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER? When standard cancer treatments don't work, or if doctors can't determine where a patient's cancer originated, genomic sequencing can help pinpoint mutations in a tumor that might be matched with medicines targeting those speci c alterations. But how much does this \"next-generation\" sequencing actually infl uence clinical care and improve outcomes? Quite a bit, according to a study of more than 1,000 patients seen at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center \u2014 especially for certain subsets of patients. The ndings, which appeared in JAMA Oncology, showed that potentially actionable genomic alterations were found in nearly 80% of patients. And of the 130 patients who received sequencing-directed therapy, nearly 40% experienced some clinical bene t, with 20% experiencing exceptionally good responses \u2014 de ned as keeping their disease under control for at least one year. Moreover, for patients with cancers of unknown origin, sequencing was able to decode the tissue of origin for the cancer in half of cases \u2014 giving doctors much better clues about what standard therapies, as well as targeted therapies, might help. One of the most telling results of the study was that potentially inheritable cancer risk was identi ed in 16% of patients, says study rst author Erin Cobain, M.D., an oncologist at Michigan Medicine. \"Any family members who have also inherited those same mutations may be at increased risk for cancer,\" she says. \"So, a lot of this testing prompted downstream genetic testing and counseling across families. That's how sequencing can have even more far-reaching impact than just looking for therapies to directly help a current patient.\" The study examined nearly seven years' worth of data from 1,015 patients who participated in the Michigan Oncology Sequencing Program (Mi-ONCOSEQ) between 2011 and 2018. Today, more than 3,500 patients have had their tumors sequenced. \"The way that I describe next-generation sequencing to patients is that the test is looking for changes in the DNA and RNA of the tumor,\" Cobain says. \"The tumor develops these changes that don't happen in the rest of the cells in our body and sometimes we can nd medications that target those changes \u2014 and that won't have as great of an impact on the normal cells in the body because they're speci cally targeted against something that is di erent or abnormal in the cancer cells.\" Over time, too, as next-generation sequencing has become more widespread and cheaper to do, more clinical trials are available to patients based on their results, she adds. alanphillips/E+/Getty ImagesAmy Chang, M.D. 15 SUMMER 2021 RESEARCH ROUND-UP PREBIOTICS MAY HELP PROTECT AGAINST IMMUNOTHERAPY- INDUCED COLITIS Prebiotics are an intriguing potential approach to curbing some of the severe side e ects that life-saving immunotherapy treatments Get Thrive in Your Inbox!
