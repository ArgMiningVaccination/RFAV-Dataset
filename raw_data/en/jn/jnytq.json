He has admitted to getting Wordpress to pull Michael Hawkins' blog, and is also threatening me, now. Michael Hawkins, You may blame me for having your blog pulled. WorldPress had to remove your blog because otherwise it would have faced a hefty lawsuit, given the nature of the defamation campaign you had launched against me, and having positioned your blog link second place on the search engines. [http://www.google.com/search?q=Andreas+Moritz&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a] I have not yet decided whether to sue you for defamation. I have asked my attorneys to assess the damages your defamation campaign has done to my work, business, and reputation since your blog has been up. I know that they are significant, but if they turn out to be an excessive loss of revenue and reputation and/or if I see any more defaming publications by you or your blog friends against me or Dr. Makoney, I will not hesitate to launch an expensive lawsuit against you that you will not forget for a long time. I have collected all the data of your blogs and publications involving me. Your last email to Dr. Makoney clearly shows that you are instigating a new defamation campaign, at least against him. My investigations show me where you live and where you study (Augusta, Amine), and if I hear or see any further activities that involve me or Dr. Makoney you will need to hire a good attorney to defend your slanderous actions and campaigns. My close friend, Dr Deepak Chopra, who in addition to Dr Makoney and myself have been viciously attacked by your friend, the fish zoologist, PZ Myers, are considering a lawsuit against him. Slander is slander, whether it is done online or offline. If your friend is wise, he will immediately remove those blogs from his site. Just in case you are not aware of it, below are stated the laws that protect people like me against people like you. Sincerely, Andreas Moritz Hmmm, misspelling names seems to be an epidemic among quacks. It's also interesting that he's openly threatening an expensive legal campaign against Hawkins. If the threats of lawsuits and [his own crazy snakeoil site](http://www.ener-chi.com/) aren't enough to convince you that he's a loon, consider that he was [written up favorably on NaturalNews.com](http://www.naturalnews.com/022578.html) (you may recall [Mike Adams](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/01/sometimes_i_think_we_break_the.php), whose mind snapped under the weight of our criticism). [Michael Hawkins wrote up an angry rebuttal to Moritz](http://withoutapologyinmaine.wordpress.com/2009/05/24/andreas-moritz-is-a-stupid-dangerous-man/), as [did I](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/dangerous_idiot_with_bogus_med.php). He's not a good person. [Moritz is a cancer quack](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/dangerous_idiot_with_bogus_med.php). He is an evil man who takes advantage of others' pain for his own profit. Here's what [he says about cancer](http://www.ener-chi.com/cancerarticle.htm). Cancer has always been an extremely rare illness, except in industrialized nations during the past 40-50 years. Human genes have not significantly changed for thousands of years. Why would they change so drastically now, and suddenly decide to kill scores of people? The answer to this question is amazingly simple: Damaged or faulty genes do not kill anyone. Cancer does not kill a person afflicted with it! What kills a cancer patient is not the tumor, but the numerous reasons behind cell mutation and tumor growth. These root causes should be the focus of every cancer treatment, yet most oncologists typically ignore them. Constant conflicts, guilt and shame, for example, can easily paralyze the body's most basic functions, and lead to the growth of a cancerous tumor. After having seen thousands of cancer patients over a period of three decades, I began to recognize a certain pattern of thinking, believing and feeling that was common to most of them. To be more specific, I have yet to meet a cancer patient who does not feel burdened by some poor self-image, unresolved conflict and worries, or past emotional trauma that still lingers in his/her subconscious. Cancer, the physical disease, cannot occur unless there is a strong undercurrent of emotional uneasiness and deep-seated frustration. Note that he has absolutely no credentials or expertise in medicine; he calls himself a \"medical intuitive\". Yet he is dispensing dangerous, defeatist advice on how to manage cancer, such as [recommending against chemotherapy](http://www.ener-chi.com/trustchemo.htm). Have you had a loved one die of cancer? It was their fault. Do you have or have you had cancer? It's your own damn fault for being so negative. Switch your target from Makoney, errm, Maloney to Moritz: he's even crazier and more dangerous. By the way, here is Andreas Moritz. He's peddling something called a liver flush \u2014 you gulp down a nasty concoction of Epsom salts, olive oil, and grapefruit, and then you go lie down for a while and suffer nausea and diarrhea. If you're really dedicated, you can poop into a colander and collect strange lumps, as much as 2\" in diameter, that he claims are liver stones flushed out by the oily glop. This will make your knees feel better. Seriously. Read [Orac's take on Moritz](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/the_wisdom_of_cancer_cells.php). You might also be interested in his [explanation of the liver flush](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_would_you_like_a.php): oil+salts is a nice way to make saponified lumps in your digestive tract.
