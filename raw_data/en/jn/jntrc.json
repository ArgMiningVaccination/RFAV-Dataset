Criticism of the move to make it mandatory ranges from outrage of conservative parents who think it interferes with teaching their daughters how to be 'moral' and abstinent. 'It won't happen to my child, because I'll raise her to be chaste and therefore she can't get the HPV virus', they think.\"How dare the government force these medical decisions on my children!', to a concern by other [groups](http://www.909shot.com/PressReleases/pr62706gardasil.htm) that the vaccine has not been tested in the long term enough to ensure that the benefits truly outweigh the side effects. It doesn't help that the price of the vaccine is so [high ](http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/02/02/cancer.vaccine.ap/index.html)that some doctors are charging their patients upfront for the cost of the vaccine, especially since insurance isn't exactly rushing to cover this new vaccine. As of now, the silver bullet for cervical cancer prevention still remains the humble and inconvenient [pap smear test](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_Can_cervical_cancer_be_prevented_8.asp). Will the vaccine help? Only time and a thorough study of the long term effects in a large population will tell... and the [question](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/health/18essa.html?ex=1170565200&en=1f6151feef9875d6&ei=5070) arises as to whether parents should permit their daughters to be guinea pigs of sorts.
