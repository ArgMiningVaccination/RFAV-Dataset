Protein agent-based therapeutics, including antibody therapeutics, are widely used for a variety of human diseases, and marketing approvals increase every year. Some industry watchers have reported that combined worldwide sales of monoclonal antibody products will be nearly $125 billion by 2020.SUMMARY Many protein agent-based therapeutics are administered at doses within a range of about 100 mg to about 1 g of protein agent per injection. The present disclosure recognizes the source of a problem associated with highly concentrated protein-agent formulations, which can present administration challenges due to high viscosity and/or due to aggregation. Among other things, the present disclosure provides low-viscosity, high concentration therapeutic protein agent formulations. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the present disclosure provides low-aggregation formulations of therapeutic protein agents. In some embodiments, the present disclosure encompasses the recognition that reducing surface adsorption and/or interfacial interaction can have beneficial effects for certain protein formulations. Among other things, in some embodiments, the present disclosure provides formulations of therapeutic protein agents with relatively low surface adsorption and/or interfacial interaction (as compared with that observed for an appropriate reference formulation). In some embodiments, provided formulations can be injected either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). The present disclosure also provides methods of making and/or using such formulations. Highly concentrated formulations of macromolecules, such as therapeutic protein agents, including whole antibodies, or fragments thereof, with low-viscosity, are of great value for their ease of storage and delivery in vivo. However, very few techniques exist for the preparation of high concentration, low-viscosity protein agent formulations above 200 mg protein agent per mL solution that are also stable. The present disclosure, among other things, identifies the source of a problem relating to high concentration protein agent compositions. Among other things, the present disclosure appreciates that such compositions can pose a number of challenges such as high viscosity, lower stability, and difficulty in handling and manufacturing. In addition, the present disclosures appreciates that certain viscosity-reducing agents sometimes proposed for use in the art may be required in large amounts in order to reduce viscosity sufficiently, and sometimes these agents can be toxic or not pharmaceutically acceptable. The present disclosure appreciates that high concentrations of protein agents often must be handled with considerable care, since they can be extremely prone to aggregation and high degrees of protein-protein interactions. Solutions with high protein agent concentrations have a tendency to aggregate and form particulates during processing and/or storage, which makes manipulation during further processing and/or delivery difficult. Concentration-dependent degradation and/or aggregation can present significant challenges for development of high concentration protein agent formulations. Often, protein agent-based therapeutics are administered through intravenous infusions, which are costly and can require a high level of patient compliance. Some protein agent-based therapeutics may be administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. While these routes can offer clear advantages in ease of administration and cost when compared to intravenous infusions, they can also present challenges that may arise, for example, from limited injection volume tolerance. Typically, it is preferred that injection volumes be under about 2 mL for subcutaneous injections and under about 5 mL for intramuscular injections. Furthermore, it is often preferred that preparations for subcutaneous or intramuscular injections have a viscosity of about 20 centipoise (cP) or lower. Many protein agent-based therapeutics are administered intravenously (IV); in some instances IV administration is required or useful given the high doses being administered, which can often be in a range of about 100 mg to about 1 g of protein agent per injection. If it is desired to administer a comparable (or identical dose) by a different route\u2014for example by subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection, then a highly concentrated formulation is required, given that a permitted volume for such routes is so much smaller than that for IV injection. Such high concentration formulations, as discussed herein, can present significant administration challenges, among other things, due to high viscosity. Also, efforts to concentrate protein agents in order achieve smaller volumes for injection can risk damage to protein agents, for example as a result of chemical and/or physical instability. Still further, subjects sometimes report pain at injection sites when viscosity is high. Reported antibody concentrations formulated for SC or IM injections can be up to about 100 mg/mL (Wang et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 96:1-26, 2007) and in some cases, even 150 to 200 mg/mL. The present disclosure provides, among other things, high concentration formulations (e.g., at concentrations greater than 200 mg/mL) of protein agents with reduced viscosity, including therapeutic agents. In general, provided formulations are suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), and in many embodiments by parenteral administration that does not involve infusion and/or that is other than intravenous administration. In particular, in many embodiments, the present disclosure provides formulations suitable for administration by subcutaneous (SC) and/or intramuscular (IM) injection. In many embodiments, provided formulations are suitable for administration via18-32 gauge needles. Typically, provided formulations are aqueous formulations. Most commercially available mAb products administered by SC or IM injection are formulated in aqueous buffers, such as a phosphate, succinate or L-histidine buffer, with the addition of excipients monolaurate). These compounds act to improve overall solution stability.

Osmolality of a pharmaceutical composition is regulated to maximize stability of active ingredients, or in this case, of a protein agent, and also to minimize discomfort to a patient upon administration of a therapeutic formulation. Serum has an osmolality of approximately 300\u00b150 milliosmolals per kilogram (mOsm/kg). It is generally preferred that a pharmaceutical composition be isotonic with serum, i.e., having the same or a similar osmolality as serum, which is achieved by addition of a tonicity modifier. Thus, it is contemplated that osmolality typically ranges from about 180 to about 420 mOsm/kg, however, it is to be understood that osmolality may register either higher or lower than the range as specific conditions require. In some embodiments, a liquid formulation has a physiological osmolality that is hypotonic or isotonic to human blood, for example, about 150 mOsm/kg, 200 mOsm/kg, 225 mOsm/kg, 250 mOsm/kg, 275 mOsm/kg, or 300 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit.

In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms are defined below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that definitions for certain terms may be provided elsewhere in the specification, and/or will be clear from context. Alkyl group: As generally used herein, \"alkyl group\" refers to straight-chain, branched-chain and cyclic hydrocarbon groups. Unless specified otherwise, the term alkyl group embraces hydrocarbon groups containing one or more double or triple bonds. An alkyl group containing at least one ring system is a \"cycloalkyl\" group. An alkyl group containing at least one double bond is an \"alkenyl group,\" and an alkyl group containing at least one triple bond is an \"alkynyl group.\" About: The term \"about\", when used herein in reference to a value, refers to a value that is similar, in context to the referenced value. In general, those skilled in the art, familiar with the context, will appreciate the relevant degree of variance encompassed by \"about\" in that context. For example, in some embodiments, the term \"about\" may encompass a range of referred value. Absolute viscosity: As generally used herein, the term \"absolute viscosity\" is sometimes called \"dynamic \"simple viscosity,\" is the product of kinematic viscosity and fluid density. Absolute viscosity is expressed in units of centipoise (cP). The SI unit of absolute viscosity is the (mPa-s), where 1 cP=1 mPa-s. Administration: As used herein, the term \"administration\" typically refers to the administration of a composition to a subject or system to achieve delivery of an agent that is, or is included in, the composition. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of a variety of routes that may, in appropriate circumstances, be utilized for administration to a subject, for example a human. For example, in some embodiments, administration may be ocular, oral, parenteral, topical, etc. In some particular embodiments, administration may be bronchial (e.g., by bronchial instillation), buccal, dermal (which may be or comprise, for example, one or more of topical to the instillation), vaginal, vitreal, etc. In some embodiments, administration may involve only a single dose. In some embodiments, administration may involve application of a fixed number of doses. In some embodiments, administration may involve dosing that is intermittent (e.g., a plurality of doses separated in time) and/or periodic (e.g., individual doses separated by a common period of time) dosing. In some embodiments, administration may involve continuous dosing (e.g., perfusion) for at least a selected period of time. Agent: In general, the term \"agent\", as used herein, may be used to refer to a compound or entity of any chemical class including, for example, a polypeptide, nucleic acid, saccharide, lipid, small molecule, metal, or combination or complex thereof. In appropriate circumstances, as will be clear from context to those skilled in the art, the term may be utilized to refer to an entity that is or comprises a cell or organism, or a fraction, extract, or component thereof. Alternatively or additionally, as context will make clear, the term may be used to refer to a natural product in that it is found in and/or is obtained from nature. In some instances, again as will be clear from context, the term may be used to refer to one or more entities that is man-made in that it is designed, engineered, and/or produced through action of the hand of man and/or is not found in nature. In some embodiments, an agent may be utilized in isolated or pure form; in some embodiments, an agent may be utilized in crude form. In some embodiments, potential agents may be provided as collections or libraries, for example that may be screened to identify or characterize active agents within them. In some cases, the term \"agent\" may refer to a compound or entity that is or comprises a polymer; in some cases, the term may refer to a compound or entity that comprises one or more polymeric moieties. In some embodiments, the term \"agent\" may refer to a compound or entity that is not a polymer and/or is substantially free of any polymer and/or of one or more particular polymeric moieties. In some embodiments, the term may refer to a compound or entity that lacks or is substantially free of any polymeric moiety. Aggregation: The term \"protein aggregation,\" as generally used herein, refers to a biological phenomenon in which mis-folded proteins aggregate (i.e., accumulate and clump together) either intra- or extracellularly. These protein aggregates are often correlated with diseases. In fact, protein aggregates have been implicated in a wide variety of disease known as amyloidoses, including ALS, Alzheimers's, Parkinson's and prion disease. This aggregation can be 'native,' in which the protein structure is maintained and the aggregation is largely reversible, or 'non-native,' where denaturation and structural changes mean this effect is largely irreversible. Aggregates may continue to grow and form over a wide size range, including up to and beyond the formation. of visible particles, and ultimately this leads to precipitation. Aggregation preventer/aggregation inhibitor: The term \"protein preventer/aggregation inhibitor,\" as generally used herein, means preventing formation of additional protein aggregate in a protein-containing solution. Thus, inhibiting can encompass preventing the amount of protein aggregate in a protein formulation or solution. Preventing is measured by comparing the amount of aggregate present in a protein-containing solution that comprises at least one inhibitor of insoluble aggregate formation with the amount of aggregate present in a protein-containing solution that does not comprise at least one inhibitor of insoluble aggregate formation and is measured by either using Size-Exclusion chromatography or dynamic light scattering techniques. Aggregation-reducing agent: The term \"aggregation-reducing agent,\" as generally used herein, means decreasing the amount of protein aggregate in a protein-containing solution. Thus, reducing can encompass decreasing the amount of protein aggregate in a protein formulation or solution. Decreasing is measured by comparing the amount of aggregate present in a protein-containing solution that comprises at least one reducer of insoluble aggregate formation with the amount of aggregate present in a protein-containing solution that does not comprise at least one reducer of insoluble aggregate formation and is measured by either using Size-Exclusion chromatography or dynamic light scattering techniques. Amino acid: in its broadest sense, as used herein, refers to any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, e.g., through formation of one or more peptide bonds. In some embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H2N\u2014C(H)(R)\u2014COOH. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally-occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a non-natural amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is a D-amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is an L-amino acid. \"Standard amino acid\" refers to any of the twenty standard L-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides. \"Nonstandard amino acid\" refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids, regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. In some embodiments, an amino acid, including a carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acid in a polypeptide, can contain a structural modification as compared with the general structure above. For example, in some embodiments, an amino acid may be modified by methylation, amidation, acetylation, pegylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and/or substitution (e.g., of the amino group, the carboxylic acid group, one or more protons, and/or the hydroxyl group) as compared with the general structure. In some embodiments, such modification may, for example, alter the circulating half-life of a polypeptide containing the modified amino acid as compared with one containing an otherwise identical unmodified amino acid. In some embodiments, such modification does not significantly alter a relevant activity of a polypeptide containing the modified amino acid, as compared with one containing an otherwise identical unmodified amino acid. As will be clear from context, in some embodiments, the term \"amino acid\" may be used to refer to a free amino acid; in some embodiments it may be used to refer to an amino acid residue of a polypeptide. Antibody: As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to a polypeptide that includes canonical immunoglobulin sequence elements sufficient to confer specific binding to a particular target antigen. As is known in the art, intact antibodies as produced in nature are approximately 150 kD tetrameric agents comprised of two identical heavy chain polypeptides (about 50 kD each) and two identical light chain polypeptides (about 25 kD each) that associate with each other into what is commonly referred to as a \"Y-shaped\" structure. Each heavy chain is comprised of at least four domains (each about 110 amino acids long)\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VH) domain (located at the tips of the Y structure), followed by three constant domains: CH1, CH2, and the carboxy-terminal CH3 (located at the base of the Y's stem). A short region, known as the \"switch\", connects the heavy chain variable and constant regions. The \"hinge\" connects CH2 and CH3 domains to the rest of the antibody. Two disulfide bonds in this hinge region connect the two heavy chain polypeptides to one another in an intact antibody. Each light chain is comprised of two domains\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VL) domain, followed by a carboxy-terminal constant (CL) domain, separated from one another by another \"switch\". Intact antibody tetramers are comprised of two heavy chain-light chain dimers in which the heavy and light chains are linked to one another by a single disulfide bond; two other disulfide bonds connect the heavy chain hinge regions to one another, so that the dimers are connected to one another and the tetramer is formed. Naturally-produced antibodies are also glycosylated, typically on the CH2 domain. Each domain in a natural antibody has a structure characterized by an \"immunoglobulin fold\" formed from two beta sheets (e.g., 3-, 4-, or 5-stranded sheets) packed against each other in a compressed antiparallel beta barrel. Each variable domain contains three hypervariable loops known as \"complement determining regions\" (CDR1, FR3, and FR4). When natural antibodies fold, the FR regions form the beta sheets that provide the structural framework for the domains, and the CDR loop regions from both the heavy and light chains are brought together in three-dimensional space so that they create a single hypervariable antigen binding site located at the tip of the Y structure. The Fc region of naturally-occurring antibodies binds to elements of the complement system, and also to receptors on effector cells, including for example effector cells that mediate cytotoxicity. As is known in the art, affinity and/or other binding attributes of Fc regions for Fc receptors can be modulated through glycosylation or other modification. In some embodiments, antibodies produced and/or utilized in accordance with the present invention include glycosylated Fc domains, including Fc domains with modified or engineered such glycosylation. For purposes of the present invention, in certain embodiments, any polypeptide or complex of polypeptides that includes sufficient immunoglobulin domain sequences as found in natural antibodies can be referred to and/or used as an \"antibody\", whether such polypeptide is naturally produced (e.g., generated by an organism reacting to an antigen), or produced by recombinant engineering, chemical synthesis, or other artificial system or methodology. In some embodiments, an antibody is polyclonal; in some embodiments, an antibody is monoclonal. In some embodiments, an antibody has constant region sequences that are characteristic of mouse, rabbit, primate, or human antibodies. In some embodiments, antibody sequence elements are humanized, primatized, chimeric, etc, as is known in the art. Moreover, the term \"antibody\" as used herein, can refer in appropriate embodiments (unless otherwise stated or clear from context) to any of the art-known or developed constructs or formats for utilizing antibody structural and functional features in alternative presentation. For example, embodiments, an antibody utilized in accordance with the present invention is in a format selected from, but not limited to, intact IgA, IgG, IgE or IgM antibodies; bi- or multi-specific antibodies (e.g., Zybodies\u00ae, etc); antibody fragments such as Fab fragments, Fab fragments, F(ab)2 fragments, Fd fragments, Fd fragments, and isolated CDRs or sets thereof; single chain Fvs; polypeptide-Fc fusions; single domain antibodies (e.g., shark single domain antibodies such as IgNAR or fragments thereof); cameloid antibodies; masked antibodies (e.g., Probodies\u00ae); an antibody may lack a covalent modification (e.g., attachment of a glycan) that it would have if produced naturally. In some embodiments, an antibody may contain a covalent modification (e.g., attachment of a glycan, a payload [e.g., a detectable moiety, a therapeutic moiety, a catalytic As \"antibody agent\" refers to an agent that specifically binds to a particular antigen. In some embodiments, the term encompasses any polypeptide or polypeptide complex that includes immunoglobulin structural elements sufficient to confer specific binding. Exemplary antibody agents include, but are not limited to monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies.

In some embodiments, an antibody agent may include one or more sequence elements are humanized, primatized, chimeric, etc, as is known in the art. In many embodiments, the term \"antibody agent\" is used to refer to one or more of the art-known or developed constructs or formats for utilizing antibody structural and functional features in alternative presentation. For example, in some embodiments, an antibody agent utilized in accordance with the present invention is in a format selected from, but not limited to, intact IgA, IgG, IgE or IgM antibodies; bi- or multi-specific antibodies (e.g., Zybodies\u00ae, etc); antibody fragments such as Fab fragments, Fab fragments, F(ab)2 fragments, Fd fragments, Fd fragments, and isolated CDRs or sets thereof; single chain Fvs; polypeptide-Fc fusions; single domain antibodies (e.g., shark single domain antibodies such as IgNAR or fragments thereof); cameloid antibodies; masked antibodies (e.g., Probodies\u00ae); an antibody may lack a covalent modification (e.g., attachment of a glycan) that it would have if produced naturally. In some embodiments, an antibody may contain a covalent modification (e.g., attachment of a glycan, a payload [e.g., a detectable moiety, a therapeutic moiety, a catalytic or group glycol, etc.]. In many embodiments, an antibody agent is or comprises a polypeptide whose amino acid sequence includes one or more structural elements recognized by those skilled in the art as a complementarity determining region (CDR); in some embodiments an antibody agent is or comprises a polypeptide whose amino acid sequence includes at least one CDR (e.g., at least one heavy chain CDR and/or at least one light chain CDR) that is substantially identical to one found in a reference antibody. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that it is either identical in sequence or contains between 1-5 amino acid substitutions as compared with the reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that it shows reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that it shows at least 96%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that at least one amino acid within the included CDR is deleted, added, or substituted as compared with the reference CDR but the included CDR has an amino acid sequence that is otherwise identical with that of the reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that 1-5 amino acids within the included CDR are deleted, added, or substituted as compared with the reference CDR but the included CDR has an amino acid sequence that is otherwise identical to the reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that at least one amino acid within the included CDR is substituted as compared with the reference CDR but the included CDR has an amino acid sequence that is otherwise identical with that of the reference CDR. In some embodiments an included CDR is substantially identical to a reference CDR in that 1-5 amino acids within the included CDR are deleted, added, or substituted as compared with the reference CDR but the included CDR has an amino acid sequence that is otherwise identical to the reference CDR. In some embodiments, an antibody agent is or comprises a polypeptide whose amino acid sequence includes structural elements recognized by those skilled in the art as an immunoglobulin variable domain. In some embodiments, an antibody agent is a polypeptide protein having a binding domain which is homologous or largely homologous to an immunoglobulin-binding domain. Antibody-drug conjugate: As used herein, an \"antibody-drug conjugate\" refers to a protein that is created by linking an antibody to a biologically active cytotoxic payload or drug. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are generally produced through chemical modification/coupling reactions known to those skilled in the art. ADCs are intended to target and kill only the cancer cells and spare healthy cells. Antibody-drug conjugates are examples of bioconjugates and immunoconjugates. Antibody fragment: As used herein, an \"antibody fragment\" refers to a portion of an antibody or antibody agent as described herein, and typically refers to a portion that includes an antigen-binding portion or variable region thereof. An antibody fragment may be produced by any means. For example, in some embodiments, an antibody fragment may be enzymatically or chemically produced by fragmentation of an intact antibody or antibody agent. Alternatively, in some embodiments, an antibody fragment may be recombinantly produced (i.e., by expression of an engineered nucleic acid sequence. In some embodiments, an antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. In some embodiments, an antibody fragment (particularly an antigen-binding antibody fragment) may have a length of at least about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190 amino acids or more, in some embodiments at least about 200 amino acids. Antigen: As generally used herein, the term \"antigen\" refers to any substance or material that is specifically recognized and bound by an antibody. Antigens are typically small pieces of proteins (peptides) found on the surfaces of cells or invading microorganisms. Antibodies are thought to specifically recognize antigens as small as four amino acids in length, and the substitution of only one amino acid can abolish antibody recognition of the particular antigen for which it is specific. Antigenicity: As generally used herein, the term \"antigenicity\" refers to the ability of an antigen to be specifically recognized and bound by an antibody. An antigen is said to be in its antigenic conformation when it can be specifically recognized and bound by the antibody specific for the antigen. This is different from immunogenicity, which is the ability of an antigen to elicit the production of antibodies specific for the antigen. Anti-idiotypic antibody: As generally used herein, the term \"anti-idiotypic\" refers to antibodies having specificity for the antigen-binding sites of other antibody molecules. Anti-idiotypic antibodies are typically generated in the following manner: an antigen elicits the production of antibodies (called Ab-1) that are specific for that antigen. The antigenic determinant (epitopes) of this Ab-1 antibody which usually are called idiotypes are then used as immunogens themselves to elicit a second generation of antibodies that are specific for Ab-1. Such second generation antibodies (Ab-2) are typically called anti-idiotypic antibodies (or anti-idiotypes), and either mimic, or are closely related to, the initial antigen used to generate Ab-1. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, we note that it has been postulated that by exploiting this capability, anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to prevent certain infections, and treat some kinds of cancers and various immune and autoimmune diseases. Antibody half-life: As generally used herein, the term \"antibody half-life\" refers to the time in which a given amount of antibody or antibody agent, in vivo, is reduced to 50% of its initial concentration. Those of skill in the art are aware that, for example, IgG typically has a half-life of about 21 days (though IgG3 has a half-life of only 7 days), while IgM, A, D, and E have typical half-lives of 10 days, 6 days, 3 days, and 2 days, respectively. Antibody loading: As generally used herein, the term \"antibody loading\" refers to the antibody content of formulations or compositions, typically calculated as a percentage by weight of antibody, a single-chain Fv antibody fragment or Fab antibody fragment, relative to the weight of the dry preparation. A typical range of antibody loading is from 1-80%. Amorphous solid: As generally used herein, the term \"amorphous solid\" refers to a non-crystalline solid form of protein, sometimes referred to as \"amorphous precipitate\", which typically has no molecular lattice structure characteristic of the crystalline solid state. Aqueous-organic solvent mixture: As generally used herein, the term \"aqueous-organic solvent mixture\" refers to\u2014a mixture comprising n % organic solvent, where n is between 1 and 99 and m % aqueous, where m is 100n. Bioavailability: As generally used herein. The term \"bioavailability\" refers to the degree to which a substance, e.g., an active antibody or antibody fragment thereof, administered in vivo, becomes available to the tissue to which the substance is targeted. According to this invention, bioavailability also refers to the degree to which a whole antibody, or fragment thereof, that has been administered in vivo as a liquid formulation or a composition or formulation thereof, becomes available in the blood. According to this invention, bioavailability also refers to the ability of the substance, e.g., an active antibody or antibody fragment, to perform a function, e.g., direct cytotoxicity, at the target tissue once the substance has been delivered. Bioavailability may be measured in a number of ways, e.g., as the concentration of the substance, such as an active antibody or antibody fragment, measured as a function of time in the bloodstream. In some embodiments, bioavailability may be assessed, for example, by comparing the \"area under the curve\" (AUC) in a plot of the plasma concentration as a function of time. The AUC can be calculated, for example, using the linear trapezoidal rule. \"AUC\", as used herein, which refers to the area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to a time where the plasma concentration returns to baseline levels. \"AUC0-t\", as used herein, refers to the area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to a time, t, later, for example to the time of reaching baseline. The time will typically be measured in days, although hours can also be used as will be apparent by context. Biological macromolecule: As generally used herein the term \"biological macromolecule\" refers to biological polymers such proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, therapeutic protein, polysaccharides, lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharides, lipids, deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) and ribonucleic acids (RNA). Such, biological macromolecules can also be referred to as macromolecules. Branded: As used herein, the term \"branded\" (when used in the context of regulatory approval) generally refer to a protein or biologic, are used interchangeably herein, to mean the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the U.S. Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262). Biosimilar: The term \"biosimilar,\" as used herein, generally used interchangeably with \"a generic equivalent\" or \"follow-on.\" For example, a \"biosimilar mAb\" refers to a subsequent version of an innovator's mAb typically made by a different company. \"Biosimilar\" when used in reference to a branded protein or branded biologic can refer to a biological product evaluated against the branded protein or branded biologic and licensed under section 351(k) of the U.S. Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262). A biosimilar mAb can be one that satisfies one or more guidelines adopted May 30, 2012 by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency and published by the European Union as \"Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies\u2014non-clinical and clinical issues\" (Document Reference EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). Biosimilars can generally be produced by microbial cells (prokaryotic, eukaryotic), cell lines of human or animal origin (e.g., mammalian, avian, insect), or tissues derived from animals or plants. The expression construct for a proposed biosimilar product will generally encode the same primary amino acid sequence as its reference product. Minor modifications, such as N- or C-terminal truncations that will not have an effect on safety, purity, or potency, may be present. Bulking agent: As generally used herein, the term \"bulking agent\" refers to a compound which adds mass to a lyophilized mixture and contributes to the physical structure of the lyophilized cake (e.g. facilitates the production of an essentially uniform lyophilized cake which maintains an open pore structure). Exemplary bulking agents include mannitol, glycine, lactose, modified starch, poly(ethylene glycol), and sorbitol. As generally used herein, the term \"chemical stability\" refers to the ability of the protein components in a formulation to resist degradation via chemical pathways, such as oxidation, deamination, or hydrolysis. A protein formulation is typically considered chemically stable if less than about 5% of the components are degraded after 24 months at 4\u00b0 C. Chimeric antibody: As generally used herein, the term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is (are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. The term \"chimeric antibody\" may also refer to forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies, where regions of heavy and light chains are derived from human antibodies and the CDR or variable region is originated from a non-human source. Composition: As used herein, the term \"composition\" may be used to refer to a discrete physical entity that comprises one or more specified components. In general, unless otherwise specified, a composition may be of any form\u2014e.g., gas, gel, liquid, solid, etc. In particular, as described herein, are compositions comprising a therapeutic protein, or are prepared using a therapeutic protein.

Injectability or syringeability: As generally used herein, the term \"injectability\" or \"syringeability\" refers to the injection performance of a pharmaceutical formulation through a syringe equipped with an 18-32 gauge needle, optionally a thin walled needle. Injectability generally depends upon factors such as pressure or force required for injection, evenness of flow, aspiration qualities, and freedom from clogging the needle. Injectability of the liquid pharmaceutical formulations may be assessed by comparing the injection force of a reduced-viscosity formulation to a standard formulation without added viscosity-reducing agents. The reduction in the injection force of the formulation containing a viscosity-reducing agent reflects improved injectability of that formulation. The reduced viscosity formulations have improved injectability when the injection force is reduced by 10%, 30%, 50%, 75% or more when compared to a standard formulation with the same concentration of protein under otherwise the same conditions, except for replacement of a viscosity-reducing agent with an appropriate buffer of about the same concentration. In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 5%, about 10%, or about 15%. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 50%, or about 75%. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 30%. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 50%. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 75%. Alternatively, injectability of liquid pharmaceutical formulations may be assessed by comparing the time required to inject the same volume, such as 0.5 mL to about 1 mL, of different liquid protein formulations when the syringe is depressed with the same force. Injection force: As generally used herein, the term \"injection force\" refers to the force required to push a given liquid formulation through a given syringe equipped with a given needle gauge at a given injection speed. The injection force is typically reported in Newtons. For example, the injection force may be measured as the force required to push a liquid formulation through a 1 mL plastic syringe with a 0.25 inch inside diameter that is equipped with a 0.50 inch, 27 gauge needle at a 250 mm/min injection speed. Testing equipment can be used to measure the injection force. When measured under the same conditions, a formulation with lower viscosity will generally require an overall lower injection force.

The kinematic viscosity is a measure of the resistive flow of a fluid under the influence of gravity. When two fluids of equal volume and differing viscosity are placed in identical capillary viscometers and allowed to flow by gravity, the more viscous fluid typically takes longer than the less viscous fluid to flow through the capillary. The dimension of kinematic viscosity is length/time. Commonly, kinematic viscosity is The SI unit of kinematic viscosity is mm2/s, which is equal to 1 cSt. Liquid polymer: As generally used herein, the term \"liquid polymer\" refers to a pure liquid phase synthetic polymer, such as poly-ethylene glycol (PEG), in the absence of aqueous or organic solvents.

Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, and are directed against a single epitope. These, for example, are typically synthesized by culturing hybridoma cells, as described by Kohler et al. (Nature 256: 495, 1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), or isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (Nature 352: 624-628, 1991) and Marks et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 581-597, 1991). antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and \"chimeric\" antibodies as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat.

Some solutes, such as ionic solutes that dissociate in solution, will contribute more than 1 mole of dissolved components per mole of solute in the solution. For example, NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl in solution and thus provides 2 moles of dissolved components per 1 mole of dissolved NaCl in solution. Physiological osmolarity is typically in the range of about 280 mOsm/L to about 310 mOsm/L.

In some embodiments the range may be about 150 mg/mL to about 300 mg/mL. Protein delivery system: As generally used herein, the term \"protein delivery system\" refers to a method or means for administering one or more of a protein, such as a therapeutic protein, or high concentration of protein formulation or composition comprising such therapeutic proteins, to a biological entity. Radiolabel: As generally used herein, the term \"radiolabel\" refers to the incorporation of a radiolabel to a protein, such as a therapeutic protein, or an antibody. In situations where the radiolabel has a short half-life, as with 131I or 90Y, the radiolabel can also be therapeutic, e.g., used in radioimmunotherapies against cancers. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used. Examples of labels include, but are not limited to, the following herein, the term \"reconstitution\" refers to the dissolution of a dry powder, spray-dried or solvent precipitate, lyophilized therapeutic protein, or lyophilized cake into a high concentration protein formulation or compositions comprising such therapeutic proteins, in an appropriate buffer or pharmaceutical preparation such that the protein is dissolved or dispersed in aqueous solution for administration. Reduced-viscosity formulation: As generally used herein, the term \"reduced-viscosity formulation\" refers to a liquid formulation with a high concentration of a high-molecular-weight protein, such as a mAb, or a low-molecular-weight protein that is modified by the presence of one or more additives to lower the viscosity, as compared to a corresponding formulation that does not contain the viscosity-reducing additive(s). Reference: As generally used herein, describes a standard or control relative to which a comparison is performed. For example, in some embodiments, an agent, animal, individual, population, sample, sequence or value of interest is compared with a reference or control agent, animal, individual, population, sample, sequence or value. In some embodiments, a reference or control is tested and/or determined substantially simultaneously with the testing or determination of interest. In some embodiments, a reference or control is a historical reference or control, optionally embodied in a tangible medium. Typically, as would be understood by those skilled in the art, a reference or control is determined or characterized under comparable conditions or circumstances to those under assessment. Those skilled in the art will appreciate when sufficient similarities are present to justify reliance on and/or comparison to a particular possible reference or control. Rheology: As generally used herein, the term \"rheology\" refers to the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Room Temperature: As generally used herein, the term \"room temperature,\" for purposes of this invention, will be understood by those of skill in the art that room temperature can be any temperature from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 26\u00b0 C. Shear rate: as generally used herein, refers to the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer. The velocity gradient is the rate of change of velocity with distance from the plates. This simple case shows the uniform velocity gradient with shear rate (v1v2)/h in units of (cm/sec)/(cm)=1/sec. Hence, shear rate units are reciprocal seconds or, in general, reciprocal time. For a microfluidic viscometer, changes in pressure and flow rate are related to shear rate. Shear rate also refers to speed with which a material is deformed. Formulations containing proteins and viscosity-reducing agents are typically measured at shear rates ranging from about 0.5 s1 to about 200 s1 when measured using a cone and plate viscometer and a spindle appropriately chosen by one skilled in the art to accurately measure viscosities in the viscosity range of the sample of interest. Stabilization: As generally used herein, the term \"stabilization\" refers to the process of preventing the loss of specific activity and/or changes in secondary structure of a therapeutic protein, antibody, single-chain antibody Fv fragment, or a Fab antibody fragment as compared with the non-formulated aqueous therapeutic protein, antibody, single-chain Fv antibody fragment counterpart, or Fab antibody fragment counterpart, by preparing formulations or compositions of the above to include viscosity-reducing reagents. Stable formulation: As generally used herein, the term \"stable formulation\" refers to a formulation that is both chemically stable and physically stable. A stable formulation may be one in which more than about 95% of the bioactive protein molecules retain bioactivity in a formulation after 24 months of storage at 4\u00b0 C., or equivalent solution conditions at an elevated temperature, such as one month storage at 40\u00b0 C. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed, for example, in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1991) and Jones, A., Adv. Drug Delivery Revs. 10:29-90, 1993. Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a certain time period. For rapid screening, for example, the formulation may be kept at 40\u00b0 C., for 2 weeks to one month, at which time residual biological activity is measured and compared to the initial condition to assess stability. When the formulation is to be stored at 2\u00b0 C.-8\u00b0 C., the formulation should generally be stable at 30\u00b0 C. or 40\u00b0 C. for at least one month and/or stable at 2\u00b0 C.-8\u00b0 C. for at least 2 years. When the formulation is to be stored at room temperature, or about 25\u00b0 C., the formulation should generally be stable for at least 2 years at about 25\u00b0 C. and/or stable at 40\u00b0 C. for at least about 6 months. The extent of aggregation following lyophilization and storage can be used as an indicator of protein stability. In some embodiments, the stability is assessed by measuring the particle size of the proteins in the formulation. In some embodiments, stability may be assessed by measuring the activity of a formulation using standard biological activity or binding assays well within the abilities of one ordinarily skilled in the art. Therapeutic agent: As used herein, the phrase \"therapeutic agent\" in general refers to any agent that elicits a desired pharmacological effect when administered to an organism. In some embodiments, an agent is considered to be a therapeutic agent if it demonstrates a statistically significant effect across an appropriate population. In some embodiments, the appropriate population may be a population of model organisms. In some embodiments, an appropriate population may be defined by various criteria, such as a certain age group, gender, genetic background, preexisting clinical conditions, etc. In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent is a substance that can be used to alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of, and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, a \"therapeutic agent\" is an agent that has been or is required to be approved by a government agency before it can be marketed for administration to humans. In some embodiments, a \"therapeutic agent\" is an agent for which a medical prescription is required for administration to humans. Therapeutically effective amount: As generally used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to the lowest concentration of a substance required to elicit a measurable improvement or prevention of any symptom of a particular condition or disorder, to elicit a measurable enhancement of life expectancy, or to generally improve patient quality of life. The therapeutically effective amount is dependent upon the specific biologically active molecule and the specific condition or disorder to be treated. Therapeutically effective amounts of many proteins, such as the mAbs described herein, are well known in the art. The therapeutically effective amounts for treating specific disorders with known proteins, such as mAbs, if to be clinically applied to treat additional disorders, may be determined by standard techniques which are well within the craft of a skilled artisan, such as a physician. Tonicity: As generally used herein, the term \"tonicity\" refers to the osmotic pressure gradient resulting from the separation of two solutions by a semi-permeable membrane. In particular, tonicity is used to describe the osmotic pressure created across a cell membrane when a cell is exposed to an external solution. Solutes that can cross the cellular membrane do not contribute to the final osmotic pressure gradient. Only those dissolved species that do not cross the cell membrane will contribute to osmotic pressure differences and thus tonicity. Vaccination: As used herein, the term \"vaccination\" refers to the administration of a composition intended to generate an immune response, for example to a disease-causing agent. For the purposes of the present invention, vaccination can be administered before, during, and/or after exposure to a disease-causing agent, and in certain embodiments, before, during, and/or shortly after exposure to the agent. In some embodiments, vaccination includes multiple administrations, appropriately spaced in time, of a vaccinating composition. Variant: As used herein, the term \"variant\" refers to an entity that shows significant structural identity with a reference entity but differs structurally from the reference entity in the presence or level of one or more chemical moieties as compared with the reference entity. In many embodiments, a variant also differs functionally from its reference entity. In general, whether a particular entity is properly considered to be a \"variant\" of a reference entity is based on its degree of structural identity with the reference entity. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any biological or chemical reference entity has certain characteristic structural elements. A variant, by definition, is a distinct chemical entity that shares one or more such characteristic structural elements. To give but a few examples, a small molecule may have a characteristic core structural element (e.g., a macrocycle core) and/or one or more characteristic pendent moieties so that a variant of the small molecule is one that shares the core structural element and the characteristic pendent moieties but differs in other pendent moieties and/or in types of bonds present (single vs double, E vs Z, etc) within the core, a polypeptide may have a characteristic sequence element comprised of a plurality of amino acids having designated positions relative to one another in linear or three-dimensional space and/or contributing to a particular biological function, a nucleic acid may have a characteristic sequence element comprised of a plurality of nucleotide residues having designated positions relative to on another in linear or three-dimensional space. For example, a variant polypeptide may differ from a reference polypeptide as a result of one or more differences in amino acid sequence and/or one or more differences in chemical moieties (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, etc) covalently attached to the polypeptide backbone. In some embodiments, a variant polypeptide shows an overall sequence identity with a reference polypeptide that is in some embodiments, a variant polypeptide does not share at least one characteristic sequence element with a reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, the reference polypeptide has one or more biological activities. In some embodiments, a variant polypeptide shares one or more of the biological activities of the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, a variant polypeptide lacks one or more of the biological activities of the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, a variant polypeptide shows a reduced level of one or more biological activities as compared with the reference polypeptide. In many embodiments, a polypeptide of interest is considered to be a \"variant\" of a parent or reference polypeptide if the polypeptide of interest has an amino acid sequence that is identical to that of the parent but for a small number of sequence alterations at particular positions. Typically, residues in the variant are substituted as compared with the parent. In some embodiments, a variant has 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 substituted residue as compared with a parent. Often, a variant has a very small number (e.g., fewer than 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) number of substituted functional residues (i.e., residues that participate in a particular biological activity). Furthermore, a variant typically has not more than 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 additions or deletions, and often has no additions or deletions, as compared with the parent. Moreover, any additions or deletions are typically fewer than about 25, about 20, about 19, about 18, about 17, about 16, about 15, about 14, about 13, about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, and commonly are fewer than about 5, about 4, about 3, or about 2 residues. In some embodiments, the parent or reference polypeptide is one found in nature. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, a plurality of variants of a particular polypeptide of interest may commonly be found in nature, particularly when the polypeptide of interest is an infectious agent polypeptide. The term \"variant\" when used in connection with antibodies, refers to a polypeptide sequence of an antibody that contains at least one amino acid substitution, deletion, or insertion in the variable region, or a portion equivalent to the variable region, provided that the variant retains the desired binding affinity or biological activity. In addition, the antibodies as described herein may have amino acid modifications in the invariable region to modify effector function of the antibody, including half-life or clearance, ADCC and/or CDC activity. Such modifications can typically enhance pharmacokinetics or enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer, for example. See Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276(9):6591-6604 (2001), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In the case of IgG1, modifications to the invariable region, particularly the hinge or CH2 region, may increase or decrease effector function, including ADCC and/or CDC activity. In other embodiments, an IgG2 constant region is modified to decrease antibody-antigen aggregate formation. In the case of IgG4, modifications to the constant region, particularly the hinge region, may reduce the formation of half-antibodies. Viscosity: The term \"viscosity,\" as generally used herein, refers to the resistance of a substance (typically a liquid) to flow. Viscosity is related to the concept of shear force; it can be understood as the effect of different layers of the fluid exerting shearing force on each other, or on other surfaces, as they move against each other. Viscosity can be \"kinematic\" or \"absolute\". There are several measures of viscosity. The units of viscosity are Ns/m2, known as Pascal-seconds (Pa-s). Viscosity may be measured by using, for example, a viscometer at a given shear rate or multiple shear rates. An \"extrapolated zero-shear\" viscosity can be determined by creating a best fit line of the four highest-shear points on a plot of absolute viscosity versus shear rate, and linearly extrapolating viscosity back to zero-shear. Alternatively, for a Newtonian fluid, viscosity can be determined by averaging viscosity values at multiple shear rates. Viscosity can also be measured using a microfluidic viscometer at single or multiple shear rates (also called flow rates), wherein absolute viscosity is derived from a change in pressure as a liquid flows through a channel. Viscosity equals shear stress over shear rate. Viscosities measured with microfluidic viscometers can, in some embodiments, be directly compared to extrapolated zero-shear viscosities, for example those extrapolated from viscosities measured at multiple shear rates using a cone and plate viscometer. The composition herein may be in either aqueous or lyophilized form. In aqueous form, the composition of matter may have a viscosity, that when measured at 25\u00b0 C., that may be, for example, about 100 cP, 75 cP, 50 cP, 45 cP, 40 cP, 35 cP, 30 cP, or lower. In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the lower limit may be about 1 cP, about 5 cP, about 10 cP, or about or 15 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the upper limit may be about 20 cP, about 25 cP, about 30 cP, about 35 cP, about 40 cP, about 45 cP, about 50 cP, about 75 cP, or about 100 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 100 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 75 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 50 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 40 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 35 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 30 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 25 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 20 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 15 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 10 cP. Viscosity gradient: As used herein, the term \"viscosity gradient\" refers to the rate of change of the viscosity of a protein solution as protein concentration increases. The viscosity gradient can be approximated from a plot of the viscosity as a function of the protein concentration for a series of formulations that are otherwise the same but have different protein concentrations. The viscosity increases approximately exponentially with increasing protein concentration. The viscosity gradient at a specific protein concentration can be approximated from the slope of a line tangent to the plot of viscosity as a function of protein concentration. The viscosity gradient can be approximated from a linear approximation to the plot of viscosity as a function of any protein concentration or over a narrow window of protein concentrations. In some embodiments a formulation is said to have a decreased viscosity gradient if, when the viscosity as a function of protein concentration is approximated as an exponential function, the exponent of the exponential function is smaller than the exponent obtained for the otherwise same formulation without the viscosity-reducing agent. In a similar manner, a formulation can be said to have a lower/higher viscosity gradient when compared to a second formulation if the exponent for the formulation is lower/higher than the exponent for the second formulation. The viscosity gradient can be numerically approximated from a plot of the viscosity as a function of protein concentration by other methods known to the skilled formulation researchers. Viscosity-reducing agent: As used herein, the term \"viscosity-reducing agent\" refers to a compound which acts to reduce the viscosity of a solution relative to the viscosity of a solution absent of a viscosity-reducing agent. The viscosity-reducing agent may be a single compound, or may be a mixture of one or more compounds. When the viscosity-reducing agent is a mixture of two or more compounds, the listed concentration refers to each individual agent, unless otherwise specified.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS The present disclosure, among other things, identifies viscosity-reducing additive agents that are capable of lowering viscosity of high concentration protein agent formulations, particularly of aqueous formulations. In some embodiments, inclusion of such additive agents also avoids and/or reduces protein agent aggregation within provided preparations. Prior efforts to identify useful viscosity-reducing additive agents have often relied on agents with safety and/or toxicity profiles that are uncertain and/or problematic. Preparations including such additives would therefore face a higher regulatory burden prior to approval than would preparations containing compounds demonstrated and/or accepted to be safe. The present disclosure provides, in many embodiments, preparations that utilize only safe additives. Indeed, even if a compound were to be shown to substantially reduce viscosity, the compound may ultimately be unsuitable for use in a formulation intended for injection into a human. In order to provide therapeutically effective amounts of many high-molecular-weight protein agents, such as mAbs, protein agent concentrations greater than 150 mg/mL for SC/IM injection are often required in volumes less than 2 mL. Due to problems with high viscosity and other properties characteristic of concentrated solutions of large proteins, many therapeutically important mAbs are currently administered via IV infusions in order to deliver therapeutically effective amounts of mAb/protein agent. The present pharmaceutical formulation is prepared by combining, in addition to therapeutic protein agents as described, one or more of the following types of liquid media, viscosity-reducing agents, surfactants, lyoprotectants, or other ingredients or excipients listed in the paragraphs below. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that combining the various components to be included in the formulation can be done in any appropriate order, namely, the buffer can be added first, middle or last and the other additive agents can also be added first, middle or last. It is also to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that some of these chemicals can be incompatible in certain combinations, and accordingly, can be easily substituted with different chemicals that have similar properties but are compatible in the relevant mixture.Protein Agents A therapeutic protein agents is the pharmaceutically active substance of a protein agent formulation. In some embodiments, a protein agent may include recombinant proteins, isolated or synthetic proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, plasma proteins, coagulation factors, acute phase proteins, hemoproteins, cell adhesion proteins, transmembrane transport proteins, synport/antiport proteins, hormones, growth factors, receptors, transmembrane receptors, intracellular receptors, DNA-binding proteins, transcription regulation proteins, RNA-binding proteins, immune system proteins, nutrient storage and transport proteins, chaperone proteins, enzymes, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, membrane proteins, transport proteins, or lipoproteins, antibodies, recombinant antibodies, antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies, modified enzymes, pegylated proteins, therapeutic proteins, storage proteins, enzymes, growth factors or hormones, immunomodifiers, anti-infectives, antiproliferatives, vaccines or other therapeutics, prophylactic, diagnostic proteins, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments a protein agent may include antibodies, recombinant antibodies, antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies, modified enzymes, pegylated proteins, therapeutic proteins, storage proteins, enzymes, growth factors or hormones, immunomodifiers, anti-infectives, antiproliferatives, vaccines or other therapeutics, prophylactic, diagnostic proteins, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a protein agent is an antibody. Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware that, typically, an antibody as produced in nature is a glycoprotein, typically with an approximate MW of 150 kD. Generally, antibodies are produced by the humoral arm of the immune system of vertebrates in response to the presence of foreign (non-self) or self-identified as non-self-molecules in the body. Antibodies are essential for the prevention and resolution of infection by microorganisms, e.g. parasites, bacteria and viruses. Antibodies perform this function by recognizing and binding, in a highly specific manner, proteins (or, sometimes, other organic molecules including polysaccharides, glycoproteins, lipids, or nucleic acids) called antigens (or epitopes), including those presented on the surface of invading microorganisms and their products. Antibodies bind their target antigens through highly specific interactions between hypervariable domains, called antigen-binding sites, that appear on the antibody and on the epitope itself. Upon binding to the antigen, antibodies activate one or more of the many effector systems of the immune system that contribute to the potential neutralization, destruction and elimination of the infecting microorganism or other antigen-containing entity, e.g. a cancer cell. Antibodies can also generally be used for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and transplant rejection, by virtue of their specific binding properties and subsequent potential neutralization of the cellular targets, which are typically involved in disease states. For example, the monoclonal antibody Infliximab binds to tumor necrosis factor and neutralizes its role in inflammation by blocking its interaction with a cell surface receptor; while Rituximab targets malignant B lymphocytes by binding to their cell surface CD20 antigen. In some embodiments, a protein agent is an An \"immunoglobulin\" a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a \"variable\" (\"V\") region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids which are primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines an invariable region primarily responsible for effector function. The four chains are arranged in a classic \"Y\" model. The bottom \"leg\" of the \"Y\" is called the Fc region (\"c\" stands for \"crystallizable\" or, alternatively, \"complement-binding\") and is used to anchor the antibody within cell membranes, and is also used to bind macrophage cells and thus activate complementation. The two \"arms\" at the top of the \"Y\" are called Fab regions (the \"ab\" stands for \"antigen-binding\"). Each Fab region contains an invariable region (at the junction of the Fab and the Fc regions) and a variable region (which extends to the tip of the \"Y\" or Fc region). Each variable region contains identical antigen-binding sites (at regions within the variable regions called \"hypervariable\" regions) at each tip of the \"Y\". The term \"hypervariable\" region refers to amino acid residues from a complementarity-determining region or CDR (i.e., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) the light and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain as described by Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). \"Framework\" or FR residues are the remaining variable region residues other than the hypervariable region residues. Each Fab region has one antigen-binding site, and the complete antibody molecule therefore has two antigen-binding sites (i.e., is \"bivalent\"). The two antigen-binding sites on a naturally occurring antibody are identical to each other, and therefore the antibody is specific for one antigen (i.e., is \"monospecific\"). Immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes depending on the amino acid sequence of the invariable domain of their heavy chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu (), delta (), gamma (), alpha (), and antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Typically, IgG, IgE and IgD occur as monomers, while IgA can occur as not only a monomer, but also a dimer or trimer, and IgM can occur as a pentamer. Several of the above may be further divided into subclasses or isotypes, have antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities. Human light chains are classified as kappa () and lambda () light chains. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and invariable regions are joined by a \"J\" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain additionally encompassing a \"D\" region of about 10 more amino acids (See generally, Fundamental Immunology, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). In some embodiments, a whole anti-idiotypic antibody is itself the immunogen. In some embodiments, atherapeutic protein elicits a response to the antigen that the anti-idiotype mimics or is closely related to. Therefore, an anti-idiotypic antibody can act as a type of vaccine or therapy against cancers and autoimmune diseases, e.g., allergies, as well as viruses, for example, hepatitis B virus. In some embodiments, a protein agent is an antibody fragment. A number of molecular fragments of antibody molecules have been isolated to date. These do not occur naturally, but are engineered from one or more complete antibody molecules. These fragments include Fab fragments (a single Fab that is isolated from a complete antibody by digestion with the enzyme papain), and F(ab)2 fragments (two Fabs covalently-bound to each other, produced by digesting the antibody with the enzyme pepsin). Fab fragments are monospecific, while F(ab)2 fragments are bispecific. Recently, a number of engineered antibody fragments have been introduced. These include double-stranded Fv (dsFv) fragments and single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments stands for \"variable\" in both cases). A dsFv fragment consists of a Fab fragment minus the constant regions, i.e., consisting only of the variable regions of a heavy and light chain covalently bound to each other. A scFv fragment is a single polypeptide chain, consisting of the variable region of a heavy chain linked via a peptide linker to the variable region of a light chain. Classically, both dsFv and scFv fragments are monovalent (and thus mono-specific). However, two dsFv fragments or two scFv fragments can themselves be linked to form a bispecific fragment (which would be analogous to a F(ab)2 fragment without the constant regions). Furthermore, it is possible to link two dsFv fragments or scFv fragments with different antigen-binding sites (i.e., different specificities), to form a bi-specific fragment. Such fragments may be used as either research tools or therapeutic or diagnostic reagents. In some embodiments, a protein agent is an antibody that can be monoclonal (mAb) or polyclonal. Two particular types of antibody preparations, monoclonal and polyclonal, can be distinguished by their specificities: polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are found in the immunoglobulin fraction of blood, and are essentially a polyclonal mixture of many different types of antibodies specific for different antigens an individual has been exposed to (i.e., they originate from many different clones of B lymphocytes (or B cells). Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies of a single specificity, i.e., that are derived from a single clone of B lymphocytes (B cells). These antibodies generally have exquisite specificity for their target antigens and can also typically be produced in high amounts (i.e., high titres). They are useful as markers for specific antigens (e.g., cancer antigens), as diagnostic agents (e.g., in assays to detect viruses like HIV-1), and as therapeutic agents. Whole monoclonal antibodies are those that have a classic molecular structure that includes two complete heavy chains and two complete light chains. This is distinguished from antibody fragments, such as Fab, F(ab)2, Fc fragments, dsFv fragments, and scFv fragments. Traditionally, monoclonal antibodies have been produced by fusing an antibody-producing B cell with an immortal hybridoma cell to generate B cell hybridomas, which continually produce monoclonal antibodies in cell culture. Another method that is traditionally used to generate monoclonal antibodies involves the expression of monoclonal antibodies in a bacterial cell culture using phage-display technology. Currently, however, monoclonal antibodies may be produced in vivo in large quantities in genetically-modified animals, such as cows and goats (Genzyme Transgenics), pigs and rabbits (Medarex, PPL Therapeutics), chickens (Tranxenogen), and in plants, such as tobacco and corn (Epicyte, Integrated Protein Technologies, Meristem Croptech, and others). For example, large amounts of monoclonal antibodies can be found in the milk of genetically-modified goats (Genzyme Transgenics). Furthermore, as a result of transgenics, mice have been modified to contain and express the entire human B cell genome (which encodes human antibodies). Therefore, such transgenic mice (Abgenix) are a source of human antibodies according to this invention. It should be noted that glycosylation is specific to the animal that is producing the antibodies. For example, human antibodies from sources other than humans will have subtly different glycosylation profiles. Therefore, whole antibodies or single-chain Fv antibody fragments or Fab antibody fragments described in this invention may display modified glycosylation patterns or be deglycosylated, depending on the source of isolation. Antibodies, according to the context of this invention, may also include derivatized antibodies. Such antibodies include those derivatized with polyethylene glycol, or at least one carbohydrate moiety, or least one methyl or ethyl group. Clinically relevant antibodies may also be classified according to the therapeutic area in which they are to be employed. In some embodiments, a clinical antibody employed for therapeutic use may include those for treating cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer), inflammatory diseases (e.g., autoimmune diseases, arthritis), cardiovascular diseases (e.g., strokes), infectious disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS), respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma), tissue transplantation rejection and organ transplantation rejection. In some embodiments, a clinical antibody is employed for radioimmunotherapy. In some embodiments, an embodiments, a protein agent may be a chimeric antibody. Though naturally occurring antibodies are derived from a single species, engineered antibodies and antibody fragments may be derived from more than one species of animal, i.e., may be chimeric. Mouse (murine)/human chimeric antibodies have been generated, though other combinations are possible. Chimeric antibodies have been further broken down into two subtypes: chimeric and humanized. Chimeric murine/human antibodies typically contain approximately 75% human and 25% mouse amino acid sequences, respectively. The human sequences represent invariable regions of an antibody while the mouse sequences represent variable regions (and thus contain the antigen-binding sites) of an antibody. The general rationale for using such chimeras is to retain antigen specificity of a mouse antibody but reduce the immunogenicity of a mouse antibody (a murine antibody would cause an immune response against it in species other than the mouse) and thus be able to employ a chimera in human therapies. Chimeric antibodies also include those which comprise CDR regions from different human antibodies. CDR regions, also called hypervariable regions, are sequences within variable regions of antibody molecules that generate antigen-binding sites. CDR regions are so-named because the binding site is complementary in shape and charge distribution to the epitope recognized on an antigen. Alternatively, chimeric antibodies comprise framework regions from one antibody and CDR regions from another antibody. Chimeric antibodies also include those which comprise CDR regions from at least two different human antibodies. Humanized antibodies typically contain approximately 90% (or more) human amino acid sequences. In this scenario, the only murine sequences present are those for a hypervariable region (that are the actual antigen-binding sites contained within a variable region). Humanized antibodies have minimal mouse immunogenicity as compared with chimeric antibodies. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises amino acid sequences obtained by expressing cDNA encoding the heavy and/or light chain, or alternatively the heavy and/or light chain variable region of an antibody in mammalian host cells. The term \"antibody\" refers to an intact immunoglobulin, e.g. in the case of IgG, a tetrameric immunoglobulin composed of two heavy chains and two light chains (e.g., chimeric, humanized, or human versions preferably with full length heavy and/or light chains, and optionally with mutations within the framework or constant regions that retain the antigen binding properties). In some embodiments, proteins and non-protein agents may be conjugated to antibodies by methods that are known in the art. Conjugation methods include direct linkage, linkage via covalently attached linkers, and specific binding pair members (e.g., avidin-biotin). Exemplary methods are described by Greenfield et al., Cancer Research 50, 6600-6607 (1990) for the conjugation of doxorubicin, and by Arnon et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 303, 79-90 (1991) and by Kiseleva et al., Mol. Biol. (USSR) 25, 508-514 (1991) for the conjugation of platinum compounds. In some embodiments, a protein agent is a biosimilar mAb. A biosimilar mAb is generally similar to the reference mAb either physiochemically or biologically, both in terms of safety and efficacy. The biosimilar mAb can be evaluated against a reference mAb using one or more in vitro studies including assays detailing binding to target antigen(s); binding to isoforms of the Fc gamma and FcRIII), FcRn, and complement (C1q); Fab-associated functions (e.g. neutralization of a soluble ligand, receptor activation or blockade); or Fc-associated functions (e.g. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, complement activation). In vitro comparisons may be combined with in vivo data demonstrating similarity of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and/or safety. Clinical evaluations of a biosimilar mAb against a reference mAb can include tmax, Ctrough); similarity of clinical efficacy (e.g. using randomized, parallel group comparative clinical trials). The quality comparison between a biosimilar mAb and a reference mAb can be evaluated using established procedures, including those described in the \"Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: Quality issues\" (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/49348/2005), and the \"Guideline on development, production, characterization and specifications for monoclonal antibodies and related substances\" (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/157653/2007). Differences between a biosimilar mAb and a reference mAb can include post-translational modification, e.g. by attaching to the mAb other biochemical groups such as a phosphate, various lipids and carbohydrates; by proteolytic cleavage following translation; by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid (e.g., formylation); or by many other mechanisms. Other post-translational modifications can be a consequence of manufacturing process operations\u2014for example, glycation may occur with exposure of the product to reducing sugars. In other cases, storage conditions may be permissive for certain degradation pathways such as oxidation, deamidation, or aggregation. In some embodiments, a protein agent is an antibody.

In some embodiments, a surfactant to be added to a protein agent formulation is or comprises one or more of A tonicity modifier may also be included in a protein agent formulation as described herein. Tonicity modifiers are understood to be molecules that contribute to the osmolality of a solution. The osmolality of a pharmaceutical composition is regulated to maximize the stability of the active ingredients, or in this case, protein agents, and also to minimize discomfort to the patient upon administration of therapeutic formulations. Serum is approximately 300\u00b150 milliosmolals per kilogram (mOsm/kg). It is generally preferred that a pharmaceutical composition be isotonic with serum, i.e., having the same or similar osmolality as serum, which is achieved by addition of a tonicity modifier. Thus, it is contemplated that osmolality will range from about 180 to about 420 mOsm/kg, however, it is to be understood that osmolality can register either higher or lower than the range, as specific conditions require.

Low-viscosity formulations can exhibit changes in viscosity that are less dependent upon protein agent concentration as compared to an otherwise same formulation control or reference without a viscosity-reducing agent. A low-viscosity protein agent formulation can allow for an increased concentration and a decreased dosage frequency of a protein agent. In some embodiments, a low-viscosity protein agent formulation contains 2 or more, 3 or more, or 4 or more different protein agents. For example, a combination of 2 or more mAbs can be provided in a single low-viscosity protein agent formulation. A low-viscosity protein agent formulation can be used to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of a protein agent in a volume appropriate for subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) injections. A viscosity-reducing agent and other additives like buffering agents, tonicity agents, and solubilizing agents, can be included in any amount to achieve a desired viscosity measurement of a liquid protein agent formulation, as long as the amounts are not toxic or otherwise harmful to the subject upon administration. In addition, additives or a viscosity-reducing agent added to a protein agent formulation should not substantially interfere with the chemical and/or physical stability of the formulation.

In some embodiments, the range may be about 10 mM to about 200 mM. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10 mM to about 150 mM. In some embodiments the range may be about 10 mM to about 100 mM. In some embodiments the range may be about 15 mM to about 75 mM. In some embodiments, the range may be about 15 mM to about 25 mM. In some embodiments, with two or more viscosity-reducing agents, the agents are preferably, but not necessarily, present at the same concentration. In the absence of a viscosity-reducing agent, the viscosity of a protein agent-containing formulation increases exponentially as the concentration is increased to accommodate a required lower volume for injection. Such a protein formulation, in the absence of a viscosity-reducing agent, may have a viscosity in the range of 50 cP to 1,500 cP when measured at 25\u00b0 C. Such formulations are often unsuitable for SC or IM injection due to difficulty in administration by small-bore needles using syringes, and due to pain at the site of injection. In addition, the chemical and physical stability of a protein agent is at risk at higher concentrations. The use of one or more viscosity-reducing agents permits the preparation of formulations with a viscosity, that when measured at 25\u00b0 C., may be, for example, about 100 cP, 75 cP, 50 cP, 45 cP, 40 cP, 35 cP, 30 cP, or lower.

In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 15 cP. In some embodiments, when measured at 25\u00b0 C., the range may be about 5 cP to about 10 cP. In some embodiments, an aqueous protein agent formulation has a viscosity that is at least about 30% less than the analogous control or reference formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent, when measured under the same conditions.

By making a low-viscosity protein agent formulation, the viscosity changes less with increasing protein agent concentration as compared to the otherwise same formulation control without a viscosity-reducing agent. Also, a low-viscosity protein agent formulation exhibits a decreased viscosity gradient. In some embodiments, a viscosity gradient of a protein formulation may be about 2-fold less, 3-fold less, or even more than 3-fold less than a viscosity gradient of an otherwise same protein agent formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent. In some embodiments, a viscosity gradient of a protein agent formulation may be, for example, less than about 5.0 cP mL/mg, 3.0 or lower for a protein agent formulation with a protein concentration between 10 mg/mL and 5,000 mg/mL. In some embodiments, a viscosity gradient may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 0.01 Cp mL/mg, about 0.02 cP mL/mg, or about 0.04 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 0.05 cP mL/mg, about 0.1 cP mL/mg, about about 5.0 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.01 cP mg/mL to about 5.0 cP mg/mL. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.01 cP mg/mL to about 3.0 cP mg/mL. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.01 cP mg/mL to about 2.0 cP mg/mL. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.01 cP mL/mg to about 1.5 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.01 cP mL/mg to about 1.0 cP mL/mg.

In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.02 cP mL/mg to about 1.0 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.02 cP mL/mg to about 0.5 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.02 cP mL/mg to about 0.1 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.02 cP mL/mg to about 0.05 cP mL/mg. In some embodiments, a viscosity-reducing agent may also affect pharmacokinetics when a protein agent formulation is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, when compared to administration through an intravenous route, especially with regard to CMAX. As used herein, \"CMAX\" refers to the maximum plasma concentration after a dose administration, and before administration of a subsequent dose. For example, the CMAX after SC or IM injection may be at least 10% to at least 20% less than the CMAX of an approximately equivalent pharmaceutically effective intravenously administered dose. In some embodiments, a protein agent formulation with a viscosity-reducing agent does not cause any significant signs of toxicity and/or no irreversible signs of toxicity when administered via subcutaneous, intramuscular, or other types of injection. As used herein, \"significant signs of toxicity\" includes intoxication, lethargy, and behavioral modifications such as those that occur with damage to the central nervous system, infertility, signs of serious cardiotoxicity such as cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarctions, and cardiac or congestive heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, difficulty breathing, and death.Osmolarity In some embodiments, a liquid protein agent formulation has a physiological osmolarity that may be, for example, at least 200 mOsm/L, 220 mOsm/L, 240 mOsm/L, 260 mOsm/L, 280 mOsm/L, 300 mOsm/L, or more. In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 200 mOsm/L, about 220 mOsm/L, about 240 mOsm/L, about 260 mOsm/L, about 280 mOsm/L, or about 300 mOsm/L.

In some embodiments, the range may be between 200 mOsm/L to about 500 mOsm/L. In some embodiments, the range may be between 200 mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L. In some embodiments, the range may be between 200 mOsm/L to about 380 mOsm/L. In some embodiments, the range may be about 280 mOsm/L to about 310 mOsm/L.Osmolality and Tonicity In some embodiments, a liquid protein agent formulation is essentially isotonic to human blood. In some embodiments, a liquid protein agent formulation can be hypertonic. A tonicity modifier may also be included in a protein agent formulation as described herein. A tonicity modifier is understood to be molecule that contributes to an osmolality of a solution. Osmolality of a pharmaceutical composition is regulated to maximize the stability of an active ingredient, or, in this case, of a protein agent, and also to minimize discomfort to a patient upon administration of a therapeutic protein agent formulation. Serum is approximately 300\u00b150 milliosmolals per kilogram (mOsm/kg). It is generally preferred that a pharmaceutical composition be isotonic with serum, i.e., having the same or similar osmolality as serum, which is achieved by an addition of a tonicity modifier. Thus, it is contemplated that osmolality of a protein agent formulation will range from about 180 to about 420 mOsm/kg, however, it is to be understood that osmolality can register either higher or lower than the range as specific conditions require. In some embodiments, a tonicity modifier is or comprises one or more of amino acids (e.g., arginine, cysteine, histidine and glycine), salts can be added to a protein agent formulation in an amount that may be, for example, at least about 1 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 500 mM, 1000 mM, or more. In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 1 mM, about 10 mM, about 15 mM, about 25 mM, or about 50 mM. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 75 mM, about 100 mM, about 150 mM, about 200 mM, about 300 mM, about 400 mM, about 500 mM, about 600 mM, about 700 mM, about 800 mM, about 900 mM, or about 1000 mM. In some embodiments, the range may be about 1 mM to about 1000 mM. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10 mM to about 200 mM. In some embodiments, a tonicity modifier is sodium chloride within a concentration range of 0 mM to 200 mM. In some embodiments, a liquid formulation has a physiological osmolality that is hypotonic or isotonic to human blood, for example, about 150 mOsm/kg, 200 mOsm/kg, 225 mOsm/kg, 250 mOsm/kg, 275 mOsm/kg, or 300 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 150 mOsm/kg, 200 mOsm, about 225 mOsm/kg, or about 250 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 275 mOsm/kg, or about 300 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 150 mOsm/kg to about 300 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments the range may be about 200 mOsm/kg to about 300 mOsm/kg.

In some embodiments, a liquid formulation has an osmolality that is hypertonic to human blood, for example, about 350 mOsm/kg, 400 mOsm/kg, 450 mOsm/kg, 500 mOsm/kg, 900 950 mOsm/kg, 1000 mOsm/kg, or more. In some embodiments the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 350 mOsm/kg, about 400 mOsm/kg, about 500 mOsm/kg, about 550 mOsm/kg, about 600 mOsm/kg, or about 650 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 700 mOsm/kg, about 750 mOsm/kg, about 800 mOsm/kg, about 850 mOsm/kg, about 900 mOsm/kg, about 950 mOsm/kg, or about 1000 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 350 mOsm/kg to about 1000 mOsm/kg. In some embodiments, the range may be about 400 mOsm/kg to about 1000 mOsm/kg.

In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 6.1, about 6.2, about 6.3, about 6.4, about 6.5, about 6.6, about 6.7, about 6.8, about 6.9, about 7.0, about 7.1, about 7.2, about 7.3, about 7.4, about 7.5, about 7.6, about 7.7, about 7.8, about 7.9, about 8.0, about 8.1, about 8.2, about 8.3, about 8.4, about 8.5, about 8.6, about 8.7, about 8.8, about 8.9, about 9.0, about 9.1, about 9.2, about 9.3, about 9.4, about 9.5, about 9.6, about 9.7, about 9.8, about 9.9, or about 10.0. In some embodiments, the range may be about 3.0 to about 10.0. In some embodiments, the range may be about 4.0 to about 10.0. In some embodiments, the range may be about 4.0 to about 10.0.

In some embodiments, the range may be about 6.2 to 7.0. It is to be understood that a pH can be adjusted as necessary to maximize stability and solubility of a protein agent in a particular formulation and as such, a pH reading outside of physiological ranges, yet tolerable to a patient, are within the scope of the invention.Stability Those of skill in the art will appreciate that protein agent stability is one of the most important obstacles to the successful preparation of polymer microparticulate delivery systems that control the release of a protein agent. The stability of high concentration protein agents, such as a therapeutic protein agent (e.g whole antibodies or antibody fragments) encapsulated in polymeric carriers may be challenged at three separate stages: 1) manufacture of a therapeutic protein agent composition, 2) protein agent release from the resulting composition and 3) in vivo stability after protein agent release. During preparation of microparticles or microspheres containing a soluble or amorphous protein agent, the use of lyophilization is especially detrimental to protein agent stability. Subsequently, a released protein agent is susceptible to moisture-induced aggregation, thus resulting in permanent inactivation. In some embodiments, a viscosity-reducing agent and other excipients used for the preparation of a high protein agent concentration formulation reduce aggregation and minimize protein-protein interactions. In order to achieve high protein agent stability in a high concentration, low-viscosity protein agent formulation, it is necessary to restrict the mobility of individual therapeutic protein agents, which is best achieved in the lyophilized solid state in the presence of excipients.Bioavailability Bioavailability may be affected by using a low-viscosity formulation of a therapeutic protein agent. The overall bioavailability can be increased for SC or IM injections as compared to the otherwise same formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent. In some embodiments, when administered, the percent bioavailability of a protein agent may be at least 1.1 to 1.2 times the percent bioavailability of the otherwise same formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent. In certain terms, the area under the curve, (AUC) value may be at least 10% to 20% or larger than the same value computed for the otherwise same formulation but without a viscosity-reducing agent.Pharmaceutical Compositions Formulations for Therapeutic Administration In some embodiments, a provided formulation may be a pharmaceutical formulation in that all of its components are pharmaceutically acceptable. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation may be formulated and/or packaged for a particular route of administration. In some embodiments, a provided pharmaceutical formulation may be formulated and/or packaged for parenteral administration. In some embodiments, the route of administration of a protein agent formulation is subcutaneous (SC) and/or intramuscular (IM) injection. In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein agent is administered in the form of a physiologically acceptable formulation (also referred to herein as a composition, a pharmaceutical composition, or as a pharmaceutical formulation) comprising a therapeutic protein agent that is formulated with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. Such carriers, excipients, or diluents are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In some embodiments, the preparation of such compositions entails combining a therapeutic protein agent with one or more additives that can include buffers, antioxidants (e.g. ascorbic acid), low molecular weight polypeptides (e.g. those having fewer than 10 amino acids), amino (e.g. EDTA), glutathione and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, in a liquid formulation, neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with nonspecific serum albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents. In accordance with appropriate industry standards, preservatives (e.g. benzyl alcohol) may also be added to a protein agent formulation. Further examples of components that may be employed in a pharmaceutical formulation are presented in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1980, and in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published jointly by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. In some embodiments, a protein agent formulation is prepared in a bulk formulations and, as such, components of a pharmaceutical formulation are adjusted so that they are higher than would be required for administration, and are later diluted appropriately with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent prior to administration. A protein agent formulation can be formulated as lyophilized crystalline or amorphous powder formulation, a form suitable for storage and handling, and in a form suitable for inhalation or pulmonary administration, for example in the form of powders made for the preparation of aerosol formulations. In some embodiments, a protein agent can be formulated in a slurry of crystals or precipitates. In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein agent is used to prepare a liquid formulation, such as an aqueous formulation or a non-aqueous formulation, for therapeutic administration. In some embodiments, a high concentration protein agent formulation is suitable for parenteral administration, e.g. is sterile, has endotoxin levels acceptable for parenteral administration, e.g. <0.25 EU/mL or 0.008 EU/mg, and comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.Aqueous Liquid Formulations In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein agent formulation is an aqueous formulation that allows for stable, long-term storage. These formulations are useful, in part, because they are more convenient for the patient to use, as these formulations do not require any extra steps such as rehydrating. As used herein, a \"solution\" or \"liquid formulation\" is meant to mean a liquid preparation that contains one or more chemical substances dissolved in a suitable solvent or mixture of mutually miscible solvents. Reconstitution is the dissolution of lyophilized therapeutic protein agent formulations or compositions in appropriate buffers or pharmaceutical formulations.Lyophilized Formulations A lyophilized therapeutic protein formulation includes a therapeutic protein agent that has been dried and is present as particles in, for example, powder form. In the present context the expression \"powder\" refers to a collection of essentially dry particles, i.e. the moisture content being at least below about 10% by weight, 6% by weight, 4% by weight, or lower.

In some embodiments, the range of moisture content after lyophilization may be about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight. A therapeutic protein agent powder can be optionally combined with carriers or surfactants. A suitable carrier agent is can include carbohydrates (e.g. monosaccharides such as fructose, glucose, salts (e.g. sodium citrate and sodium ascorbate), and combinations therein. In some embodiments, a carrier is selected from the group consisting thereof. In some embodiments, a surfactant is selected from the group consisting of salts of fatty acids, bile thereof. In some embodiments, a surfactant is a salt of taurocholate, such as sodium taurocholate. In some embodiments, a phospholipid that can be used as a surfactant includes lysophosphatidylcholine.

This allows a formulation of a pharmaceutically active protein agent to be purified and/or concentrated at a higher concentration using common methods known to those skilled in the art that can include tangential flow filtration, centrifugal concentration, and, after buffer exchange, using dialysis UF/DF containing viscosity-reducing agents, or even without buffer exchange with viscosity-reducing agents. In some embodiments, a low-viscosity, high concentration formulation of a therapeutic protein agent consisting of whole antibodies, single-chain Fv antibody fragments, Fab antibody fragments, or a formulation or composition comprising such a protein agent is prepared by the following process: First, a therapeutic protein agent is buffer exchanged with pharmaceutically acceptable buffers or water. Next, excipients or ingredients selected the group consisting of sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, vitamins, viscosity lowering agents, wetting or solubilizing buffer salts, emulsifying agents, antimicrobial agents, chelating agents, antioxidants, and combinations thereof are added directly to a protein agent solution. After adding, a protein agent solution a is incubated with excipients for a minimum of 1 hour to a maximum of 24 hours. Excipient concentrations are typically between about 0.01 and about 10% (w/v). Other ingredient concentrations are between about 0.01 and about 90% (w/v). Protein agent concentrations are between about 0.01 and about 99% (w/v). A buffer exchanged protein agent solution containing excipients and a viscosity-reducing agent is then concentrated using the TFF system. Alternatively, a protein agent solution containing a viscosity-reducing agents and other excipients can be dried by air drying, spray drying, lyophilization or vacuum drying. Drying is carried out for a minimum of about 1 hour to a maximum of about 72 hours after incubation, until the moisture content of the final product is below about 5% to about 10% by weight. Finally, micromizing (reducing the size) of a cake can be performed if necessary.Preparation of a Viscosity-Reducing Protein Agent Formulation In some embodiments, when preparing a low viscosity, high concentration formulation of a protein agent, a viscosity-reducing agent such as amino acids and/or vitamins, or enhancers such as surfactants, are not added during the buffer exchange step. Excipients, ingredients, or a viscosity-reducing agent is added to a low concentration protein agent solution after buffer exchange, but before the concentration step, at a concentration that may be, for example, In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 0.01%, about 0.05%, about 0.1%, about 0.5%, about 1%, or about 5% (w/v).

Excipients, ingredients, or a viscosity-reducing agent are incubated with a therapeutic protein agent in buffer containing excipients for about 0.1 to about 3 hrs. Alternatively, incubation is carried out for about 0.1 to about 12 hrs, or, alternatively, incubation is carried out for about 0.1 to about 24 hrs. Drying of Protein Agent and/or Protein Agent-Containing Viscosity-Reducing Formulations Disclosed herein are methods of reconstituting any of the foregoing powdered formulations comprising adding a sterile diluent to achieve a high protein concentration such as those described herein. In some embodiments, a protein agent and a viscosity-lowering agent is provided in a lyophilized dosage unit, ready for reconstitution with a sterile aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, to yield a concentrated low-viscosity liquid protein agent formulation. An advantage of the present invention is that a high concentration of therapeutic protein agent or a composition comprising a viscosity-reducing agent and a therapeutic protein agent can be dried by lyophilization. Lyophilization, or freeze-drying, allows water to be separated from a composition. A therapeutic protein agent or composition thereof is first frozen and then placed in a high vacuum. In a vacuum, the crystalline water sublimes, leaving behind solely a therapeutic protein agent or a composition thereof, and only tightly bound water molecules. Such processing further stabilizes a composition and allows for easier storage and transportation at typically encountered ambient temperatures. A lyophilized dosage unit is a lyophilized cake of a protein agent, a viscosity-reducing agent, and other excipients, to which water, saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable fluid can be added. By including a viscosity-reducing agent, a lyophilized dosage unit dissolves/reconstitutes faster than one without a viscosity-reducing agent. Spray drying also allows water to be separated out from therapeutic high concentration protein agent formulations. It is highly suited for the continuous production of dry solids in either powder, granulate or agglomerate form from liquid feedstocks as solutions, emulsions, and pumpable suspensions. Spray drying involves the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets and contacting droplets with hot air in a drying chamber. Sprays are produced by either rotary (wheel) or nozzle atomizers. Relatively high temperatures are needed for spray drying operations, however, heat damage to products is generally only slight, because of an evaporative cooling effect during the critical drying period and because the subsequent time of exposure to high temperatures of the dry material may be very short. Powder is discharged continuously from the drying chamber. Operating conditions and dryer design are selected according to the drying characteristics of the product and the powder specification. Spray drying is an ideal process where the end product must comply with precise quality standards regarding particle size distribution, residual moisture content, bulk density and particle shape. Drying of a protein agent or protein agent-containing formulation is especially desirable for a protein agent, which can be dispensed into a single dose sterile container (\"ampule\") or, alternatively, in any desired increment of a single dose. Ampules containing dispensed formulations can then be capped, batch frozen, and lyophilized under sterile conditions. Such sterile containers can be transported throughout the world and stored at ambient temperatures. Such a system is useful for providing sterile vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to remote and under-developed parts of the world. At the point of use, contents of an ampule is rehydrated with a sterile solvent or a buffer of choice and then dispensed to the patient. For such a preparation, minimal or no refrigeration is required.Radiolabeling of Protein Agent In further embodiments of this invention, therapeutic protein agents, specifically whole antibodies, scFv fragments of antibodies, or Fab fragments of antibodies, may be radiolabeled to be used in antibody radiation therapies. In such therapies, for example, radiolabeled anti-cancer antibodies, scFv fragments, Fab antibody fragments, or formulations or compositions comprising such therapeutic protein agents, can be delivered to the site of cancer. After delivery, a protein agent binds to targeted cancer antigens and consequently delivers radioisotopes directly to cancerous cells or tumors. The release of a protein agent may be timed according to this invention. Alternatively, when using crosslinked antibodies in radiation therapies, the crosslinkers themselves may be radiolabeled. In some embodiments, whole antibodies or antibody fragments that are crosslinked serve to target and deliver radioisotopes to cancerous cells. Radioisotopes are carried and released by the crosslinkers. In some would limit a radiolabel to 131I, 90Y, or any other radiolabels defined by a short half-life. For example, the monoclonal antibody Rituximab (see Example 1) has been labeled with 90Yttrium (90Y), in order to be used for radioimmunotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.Kits and Articles of Manufacture Described herein are kits which comprise one or more of a protein agent formulation described herein, packaged in a manner which facilitates use for administration to subjects.

Such kits may comprise a container and, optionally, instructions for use. Protein agents in a kit may be labelled with a detectable label. Methods for detecting target antigens in a sample, such as blood, tumors, cells, or tissue samples, may be carried out by mixing a sample with a therapeutic protein agent according to this invention, and then determining whether a sample binds to an antibody or antibody fragment.

A high concentration, low-viscosity solution of a therapeutic protein has advantageously improved patient compliance and convenience. Furthermore, because of an increased bioavailability and an increased stability of a protein agent in a low-viscosity, high protein agent concentration formulation, more stable blood levels of an administered therapeutic protein agent can be achieved, potentially with lower dosages. Also, the slow and constant release capabilities afforded by the present invention advantageously permit reduced dosages, due to more efficient delivery of an active therapeutic protein agent. Significant cost savings may be achieved by using high concentration, low-viscosity therapeutic protein agents formulations described herein.Dosing A dosage regimen involved in a method for treating a condition described herein will be determined by an attending physician, taking into account various factors which modify the action of drugs, including age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of a patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors.

In some embodiments, amounts of a therapeutic protein agent, or formulations or compositions comprising a high concentration protein agent, which provides a single dosage, will vary depending upon a particular mode of administration, a specific high protein agent concentration preparation, formulation or composition, dose level and dose frequency. In some embodiments, a protein agent preparation can contain, agent (w/w). In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 0.01%, about 0.1%, about 1%, about 10%, about 20%, or about 30% (w/w).

A protein agent which currently requires multiple administrations on the same day (either at the same time or at different times of the day) may be administered in fewer injections per day. In some instances, the frequency may be reduced to a single injection once per day. Also, a viscosity-reducing agent in a high protein agent concentration formulation may allow for greater flexibility in dosing including a decreased dosing frequency compared to a protein formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent.

In some embodiments, a frequency of dosing will take into account pharmacokinetic parameters of a therapeutic protein agent. In some embodiments, a clinician will administer a formulation until a dosage is reached that achieves a desired effect. In some embodiments, a formulation can therefore be administered in an amount that may be, for example, at least as a single dose, two doses, three doses, four doses, or more. In some embodiments, the dose may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about one dose or about two doses. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 100 doses, about 200 doses, about 250 doses, about 500 doses, or about 1000 doses.

In some embodiments, doses, which may or may not contain the same amount of desired molecules, may be distributed over time or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. A formulation may also be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, pen delivery devices as well as autoinjector delivery devices, have applications in delivering a pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention. Further refinement of an appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. In certain embodiments, an appropriate dosage can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data, which can be obtained by methods that are well known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, a formulation is generally administered parenterally, e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or via aerosol (intrapulmonary or administration). In some embodiments, a formulation is administered intravenously by an initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. In some embodiments, a formulation is administered as a one-time dose. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily optimize effective dosages and administration regimens as determined by good medical practice and clinical condition of an individual patient. Frequency of dosing will depend on pharmacokinetic parameters of a protein agent and a chosen route of administration. An optimal pharmaceutical formulation will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon a chosen route of administration and desired dosage. See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18042) pages 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Such a formulation may influence a physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of an administered protein agent. Depending on route of administration, a suitable dose may be calculated according to body weight, body surface area or organ size. Further refinement of calculations necessary to determine an appropriate dosage for treatment involving protein agent formulations is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation, especially in light of dosage information and assays disclosed herein, as well as pharmacokinetic data observed in human clinical trials. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of established assays for determining blood level dosages in conjunction with appropriate dose-response data. Final dosage regimens will be determined by an attending physician, considering various factors which modify the action of drugs, e.g. a drug's specific activity, severity of damage and responsiveness of a patient, age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of a patient, severity of any infection, time of administration, and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for various diseases and conditions. Dosage of a high concentration protein agent formulation containing a viscosity-reducing agent is designed in such a way that injections cause no significant signs of irritation at a site of injection, and a primary irritation index is less than 3 when evaluated using a Draize scoring system.

In some embodiments, injections of a protein agent formulation cause macroscopically similar levels of irritation when compared to injections of equivalent volumes of a control saline solution. A viscosity-reducing formulation can be provided as a solution or in a dosage unit form wherein a protein agent is lyophilized in one vial, with or without a viscosity-reducing agent and other excipients, and a solvent, with or without a viscosity-reducing agent and other excipients, is provided in a second vial. In some embodiments, a solvent is added to a protein agent shortly before or at the time of injection to ensure uniform mixing and dissolution. According to this invention, any individual, including humans, animals and plants, may be treated in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner with a pharmaceutically effective amount of a therapeutic protein agent, or a formulation comprising thereof, for a period of time sufficient to treat a condition or conditions in an individual to whom the protein agent formulation is administered over some period of time. Alternatively, individuals may receive a prophylactically effective amount of therapeutic protein agent or a formulation thereof, which is effective to treat or prevent a condition or conditions in an individual to whom it is administered over some period of time. Upon improvement of an individual's condition, maintenance doses of a therapeutic protein agent, including whole antibodies, single-chain Fv antibody fragments, Fab antibody fragments, or a formulation or composition comprising such a protein agent with a viscosity-reducing agent, may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, a dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of symptoms, to a level at which an improved condition is retained. When a condition or conditions have been alleviated to a desired level, treatment should cease. An individuals may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of a condition, conditions, or symptoms thereof. Effective modes of administration and accompanying dosing regimens of a therapeutic protein agent, or formulations or compositions comprising a high concentration of protein agent with low viscosity, will depend on a desired effect, previous therapy (if any), an individual's health status, status of a condition or conditions, response to a therapeutic protein agent formulations, and judgment of a treating physician or clinician. A therapeutic protein agent formulation may be administered in any dosage form acceptable for pharmaceuticals, immunotherapy, or veterinary preparations, at one time or over a series of treatments.Enteral Routes of Administration A low-viscosity protein agent formulation comprising a high concentration protein agent may be delivered to humans, animals, or plants at a desired site of delivery according to this invention. In some embodiments, such delivery may include use of devices, such as implant-capable devices, or may involve other microparticulate protein delivery systems. Such systems may allow for slow or controlled release of a protein agent in the subject. In some embodiments, a protein agent may be formulated in the presence of plasticizers, which aim to enhance preservation of a native, biologically active, tertiary structure of a protein agent. In some embodiments, a plasticizer also creates reservoirs which can allow for slow release of active whole antibodies, or fragments thereof, to a subject where and when they are needed. A biologically active protein agent, including whole antibodies or fragments thereof, is subsequently released in a controlled manner over a period of time as determined by a particular encapsulation technique, polymer constitution, solubility, and presence and nature of any excipients used. Formulations and compositions comprising a high concentration, low-viscosity protein agent in a polymeric delivery carrier may also comprise any conventional carrier or adjuvant used in vaccines, pharmaceuticals, personal care formulations and compositions, veterinary preparations, or oral enzyme supplementations. In some embodiments, a carrier ca include Freund's adjuvant, an ion exchanger, aluminum stearate, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes (e.g. protamine and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.1 mL to about 2 mL. In some embodiments, the range may be about 0.1 mL to about 1 mL. A reduced-viscosity protein agent formulation has improved injectability and requires less injection force compared to an analogous control formulation without a viscosity-reducing agent (e.g., in phosphate buffer alone) under otherwise same conditions. In some embodiments, the force of injection may be, for example, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or even than 50% less than the analogous control protein agent formulation without viscosity-reducing agents. In some embodiments, the percentage decrease in injection force once viscosity-reducing agents are incorporated maybe be within a range bound by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, or about 25% less force than the control formulation upon injection. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, or about 50% less force than the control formulation upon injection. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 60% decrease in injection force. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 55% decrease in injection force. In some embodiments, the range may be about 10% to about 50% decrease in injection force. In some embodiments, the range may be about 15% to about 50% decrease in injection force. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20% to about 50% decrease in injection force. In some embodiments, the range may be about 25% to about 50% decrease in injection force.

In some embodiments, the range may be about 45% to about 50% decrease in injection force as compared to standard control formulations without the viscosity-reducing agent(s) but otherwise under the same injection conditions. In some embodiments, a protein agent formulation possesses \"Newtonian flow characteristics,\" defined as having a viscosity that is substantially independent of shear rate. A protein agent formulations can be readily injected through a needle of about 22-32 gauge. In some embodiments, an injection is administered via a 27 gauge needle and the injection force is less than 30 N. A formulation can be administered, in most cases, using a very small gauge needle, for example, between 27 and 31 gauge, preferably 29 gauge and more preferably 31 gauge needle. To increase drug delivery efficiency, patient compliance, and to ease a procedure of administration of a protein agent formulation by a healthcare provider, a variety of syringes are available on the market. In some embodiments, a syringe can include some embodiments, a protein agent formulation can be pre-heated just before a drug administration procedure using a syringe heater or a pre-heated syringe that is heated in a separate warming unit prior to filling a syringe. In some embodiments, a protein agent formulation, including a reconstituted formulation, can be administered using a heated and/or self-mixing syringe or autoinjector. A protein agent formulation can also be pre-heated in a separate warming unit prior to filling a syringe. A syringe heater is a device which often contains one or more slots for holding a syringe filled with a protein agent formulation, and a controlling system to heat, monitor and maintain a temperature range of a formulation-filled syringe at a given specific temperature range. In some embodiments, a syringe heater can be a separate device where a syringe containing a protein agent formulation is heated, or it can be a built-in device in which a syringe itself contains an integrated heater. In some embodiments, a syringe heater that can be used for any can include pre-filled syringes, retractable syringes, needleless syringes of variable sizes, and combinations thereof. The disadvantage of a separate heating device over a built-in heating device is that once a syringe is heated and taken out, heat dissipates to the environment. An appropriate syringe heater or syringe heater tape device can be obtained from GDPGlobal\u00ae precision dispensing systems, Watlow Electric Manufacturing Co., and many others. A stage heater, or heating block of in-line perfusion (Single in-line or multiple in-line) can be procured from Warner Instruments. Any of the heaters described herein are capable of heating a protein agent formulation from ambient temperature to about 90\u00b0 C. as a higher range, or a further high range of 185\u00b0 C. Examples of syringe heaters include SW-60, SW-61, SH-27B, SF-28 model supplied by Warner Instruments. A heated syringe maintains a therapeutic protein agent formulation at a set temperature with precision of \u00b11\u00b0 C., \u00b13\u00b0 C. or up to \u00b15\u00b0 C. from a set temperature. Depending on stability of a liquid protein agent formulation, a heated syringe can maintain a temperature of about 40\u00b0 C., 50\u00b0 C., or 80\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, a temperature of a therapeutic protein agent formulation is maintained at a value that may be, for example, at least 20\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C., 30\u00b0 C., 35\u00b0 C., 40\u00b0 C., or more. In some embodiments, the amount may be within a range bounded by a lower limit and an upper limit, the upper limit being larger than the lower limit. In some embodiments, the lower limit may be about 20\u00b0 C., about 25\u00b0 C., about 30\u00b0 C., or about 35\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the upper limit may be about about 40\u00b0 C., about 45\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C., about 55\u00b0 C., about 60\u00b0 C., about 65\u00b0 C., about 70\u00b0 C., about 75\u00b0 C., or about 80\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 80\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 40\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 20\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the range may be about 25\u00b0 C. to about 40\u00b0 C. This allows a protein agent formulation in a heated syringe to be maintained at a temperature close to body temperature, thereby reducing patient discomfort and also helping to reduce viscosity of a drug formulation, which enables easy injection of fluids with less effort, causing less pain at a site of injection.Self-Mixing Syringes: In some embodiments, a self-mixing syringe may be used for reconstitution and administration of a high concentration, low viscosity protein agent formulation, which helps a patient by reducing an inconvenience of visiting a healthcare center. A self-mixing device consists of two or more chambers. In a two chamber self-mixing system, a first component is a fluid (BFWI, saline etc.) and a second component includes a lyophilized drug, or in this case, more specifically, a protein agent. Various mechanisms are present for mixing of two contents at a controlled rate and under sterile conditions to achieve a final injection solution. Application of axial pressure on a vial causes mixing of the contents of the two components. Mixing of the contents in two chambers can be done by using a static mixer or a dynamic mixer. Merlin Packaging Technologies offers micro-sized static mixers for controlled dispensing and minimal waste of the formulations.Pre-Filled Syringes: In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein agent in a liquid or lyophilized formulation may be administered in a pre-filled syringe. In Humira\u00ae thereof. In some embodiments, a pre-filled syringe include an syringe, and a syringes a wearable device. In some embodiments, a protein agent formulation can be administered using a retractable syringe which can be automatically or manually retracted. In a manually operated syringe, after dispensing a drug, a plunger is pulled back until an obvious stop is felt. This will pull the needle into the barrel of a syringe and then the plunger is disassembled. This technology is mainly used to prevent viral contamination and accidental needlesticks during administration. In some embodiments, a retractable syringes is selected from the group consisting Safety Syrine from Life-Shield Products, Inc, and combinations thereof. A biological therapeutic protein agent formulation is more often than not, a viscous solution that is mostly administered subcutaneously and at at high doses, requiring more than 1 mL of fluid per dose. Administration of such a high volume requires expertise in the field and also often necessitates a patient visit to a healthcare center solely for drug therapy, decreasing patient compliance and satisfaction. For such a bolus injection, which requires a relatively large volume of drug to be administered, wearable injection devices are available on the market. These devices contain a pre-programmed unit which delivers a set volume of drug at a controlled rate and duration. In some embodiments, a wearable injection device can include Precision-Therapy Autoinjection wearable devices contain a syringe which when operated causes a syringe to move forward to project a needle, aiding in administration of a therapeutic agent into a patient's body. Autoinjection wearable devices are typically designed for self-administration of a therapeutic formulation by untrained personnel.Needleless Syringes: Delivery of a substance into the body of a mammal or other suitable recipient, which does not involve using a sharp needle for injection, is made possible through needleless injection devices. This device contains a drug chamber pre-filled with drug, a nozzle with an orifice that serves as a skin contacting surface and a pressure source, and compressed gas to propel the drug through the orifice at a very high speed (Tejaswi R. Kale and Munira Momin., Inov Pharm. Article 148). Different types of needleless syringes can include powder injections, liquid injections and depot or projectile injections. In some embodiments, a needleless liquid injection device can include Jetinjector Powder and depot-based needleless systems are available as Powderject system from Powderject Pharmaceuticals and Depixol\u00ae Depo Injection from Lundbeck Limited respectively. Needless syringes are used for administering formulations though IM, SC, and ID routes, and involve the use of spring, laser power, or energy propelled (e.g. Lorentz force, air force and shock waves) forces for injecting a protein agent drug into a patient's body as described by Ravi. et. al. (Ravi. et. al, Int. some embodiments, commercially-available, needle-free injection devices or systems that can be used to administer a high protein agent concentration, low viscosity formulation can include inter alia, Intraject\u00ae (Weston Medical, Ltd.), Biojector2000\u00ae (Bioject, Inc.), MadaJet\u00ae (MADA Medical Products, Inc.), and J-Tip\u00ae (National Medical Products, LectraJet\u00ae (DCI, injector (Avant Drug Delivery Systems, Inc.), and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the present invention may utilize a slow release methodology, such as a silicon based ring or a rod which has been preloaded with a therapeutic protein agent formulations, and can therefore act as an implants for delivery. Such a methodology provides a constant level of therapeutic protein agent to the bloodstream over a period of weeks or months. Such implants can be inserted intra-dermally and can be safely replaced and removed when needed.Therapeutic Uses Disclosed herein are methods of reducing pain at an injection site of a therapeutic protein agent in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administration of a liquid therapeutic formulation by injection, wherein a liquid formulation comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic protein agent, wherein a formulations further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable viscosity-reducing agent or an aggregation-reducing agent selected from groups mentioned wherein a pharmaceutically acceptable viscosity-reducing agent or aggregation-inducing agent is added to a formulation in a viscosity-reducing amount; and wherein a mammal experiences less pain with administration of a therapeutic protein agent formulation containing a viscosity-reducing agents or an aggregation-reducing agent in comparison to a protein formulation without such agents.

The excipient containing HGG was concentrated to a final volume of less than 150 L using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The collected protein sample was stored at 4\u00b0 C. O/N. The collected HGG sample was divided into two fractions. One fraction was used as excipient, nicotinic acid (acid form) containing sample; the other fraction was dialysed extensively against 25 mM histidine buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr with three changes to remove viscosity-reducing agent, nicotinic acid (acid form) and concentrated using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators as described above. All three samples, the HGG sample without any nicotinic acid (acid form) (control); the HGG sample containing nicotinic acid dialysed HGG sample where the viscosity-reducing agent had been removed) were then processed for estimating the protein and viscosity. The final concentration of HGG in solution was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a UV visible spectrophotometer against the histidine buffer containing viscosity-reducing agent alone (which does not contain any HGG) for measuring the protein concentration in excipient containing sample; and for HGG without any excipient, buffer alone (without any excipient) was used as a blank to determine the protein concentration.

The data in Table 21 demonstrate the viscosity reducing effect of viscosity-reducing agent nicotinic acid (acid form). But, on removal of nicotinic acid (acid form), the viscosity-reducing agent, the viscosity increased. Furthermore, upon removal of nicotinic acid (acid form), HGG solution viscosity returned to approximately the same level as the original solution, suggesting that nicotinic acid (acid form) is the one which reduces viscosity and does not modify or damage the protein, HGG.

The viscosities of the solution were measured either using a Cambridge Viscometer, VISCOlab5000 using 704, of sample at 25\u00b0 C. or using a DV2T cone and plate viscometer using 1.5 mL of sample at 25\u00b0 C. at extrapolated zero shear rate.Results The data in Table 23 demonstrate the viscosity reducing effect of nicotinic acid (acid form), nicotinic acid sodium salt, nicotinamide, thiamine.HCl and caffeine on Human gamma globulin (GLOBUCEL\u00ae) in either phosphate or citrate or histidine buffer. The data in The present example describes the effect of various combinations of organic molecules and their effect on the viscosity of aqueous solutions of Human Gamma Globulin.Materials and Methods Commercially obtained human gamma globulin (HGG), GLOBUCEL\u00ae (50 mg/mL) containing pharmaceutical excipients (Maltose) was dialyzed against water for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. To the aqueous solution of HGG, phosphate/citrate/histidine buffer was added from the stock concentration of 1000 mM phosphate/citrate/histidine buffer, pH 6.0 to get a final concentration of 25 mM. To the buffered HGG different organic molecules in combination were added and mixed until complete dissolution. The excipient containing HGG was concentrated to a final volume of less than 150 L using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The collected protein sample was stored at 4\u00b0 C. O/N. The final concentration of HGG in solution was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a UV visible spectrophotometer against the phosphate/citrate/histidine containing viscosity-reducing agents alone (which does not contain any HGG) for measuring the protein concentration in excipient containing sample; and for HGG without any excipients, buffer alone (without any excipients) was used as a blank to determine the protein concentration. Reported protein concentrations represent the range of all protein samples in each Table or Figure. Specifically, reported values are the median plus or minus half the range. The protein concentrations were experimentally determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.4 at 280 nm.

The viscosities at 25\u00b0 C. and pH 6.0 are reported in Table 11 as extrapolated zero-shear viscosities from cone and plate viscometer measurements and as absolute viscosities measured with a ViscoLab viscometer. The cone and plate measurements used a DV2T cone and plate viscometer (Brookfield) equipped with a CPE40 spindle measured at multiple shear rates between 2 and 400 s1. An extrapolated zero-shear viscosity was determined from a plot of absolute viscosity versus shear rate. For measuring absolute viscosity, viscometer ViscoLab 5000 equipped with a piston covering the range from 5-100 cP was used and for viscosities above 100 cP, ViscoLab 4000 equipped with a piston covering the range 50-1000 cP was used.Results The data in Table 26 demonstrate that absolute viscosities from the ViscoLab viscometer can be directly compared to extrapolated zero-shear viscosities determined from a cone and plate viscometer. In order to compare a broad range of protein agent concentrations and presence of a number of viscosity-reducing agents, aqueous solutions of a model antibody, human gamma globulin, were prepared with and without viscosity-reducing agents such as nicotinamide, tryptophan and thiamine. The viscosities were measured as described above at protein concentrations ranging from 192 to 243 mg/mL.

The magnitude of viscosity-reducing effects afforded by the addition of viscosity-reducing agents, nicotinic acid (acid form) and tryptophan, to the phosphate buffer was 34.4-fold at 225\u00b110 mg/mL. Biophysical characterization of formulated solution with viscosity-reducing agents, tryptophan and nicotinic acid (acid form), was carried out over a three month period. Samples of Bevacizumab were prepared as described above. The data in Table 37 demonstrate that the monomer content of concentrated solutions of Bevacizumab at 225 mg/mL as determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (Phenomenex BioSEP SEC-S2000 (7.8 mm\u00d730 cm; 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 0.1M sodium chloride; flow rate 0.5 mL/min; isocratic) is similar to the drug product at all time points and no detectable aggregation or degradation is observed after storage for three months at 4\u00b0 C.

The present example describes the effect of the combination of viscosity-reducing and aggregation-reducing agents, nicotinic acid (acid form) and tryptophan on aggregation of Human Gamma Globulin and Rituximab in aqueous solutions.Materials and Methods Commercially obtained antibodies, human gamma globulin (HGG), GLOBUCEL\u00ae (50 mg/mL) containing pharmaceutical excipients (Maltose) and mg 50 mg/mL Rituximab, mg/mL sodium chloride, 80, USP) were dialyzed either against water (HGG) or against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (rituximab) for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. To the aqueous solution of HGG (in water), histidine buffer was added from the stock concentration of 1000 mM histidine buffer, pH 6.0 to get a final concentration of 25 mM. To the buffered antibody solutions, different aggregation reducing-agents were added individually or in combination and mixed until complete dissolution. The excipient-containing antibody solutions and antibody in buffer alone (without excipients) were concentrated to a final volume of less than 150 L using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The collected protein sample was stored at 4\u00b0 C. O/N. The final concentration of protein (antibody) in solution was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a UV visible spectrophotometer against the histidine containing aggregation-reducing agent (which does not contain any HGG or rituximab) for measuring the protein concentration in excipient containing sample; and for antibody without any excipient, buffer alone (without any excipient) was used as a blank to determine the protein concentration. The protein concentrations were experimentally determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.4 at 280 nm. Percent reduction in aggregation of formulated HGG and rituximab in aqueous solution with aggregation-reducing agents, tryptophan and nicotinic acid (acid form), was carried out at different time points. Samples of HGG and rituximab were prepared as described above. The data in Table 39 demonstrate the percent reduction in aggregation of HGG and rituximab at 250-275 mg/mL BioSEP SEC S2000 (7.8 mm\u00d730 cm; 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 0.1M sodium chloride; flow rate 0.5 mL/min; isocratic). The amount of reduction in aggregation is calculated setting the values at 0 time point equal to 100% in control (without any aggregation-reducing agent) and the reduction in aggregation in test samples (with aggregation-reducing agent) is expressed as percent reduction when compared to control at 0 time point.Results The data in Table 39 demonstrate that nicotinic acid (acid form) and tryptophan in combination reduced the amount of aggregation in the high concentration formulations of both HGG and rituximab when compared to the control without any aggregation-reducing agent. The amount of aggregated species remaining after 48 hours is almost 0 when compared to the control (buffer alone without any aggregation-reducing agent). The amount of aggregated species in the initial sample before adding aggregation-reducing agents was 3 to 10% in HGG and 1 to 5% in rituximab samples (these values are considered as 100%). The data in Table 39 show the percent reduction in aggregation of HGG and Rituximab over a time period of 24-48 hours. The present example describes an exemplary protein agent formulation containing viscosity-reducing agents nicotinic and (acid form) and tryptophan plus added excipients, and the effect of these additives on solutions of a wide span of protein agents.

To the aqueous solution of HGG, phosphate buffer was added from the stock concentration of 1000 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 to get a final concentration of 25 mM. Commercially obtained Trastuzumab, HERCEPTIN\u00ae (lyophilized powder contains 440 mg Trastuzumab, 9.9 mg of L-Histidine.HCl, 6.4 mg of L-Histidine, 400 mg of a,a,-trehalose dihydrate, and 1.8 mg polysorbate 20, USP; and 20 mL of water for injection for reconstitution) was dialyzed against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. Commercially obtained Rituximab, RITUXAN\u00ae, 500 mg in 50 mL (10 mg/mL Rituximab, mg/mL sodium chloride, mg/mL polysorbate 80, USP) was dialyzed against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. Commercially obtained Bevacizumab, AVASTIN\u00ae, 400 mg in 16 mL (100 mg/4 mL Bevacizumab, 240 mg/4 mL Trehalose sodium dibasic, mg/4 mL polysorbate 20, USP) was dialyzed against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. Commercially obtained Cetuximab, ERBITUX\u00ae, 100 mg in 50 mL (2 mg/l mL Cetuximab, 8.48 mg/l mL sodium sodium phosphate dibasic, heptahydrate) was dialyzed against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. Commercially obtained Etanercept, ENBREL\u00ae, 25 mg as a lyophilized powder (25 mg Etanercept, 40 mg mannitol, 10 mg sucrose, and 1.2 mg Tromethamine and for reconstitution 0.9% benzyl alcohol in water) was dialyzed against 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. To the dialysed samples of above protein agents, a combination of viscosity-reducing agents nicotinic acid (acid form) and tryptophan were added and mixed until complete dissolution. The excipient-containing samples as described above were concentrated to a final volume of less than 150 L using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The collected protein samples were stored at 4\u00b0 C. O/N. The final concentration of proteins in each solutions were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a UV visible spectrophotometer against the phosphate buffer containing viscosity-reducing agent alone (which does not contain any protein) for measuring the protein concentration in excipient containing sample; and for protein without any excipient, buffer alone (without any excipient) was used as a blank to determine the protein concentration. Reported protein concentrations represent the range of all protein samples in each Table or Figure. Specifically, reported values are the median plus or minus half the range. The protein concentrations were experimentally determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.4 for HGG; 1.48 for Trastuzumab; 1.7 for Rituximab; 1.54 for Bevacizumab; 1.4 for Cetuximab; 1.4 for Infliximab and 0.96 for Etanercept at 280 nm. The viscosities of the solution were measured either using a Cambridge Viscometer, VISCOlab5000 using 704, of sample at 25\u00b0 C. or using a DV2T cone and plate viscometer using 1.5 mL of sample at 25\u00b0 C. at extrapolated zero shear rate.Results The data in Table 40 demonstrate the viscosity reducing effect of a combination of viscosity-reducing agents nicotinic acid (acid form) and tryptophan on an array of different proteins such as human gamma globulin, monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Bevacizumab, Cetuximab and a fusion protein like Etanercept. The combination formulation can lower the viscosity not only of monoclonal antibodies but also of other proteins like fusion proteins at very high concentrations, and is thus can be applied to a wide span of protein agents. The present example describes the effect of viscosity-reducing agents on tonicity of Human Gamma Globulin aqueous solutions.Materials and Methods Commercially obtained human gamma globulin (HGG), GLOBUCEL\u00ae (50 mg/mL) containing pharmaceutical excipients (Maltose) was dialyzed against water for 24 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with three changes. To the aqueous solution of HGG, phosphate buffer was added from the stock concentration of 1000 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 to get a final concentration of 25 mM. To the buffered HGG different viscosity-reducing agent(s) was added individually or in combination and mixed until complete dissolution. The excipient containing HGG was concentrated to a final volume of less than 150 L using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The collected protein sample was stored at 4\u00b0 C. O/N. The final concentration of HGG in solution was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a UV visible spectrophotometer against the phosphate containing viscosity-reducing agents alone (which does not contain any HGG). Reported protein concentrations represent the range of all protein samples in each Table or Figure. Specifically, reported values are the median plus or minus half the range.
