Chinese medicine can help. COVID-19, its official name, is a type of virus called a Coronavirus. There are many types of virus and each can attack the body in different ways. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that was first seen in humans in Wuhan, China. It has since been diagnosed in countries across the globe and is expanding. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization officially labeled it a pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is recommending that we take precautions as they are confident that it will spread across the country. It is not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\" COVID-19 has caused deaths. However, in America, the likelihood of death from this virus is fairly low. According to the CDC, the two populations at risk are the elderly/immunocompromised and healthcare workers.COVID-19 causes a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may occur anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure. Many people who are exposed to the virus may not even show symptoms. Others will experience a nasty chest cold. Currently, there is no specific Western treatment or vaccine. The treatment is \"supportive and symptomatic.\" Chinese medicine can help the chances of either preventing or treating COVID-19. Because Chinese medicine (TCM) sees colds and infections differently than Western, it treats them with a different level of success. Remember, COVID-19 is a type of viral infection, like the flu, herpes or even the common cold. Many of my clients know that I can \"kick\" a cold within two days, and many others understand that one of the benefits of acupuncture on a regular basis is the strengthened immune system that they enjoy. Anyone who has been treated for a cold with TCM can attest to this. Although you should avoid crowds if you feel you have any sort of infection, having acupuncture before you get sick or in the very early phase can significantly decrease the chances of a cold worsening. The other thing that I am strongly recommending to my clients is that they begin taking an Echinacea complex immediately to boost their immune system. Here at the Spa we carry Xenoforce, which is an excellent choice. Come in today before you get sick and allow Chinese medicine to strengthen you and reduce your chances of getting ill. "}
