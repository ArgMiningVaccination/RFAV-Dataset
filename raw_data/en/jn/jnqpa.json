The setting of global standards isrequested in Article 2 of the WHO Constitution, which cites as one of the Organization's functions that it should \"develop, establish and promote inter-national standards with respect to food, biological, pharmaceutical and similarproducts.\" Every government allocates a substantial proportion of its total health budget to medicines. This proportion tends to be greatest in developing countries, where it may exceed 40%. Without assurance that these medicines are relevant to priority health needs and that they meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efcacy, any healthservice is evidently compromised. In developing countries considerable admin-istrative and technical effort is directed to ensuring that patients receive effectivemedicines of good quality. It is crucial to the objective of health for all that a reli-able system of medicines control be brought within the reach of every country. The supply of essential medicines of good quality was identied as one of the prerequisites for the delivery of health care at the International Conferenceon Primary Health Care in Alma-Ata in 1978. Similarly, the Conference ofExperts on the Rational Use of Drugs, held in Nairobi in 1985, and WHO'sRevised Drug Strategy, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 1986,identied the effective functioning of national drug regulation and controlsystems as the only means to assure safety and quality of medicines. Yet theWorld Health Assembly continues to express great concern about the quality,safety and efcacy of medicines, particularly those products or active pharma-ceutical substances imported into, or produced in, developing countries. Inrecent years counterfeit products have inltrated certain markets in disquietingproportions. Since the founding of WHO, the World Health Assembly hasadopted many resolutions requesting the Organization to develop internationalstandards, recommendations and instruments to assure the quality of medicines,whether produced and traded nationally or internationally. In response to these resolutions, the WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations, which was originally created toprepare The International Pharmacopoeia , has made numerous recommenda- tions relevant to quality assurance and control. Most of these recommendations,QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 1even though they were made several years ago, are still valid. Thus far, however, most have been available only as separate sets of recommendations containedin annexes to various WHO Technical Reports . The recommendations are essen- tial to all concerned with the quality assurance of medicines, but separate publications over a period of years has made it difcult to recognize them ascomplementary parts of a comprehensive system of quality assurance. To provide easy access to this information, the appropriate annexes and updates are reproduced in the volumes of this publication. They are supple-mented with other material relevant to the quality assurance of pharmaceuti-cals, some already issued in the form of WHO documents. The information ispresented in logical sequence as a series of administrative instruments and tech-nical elements of an overall quality assurance system. Readers should bear inmind that, in certain previously published texts, reference is made to WHOguidelines and other documents that have since been updated. Some of theseupdated texts are themselves included in the compendium. Volume 1 of Quality assurance of pharmaceuticals: a compendium of guide- lines and related materials was published by WHO in 1997. Material relating to national drug regulations, product assessment and registration, The International Pharmacopoeia and related activities, quality control laboratories, international trade in pharmaceuticals and their distribution, counterfeit products, basic testsfor pharmaceutical products and training of technical personnel is collected andreproduced in Volume 1. Volume 2, rst published by WHO in 1999, repro-duces guidelines related to good manufacturing practices (GMP) and to theinspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug distribution channels.This volume was updated in 2004, and the current version constitutes thesecond updated edition of Volume 2 including new texts and revisions adoptedto date as WHO guidelines. Both for manufacturers and at national level, GMP are an important part of a comprehensive system of quality assurance. They also represent the tech-nical standard upon which is based the WHO Certication Scheme on theQuality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce. Therst GMP text published by WHO was developed during 1967-69 uponrequest by WHO's Member States and was revised in 1975. In the 1980s andearly 1990s, several national and regional drug regulatory authorities issued orrevised guidelines reflecting the ongoing elaboration of the concept of GMP . Inaddition, the WHO Certication Scheme on the Quality of PharmaceuticalProducts Moving in International Commerce was extended in 1988. Together,these developments necessitated an update of the existing guidelines on GMPpublished by WHO. Revised and expanded GMP guidelines were prepared during 1989-90, approved by the WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceuti-cal Preparations in late 1990 and subsequently published by WHO. At thattime, Part One of these revised and expanded guidelines set out the philosophyand essential elements of GMP; Part Two dealt with good practices in produc-QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 2tion and quality control. These two parts together represented the \"core\" of the GMP guidelines published by WHO. Their provisions were and still are fully consonant with those of other inter- nationally recognized texts on GMP . GMP guidelines published by WHO areto be regarded as advisory in nature and may need to be adapted to addressspecic conditions in individual countries. However, if any departures from recommended practices are introduced, the equivalence of such alternativeapproaches should be validated. In 1996, GMP guidelines were published by WHO for the validation of manufacturing processes. These guidelines were prepared to explain andpromote the concept of validation embedded in the core GMP texts, and toassist in establishing priorities and selecting approaches when a validation pro-gramme is being developed. In 1997, the WHO Expert Committee on Speci-cations for Pharmaceutical Preparations approved an explanatory text on therole and functions of the \"authorized person\" at manufacturing establishmentsin the medicines industry. The core GMP guidelines dene the authorizedperson as the person responsible for the release of batches of nished productsfor sale. The explanatory text is intended to assist manufacturers wishing tostrengthen their quality assurance systems. These concepts were integrated inits revised text in 2003. The guidance on validation has been extensively revisedand expanded. The new text has been adopted in 2005 and is now included inits revised form. GMP guidelines published by WHO in 1992-2006 constitute in the rst instalment an ongoing series of applications of the principles of GMP to variousspecialized areas. The series of the \"main\" GMP texts on the manufacture ofpharmaceutical active substances and excipients, were approved by the WHOExpert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations in 1992,1997, and therafter. Chapter 1 (\"Main principles for pharmaceutical products\") includes the core GMP guidelines, as well as GMP guidance texts for the heating, ventila-tion and air-conditioning systems; validation; and water for pharmaceutical usein their updated forms. The two texts in Chapter 2 constitute the existing body of GMP guidance for pharmaceutical starting materials. As strict application of full GMP is notalways practical or necessary for such materials, these texts outline the proce-dures and practices that manufacturers should employ to ensure that themethods, facilities and controls used for their production are operated ormanaged so that pharmaceutical starting materials have the quality and purityappropriate for use in nished pharmaceutical products. On the other hand, certain specic kinds of pharmaceutical products demand practices or procedures not described in the core GMP guidelines. Forexample, section 17 in Part Three of the 1992 guidelines, updated in 2002 (tobe found in Chapter 3) stresses additional points necessary to minimize the risksof microbiological, particulate and pyrogen contamination in sterile pharma-INTRODUCTION 3QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 3ceutical products. Other specialized GMP guidelines were subsequently published by WHO for biological products, investigational pharmaceuticalproducts, herbal medicinal products, radiopharmaceuticals, etc. The GMP guidelines for biological products have been approved by both the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization and the WHOExpert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Unlikeconventional pharmaceutical products which are normally produced and con-trolled by means of reproducible chemical and physical techniques, biologicalproducts are manufactured with biological materials and processes, such as thecultivation of cells or the extraction of materials from living organisms. As suchmaterials and processes display inherent variability, the range and nature of man-ufacturing by-products in biological products are likewise variable. For suchproducts, including allergens, antigens, vaccines, hormones, cytokines, enzymes,human whole-blood and plasma derivatives, immune sera, immunoglobulins,products of fermentation and diagnostic agents for in vitro use, full adherenceto the GMP guidelines for biological products is recommended for all produc-tion steps, including those from which active ingredients are produced. The GMP guidelines for the manufacture of investigational pharmaceutical products for clinical trials in humans supplement both the core GMP guide-lines for pharmaceutical products and \"Guidelines for good clinical practice(GCP) for trials on pharmaceutical products\" (WHO Technical Report Series,No. 850, 1995, pp. 97-137). These specialized GMP guidelines specicallyaddress those manufacturing practices that may be different for investigationalproducts (which are not usually manufactured in accordance with a set routine),and which may be incompletely characterized during the initial stages of clinical development. The specialized GMP guidelines for the manufacture of herbal medicinal products address the manufacture of products from material of plant origin,which may be subject to contamination and deterioration and vary in its com-position and properties. Furthermore, in the manufacture and quality controlof herbal medicinal products, procedures and techniques are often used that aresubstantially different from those employed for conventional pharmaceuticalproducts. The newly revised text was adopted by the Expert Committee in 2005(WHO Technical Report Series, No. 937, 2006, pp. 85-116). The text on radiopharmaceuticals has been developed in close collabora- tion with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The text coversradiopharmaceutical products that are prepared in hospital radiopharmacies,centralized radiopharmacies, nuclear centres and insititutes or by industrialmanufacturers, as well as in positron emission tomography (PET) centres. These ve sets of specialized guidelines\u2014for sterile, biological, investiga- tional and herbal products and for radiopharmaceuticals\u2014are reproduced inChapter 3 (Specic pharmaceutical products). Inspection is closely related to other elements of the overall medicines quality assurance system: GMP , licensing of manufacturing facilities, productQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 4QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 4registration, etc. Without a competent inspectorate operating to high profes- sional standards, neither GMP compliance nor licensing provisions can be effec-tively enforced. In addition, inspection of manufacturing facilities is pivotal tothe operation of the WHO Certication Scheme on the Quality of Pharma-ceutical Products Moving in International Commerce, which provides for theissuance of an attestation that a given product is manufactured under GMP con-ditions as established by periodic inspections. A text on pre-approval inspections was developed to complement the text on inspections, described below. These guidelines apply to the inspection ofmanufacturing and quality control facilities prior to the issuing of a marketingauthorization for a pharmaceutical product. A text entitled \"Provisional guidelines on the inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers\" was published by WHO in 1992 along with the core GMPguidelines on pharmaceutical products. The provisional guidelines wereintended to promote the harmonization of inspection practices among WHOMember States, and the Expert Committee noted that they would be of partic-ular value to government inspectors operating within small national regulatoryauthorities. In general, the objective of inspecting pharmaceutical manufacturing facil- ities is either to enforce general GMP compliance or to provide authorizationfor the manufacture of specic pharmaceutical products, usually in relation toan application for registration. The provisional guidelines are applicable mostlyto inspections of the rst type, whether performed before a manufacturingauthorization is issued, or on a periodic, routine basis. A further aspect of pharmaceutical inspection is monitoring the quality of pharmaceutical products in distribution channels, that is, from the point of man-ufacture to delivery to the recipient. In recent years the hazard posed by theinltration of counterfeit products has been identied in addition to problemsrelated to the inadequate stability of drug products and their improper handlingand storage. The text \"Guidelines for inspection of drug distribution channels\",part of the Thirty-fth report of the WHO Expert Committee on Specicationsfor Pharmaceutical Preparations, is included in this volume and providesdetailed advice to national drug regulatory authorities on the inspection of distribution channels. The provisional guidelines on the inspection of pharmaceutical manu- facturers and the guidelines for inspection of drug distribution channels arereproduced in Chapter 4 (\"Inspections\"). With the worldwide acceptance of the ISO 9000-series standards address- ing quality management and quality systems, a trend has emerged in someMember States for non-commercial institutions such as certication bodies,testing laboratories and the like to introduce principles of quality systems intotheir internal operations. The same principles have begun to be applied to governmental pharmaceutical inspectorates and medicines control laboratories.The WHO Expert Committee on Speci for Pharmaceutical PreparationsINTRODUCTION 5QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 5recently recommended that further guidance in this area should address the introduction of quality systems principles in the practice of pharmaceuticalinspections. Following the publication of the guidance texts on inspections, additional guidelines dealing with the quality system requirements for national good manu-facturing practice inspectorates were adopted by the Expert Committee. Thisguidance is one important tool when implementing GMP . The establishmentand operation of a quality system is an essential element in the mutual recogni-tion among inspectorates. The quality system should include all activitiesinvolved in the inspection. To complement the set of guidance texts in this area, the Expert Committee adopted a model layout for an inspection report, as well as a model certicateof GMP for a manufacturing site. Hazards affecting quality are to a certain extent covered and controlled through the validation of critical operations and processes in the manufactureof nished pharmaceutical products in accordance with GMP . However, GMPdo not cover the safety of the personnel engaged in manufacture, whereas theapplication of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) methodologydoes. Traditionally, this concept has been applied to food safety managementsystems. The same principles have increasingly also been adopted in other indus-tries. The guidance reproduced in this volume, in Chapter 5 (Hazard and risk analysis in pharmaceutical products), suggests their use also in the area ofpharmaceuticals. Sampling is an essential element when surveying the national markets for the quality of drug products in accordance with national drug quality surveil-lance programmes of marketed products, whether registered for sale or com-pounded in pharmacies. The Expert Committee adopted a revised guideline in2004 primarily intended to assist governmental organizations, such as drugcontrol authorities (including inspectorates), quality control laboratories,customs and police ofcials, but some of the general principles may also beappropriate for procurement agencies, manufacturers and customers. The guidance text is reproduced in Chapter 6 (\"Sampling operations\"). An alphabetical index of subjects covered in Volume 2 of Quality assurance of pharmaceuticals: a compendium of guidelines and related materials is included at the end of this volume.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 6QAPIN 12/16/06 12:17 PM Page 671.

It was subsequently submitted to theTwenty-rst World Health Assembly under the title \"Draft requirements forgood manufacturing practice in the manufacture and quality control of drugsand pharmaceutical specialities\" and was accepted. The revised text was discussed by the WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations in 1968 and published as anannex to its twenty-second report. The text was then reproduced (with somerevisions) in 1971 in the Supplement to the second edition of The International Pharmacopoeia . In 1969, when the World Health Assembly recommended the rst version of the WHO Certication Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical ProductsMoving in International Commerce in resolution WHA22.50, it accepted at thesame time the GMP text as an integral part of the Scheme. Revised versions ofboth the Certication Scheme and the GMP text were adopted in 1975 by resolution WHA28.65. Since then, the Certication Scheme has been extendedto include the certication of: \u2014 veterinary products administered to food-producing animals; \u2014 starting materials for use in dosage forms, when they are subject to control by legislation in both the exporting Member State and the importingMember State; \u2014 information on safety and efcacy (resolution WHA41.18, 1988). In 1992, the revised draft requirements for GMP were presented in three parts, of which only Parts One and Two are reproduced in this document ( 1). \"Quality management in the drug industry: philosophy and essential ele- ments\" outlines the general concepts of quality assurance as well as the princi-pal components or subsystems of GMP , which are joint responsibilities of topmanagement and of production and quality control management. These includehygiene, validation, self-inspection, personnel, premises, equipment, materialsand documentation. \"Good practices in production\" (section 16) and \"Good practices in quality control\" (section 17), provide guidance on actions to be taken separately byproduction and by quality control personnel for the implementation of thegeneral principles of quality assurance. These two parts were subsequently supplemented by further guidelines which are integral parts of these good manufacturing practices for pharma-ceutical products. All these texts are available on the web page of the World Health Organization http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/production/en/index.html. Considerable developments in GMP have taken place in the intervening years, and important national and international documents, including new revi-MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 9QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 9sions, have appeared ( 2, 3, 4, 5). Thus the necessity to revise the main princi- ples and incorporate the concept of validation. General considerations Licensed pharmaceutical products (marketing authorization) should be manufactured only by licensed manufacturers (holders of a manufacturingauthorization) whose activities are regularly inspected by competent nationalauthorities. This guide to GMP shall be used as a standard to justify GMP status,which constitutes one of the elements of the WHO Certication Scheme on theQuality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce,through the assessment of applications for manufacturing authorizations and asa basis for the inspection of manufacturing facilities. It may also be used as train-ing material for government drug inspectors, as well as for production, qualitycontrol and quality assurance personnel in the industry. The guide is applicable to operations for the manufacture of drugs in their nished dosage forms, including large-scale processes in hospitals and thepreparation of supplies for use in clinical trials. The good practices outlined below are to be considered general guides, 1 and they may be adapted to meet individual needs. The equivalence of alternative approaches to quality assurance, however, should be validated. The guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engagedin manufacture or environmental protection: these are normally governed by national legislation. A new concept of hazard analysis related to the risks in production and personnel safety is also newly recommended (Chapter 5). The manufacturer should assure the safety of workers and take the necessarymeasures to prevent pollution of the external environment. International Nonproprietary Names (INNs) for pharmaceutical substances designated byWHO should be used when available, together with other designated names. Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms used in this guide. They mayhave different meanings in other contexts. active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufac-ture of a pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when so used, becomes an activeingredient of that pharmaceutical dosage form. Such substances are intended tofurnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure andfunction of the body.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 101The word \"should\" in the text means a strong recommendation.QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 10airlock An enclosed space with two or more doors, which is interposed between two or more rooms, e.g. of differing classes of cleanliness, for the purpose of con-trolling the airflow between those rooms when they need to be entered. Anairlock is designed for use either by people or for goods and/or equipment. authorized person The person recognized by the national regulatory authority as having the respon-sibility for ensuring that each batch of nished product has been manufactured,tested and approved for release in compliance with the laws and regulations inforce in that country. batch (or lot) A dened quantity of starting material, packaging material, or productprocessed in a single process or series of processes so that it is expected to behomogeneous. It may sometimes be necessary to divide a batch into a numberof sub-batches, which are later brought together to form a nal homogeneousbatch. In the case of terminal sterilization, the batch size is determined by thecapacity of the autoclave. In continuous manufacture, the batch must corre-spond to a dened fraction of the production, characterized by its intendedhomogeneity. The batch size can be dened either as a xed quantity or as theamount produced in a xed time interval. batch number (or lot number) A distinctive combination of numbers and/or letters which uniquely identiesa batch on the labels, its batch records and corresponding certicates of analysis, etc. batch records All documents associated with the manufacture of a batch of bulk product ornished product.

Quality management in the drug industry In the drug industry at large, quality management is usually dened as the aspect of management function that determines and implements the \"quality policy\",i.e. the overall intention and direction of an organization regarding quality, asformally expressed and authorized by top management. The basic elements ofquality management are: \u2014 an appropriate infrastructure or \"quality system\", encompassing the orga- nizational structure, procedures, processes and resources; \u2014 systematic actions necessary to ensure adequate condence that a product (or service) will satisfy given requirements for quality. The totality of theseactions is termed \"quality assurance\". Within an organization, quality assurance serves as a management tool. In contractual situations, quality assurance also serves to generate condence inthe supplier. The concepts of quality assurance, GMP and quality control areMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 15QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 15interrelated aspects of quality management. They are described here in order to emphasize their relationship and their fundamental importance to the produc-tion and control of pharmaceutical products. 1. Quality assurance 1.1Principle. \"Quality assurance\" is a wide-ranging concept covering all matters that individually or collectively influence the quality of a product. It isthe totality of the arrangements made with the object of ensuring that pharma-ceutical products are of the quality required for their intended use. Qualityassurance therefore incorporates GMP and other factors, including thoseoutside the scope of this guide such as product design and development. 1.2 The system of quality assurance appropriate to the manufacture of pharma- ceutical products should ensure that: (a) pharmaceutical products are designed and developed in a way that takes account of the requirements of GMP and other associated codes such asthose of good laboratory practice (GLP) 1and good clinical practice (GCP); (b) production and control operations are clearly specied in a written form and GMP requirements are adopted; (c) managerial responsibilities are clearly specied in job descriptions;(d) arrangements are made for the manufacture, supply and use of the correct starting and packaging materials; (e) all necessary controls on starting materials, intermediate products, and bulk products and other in-process controls, calibrations, and validationsare carried out; (f) the nished product is correctly processed and checked, according to the dened procedures; (g) pharmaceutical products are not sold or supplied before the authorized persons (see also sections 9.11 and 9.12) have certied that each produc-tion batch has been produced and controlled in accordance with therequirements of the marketing authorization and any other regulations rel-evant to the production, control and release of pharmaceutical products; (h) satisfactory arrangements exist to ensure, as far as possible, that the phar- maceutical products are stored by the manufacturer, distributed, and sub-sequently handled so that quality is maintained throughout their shelf-life;QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 161This is a code governing the testing of chemicals to obtain data on their properties and ensuring safety with respect to human health and the environment. It is different from that described in \"Good labora-tory practices in governmental drug control laboratories\" in the Thirtieth report of the WHO Expert Com-mittee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 748, 1987,Annex 1).QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 16(i) there is a procedure for self-inspection and/or quality audit that regularly appraises the effectiveness and applicability of the quality assurancesystem; (j) deviations are reported, investigated and recorded;(k) there is a system for approving changes that may have an impact on product quality; (l) regular evaluations of the quality of pharmaceutical products should be conducted with the objective of verifying the consistency of the processand ensuring its continuous improvement. 1.3 The manufacturer must assume responsibility for the quality of the pharma- ceutical products to ensure that they are t for their intended use, comply withthe requirements of the marketing authorization and do not place patients atrisk due to inadequate safety, quality or efcacy. The attainment of this qualityobjective is the responsibility of senior management and requires the participa-tion and commitment of staff in many different departments and at all levelswithin the company, the company's suppliers, and the distributors. To achievethe quality objective reliably there must be a comprehensively designed and cor-rectly implemented system of quality assurance incorporating GMP and qualitycontrol. It should be fully documented and its effectiveness monitored. All partsof the quality assurance system should be adequately staffed with competentpersonnel, and should have suitable and sufcient premises, equipment, andfacilities. 2. Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products (GMP) 2.1 Good manufacturing practice is that part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled to the quality standardsappropriate to their intended use and as required by the marketing autho-rization. GMP are aimed primarily at diminishing the risks inherent in any pharmaceutical production. Such risks are essentially of two types: cross-contamination (in particular of unexpected contaminants) and mix-ups (confusion) caused by, for example, false labels being put on containers. UnderGMP: (a) all manufacturing processes are clearly dened, systematically reviewed in the light of experience, and shown to be capable of consistently manu-facturing pharmaceutical products of the required quality that comply withtheir specications; (b) qualication and validation are performed;(c) all necessary resources are provided, including: (i) appropriately qualied and trained personnel; (ii) adequate premises and space;MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 17QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 17(iii) suitable equipment and services; (iv) appropriate materials, containers and labels;(v) approved procedures and instructions;(vi) suitable storage and transport;(vii) adequate personnel, laboratories and equipment for in-process controls; (d) instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language, specically applicable to the facilities provided; (e) operators are trained to carry out procedures correctly;(f) records are made (manually and/or by recording instruments) during manufacture to show that all the steps required by the dened proceduresand instructions have in fact been taken and that the quantity and qualityof the product are as expected; any signicant deviations are fully recordedand investigated; (g) records covering manufacture and distribution, which enable the complete history of a batch to be traced, are retained in a comprehensible and acces-sible form; (h) the proper storage and distribution of the products minimizes any risk to their quality; (i) a system is available to recall any batch of product from sale or supply;(j) complaints about marketed products are examined, the causes of quality defects investigated, and appropriate measures taken in respect of thedefective products to prevent recurrence. 3. Sanitation and hygiene 3.1 A high level of sanitation and hygiene should be practised in every aspectof the manufacture of drug products. The scope of sanitation and hygiene coverspersonnel, premises, equipment and apparatus, production materials and con-tainers, products for cleaning and disinfection, and anything that could becomea source of contamination to the product. Potential sources of contaminationshould be eliminated through an integrated comprehensive programme of san-itation and hygiene. (For personal hygiene see section 11, and for sanitation see section 12, \"Premises\".) 4. Qualication and validation 4.1 In accordance with GMP , each pharmaceutical company should identifywhat qualication and validation work is required to prove that the criticalaspects of their particular operation are controlled. 4.2 The key elements of a qualication and validation programme of a company should be clearly dened and documented in a validation master plan.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF 18QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 184.3 Qualication and validation should establish and provide documentary evidence that: (a) the premises, supporting utilities, equipment and processes have been designed in accordance with the requirements for GMP (design qualica-tion, or DQ); (b) the premises, supporting utilities and equipment have been built and installed in compliance with their design specications (installation quali-cation, or IQ); (c) the premises, supporting utilities and equipment operate in accordance with their design specications (operational qualication, or OQ); (d) a specic process will consistently produce a product meeting its pre- determined specications and quality attributes (process validation, or PV ,also called performance qualication, or PQ). 4.4 Any aspect of operation, including signicant changes to the premises, facil- ities, equipment or processes, which may affect the quality of the product,directly or indirectly, should be qualied and validated. 4.5 Qualication and validation should not be considered as one-off exercises. An ongoing programme should follow their rst implementation and should bebased on an annual review. 4.6 The commitment to maintain continued validation status should be stated in the relevant company documentation, such as the quality manual or valida-tion master plan. 4.7 The responsibility of performing validation should be clearly dened.4.8 Validation studies are an essential part of GMP and should be conducted in accordance with predened and approved protocols. 4.9 A written report summarizing the results recorded and the conclusions reached should be prepared and stored. 4.10 Processes and procedures should be established on the basis of the results of the validation performed. 4.11 It is of critical importance that particular attention is paid to the valida- tion of analytical test methods, automated systems and cleaning procedures. 5. Complaints 5.1Principle . All complaints and other information concerning potentially defective products should be carefully reviewed according to written proceduresand the corrective action should be taken. 5.2 A person responsible for handling the complaints and deciding the mea- sures to be taken should be designated, together with sufcient supporting staffMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 19QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 19to assist him or her. If this person is different from the authorized person, the latter should be made aware of any complaint, investigation or recall. 5.3 There should be written procedures describing the action to be taken, including the need to consider a recall, in the case of a complaint concerning apossible product defect. 5.4 Special attention should be given to establishing whether a complaint was caused because of counterfeiting. 5.5 Any complaint concerning a product defect should be recorded with all the original details and thoroughly investigated. The person responsible for qualitycontrol should normally be involved in the review of such investigations. 5.6 If a product defect is discovered or suspected in a batch, consideration should be given to whether other batches should be checked in order to deter-mine whether they are also affected. In particular, other batches that maycontain reprocessed product from the defective batch should be investigated. 5.7 Where necessary, appropriate follow-up action, possibly including product recall, should be taken after investigation and evaluation of the complaint. 5.8 All decisions made and measures taken as a result of a complaint should be recorded and referenced to the corresponding batch records. 5.9 Complaints records should be regularly reviewed for any indication of spe- cic or recurring problems that require attention and might justify the recall ofmarketed products. 5.10 The competent authorities should be informed if a manufacturer is con- sidering action following possibly faulty manufacture, product deterioration,counterfeiting or any other serious quality problems with a product. 6. Product recalls 6.1Principle . There should be a system to recall from the market, promptly and effectively, products known or suspected to be defective. 6.2 The authorized person should be responsible for the execution and coor- dination of recalls. He/she should have sufcient staff to handle all aspects ofthe recalls with the appropriate degree of urgency. 6.3 There should be established written procedures, which are regularly reviewed and updated, for the organization of any recall activity. Recall opera-tions should be capable of being initiated promptly down to the required levelin the distribution chain. 6.4 An instruction should be included in the written procedures to store recalled products in a secure segregated area while their fate is decided.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 20QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 206.5 All competent authorities of all countries to which a given product has been distributed should be promptly informed of any intention to recall the productbecause it is, or is suspected of being, defective. 6.6 The distribution records should be readily available to the authorized person, and they should contain sufcient information on wholesalers anddirectly supplied customers (including, for exported products, those who havereceived samples for clinical tests and medical samples) to permit an effectiverecall. 6.7 The progress of the recall process should be monitored and recorded. Records should include the disposition of the product. A nal report should beissued, including a reconciliation between the delivered and recovered quanti-ties of the products. 6.8 The effectiveness of the arrangements for recalls should be tested and eval- uated from time to time. 7. Contract production and analysis 7.1Principle . Contract production and analysis must be correctly dened, agreed and controlled in order to avoid misunderstandings that could result ina product or work or analysis of unsatisfactory quality. General 7.2 All arrangements for contract manufacture and analysis, including any pro-posed changes in technical or other arrangements, should be in accordance withthe marketing authorization for the product concerned. 7.3 The contract should permit the contract giver to audit the facilities of the contract accepter. 7.4 In the case of contract analysis, the nal approval for release must be given by the authorized person. The contract giver 7.5 The contract giver is responsible for assessing the competence of the con-tract accepter in successfully carrying out the work or tests required, forapproval for contract activities, and for ensuring by means of the contract thatthe principles of GMP described in this guide are followed. 7.6 The contract giver should provide the contract accepter with all the information necessary to carry out the contracted operations correctly in accord-ance with the marketing authorization and any other legal requirements. Thecontract giver should ensure that the contract accepter is fully aware of anyMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 21QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 21problems associated with the product, work or tests that might pose a hazard to premises, equipment, personnel, other materials or other products. 7.7 The contract giver should ensure that all processed products and materials delivered by the contract accepter comply with their specications or that theproduct has been released by the authorized person. The contract accepter 7.8 The contract accepter must have adequate premises, equipment, knowl-edge, and experience and competent personnel to carry out satisfactorily thework ordered by the contract giver. Contract manufacture may be undertakenonly by a manufacturer who holds a manufacturing authorization. 7.9 The contract accepter should not pass to a third party any of the work entrusted to him or her under the contract without the contract giver's priorevaluation and approval of the arrangements. Arrangements made between thecontract accepter and any third party should ensure that the manufacturing andanalytical information is made available in the same way as between the origi-nal contract giver and contract accepter. 7.10 The contract accepter should refrain from any activity that may adversely affect the quality of the product manufactured and/or analysed for the contractgiver. The contract 7.11 There must be a written contract between the contract giver and the con-tract accepter which clearly establishes the responsibilities of each party. 7.12 The contract must clearly state the way in which the authorized person, in releasing each batch of product for sale or issuing the certicate of analysis,exercises his or her full responsibility and ensures that each batch has been man-ufactured in, and checked for, compliance with the requirements of the marketing authorization. 7.13 Technical aspects of the contract should be drawn up by competent persons suitably knowledgeable in pharmaceutical technology, analysis andGMP . 7.14 All arrangements for production and analysis must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and agreed by both parties. 7.15 The contract should describe clearly who is responsible for purchasing, testing and releasing materials and for undertaking production and quality controls, including in-process controls, and who has responsibility for samplingand analysis. In the case of contract analysis, the contract should state whetherQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 22QAP1 12/16/06 12:11 PM Page 22or not the contract accepter should take samples at the premises of the manufacturer. 7.16 Manufacturing, analytical, distribution records and reference samples should be kept by, or be available to, the contract giver. Any records relevantto assessing the quality of a product in the event of complaints or a suspecteddefect must be accessible and specied in the defect/recall procedures of thecontract giver. 7.17 The contract should describe the handling of starting materials, inter- mediate and bulk products and nished products if they are rejected. It shouldalso describe the procedure to be followed if the contract analysis shows thatthe tested product must be rejected. 8. Self-inspection and quality audits 8.1Principle. The purpose of self-inspection is to evaluate the manufacturer's compliance with GMP in all aspects of production and quality control. The self-inspection programme should be designed to detect any shortcomings in theimplementation of GMP and to recommend the necessary corrective actions.Self-inspections should be performed routinely, and may be, in addition, per-formed on special occasions, e.g. in the case of product recalls or repeated rejec-tions, or when an inspection by the health authorities is announced. The teamresponsible for self-inspection should consist of personnel who can evaluate theimplementation of GMP objectively. All recommendations for corrective actionshould be implemented. The procedure for self-inspection should be docu-mented, and there should be an effective follow-up programme. Items for self-inspection 8.2 Written instructions for self-inspection should be established to provide aminimum and uniform standard of requirements. These may include question-naires on GMP requirements covering at least the following items: (a) personnel; (b) premises including personnel facilities;(c) maintenance of buildings and equipment;(d) storage of starting materials and nished products;(e) equipment;(f) instruments or procedures;MAIN FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 23QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 23(m) complaints management; (n) labels control;(o) results of previous self-inspections and any corrective steps taken. Self-inspection team 8.3 Management should appoint a self-inspection team consisting of experts intheir respective elds and familiar with GMP . The members of the team may beappointed from inside or outside the company. Frequency of self-inspection 8.4 The frequency at which self-inspections are conducted may depend oncompany requirements but should preferably be at least once a year. The frequency should be stated in the procedure. Self-inspection report 8.5 A report should be made at the completion of a self-inspection. The reportshould include: (a) self-inspection results; (b) evaluation and conclusions;(c) recommended corrective actions. Follow-up action 8.6 There should be an effective follow-up programme. The company manage-ment should evaluate both the self-inspection report and the corrective actionsas necessary. Quality audit 8.7 It may be useful to supplement self-inspections with a quality audit. Aquality audit consists of an examination and assessment of all or part of a qualitysystem with the specic purpose of improving it. A quality audit is usually con-ducted by outside or independent specialists or a team designated by the management for this purpose. Such audits may also be extended to suppliersand contractors (see section 7, \"Contract production and analysis\"). Suppliers' audits and approval 8.8 The person responsible for quality control should have responsibilitytogether with other relevant departments for approving suppliers who can QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 24QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 24reliably supply starting and packaging materials that meet established specications. 8.9 Before suppliers are approved and included in the approved suppliers' list or specications, they should be evaluated. The evaluation should take intoaccount a supplier's history and the nature of the materials to be supplied. If anaudit is required, it should determine the supplier's ability to conform withGMP standards. 9. Personnel 9.1Principle. The establishment and maintenance of a satisfactory system of quality assurance and the correct manufacture and control of pharmaceuticalproducts and active ingredients rely upon people. For this reason there must besufcient qualied personnel to carry out all the tasks for which the manu-facturer is responsible. Individual responsibilities should be clearly dened andunderstood by the persons concerned and recorded as written descriptions. General 9.2 The manufacturer should have an adequate number of personnel with thenecessary qualications and practical experience. The responsibilities placed onany one individual should not be so extensive so as to present any risk to quality. 9.3. All responsible staff should have their specic duties recorded in written descriptions and adequate authority to carry out their responsibilities. Theirduties may be delegated to designated deputies of a satisfactory qualicationlevel. There should be no gaps or unexplained overlaps in the responsibilitiesof personnel concerned with the application of GMP . The manufacturer shouldhave an organization chart. 9.4 All personnel should be aware of the principles of GMP that affect them and receive initial and continuing training, including hygiene instructions, rele-vant to their needs. All personnel should be motivated to support the estab-lishment and maintenance of high-quality standards. 9.5 Steps should be taken to prevent unauthorized people from entering pro- duction, storage and quality control areas. Personnel who do not work in theseareas should not use them as a passageway. Key personnel 9.6 Key personnel include the head of production, the head of quality controland the authorized person. Normally, key posts should be occupied by full-timepersonnel. The heads of production and quality control should be independentMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 25QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 25of each other. In large organizations, it may be necessary to delegate some of the functions; however, the responsibility cannot be delegated. 9.7 Key personnel responsible for supervising the manufacture and quality control of pharmaceutical products should possess the qualications of a sci-entic education and practical experience required by national legislation. Theireducation should include the study of an appropriate combination of: (a) chemistry (analytical or organic) or biochemistry; (b) chemical engineering;(c) microbiology;(d) pharmaceutical sciences and technology;(e) pharmacology and toxicology;(f) physiology;(g) other related sciences. They should also have adequate practical experience in the manufacture and quality assurance of pharmaceutical products. In order to gain such experience,a preparatory period may be required, during which they should exercise theirduties under professional guidance. The scientic education and practical expe-rience of experts should be such as to enable them to exercise independent professional judgement, based on the application of scientic principles andunderstanding to the practical problems encountered in the manufacture andquality control of pharmaceutical products. 9.8 The heads of the production and quality control generally have some shared, or jointly exercised, responsibilities relating to quality. These mayinclude, depending on national regulations: (a) authorization of written procedures and other documents, including amendments; (b) monitoring and control of the manufacturing environment;(c) plant hygiene;(d) process validation and calibration of analytical apparatus;(e) training, including the application and principles of quality assurance;(f) approval and monitoring of suppliers of materials;(g) approval and monitoring of contract manufacturers;(h) designation and monitoring of storage conditions for materials and products; (i) performance and evaluation of in-process controls;(j) retention of records;(k) monitoring of compliance with GMP requirements;(l) inspection, investigation and taking of samples in order to monitor factors that may affect product quality. 9.9 The head of the production generally has the following responsibilities:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 26QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 26(a) to ensure that products are produced and stored according to the appro- priate documentation in order to obtain the required quality; (b) to approve the instructions relating to production operations, including the in-process controls, and to ensure their strict implementation; (c) to ensure that the production records are evaluated and signed by a designated person; (d) to check the maintenance of the department, premises, and equipment;(e) to ensure that the appropriate process validations and calibrations of control equipment are performed and recorded and the reports madeavailable; (f) to ensure that the required initial and continuing training of production personnel is carried out and adapted according to need. 9.10 The head of the quality control generally has the following responsibilities: (a) to approve or reject starting materials, packaging materials, and inter- mediate, bulk and nished products in relation to their specications; (b) to evaluate batch records;(c) to ensure that all necessary testing is carried out;(d) to approve sampling instructions, specications, test methods and other quality control procedures; (e) to approve and monitor analyses carried out under contract;(f) to check the maintenance of the department, premises and equipment;(g) to ensure that the appropriate validations, including those of analytical procedures, and calibrations of control equipment are carried out; (h) to ensure that the required initial and continuing training of quality control personnel is carried out and adapted according to need. Other duties of the quality control are summarized in sections 17.3 and 17.4.9.11 The authorized person is responsible for compliance with technical or reg- ulatory requirements related to the quality of nished products and the approvalof the release of the nished product for sale. 9.12 The authorized person will also be involved in other activities, including the following: (a) implementation (and, when needed, establishment) of the quality system; (b) participation in the development of the company's quality manual;(c) supervision of the regular internal audits or self-inspections;(d) oversight of the quality control department;(e) participation in external audit (vendor audit);(f) participation in validation programmes. 9.13 The function of the approval of the release of a nished batch or a product can be delegated to a designated person with appropriate qualications andMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 27QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 27experience who will release the product in accordance with an approved pro- cedure. This is normally done by quality assurance by means of batch review. 9.14 The person responsible for approving a batch for release should always ensure that the following requirements have been met: (a) the marketing authorization and the manufacturing authorization require- ments for the product have been met for the batch concerned; (b) the principles and guidelines of GMP , as laid down in the guidelines published by WHO, have been followed; (c) the principal manufacturing and testing processes have been validated, if different; (d) all the necessary checks and tests have been performed and account taken of the production conditions and manufacturing records; (e) any planned changes or deviations in manufacturing or quality control have been notied in accordance with a well dened reporting systembefore any product is released. Such changes may need notication to, andapproval by, the drug regulatory authority; (f) any additional sampling, inspection, tests and checks have been carried out or initiated, as appropriate, to cover planned changes and deviations; (g) all necessary production and quality control documentation has been com- pleted and endorsed by supervisors trained in appropriate disciplines; (h) appropriate audits, self-inspections and spot-checks are carried out by experienced and trained staff; (i) approval has been given by the head of quality control;(j) all relevant factors have been considered, including any not specically associated with the output batch directly under review (e.g. subdivision ofoutput batches from a common input, factors associated with continuousproduction runs). 10. Training 10.1 The manufacturer should provide training in accordance with a writtenprogramme for all personnel whose duties take them into manufacturing areasor into control laboratories (including the technical, maintenance and cleaningpersonnel) and for other personnel as required. 10.2 Besides basic training on the theory and practice of GMP , newly recruited personnel should receive training appropriate to the duties assigned to them.Continuing training should also be given, and its practical effectiveness period-ically assessed. Approved training programmes should be available. Trainingrecords should be kept. 10.3 Personnel working in areas where contamination is a hazard, e.g. clean areas or areas where highly active, toxic, infectious or sensitizing materials arehandled, should be given specic training.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 28QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2810.4 The concept of quality assurance and all the measures which aid its understanding and implementation should be fully discussed during the training sessions. 10.5 Visitors or untrained personnel should preferably not be taken into the production and quality control areas. If this is unavoidable, they should be givenrelevant information in advance (particularly about personal hygiene) and theprescribed protective clothing. They should be closely supervised. 10.6 Consultant and contract staff should be qualied for the services they provide. Evidence of this should be included in the training records. 11. Personal hygiene 11.1 All personnel, prior to and during employment, as appropriate, shouldundergo health examinations. Personnel conducting visual inspections shouldalso undergo periodic eye examinations. 11.2 All personnel should be trained in the practices of personal hygiene. A high level of personal hygiene should be observed by all those concerned withmanufacturing processes. In particular, personnel should be instructed to washtheir hands before entering production areas. Signs to this effect should beposted and instructions observed. 11.3 Any person shown at any time to have an apparent illness or open lesions that may adversely affect the quality of products should not be allowed to handlestarting materials, packaging materials, in-process materials or drug productsuntil the condition is no longer judged to be a risk. 11.4 All employees should be instructed and encouraged to report to their immediate supervisor any conditions (relating to plant, equipment or person-nel) that they consider may adversely affect the products. 11.5 Direct contact should be avoided between the operator's hands and start- ing materials, primary packaging materials and intermediate or bulk product. 11.6 To ensure protection of the product from contamination, personnel should wear clean body coverings appropriate to the duties they perform, includingappropriate hair covering. Used clothes, if reusable, should be stored in sepa-rate closed containers until properly laundered and, if necessary, disinfected orsterilized. 11.7 Smoking, eating, drinking, chewing, and keeping plants, food, drink, smoking material and personal medicines should not be permitted in production, laboratory and storage areas, or in any other areas where they mightadversely influence product quality.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 29QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2911.8 Personal hygiene procedures including the use of protective clothing should apply to all persons entering production areas, whether they are tem-porary or full-time employees or non-employees, e.g. contractors' employees,visitors, senior managers, and inspectors. 12. Premises 12.1 Principle . Premises must be located, designed, constructed, adapted, and maintained to suit the operations to be carried out. General 12.2 The layout and design of premises must aim to minimize the risk of errorsand permit effective cleaning and maintenance in order to avoid cross-contam-ination, build-up of dust or dirt, and, in general, any adverse effect on the qualityof products. 12.3 Where dust is generated (e.g. during sampling, weighing, mixing and pro- cessing operations, packaging of powder), measures should be taken to avoidcross-contamination and facilitate cleaning. 12.4 Premises should be situated in an environment that, when considered together with measures to protect the manufacturing process, presentsminimum risk of causing any contamination of materials or products. 12.5 Premises used for the manufacture of nished products should be suitably designed and constructed to facilitate good sanitation. 12.6 Premises should be carefully maintained, and it should be ensured that repair and maintenance operations do not present any hazard to the quality ofproducts. 12.7 Premises should be cleaned and, where applicable, disinfected according to detailed written procedures. Records should be maintained. 12.8 Electrical supply, lighting, temperature, humidity and ventilation should be appropriate and such that they do not adversely affect, directly or indirectly,either the pharmaceutical products during their manufacture and storage, or theaccurate functioning of equipment. 12.9 Premises should be designed and equipped so as to afford maximum pro- tection against the entry of insects, birds or animals. There should be a proce-dure for rodent and pest control. 12.10 Premises should be designed to ensure the logical flow of materials and personnel.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 30QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 30Ancillary areas 12.11 Rest and refreshment rooms should be separate from manufacturing and control areas. 12.12 Facilities for changing and storing clothes and for washing and toilet pur- poses should be easily accessible and appropriate for the number of users.Toilets should not communicate directly with production or storage areas. 12.13 Maintenance workshops should if possible be separated from production areas. Whenever parts and tools are stored in the production area, they shouldbe kept in rooms or lockers reserved for that use. 12.14 Animal houses should be well isolated from other areas, with separate entrance (animal access) and air-handling facilities. Storage areas 12.15 Storage areas should be of sufcient capacity to allow orderly storage ofthe various categories of materials and products with proper separation and seg-regation: starting and packaging materials, intermediates, bulk and nishedproducts, products in quarantine, and released, rejected, returned or recalledproducts. 12.16 Storage areas should be designed or adapted to ensure good storage con- ditions. In particular, they should be clean, dry, sufciently lit and maintainedwithin acceptable temperature limits. Where special storage conditions arerequired (e.g. temperature, humidity) these should be provided, controlled,monitored and recorded where appropriate. 12.17 Receiving and dispatch bays should be separated and protect materials and products from the weather. Receiving areas should be designed andequipped to allow containers of incoming materials to be cleaned if necessarybefore storage. 12.18 Where quarantine status is ensured by storage in separate areas, these areas must be clearly marked and their access restricted to authorized personnel. Anysystem replacing the physical quarantine should give equivalent security. 12.19 Segregation should be provided for the storage of rejected, recalled, or returned materials or products. 12.20 Highly active and radioactive materials, narcotics, other dangerous drugs, and substances presenting special risks of abuse, re or explosion should bestored in safe and secure areas. 12.21 Printed packaging materials are considered critical to the conformity of the pharmaceutical product to its labelling and special attention should be paidto sampling and the safe and secure storage of these materials.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 31QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3112.22 There should normally be a separate sampling area for starting materials. (If sampling is performed in the storage area, it should be conducted in such away as to prevent contamination or cross-contamination.) Weighing areas 12.23 The weighing of starting materials and the estimation of yield by weigh-ing should be carried out in separate weighing areas designed for that use, forexample with provisions for dust control. Such areas may be part of eitherstorage or production areas. Production areas 12.24 In order to minimize the risk of a serious medical hazard due to cross-contamination, dedicated and self-contained facilities must be available for theproduction of particular pharmaceutical products, such as highly sensitizingmaterials (e.g. penicillins) or biological preparations (e.g. live microorganisms).The production of certain other highly active products, such as some antibi-otics, hormones, cytotoxic substances and certain non-pharmaceutical products,should not be conducted in the same facilities. In exceptional cases, the princi-ple of campaign working in the same facilities can be accepted provided thatspecic precautions are taken and the necessary validations (including cleaningvalidation) are made. The manufacture of technical poisons, such as pesticidesand herbicides, should not be allowed in premises used for the manufacture ofpharmaceutical products. 12.25 Premises should preferably be laid out in such a way as to allow the pro- duction to take place in areas connected in a logical order corresponding to thesequence of the operations and to the requisite cleanliness levels. 12.26 The adequacy of the working and in-process storage space should permit the orderly and logical positioning of equipment and materials so as to mini-mize the risk of confusion between different pharmaceutical products or theircomponents, to avoid cross-contamination, and to minimize the risk of omis-sion or wrong application of any of the manufacturing or control steps. 12.27 Where starting and primary packaging materials and intermediate or bulk products are exposed to the environment, interior surfaces (walls, floors andceilings) should be smooth and free from cracks and open joints, should notshed particulate matter, and should permit easy and effective cleaning and, ifnecessary, disinfection. 12.28 Pipework, light ttings, ventilation points and other services should be designed and sited to avoid the creation of recesses that are difcult to clean.As far as possible, for maintenance purposes, they should be accessible fromoutside the manufacturing areas.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 32QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3212.29 Drains should be of adequate size and designed and equipped to prevent back-flow. Open channels should be avoided where possible, but if they are necessary they should be shallow to facilitate cleaning and disinfection. 12.30 Production areas should be effectively ventilated, with air-control facili- ties (including ltration of air to a sufcient level to prevent contamination andcross-contamination, as well as control of temperature and, where necessary,humidity) appropriate to the products handled, to the operations undertakenand to the external environment. These areas should be regularly monitoredduring both production and non-production periods to ensure compliance withtheir design specications. 12.31 Premises for the packaging of pharmaceutical products should be specif- ically designed and laid out so as to avoid mix-ups or cross-contamination. 12.32 Production areas should be well lit, particularly where visual on-line con- trols are carried out. Quality control areas 12.33 Quality control laboratories should be separated from production areas.Areas where biological, microbiological or radioisotope test methods areemployed should be separated from each other. 12.34 Quality control laboratories should be designed to suit the operations to be carried out in them. Sufcient space should be given to avoid mix-ups andcross-contamination. There should be adequate suitable storage space forsamples, reference standards (if necessary, with cooling), solvents, reagents andrecords. 12.35 The design of the laboratories should take into account the suitability of construction materials, prevention of fumes and ventilation. There should beseparate air supply to laboratories and production areas. Separate air-handlingunits and other provisions are needed for biological, microbiological andradioisotope laboratories. 12.36 A separate room may be needed for instruments to protect them against electrical interference, vibration, contact with excessive moisture and otherexternal factors, or where it is necessary to isolate the instruments. 13. Equipment 13.1 Equipment must be located, designed, constructed, adapted, and main-tained to suit the operations to be carried out. The layout and design of equip-ment must aim to minimize the risk of errors and permit effective cleaning andmaintenance in order to avoid cross-contamination, build-up of dust or dirt,and, in general, any adverse effect on the quality of products.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 33QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3313.2 Equipment should be installed in such a way as to minimize any risk of error or of contamination. 13.3 Fixed pipework should be clearly labelled to indicate the contents and, where applicable, the direction of flow. 13.4 All service pipings and devices should be adequately marked and special attention paid to the provision of non-interchangeable connections or adaptorsfor dangerous gases and liquids. 13.5 Balances and other measuring equipment of an appropriate range and pre- cision should be available for production and control operations and should becalibrated on a scheduled basis. 13.6 Production equipment should be thoroughly cleaned on a scheduled basis.13.7 Laboratory equipment and instruments should be suited to the testing pro- cedures undertaken. 13.8 Washing, cleaning and drying equipment should be chosen and used so as not to be a source of contamination. 13.9 Production equipment should not present any hazard to the products. The parts of the production equipment that come into contact with the product mustnot be reactive, additive, or absorptive to an extent that would affect the qualityof the product. 13.10 Defective equipment should be removed from production and quality control areas. If this is not possible, it should be clearly labelled as defective toprevent use. 13.11 Closed equipment should be used whenever appropriate. Where open equipment is used or equipment is opened, precautions should be taken to min-imize contamination. 13.12 Non-dedicated equipment should be cleaned according to validated cleaning procedures between production of different pharmaceutical productsto prevent cross-contamination. 13.13 Current drawings of critical equipment and support systems should be maintained. 14. Materials 14.1 Principle. The main objective of a pharmaceutical plant is to produce n- ished products for patients' use from a combination of materials (starting andpackaging). 14.2 Materials include starting materials, packaging materials, gases, solvents, process aids, reagents and labelling materials.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 34QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 34General 14.3 No materials used for operations such as cleaning, lubrication of equip- ment and pest control, should come into direct contact with the product. Wherepossible, such materials should be of a suitable grade (e.g. food grade) to minimize health risks. 14.4 All incoming materials and nished products should be quarantined immediately after receipt or processing, until they are released for use or distribution. 14.5 All materials and products should be stored under the appropriate con- ditions established by the manufacturer and in an orderly fashion to permitbatch segregation and stock rotation by a rst-expire, rst-out rule. 14.6 Water used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products should be suit- able for its intended use. Starting materials 14.7 The purchase of starting materials is an important operation that shouldinvolve staff who have a particular and thorough knowledge of the products andsuppliers. 14.8 Starting materials should be purchased only from approved suppliers and, where possible, directly from the producer. It is also recommended that thespecications established by the manufacturer for the starting materials be discussed with the suppliers. It is of benet that all critical aspects of the pro-duction and control of the starting material in question, including handling,labelling and packaging requirements as well as complaints and rejection pro-cedures, are contractually agreed between the manufacturer and the supplier. 14.9 For each consignment, the containers should be checked for at least integrity of package and seal and for correspondence between the order, thedelivery note, and the supplier's labels. 14.10 All incoming materials should be checked to ensure that the consignment corresponds to the order. Containers should be cleaned where necessary andlabelled, if required, with the prescribed information. Where additional labelsare attached to containers, the original information should not be lost. 14.11 Damage to containers and any other problem that might adversely affect the quality of a material should be recorded and reported to the quality controldepartment and investigated. 14.12 If one delivery of material is made up of different batches, each batch must be considered as separate for sampling, testing and release.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 35QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3514.13 Starting materials in the storage area should be appropriately labelled. Labels should bear at least the following information: (a) the designated name of the product and the internal code reference where applicable; (b) the batch number given by the supplier and, on receipt, the control or batch number given by the manufacturer, if any, documented so as toensure traceability; (c) the status of the contents (e.g. on quarantine, on test, released, rejected, returned, recalled); (d) where appropriate, an expiry date or a date beyond which retesting is necessary. When fully validated computerized storage systems are used, not all of the above information need be in a legible form on the label. 14.14 There should be appropriate procedures or measures to ensure the iden- tity of the contents of each container of starting material. Bulk containers fromwhich samples have been drawn should be identied. 14.15 Only starting materials released by the quality control department and within their shelf-life should be used. 14.16 Starting materials should be dispensed only by designated persons, fol- lowing a written procedure, to ensure that the correct materials are accuratelyweighed or measured into clean and properly labelled containers. 14.17 Each dispensed material and its weight or volume should be indepen- dently checked and the check recorded. 14.18 Materials dispensed for each batch of the nal product should be kept together and conspicuously labelled as such. Packaging materials 14.19 The purchase, handling and control of primary and printed packagingmaterials should be as for starting materials. 14.20 Particular attention should be paid to printed packaging materials. They should be stored in secure conditions so as to exclude the possibility of unau-thorized access. Roll-feed labels should be used wherever possible. Cut labelsand other loose printed materials should be stored and transported in separateclosed containers so as to avoid mix-ups. Packaging materials should be issuedfor use only by designated personnel following an approved and documentedprocedure. 14.21 Each delivery or batch of printed or primary packaging material should be given a specic reference number or identication mark.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 36QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3614.22 Outdated or obsolete primary packaging material or printed packaging material should be destroyed and its disposal recorded. 14.23 All products and packaging materials to be used should be checked on delivery to the packaging department for quantity, identity and conformity withthe packaging instructions. Intermediate and bulk products 14.24 Intermediate and bulk products should be kept under appropriate conditions. 14.25 Intermediate and bulk products purchased as such should be handled on receipt as though they were starting materials. Finished products 14.26 Finished products should be held in quarantine until their nal release,after which they should be stored as usable stock under conditions establishedby the manufacturer. 14.27 The evaluation of nished products and the documentation necessary for release of a product for sale are described in section 17, \"Good practices inquality control\". Rejected, recovered, reprocessed and reworked materials 14.28 Rejected materials and products should be clearly marked as such andstored separately in restricted areas. They should either be returned to the sup-pliers or, where appropriate, reprocessed or destroyed in a timely manner. What-ever action is taken should be approved by authorized personnel and recorded. 14.29 The reworking or recovery of rejected products should be exceptional. It is permitted only if the quality of the nal product is not affected, if the spec-ications are met, and if it is done in accordance with a dened and authorizedprocedure after evaluation of the risks involved. A record should be kept of thereworking or recovery. A reworked batch should be given a new batch number. 14.30 The introduction of all or part of earlier batches, conforming to the required quality, into a batch of the same product at a dened stage of manu-facture should be authorized beforehand. This recovery should be carried outin accordance with a dened procedure after evaluation of the risks involved,including any possible effect on shelf-life. The recovery should be recorded. 14.31 The need for additional testing of any nished product that has been reprocessed, reworked or into which a recovered product has been incorpo-rated, should be considered by the quality control department.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 37QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 37Recalled products 14.32 Recalled products should be identied and stored separately in a secure area until a decision is taken on their fate. The decision should be made as soonas possible. Returned goods 14.33 Products returned from the market should be destroyed unless it iscertain that their quality is satisfactory; in such cases they may be consideredfor resale or relabelling, or alternative action taken only after they have beencritically assessed by the quality control function in accordance with a writtenprocedure. The nature of the product, any special storage conditions it requires,its condition and history, and the time elapsed since it was issued should all betaken into account in this assessment. Where any doubt arises over the qualityof the product, it should not be considered suitable for reissue or reuse. Anyaction taken should be appropriately recorded. Reagents and culture media 14.34 There should be records for the receipt and preparation of reagents andculture media. 14.35 Reagents made up in the laboratory should be prepared according to written procedures and appropriately labelled. The label should indicate theconcentration, standardization factor, shelf-life, the date when restandardizationis due, and the storage conditions. The label should be signed and dated by theperson preparing the reagent. 14.36 Both positive and negative controls should be applied to verify the suit- ability of culture media each time they are prepared and used. The size of theinoculum used in positive controls should be appropriate to the sensitivityrequired. Reference standards 14.37 Whenever ofcial reference standards exist, these should preferably be used. 14.38 Ofcial reference standards should be used only for the purpose described in the appropriate monograph. 14.39 Reference standards prepared by the producer should be tested, released and stored in the same way as ofcial standards. They should be kept under theresponsibility of a designated person in a secure area.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 38QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 3814.40 Secondary or working standards may be established by the application of appropriate tests and checks at regular intervals to ensure standardization. 14.41 Reference standards should be properly labelled with at least the follow- ing information: 14.42 All in-house reference standards should be standardized against an ofcial reference standard, when available, initially and at regular intervalsthereafter. 14.43 All reference standards should be stored and used in a manner that will not adversely affect their quality. (a) name of the material; (b) batch or lot number and control number;(c) date of preparation;(d) shelf-life;(e) potency;(f) storage conditions. Waste materials 14.44 Provision should be made for the proper and safe storage of waste mate-rials awaiting disposal. Toxic substances and flammable materials should bestored in suitably designed, separate, enclosed cupboards, as required bynational legislation. 14.45 Waste material should not be allowed to accumulate. It should be col- lected in suitable receptacles for removal to collection points outside the build-ings and disposed of safely and in a sanitary manner at regular and frequentintervals. Miscellaneous 14.46 Rodenticides, insecticides, fumigating agents and sanitizing materialsshould not be permitted to contaminate equipment, starting materials, packag-ing materials, in-process materials or nished products. 15. Documentation 15.1 Principle . Good documentation is an essential part of the quality assur- ance system and, as such, should exist for all aspects of GMP . Its aims are todene the specications and procedures for all materials and methods of man-ufacture and control; to ensure that all personnel concerned with manufactureknow what to do and when to do it; to ensure that authorized persons have allthe information necessary to decide whether or not to release a batch of a drugMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 39QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 39for sale, to ensure the existence of documented evidence, traceability, and to provide records and an audit trail that will permit investigation. It ensures theavailability of the data needed for validation, review and statistical analysis. Thedesign and use of documents depend upon the manufacturer. In some casessome or all of the documents described below may be brought together, butthey will usually be separate. General 15.2 Documents should be designed, prepared, reviewed and distributed withcare. They should comply with the relevant parts of the manufacturing and mar-keting authorizations. 15.3 Documents should be approved, signed and dated by the appropriate responsible persons. No document should be changed without authorizationand approval. 15.4 Documents should have unambiguous contents: the title, nature and purpose should be clearly stated. They should be laid out in an orderly fashionand be easy to check. Reproduced documents should be clear and legible. Thereproduction of working documents from master documents must not allow anyerror to be introduced through the reproduction process. 15.5 Documents should be regularly reviewed and kept up to date. When a document has been revised, a system should exist to prevent inadvertent use ofthe superseded version. Superseded documents should be retained for a spe-cic period of time. 15.6 Where documents require the entry of data, these entries should be clear, legible and indelible. Sufcient space should be provided for such entries. 15.7 Any alteration made to a document should be signed and dated; the alter- ation should permit the reading of the original information. Where appropri-ate, the reason for the alteration should be recorded. 15.8 Records should be made or completed when any action is taken and in such a way that all signicant activities concerning the manufacture of pharma-ceutical products are traceable. Records should be retained for at least one yearafter the expiry date of the nished product. 15.9 Data (and records for storage) may be recorded by electronic data-pro- cessing systems or by photographic or other reliable means. Master formulaeand detailed standard operating procedures relating to the system in use shouldbe available and the accuracy of the records should be checked. If documenta-tion is handled by electronic data-processing methods, only authorized personsshould be able to enter or modify data in the computer, and there should be arecord of changes and deletions; access should be restricted by passwords orQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 40QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 40other means and the entry of critical data should be independently checked. Batch records stored electronically should be protected by back-up transfer onmagnetic tape, microlm, paper print-outs or other means. It is particularlyimportant that, during the period of retention, the data are readily available. Documents required Labels 15.10 Labels applied to containers, equipment or premises should be clear, unambiguous and in the company's agreed format. It is often helpful in addi-tion to the wording on the labels to use colours to indicate status (e.g. quaran-tined, accepted, rejected, clean). 15.11 All nished drug products should be identied by labelling, as required by the national legislation, bearing at least the following information: (a) the name of the drug product; (b) a list of the active ingredients (if applicable, with the INNs), showing the amount of each present and a statement of the net contents (e.g. numberof dosage units, weight, volume); (c) the batch number assigned by the manufacturer;(d) the expiry date in an uncoded form;(e) any special storage conditions or handling precautions that may be neces- sary; (f) directions for use, and warnings and precautions that may be necessary;(g) the name and address of the manufacturer or the company or the person responsible for placing the product on the market. 15.12 For reference standards, the label and/or accompanying docu- ment should indicate potency or concentration, date of manufacture, expirydate, date the closure is rst opened, storage conditions and control number, asappropriate. Specications and testing procedures 15.13 Testing procedures described in documents should be validated in the context of available facilities and equipment before they are adopted for routinetesting. 15.14 There should be appropriately authorized and dated specications, including tests on identity, content, purity and quality, for starting and packag-ing materials and for nished products; where appropriate, they should also beavailable for intermediate or bulk products. Specications for water, solventsand reagents (e.g. acids and bases) used in production should be included.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 41QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 4115.15 Each specication should be approved, signed and dated, and maintained by quality control, quality assurance unit or documentation centre. Specica-tions for starting materials, intermediates, and bulk, nished products and pack-aging materials are referred to in sections 15.18-15.21. 15.16 Periodic revisions of the specications may be necessary to comply with new editions of the national pharmacopoeia or other ofcial compendia. 15.17 Pharmacopoeias, reference standards, reference spectra and other refer- ence materials should be available in the quality control laboratory. Specications for starting and packaging materials 15.18 Specications for starting, primary and printed packaging materials should provide, if applicable, a description of the materials, including: (a) the designated name (if applicable, the INN) and internal code reference; (b) the reference, if any, to a pharmacopoeial monograph;(c) qualitative and quantitative requirements with acceptance limits. Depending on the company's practice other data may be added to the speci- cation, such as: (a) the supplier and the original producer of the materials; (b) a specimen of printed materials;(c) directions for sampling and testing, or a reference to procedures;(d) storage conditions and precautions;(e) the maximum period of storage before re-examination. Packaging material should conform to specications, and should be compatible with the material and/or with the drug product it contains. The material shouldbe examined for compliance with the specication, and for defects as well asfor the correctness of identity markings. 15.19 Documents describing testing procedures should state the required fre- quency for re-assaying each starting material, as determined by its stability. Specications for intermediate and bulk products 15.20 Specications for intermediate and bulk products should be available. The specications should be similar to specications for starting materials orfor nished products, as appropriate.

Batch processing records 15.25 A batch processing record should be kept for each batch processed. It should be based on the relevant parts of the currently approved specicationson the record. The method of preparation of such records should be designedto avoid errors. (Copying or validated computer programmes are recommended.Transcribing from approved documents should be avoided.) 15.26 Before any processing begins, a check should be made that the equip- ment and work station are clear of previous products, documents, or materialsnot required for the planned process, and that the equipment is clean and suit-able for use. This check should be recorded. 15.27 During processing, the following information should be recorded at the time each action is taken, and after completion the record should be dated andsigned by the person responsible for the processing operations: (a) the name of the product; (b) the number of the batch being manufactured;(c) dates and times of commencement, of signicant intermediate stages, and of completion of production; (d) the name of the person responsible for each stage of production;(e) the initials of the operator(s) of different signicant steps of production and, where appropriate, of the person(s) who checked each of these oper-ations (e.g. weighing);QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 44QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 44(f) the batch number and/or analytical control number and the quantity of each starting material actually weighed (including the batch number andamount of any recovered or reprocessed material added); (g) any relevant processing operation or event and the major equipment used;(h) the in-process controls performed, the initials of the person(s) carrying them out, and the results obtained; (i) the amount of product obtained at different and pertinent stages of man- ufacture (yield), together with comments or explanations for signicantdeviations from the expected yield; (j) notes on special problems including details, with signed authorization for any deviation from the master formula. Batch packaging records 15.28 A batch packaging record should be kept for each batch or part batch processed. It should be based on the relevant parts of the approved packaginginstructions, and the method of preparing such records should be designed toavoid errors. (Copying or validated computer programmes are recommended.Transcribing from approved documents should be avoided.) 15.29 Before any packaging operation begins, checks should be made that the equipment and work station are clear of previous products, documents or mate-rials not required for the planned packaging operations, and that equipment isclean and suitable for use. These checks should be recorded. 15.30 The following information should be recorded at the time each action is taken, and the date and the person responsible should be clearly identied bysignature or electronic password: (a) the name of the product, the batch number and the quantity of bulk product to be packed, as well as the batch number and the planned quan-tity of nished product that will be obtained, the quantity actually obtainedand the reconciliation; (b) the date(s) and time(s) of the packaging operations;(c) the name of the responsible person carrying out the packaging operation;(d) the initials of the operators of the different signicant steps;(e) the checks made for identity and conformity with the packaging instruc- tions, including the results of in-process controls; (f) details of the packaging operations carried out, including references to equipment and the packaging lines used, and, when necessary, the instruc-tions for keeping the product unpacked or a record of returning productthat has not been packaged to the storage area; (g) whenever possible, samples of the printed packaging materials used, including specimens bearing the approval for the printing of and regularcheck (where appropriate) of the batch number, expiry date, and any addi-tional overprinting;MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 45QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 45(h) notes on any special problems, including details of any deviation from the packaging instructions, with written authorization by an appropriateperson; (i) the quantities and reference number or identication of all printed pack aging materials and bulk product issued, used, destroyed or returned to stock and the quantities of product obtained to permit an adequate reconciliation. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and records 15.31 Standard operating procedures and associated records of actions taken or, where appropriate, conclusions reached should be available for: (a) equipment assembly and validation; (b) analytical apparatus and calibration;(c) maintenance, cleaning and sanitization;(d) personnel matters including qualication, training, clothing and hygiene;(e) environmental monitoring;(f) pest control;(g) complaints;(h) recalls;(i) returns. 15.32 There should be standard operating procedures and records for the receipt of each delivery of starting material and primary and printed packagingmaterial. 15.33 The records of the receipts should include:(a) the name of the material on the delivery note and the containers; (b) the \"in-house\" name and/or code of the material if different from (a);(c) the date of receipt;(d) the supplier's name and, if possible, manufacturer's name;(e) the manufacturer's batch or reference number;(f) the total quantity, and number of containers received;(g) the batch number assigned after receipt;(h) any relevant comment (e.g. state of the containers). 15.34 There should be standard operating procedures for the internal labelling, quarantine and storage of starting materials, packaging materials and othermaterials, as appropriate. 15.35 Standard operating procedures should be available for each instrument and piece of equipment (e.g. use, calibration, cleaning, maintenance) and placedin close proximity to the equipment.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 46QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 4615.36 There should be standard operating procedures for sampling, which specify the person(s) authorized to take samples. 15.37 The sampling instructions should include:(a) the method of sampling and the sampling plan; (b) the equipment to be used;(c) any precautions to be observed to avoid contamination of the material or any deterioration in its quality; (d) the amount(s) of sample(s) to be taken;(e) instructions for any required subdivision of the sample;(f) the type of sample container(s) to be used, and whether they are for aseptic sampling or for normal sampling, and labelling; (g) any specic precautions to be observed, especially in regard to the sam- pling of sterile or noxious material. 15.38 There should be a standard operating procedure describing the details of the batch (lot) numbering system, with the objective of ensuring that eachbatch of intermediate, bulk or nished product is identied with a specic batchnumber. 15.39 The standard operating procedures for batch numbering that are applied to the processing stage and to the respective packaging stage should be relatedto each other. 15.40 The standard operating procedure for batch numbering should ensure that the same batch numbers will not be used repeatedly; this applies also toreprocessing. 15.41 Batch-number allocation should be immediately recorded, e.g. in a logbook. The record should include at least the date of allocation, product iden-tity and size of batch. 15.42 There should be written procedures for testing materials and products at different stages of manufacture, describing the methods and equipment to beused. The tests performed should be recorded. 15.43 Analysis records should include at least the following data:(a) the name of the material or product and, where applicable, dosage form; (b) the batch number and, where appropriate, the manufacturer and/or supplier; (c) references to the relevant specications and testing procedures;(d) test results, including observations and calculations, and reference to any specications (limits); (e) date(s) and reference number(s) of testing;(f) the initials of the persons who performed the testing;MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 47QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 47(g) the date and initials of the persons who veried the testing and the calcu- lations, where appropriate; (h) a clear statement of release or rejection (or other status decision) and the dated signature of the designated responsible person. 15.44 Written release and rejection procedures should be available for materi- als and products, and in particular for the release for sale of the nished productby an authorized person. 15.45 Records should be maintained of the distribution of each batch of a product in order, e.g. to facilitate the recall of the batch if necessary. 15.46 Records should be kept for major and critical equipment, as appropri- ate, of any validations, calibrations, maintenance, cleaning, or repair operations,including dates and the identity of the people who carried these operations out. 15.47 The use of major and critical equipment and the areas where products have been processed should be appropriately recorded in chronological order. 15.48 There should be written procedures assigning responsibility for cleaning and sanitation and describing in sufcient detail the cleaning schedules,methods, equipment and materials to be used and facilities and equipment tobe cleaned. Such written procedures should be followed. 16. Good practices in production 16.1 Principle . Production operations must follow clearly dened procedures in accordance with manufacturing and marketing authorizations, with the objec-tive of obtaining products of the requisite quality. General 16.2 All handling of materials and products, such as receipt and cleaning, quar-antine, sampling, storage, labelling, dispensing, processing, packaging and dis-tribution, should be done in accordance with written procedures or instructionsand, where necessary, recorded. 16.3 Any deviation from instructions or procedures should be avoided as far as possible. If deviations occur, they should be done in accordance with anapproved procedure. The authorization of the deviation should be approved inwriting by a designated person, with the involvement of the quality controldepartment, when appropriate. 16.4 Checks on yields and reconciliation of quantities should be carried out as necessary to ensure that there are no discrepancies outside acceptablelimits.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 48QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 4816.5 Operations on different products should not be carried out simultaneously or consecutively in the same room or area unless there is no risk of mix-up orcross-contamination. 16.6 At all times during processing, all materials, bulk containers, major items of equipment, and where appropriate, the rooms and packaging lines being usedshould be labelled or otherwise identied with an indication of the product ormaterial being processed, its strength (where applicable) and the batch number.Where applicable, this indication should also mention the stage of production.In some cases it may be useful to record also the name of the previous productthat has been processed. 16.7 Access to production premises should be restricted to authorized personnel. 16.8 Normally, non-medicinal products should not be produced in areas or with equipment destined for the production of pharmaceutical products. 16.9 In-process controls are usually performed within the production area. The performance of such in-process controls should not have any negative effecton the quality of the product or another product (e.g. cross-contamination ormix-up). Prevention of cross-contamination and bacterial contamination during production 16.10 When dry materials and products are used in production, special pre- cautions should be taken to prevent the generation and dissemination of dust.Provision should be made for proper air control (e.g. supply and extraction ofair of suitable quality). 16.11 Contamination of a starting material or of a product by another material or product must be avoided. This risk of accidental cross-contamination arisesfrom the uncontrolled release of dust, gases, particles, vapours, sprays or organ-isms from materials and products in process, from residues on equipment, fromintruding insects, and from operators' clothing, skin, etc. The signicance ofthis risk varies with the type of contaminant and of the product being con-taminated. Among the most hazardous contaminants are highly sensitizing materials, biological preparations such as living organisms, certain hormones,cytotoxic substances, and other highly active materials. Products in which con-tamination is likely to be most signicant are those administered by injection orapplied to open wounds and those given in large doses and/or over a long time. 16.12 Cross-contamination should be avoided by taking appropriate technical or organizational measures, for example:MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 49QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 49(a) carrying out production in dedicated and self-contained areas (which may be required for products such as penicillins, live vaccines, live bacterialpreparations and certain other biologicals); (b) conducting campaign production (separation in time) followed by appro- priate cleaning in accordance with a validated cleaning procedure; (c) providing appropriately designed airlocks, pressure differentials, and air supply and extraction systems; (d) minimizing the risk of contamination caused by recirculation or re-entry of untreated or insufciently treated air; (e) wearing protective clothing where products or materials are handled;(f) using cleaning and decontamination procedures of known effectiveness;(g) using a \"closed system\" in production;(h) testing for residues;(i) using cleanliness status labels on equipment. 16.13 Measures to prevent cross-contamination and their effectiveness should be checked periodically according to standard operating procedures. 16.14 Production areas where susceptible products are processed should undergo periodic environmental monitoring (e.g. for microbiological monitor-ing and particulate matter where appropriate). Processing operations 16.15 Before any processing operation is started, steps should be taken toensure that the work area and equipment are clean and free from any startingmaterials, products, product residues, labels or documents not required for thecurrent operation. 16.16 Any necessary in-process controls and environmental controls should be carried out and recorded. 16.17 Means should be instituted of indicating failures of equipment or of ser- vices (e.g. water, gas) to equipment. Defective equipment should be withdrawnfrom use until the defect has been rectied. After use, production equipmentshould be cleaned without delay according to detailed written procedures andstored under clean and dry conditions in a separate area or in a manner thatwill prevent contamination. 16.18 Time limits for storage of equipment after cleaning and before use should be stated and based on data. 16.19 Containers for lling should be cleaned before lling. Attention should be given to avoiding and removing any contaminants such as glass fragmentsand metal particles. 16.20 Any signicant deviation from the expected yield should be recorded and investigated.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 50QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 5016.21 Checks should be carried out to ensure that pipelines and other pieces of equipment used for the transportation of products from one area to anotherare connected in a correct manner. 16.22 Pipes used for conveying distilled or deionized water and, where appro- priate, other water pipes should be sanitized and stored according to writtenprocedures that detail the action limits for microbiological contamination andthe measures to be taken. 16.23 Measuring, weighing, recording, and control equipment and instruments should be serviced and calibrated at prespecied intervals and records main-tained. To ensure satisfactory functioning, instruments should be checked dailyor prior to use for performing analytical tests. The date of calibration and ser-vicing and the date when recalibration is due should be clearly indicated, prefer-ably on a label attached to the instrument. 16.24 Repair and maintenance operations should not present any hazard to the quality of the products. Packaging operations 16.25 When the programme for packaging operations is being set up, parti-cular attention should be given to minimizing the risk of cross-contamination,mix-ups or substitutions. Different products should not be packaged in closeproximity unless there is physical segregation or an alternative system that willprovide equal assurance. 16.26 Before packaging operations are begun, steps should be taken to ensure that the work area, packaging lines, printing machines and other equipment areclean and free from any products, materials or documents used previously andwhich are not required for the current operation. The line clearance should beperformed according to an appropriate procedure and checklist, and recorded. 16.27 The name and batch number of the product being handled should be displayed at each packaging station or line. 16.28 Normally, lling and sealing should be followed as quickly as possible by labelling. If labelling is delayed, appropriate procedures should be applied toensure that no mix-ups or mislabelling can occur. 16.29 The correct performance of any printing (e.g. of code numbers or expiry dates) done separately or in the course of the packaging should be checked andrecorded. Attention should be paid to printing by hand, which should berechecked at regular intervals. 16.30 Special care should be taken when cut labels are used and when over- printing is carried out off-line, and in hand-packaging operations. Roll-feedlabels are normally preferable to cut labels in helping to avoid mix-ups. On-lineMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 51QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 51verication of all labels by automated electronic means can be helpful in pre- venting mix-ups, but checks should be made to ensure that any electronic codereaders, label counters, or similar devices are operating correctly. When labelsare attached manually, in-process control checks should be performed more frequently. 16.31 Printed and embossed information on packaging materials should be dis- tinct and resistant to fading or erasing. 16.32 Regular on-line control of the product during packaging should include at least checks on: (a) the general appearance of the packages; (b) whether the packages are complete;(c) whether the correct products and packaging materials are used;(d) whether any overprinting is correct;(e) the correct functioning of line monitors. Samples taken away from the packaging line should not be returned.16.33 Products that have been involved in an unusual event during packaging should be reintroduced into the process only after special inspection, investi-gation and approval by authorized personnel. A detailed record should be keptof this operation. 16.34 Any signicant or unusual discrepancy observed during reconciliation of the amount of bulk product and printed packaging materials and the numberof units produced should be investigated, satisfactorily accounted for, andrecorded before release. 16.35 Upon completion of a packaging operation, any unused batch-coded packaging materials should be destroyed and the destruction recorded. A doc-umented procedure requiring checks to be performed before returning unusedmaterials should be followed if uncoded printed materials are returned to stock. 17. Good practices in quality control 17.1 Quality control is the part of GMP concerned with sampling, specica-tions and testing, and with the organization, documentation and release proce-dures which ensure that the necessary and relevant tests are actually carried outand that materials are not released for use, nor products released for sale orsupply, until their quality has been judged to be satisfactory. Quality control isnot conned to laboratory operations but must be involved in all decisions con-cerning the quality of the product. 17.2 The independence of quality control from production is considered fundamental.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 52QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 5217.3 Each manufacturer (the holder of a manufacturing authorization) should have a quality control function. The quality control function should be inde-pendent of other departments and under the authority of a person with appro-priate qualications and experience, who has one or several control laboratoriesat his or her disposal. Adequate resources must be available to ensure that allthe quality control arrangements are effectively and reliably carried out. Thebasic requirements for quality control are as follows: (a) adequate facilities, trained personnel and approved procedures must be available for sampling, inspecting, and testing starting materials, packag-ing materials, and intermediate, bulk, nished products, and where appro-priate for monitoring environmental conditions for GMP purposes; (b) samples of starting materials, packaging materials, intermediate products, bulk products and nished products must be taken by methods and per-sonnel approved of by the quality control department; (c) qualication and validation must be performed;(d) records must be made (manually and/or by recording instruments) demon- strating that all the required sampling, inspecting and testing procedureshave actually been carried out and that any deviations have been fullyrecorded and investigated; (e) the nished products must contain ingredients complying with the quali- tative and quantitative composition of the product described in the mar-keting authorization; the ingredients must be of the required purity, in theirproper container and correctly labelled; (f) records must be made of the results of inspecting and testing the materi- als and intermediate, bulk and nished products against specications;pro- duct assessment must include a review and evaluation of the relevantproduction documentation and an assessment of deviations from speciedprocedures; (g) no batch of product is to be released for sale or supply prior to certica- tion by the authorized person(s) that it is in accordance with the require-ments of the marketing authorization. In certain countries, by law, thebatch release is a task of the authorized person from production togetherwith the author- ized person from quality control; (h) sufcient samples of starting materials and products must be retained to permit future examination of the product if necessary; the retainedproduct must be kept in its nal pack unless the pack is exceptionally large. 17.4 Quality control as a whole will also have other duties, such as to establish, validate and implement all quality control procedures, to evaluate, maintain, andstore the reference standards for substances, to ensure the correct labelling of containers of materials and products, to ensure that the stability of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and products is monitored, to participate in the investigation of complaints related to the quality of the product, and toMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 53QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 53participate in environmental monitoring. All these operations should be carried out in accordance with written procedures and, where necessary, recorded. 17.5 Assessment of nished products should embrace all relevant factors, including the production conditions, the results of in-process testing, the man-ufacturing (including packaging) documentation, compliance with the speci-cation for the nished product, and an examination of the nished pack. 17.6 Quality control personnel must have access to production areas for sam- pling and investigation as appropriate. Control of starting materials and intermediate, bulk and nished products 17.7 All tests should follow the instructions given in the relevant written test procedure for each material or product. The result should be checked by thesupervisor before the material or product is released or rejected. 17.8 Samples should be representative of the batches of material from which they are taken in accordance with the approved written procedure. 17.9 Sampling should be carried out so as to avoid contamination or other adverse effects on quality. The containers that have been sampled should bemarked accordingly and carefully resealed after sampling. 17.10 Care should be taken during sampling to guard against contamination or mix-up of, or by, the material being sampled. All sampling equipment thatcomes into contact with the material should be clean. Some particularly hazardous or potent materials may require special precautions. 17.11 Sampling equipment should be cleaned and, if necessary, sterilized before and after each use and stored separately from other laboratory equipment. 17.12 Each sample container should bear a label indicating:17.13 Out-of-specication results obtained during testing of materials or prod- ucts should be investigated in accordance with an approved procedure. Recordsshould be maintained. (a) the name of the sampled material; (b) the batch or lot number;(c) the number of the container from which the sample has been taken;(d) the number of the sample;(e) the signature of the person who has taken the sample;(f) the date of sampling.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 54QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 54Test requirements Starting and packaging materials 17.14 Before releasing a starting or packaging material for use, the quality control manager should ensure that the materials have been tested forconformity with specications for identity, strength, purity and other qualityparameters. 17.15 An identity test should be conducted on a sample from each container of starting material (see also section 14.14). It is permissible to sample only a proportion of the containers where a val- idated procedure has been established to ensure that no single container of start-ing material has been incorrectly labelled. This validation should take account of at least the following aspects: \u2014 the nature and status of the manufacturer and of the supplier and their understanding of the GMP requirements; \u2014 the quality assurance system of the manufacturer of the starting material;\u2014 the manufacturing conditions under which the starting material is produced and controlled; and \u2014 the nature of the starting material and the medicinal products in which it will be used. Under such a system it is possible that a validated procedure for exemption from the requirement for identity testing of each incoming container of startingmaterial could be accepted for the following: \u2014 starting materials coming from a single product manufacturer or plant; or \u2014 starting materials coming directly from a manufacturer, or in the manufac- turer's sealed container where there is a history of reliability, and regularaudits of the manufacturer's quality assurance system are conducted by thepurchaser (the manufacturer of the medicinal product) or by an ofciallyaccredited body. It is improbable that such a procedure could be satisfactorily validated for either: \u2014 starting materials supplied by intermediaries, such as brokers, where the source of manufacture is unknown or not audited; or \u2014 starting materials for use in parenteral products. 17.16 Each batch (lot) of printed packaging materials must be examined fol- lowing receipt. 17.17 In lieu of testing by the manufacturer, a certicate of analysis may be accepted from the supplier, provided that the manufacturer establishes the reli-ability of the supplier's analysis through appropriate periodic validation of thesupplier's test results (see sections 8.8 and 8.9) and through on-site audits of theMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 55QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 55supplier's capabilities. (This does not affect section 17.15.) Certicates must be originals (not photocopies) or otherwise have their authenticity assured. Cer-ticates must contain at least the following information ( 6): (a) identication (name and address) of the issuing supplier; (b) signature of the competent ofcial, and statement of his or her qualica- tions; (c) the name of the material tested;(d) the batch number of the material tested;(e) the specications and methods used;(f) the test results obtained;(g) the date of testing. In-process control 17.18 In-process control records should be maintained and form a part of the batch records (see section 15.25). Finished products 17.19 For each batch of drug product, there should be an appropriate labora- tory determination of satisfactory conformity to its nished product specica-tion prior to release. 17.20 Products failing to meet the established specications or any other rele- vant quality criteria should be rejected. Batch record review 17.21 Production and quality control records should be reviewed as part of theapproval process of batch release. Any divergence or failure of a batch to meetits specications should be thoroughly investigated. The investigation should, ifnecessary, extend to other batches of the same product and other products thatmay have been associated with the specic failure or discrepancy. A writtenrecord of the investigation should be made and should include the conclusionand follow-up action. 17.22 Retention samples from each batch of nished product should be kept for at least one year after the expiry date. Finished products should usually bekept in their nal packaging and stored under the recommended conditions. Ifexceptionally large packages are produced, smaller samples might be stored inappropriate containers. Samples of active starting materials should be retainedfor at least one year beyond the expiry date of the corresponding nishedproduct. Other starting materials (other than solvents, gases, and water) shouldbe retained for a minimum of two years if their stability allows. RetentionQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 56QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 56samples of materials and products should be of a size sufcient to permit at least two full re-examinations. Stability studies 17.23 Quality control should evaluate the quality and stability of nished phar-maceutical products and, when necessary, of starting materials and intermedi-ate products. 17.24 Quality control should establish expiry dates and shelf-life specications on the basis of stability tests related to storage conditions. 17.25 A written programme for ongoing stability determination should be developed and implemented to include elements such as: (a) a complete description of the drug involved in the study; (b) the complete set of testing parameters and methods, describing all tests for potency, purity, and physical characteristics and documented evidencethat these tests indicate stability; (c) provision for the inclusion of a sufcient number of batches;(d) the testing schedule for each drug;(e) provision for special storage conditions;(f) provision for adequate sample retention;(g) a summary of all the data generated, including the evaluation and the con- clusions of the study. 17.26 Stability should be determined prior to marketing and following any sig- nicant changes in processes, equipment, packaging materials, etc. References 1.

Introduction Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) play an important role in ensuring the manufacture of quality pharmaceutical products. A well designedHVAC system will also provide comfortable conditions for operators. Theseguidelines mainly focus on recommendations for systems for manufacturers ofsolid dosage forms. The guidelines also refer to other systems or componentswhich are not relevant to solid dosage form manufacturing plants, but whichmay assist in providing a comparison between the requirements for solid dosage-form plants and other systems. HVAC system design influences architectural layouts with regard to items such as airlock positions, doorways and lobbies. The architectural componentshave an effect on room pressure differential cascades and cross-con-taminationcontrol. The prevention of contamination and cross-contamina-tion is an essen-tial design consideration of the HVAC system. In view of these critical aspects,the design of the HVAC system should be considered at the concept designstage of a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. Temperature, relative humidity and ventilation should be appropriate and should not adversely affect the quality of pharmaceutical products during theirmanufacture and storage, or the accurate functioning of equipment. This document aims to give guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers and inspectors of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities on the design, installation,qualication and maintenance of the HVAC systems. These guidelines areintended to complement those provided in Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products (1) and should be read in conjunction with the parent guide. The additional standards addressed by the present guidelines shouldtherefore be considered supplementary to the general requirements set out inthe parent guide. 2. Scope of document These guidelines focus primarily on the design and good manufacturing prac-tices (GMP) requirements for HVAC systems for facilities for the manufactureof solid dosage forms. Most of the system design principles for facilities manufacturing solid dosage forms also apply to other facilities such as thosemanufacturing liquids, creams and ointments. These guidelines do not coverrequirements for manufacturing sites for the production of sterile pharmaceu-tical products. These guidelines are intended as a basic guide for use by GMP inspectors. They are not intended to be prescriptive in specifying requirements and designparameters. There are many parameters affecting a clean area condition and itis, therefore, difcult to lay down the specic requirements for one particularparameter in isolation. Many manufacturers have their own engineering design and qualication standards and requirements may vary from one manufacturer to the next.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 59QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 59Design parameters should, therefore, be set realistically for each project, with a view to creating a cost-effective design, yet still complying with all regulatorystandards and ensuring that product quality and safety are not compromised. The three primary aspects addressed in this manual are the roles that the HVAC system plays in product protection, personnel protection and environ-mental protection (Fig. 1).QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 60GMP, Good manufacturing practice.GMP MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT Contamination (product & staff)Prevent contact with dust Avoid dust discharge Protect from product cross-contamination Prevent contact with fumesAvoid fume discharge Correct temperature & humidity Acceptable comfort conditionsAvoid effluent discharge SYSTEMS SYSTEM VALIDATION PRODUCT PROTECTIONPERSONNEL PROTECTIONENVIRONMENT PROTECTIONFigure 1.

Glossary The denitions given below apply to terms used in these guidelines. They may have different meanings in other contexts. acceptance criteria Measurable terms under which a test result will be considered acceptable. action limit The action limit is reached when the acceptance criteria of a critical parameterhave been exceeded. Results outside these limits will require specied actionand investigation. air-handling unit (AHU) The air-handling unit serves to condition the air and provide the required airmovement within a facility. airlock An enclosed space with two or more doors, which is interposed between twoor more rooms, e.g. of differing classes of cleanliness, for the purpose of controlling the airflow between those rooms when they need to be entered. Anairlock is designed for and used by either people or goods (PAL, personnelairlock; MAL, material airlock). alert limit The alert limit is reached when the normal operating range of a critical para-meter has been exceeded, indicating that corrective measures may need to betaken to prevent the action limit being reached. as-built Condition where the installation is complete with all services connected andfunctioning but with no production equipment, materials or personnel present. at-rest Condition where the installation is complete with equipment installed and operating in a manner agreed upon by the customer and supplier, but with nopersonnel present. central air-conditioning unit (see air-handling unit) change control A formal system by which qualied representatives of appropriate disciplines review proposed or actual changes that might affect a validated status.

Protection 4.1 Product and personnel 4.1.1 Areas for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, where pharmaceuticalstarting materials and products, utensils and equipment are exposed to the envi-ronment, should be classied as \"clean areas\". 4.1.2 The achievement of a particular clean area classication depends on a number of criteria that should be addressed at the design and qualicationstages. A suitable balance between the different criteria will be required in orderto create an efcient clean area. 4.1.3 Some of the basic criteria to be considered should include: building nishes and structure air ltration air change rate or flushing rateMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 65QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 65 room pressure location of air terminals and directional airflow temperature humidity material flow personnel flow equipment movement process being carried out outside air conditions occupancy type of product. 4.1.4 Air ltration and air change rates should ensure that the dened clean area classication is attained. 4.1.5 The air change rates should be determined by the manufacturer and designer, taking into account the various critical parameters. Primarily theair change rate should be set to a level that will achieve the required clean areaclassication. 4.1.6 Air change rates normally vary between 6 and 20 air changes per hour and are normally determined by the following considerations: level of protection required the quality and ltration of the supply air particulates generated by the manufacturing process particulates generated by the operators conguration of the room and air supply and extract locations sufcient air to achieve containment effect sufcient air to cope with the room heat load sufcient air to maintain the required room pressure. 4.1.7 In classifying the environment, the manufacturer should state whether this is achieved under \"as-built\" (Fig. 2), \"at-rest\" (Fig. 3) or \"operational\" (Fig. 4)conditions. 4.1.8 Room classication tests in the \"as-built\" condition should be carried out on the bare room, in the absence of any equipment or personnel. 4.1.9 Room classication tests in the \"at-rest\" condition should be carried out with the equipment operating where relevant, but without any operators.Because of the amounts of dust usually generated in a solid dosage facility mostclean area classications are rated for the \"at-rest\" condition. 4.1.10 Room classication tests in the \"operational\" condition should be carried out during the normal production process with equipment operating,and the normal number of personnel present in the room.

The clean-up time should be determined through validation and is generally of the order of20 minutes. 4.1.11 Materials and products should be protected from contamination and cross-contamination during all stages of manufacture (see also section 5.5 forcross-contamination control). Note: contaminants may result from inappropri- ate premises (e.g. poor design, layout or nishing), poor cleaning procedures,contaminants brought in by personnel, and a poor HVAC system. 4.1.12 Airborne contaminants should be controlled through effective ventilation. 4.1.13 External contaminants should be removed by effective ltration of the supply air. (See Fig. 5 for an example of a shell-like building layout to enhancecontainment and protection from external contaminants.) 4.1.14 Internal contaminants should be controlled by dilution and flushing of contaminants in the room, or by displacement airflow. (See Figs 6 and 7 forexamples of methods for the flushing of airborne contaminants.) 4.1.15 Airborne particulates and the degree of ltration should be considered critical parameters with reference to the level of product protection required.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 68 In operationSupply air Return 4. \"Operational\" ConditionQAP1 Page 68MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 69Note: The process core is regarded as the most stringently controlled clean zone which is protected by being surrounded by clean areas of a lower classi cation.E EOutdoor environment Ancilliary areas Transition zones Clean areas Process core Material transport Final product transportPersonnel movementPersonnel movement WasteFigure 5.

Good preltration extends the life of the moreexpensive lters downstream. 4.2.4 Materials for components of an HVAC system should be selected with care so that they do not become the source of contamination. Any componentwith the potential for liberating particulate or microbial contamination into theair stream should be located upstream of the nal lters. 4.2.5 Ventilation dampers, lters and other services should be designed and positioned so that they are accessible from outside the manufacturing areas (service voids or service corridors) for maintenance purposes.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 71Level Condition Example of area Level 1 General Area with normal housekeeping and maintenance, e.g. ware- housing, secondary packing Level 2 Protected Area in which steps are taken to protect the exposed phar- maceutical starting material or product from contamination or degradation, e.g. manufacturing, primary packing, dispensing Level 3 Controlled Area in which speci c environmental conditions are de ned, controlled and monitored to prevent contamination or degra- dation of the pharmaceutical starting material or product Note: The lter classi cations referred to above relate to the EN1822 and EN779 test standards (EN 779 relates to lter classes G1 to F9 and EN 1822 relates to lter classes H10 to U16).Level of protection Recommended fi ltration Level 1 Primary lters only (e.g. EN779 G4 lters) Level 2 and 3 Production facility operating on 100% outside air: primary plus secondary lters (e.g. EN779 G4 plus F8 lters) Level 2 and 3 Production facility operating on recirculated plus ambient air, where potential for cross-contamination exists: Primary plus sec- ondary plus relate to the EN1822 and EN779 test standards (EN 779 relates to lter classes G1 to F9 and EN 1822 relates to lter classes H10 to U16).Table 1.

PM Page 72MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 734.2.6 Personnel should not be a source of contamination. 4.2.7 Directional airflow within production or packing areas should assist in preventing contamination. Airflows should be planned in conjunction withoperator locations, so as to minimize contamination of the product by the oper-ator and also to protect the operator from dust inhalation. 4.2.8 HVAC air distribution components should be designed, installed and located to prevent contaminants generated within the room from being spread. 4.2.9 Supply air diffusers of the high induction type (e.g. those typically used for ofce-type air-conditioning) should where possible not be used in clean areaswhere dust is liberated. Air diffusers should be of the non-induction type, intro-ducing air with the least amount of induction so as to maximize the flushingeffect. (See Figs 9-11 for illustrations of the three types of diffuser.) 4.2.10 Whenever possible, air should be exhausted from a low level in rooms to help provide a flushing effect. 4.3 Unidirectional airflow 4.3.1 Unidirectional airflow (UDAF) should be used where appropriate toprovide product protection by supplying a clean air supply over the product,minimizing the ingress of contaminants from surrounding areas. Induced room air mixing with supply airNormal of ce- type diffuser with coanda airSwirl diffuser Return airFigure 744.3.2 Where appropriate, the unidirectional airflow should also provide pro- tection to the operator from contamination by the product. 4.3.3 Sampling of materials such as starting materials, primary packaging mate- rials and products, should be carried out in the same environmental conditionsthat are required for the further processing of the product. 4.3.4 In a weighing booth situation, the aim of the design using UDAF should be to provide dust containment. 4.3.5 A dispensary or weighing booth should be provided with unidirectional airflow for protection of the product and operator. 4.3.6 The source of the dust and the position in which the operator normally stands should be determined before deciding on the direction of unidirectionalflow. Example: In Fig. 12 the dust generated at the weighing station is immediately extracted through the perforated worktop, thus protecting the operator fromdust inhalation, but at the same time protecting the product from contamina-tion by the operator by means of the vertical unidirectional airflow stream.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS fl ow distributorSupply air protection at weighing stationQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 75QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 764.3.7 The unidirectional flow velocity should be such that it does not disrupt the sensitivity of balances in weighing areas. Where necessary the velocity maybe reduced to prevent inaccuracies during weighing, provided that sufcientairflow is maintained to provide containment. 4.3.8 The position in which the operator stands relative to the source of dust liberation and airflow should be determined to ensure that the operator isnot in the path of an airflow that could lead to contamination of the product(Fig. 13). 4.3.9 Once the system has been designed and qualied with a specic layout for operators and processes, this should be maintained in accordance with anSOP . 4.3.10 There should be no obstructions in the path of a unidirectional flow airstream that may cause the operator to be exposed to dust. Fig. 14 illustrates the incorrect use of a weighing scale which has a solid back. The back of the weighing scale should not block the return air path as this causesair to rise vertically, resulting in a hazardous situation for the operator. Fig. 15 illustrates a situation where an open bin is placed below a vertical uni- directional flow distributor. The downward airflow should be prevented fromentering the bin, and then being forced to rise again, as this would carry dustup towards the operator's face. Fig. 16 shows that a solid worktop can sometimes cause deflection of the verti- cal unidirectional airflow resulting in a flow reversal. A possible solution wouldbe to have a 100 mm gap between the back of the table and the wall, with theair being extracted here. 4.3.11 The manufacturer should select either vertical or horizontal unidirec- tional flow (Fig. 17) and an appropriate airflow pattern to provide the best pro-tection for the particular application. 4.4 Inltration 4.4.1 Air inltration of unltered air into a pharmaceutical plant should not bethe source of contamination. 4.4.2 Manufacturing facilities should be maintained at a positive pressure rela- tive to the outside, to limit the ingress of contaminants. Where facilities are tobe maintained at negative pressures relative to the ambient pressure to preventthe escape of harmful products to the outside (such as penicillin and hormones),special precautions should be taken. 4.4.3 The location of the negative pressure facility should be carefully consid- ered with reference to the areas surrounding it, particular attention being givento ensuring that the building structure is well sealed.QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page Horizontal UDAF Powder protection by horizontal airflowQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 77QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 78 Powder containerFloor scaleFigure 15.

The pressure cascade should be such thatthe direction of airflow is from the clean corridor into the cubicles, resulting indust containment. 4.5.3 The corridor should be maintained at a higher pressure than the cubicles, and the cubicles at a higher pressure than atmospheric pressure. 4.5.4 Containment can normally be achieved by application of the displacement concept (low pressure differential, high airflow), or the pressure differentialconcept (high pressure differential, low airflow), or the physical barrier concept. 4.5.5 The pressure cascade regime and the direction of airflow should be appro- priate to the product and processing method used. 4.5.6 Highly potent products should be manufactured under a pressure cascade regime that is negative relative to atmospheric pressure. 4.5.7 The pressure cascade for each facility should be individually assessed according to the product handled and level of protection required. 4.5.8 Building structure should be given special attention to accommodate the pressure cascade design. 4.5.9 Airtight ceilings and walls, close tting doors and sealed light ttings should be in place. Displacement concept (low pressure differential, high airflow) Note: This method of containment is not the preferred method, as the measurement and monitoring of airflow velocities in doorways is difcult. Thisconcept should ideally be applied in production processes where large amountsof dust are generated. 4.5.10 Under this concept the air should be supplied to the corridor, flow through the doorway, and be extracted from the back of the cubicle. Normallythe cubicle door should be closed and the air should enter the cubicle througha door grille, although the concept can be applied to an opening without a door.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 80QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 804.5.11 The velocity should be high enough to prevent turbulence within the doorway resulting in dust escaping. 4.5.12 This displacement airflow should be calculated as the product of the door area and the velocity, which generally results in fairly large air quantities. Pressure differential concept (high pressure differential, low airflow) Note: The pressure differential concept may normally be used in zones where little or no dust is being generated. It may be used alone or in combination withother containment control techniques and concepts, such as a double doorairlock. 4.5.13 The high pressure differential between the clean and less clean zones should be generated by leakage through the gaps of the closed doors to thecubicle. 4.5.14 The pressure differential should be of sufcient magnitude to ensure containment and prevention of flow reversal, but should not be so high as tocreate turbulence problems. 4.5.15 In considering room pressure differentials, transient variations, such as machine extract systems, should be taken into consideration.Note: The most widely accepted pressure differential for achieving containment between two adjacent zones is 15 Pa, but pressure differentials of between 5 Paand 20 Pa may be acceptable. Where the design pressure differential is too lowand tolerances are at opposite extremities, a flow reversal can take place. Forexample, where a control tolerance of \u00b13 Pa is specied, the implications of the upper and lower tolerances on containment should be evaluated. 4.5.16 The pressure differential between adjacent rooms could be considered a critical parameter, depending on the outcome of risk analysis. The limits forthe pressure differential between adjacent areas should be such that there is norisk of overlap, e.g. 5 Pa to 15 Pa in one room and 15 Pa to 30 Pa in an adjacentroom, resulting in no pressure cascade, if the rst room is at the maximum tol-erance and the second room is at the minimum tolerance. 4.5.17 Low pressure differentials may be acceptable when airlocks (pressure sinks or pressure bubbles) are used. 4.5.18 The effect of room pressure tolerances are illustrated in Fig. 18.4.5.19 The pressure control and monitoring devices used should be calibrated and qualied. Compliance with specications should be regularly veried andthe results recorded. Pressure control devices should be linked to an alarmsystem set according to the levels determined by a risk analysis.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 81QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM ASSURANCE Tablets compr.Tablets compr.EncapsulationProduction corridor Production corridorDesign condition (15 Pa differential) Maximum differential (21 Pa differential)Minimum differential (9 Pa differential)Air lock Air lockAir lockTablets compr.Encapsulation 15 Pa \u00b1 3 Pa 15 Pa \u00b1 3 Pa 15 Pa \u00b1 3 Pa 15 Pa 12 Pa 12 Pa 12 PaTablets compr.Tablets compr.Encapsulation 18 Pa 18 Pa 18 Pa 12 Pa33 Pa 27 Pa 18 Pa30 Pa \u00b1 3 PaFigure 18. Examples of pressure cascades 4.5.20 Manual control systems, where used, should be set up during commis- sioning and should not change unless other system conditions change. 4.5.21 Airlocks can be important components in setting up and maintaining pressure cascade systems. 4.5.22 Airlocks with different pressure cascade regimes include the cascade airlock, sink airlock and bubble airlock (Figs 19-21). Cascade airlock: high pressure on one side of the airlock and low pressure on the other. Sink airlock: low pressure inside the airlock and high pressure on both outer sides. Bubble airlock: high pressure inside the airlock and low pressure on both outer sides. 4.5.23 Doors should open to the high pressure side, and be provided with self- closers. Door closer springs, if used, should be designed to hold the door closedand prevent the pressure differential from pushing the door open. Sliding doorsare not recommended. 4.5.24 Central dust extraction systems should be interlocked with the appro- priate air handling systems, to ensure that they operate simultaneously.QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 82MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 83MAL, Material airlock.M A L aP 03 aP 5.22 aP 51 L L L = Leakage air flowMalFigure 19.

Where humidication isrequired, this should be achieved by appropriate means such as the injection of steam into the air stream. A product-contamination assessment should bedone to determine whether pure or clean steam is required for the purposes ofhumidication. 4.6.11 Where steam humidiers are used, chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors or chelating agents, which could have a detrimental effect on theproduct, should not be added to the boiler system. 4.6.12 Humidication systems should be well drained. No condensate should accumulate in air-handling systems. 4.6.13 Other humidication appliances such as evaporative systems, atomizers and water mist sprays, should not be used because of the potential risk of micro-bial contamination.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 85QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 854.6.14 Duct material in the vicinity of the humidier should not add contami- nants to air that will not be ltered downstream. 4.6.15 Air lters should not be installed immediately downstream of humidiers. 4.6.16 Cold surfaces should be insulated to prevent condensation within the clean area or on air-handling components. 4.6.17 When specifying relative humidity, the associated temperature should also be specied. 4.6.18 Chemical driers using silica gel or lithium chloride are acceptable, pro- vided that they do not become sources of contamination. 5. Dust control 5.1 Wherever possible, the dust or vapour contamination should be removedat source. Point-of-use extraction, i.e. as close as possible to the point where thedust is generated, should be employed. 5.2 Point-of-use extraction should be either in the form of a xed high veloc- ity extraction point or an articulated arm with movable hood or a xed extrac-tion hood. 5.3 Dust extraction ducting should be designed with sufcient transfer veloc- ity to ensure that dust is carried away, and does not settle in the ducting. 5.4 The required transfer velocity should be determined: it is dependent on the density of the dust (the denser the dust, the higher the transfer velocity shouldbe, e.g. 15-20 m/s). 5.5 Airflow direction should be carefully chosen, to ensure that the operator does not contaminate the product, and so that the operator is not put at risk bythe product. 5.6 Dust-related hazards to which the operators may be subjected should be assessed. An analysis of the type of dust and toxicity thereof should be doneand the airflow direction determined accordingly. 5.7 Point extraction alone is usually not sufcient to capture all of the conta- minants, and general directional airflow should be used to assist in removingdust and vapours from the room. 5.8 Typically, in a room operating with turbulent airflow, the air should be intro- duced from ceiling diffusers and extracted from the room at low level to helpgive a flushing effect in the room. 5.9 The low-level extraction should assist in drawing air downwards and away from the operator's face. The extract grilles should be positioned strategicallyQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 86QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 86to draw air away from the operator, but at the same time to prevent the opera- tor from contaminating the product. 5.10 When planning the system for the extraction of vapours, the density of the vapour should be taken into account. If the vapour is lighter than air, the extractgrilles should be at a high level, or possibly at both high and low levels. 5.11 When dealing with particularly harmful products, additional steps, such as handling the products in glove boxes or using barrier isolator technology,should be used. 5.12 When working with exposed products such as hormones or highly potent products, operators should wear totally enclosed garments, as indicated in Fig. 22. Operators should also be equipped with an air-breathing system thatprovides a supply of ltered and conditioned air. The air supply to this type ofbreathing apparatus should normally be through an air compressor. Filtration,temperature and humidity need to be controlled to ensure operator safety andcomfort. 5.13 The rates at which fresh air is supplied to the facility should comply with national, regional and/or international regulations, to provide operators with anacceptable level of comfort and safety and also to remove odours or fumes.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 87 Figure 22.

Protection of the environment 6.1 Dust in exhaust air 6.1.1 Exhaust air discharge points on pharmaceutical equipment and facilities,such as from fluid bed driers and tablet-coating equipment, and exhaust air fromdust extraction systems, carry heavy dust loads and should be provided withadequate ltration to prevent contamination of the ambient air. 6.1.2 Where the powders are not highly potent, nal lters on a dust exhaust system should be ne dust lters with a lter classication of F9 according toEN779 lter standards. 6.1.3 Where harmful substances such as penicillin, hormones, toxic powders and enzymes are manufactured, the nal lters on the dust exhaust systemshould be HEPA lters with at least an H12 classication according to EN1822lter standards, as appropriate. 6.1.4 For exhaust systems where the discharge contaminant is considered par- ticularly hazardous, it may be necessary to install two banks of HEPA lters inseries, to provide additional protection should the rst lter fail. 6.1.5 When handling hazardous compounds, safe-change lter housings, also called \"bag-in-bag-out\" lters, should be used. 6.1.6 All lter banks should be provided with pressure differential indication gauges to indicate the lter dust loading. 6.1.7 Filter pressure gauges should be marked with the clean lter resistance and the change-out lter resistance. 6.1.8 Exhaust lters should be monitored regularly to prevent excessive lter loading that could force dust particles through the lter media, or could causethe lters to burst, resulting in contamination of the ambient air. 6.1.9 Sophisticated computer-based data monitoring systems may be installed, with which preventive maintenance is planned by trend logging (This type ofsystem is commonly referred to as a building management system (BMS), build-ing automation system (BAS) or system control and data acquisition (SCADA)system.) 6.1.10 An automated monitoring system should be capable of indicating any out-of-specication condition without delay by means of an alarm or similarsystem. 6.1.11 Where reverse-pulse dust collectors are used for removing dust from dust extraction systems, they should usually be equipped with cartridge ltersQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 88QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 88containing a compressed air lance, and be capable of continuous operation without interrupting the airflow. 6.1.12 Alternative types of dust collectors (such as those operating with a mechanical shaker, requiring that the fan be switched off when the mechanicalshaker is activated) should be used in such a manner that there is no risk ofcross-contamination. There should be no disruption of airflow during a pro-duction run as the loss of airflow could disrupt the pressure cascade. 6.1.13 Mechanical-shaker dust collectors should not be used for applications where continuous airflow is required. 6.1.14 When wet scrubbers are used, the dust-slurry should be removed by a suitable drainage system. 6.1.15 The quality of the exhaust air should be determined to see whether the ltration efciency is adequate with all types of dust collectors and wetscrubbers. 6.1.16 Where necessary, additional ltration may be provided downstream of the dust collector. 6.2 Fume removal 6.2.1 The systems for fume, dust and effluent control should be designed,installed and operated in such a manner that they do not become possiblesources of contamination or cross- contamination, e.g. an exhaust-air dischargepoint located close to the HVAC system fresh air inlet. 6.2.2 Fumes should be removed by means of wet scrubbers or dry chemical scrubbers (deep-bed scrubbers). 6.2.3 Wet scrubbers for fume removal normally require the addition of various chemicals to the water to increase the adsorption efciency. 6.2.4 Deep-bed scrubbers should be designed with activated carbon lters or granular chemical adsorption media. The chemical media for deep-bed scrub-bers should be specic to the effluent being treated. 6.2.5 The type and quantity of the vapours to be removed should be known to enable the appropriate lter media, as well as the volume of media required tobe determined. 7. HVAC systems and components Note: The required degree of air cleanliness in most OSD manufacturing facil- ities can normally be achieved without the use of high-efciency particulate air(HEPA) lters, provided the air is not recirculated. Many open product zonesMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 89QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 89of OSD form facilities are capable of meeting ISO 14644-1 Class 8, \"at-rest\" condition, measured against particle sizes of 0.5 m and 5 m, but cleanliness may not be classied as such by manufacturers. 7.1 General 7.1.1 There should be no failure of a supply air fan, return air fan, exhaust airfan or dust extract system fan. Failure can cause a system imbalance, resultingin a pressure cascade malfunction with a resultant airflow reversal. 7.1.2 A schematic diagram of the airflow for a typical system serving a low humidity suite is represented in Fig. 23. 7.1.3 Air should be dried with a chemical drier (e.g. a rotating desiccant wheel which is continuously regenerated by means of passing hot air through onesegment of the wheel). 7.1.4 The gure illustrates the chemical drier handling part of the fresh air/ return air mixture on a by-pass flow. The location of the chemical drier shouldbe considered in the design phase. Examples of appropriate locations include:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 90HEPA, hi Page 90\u2014 full flow of \u2014 partial handling of fresh/return air air only;\u2014 fresh air only; or\u2014 pre-cooled air with any of the above alternatives. 7.1.5 Possible additional components that may be required should be consid- ered depending on the climatic conditions and locations. These may includeitems such as: \u2014 frost coils on fresh air inlets in very cold climates to preheat the air; \u2014 snow eliminators to prevent snow entering air inlets and blocking airflow;\u2014 dust eliminators on air inlets in arid and dusty locations;\u2014 moisture eliminators in humid areas with high rainfall; and\u2014 fresh air pre-cooling coils for very hot or humid climates. 7.1.6 Appropriate alarm systems should be in place to alert personnel if a crit- ical fan fails. 7.1.7 Low-level return or exhaust air grilles are usually preferred. However, where this is not possible, a higher air change rate may be needed to achieve aspecied clean area classication, e.g. where ceiling return air grilles are used. 7.1.8 There may be alternative locations for return air. For example, referring to Fig. 24, room D (low-level return air) and room E (ceiling return air). The airflow schematics of the two systems (Figs 24 and 25) indicate air-handling units with return air or recirculated air, having a percentage of fresh air added.Fig. 25 is a schematic diagram of an air-handling system serving rooms with horizontal unidirectional flow, vertical unidirectional flow and turbulent flow,for rooms A, B and C, respectively. The airflow diagram in Fig. 24 is an example of a typical system with a lower clean area classication. Note: There are two basic concepts of air delivery to pharmaceutical production facilities: a recirculation system, and a full fresh air system (100%outside air supply). 7.2 Recirculation system 7.2.1 There should be no risk of contamination or cross-contamination (includ-ing by fumes and volatiles) due to recirculation of air. 7.2.2 Depending on the airborne contaminants in the return-air system it may be acceptable to use recirculated air, provided that HEPA lters areinstalled in the supply air stream to remove contaminants and thus preventcross-contamination. The HEPA lters for this application should have anEN1822 of H13.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 91QAP1 coil filtersSupply air fanPrimary with horizontal UDAF 0.45 m/s0.3 m/s Production room with vertical UDAFProduction room with low-level return Room B ROOM C Secondary filterAir-handling unit FF R R R RR S S S SSFigure 25.

Air-handling system may not be required where the air-handling system is serving a single product facility and there is evidence that cross-contamination wouldnot be possible. 7.2.4 Recirculation of air from areas where pharmaceutical dust is not gener- ated such as secondary packing, may not require HEPA lters in the system. 7.2.5 HEPA lters may be located in the air-handling unit or placed terminally.7.2.6 Air containing dust from highly toxic processes should never be recircu- lated to the HVAC system. 7.3 Full fresh-air systems Fig. 26 indicates a system operating on 100% fresh air and would normally beused in a facility dealing with toxic products, where recirculation of air withcontaminants should be avoided. 7.3.1 The required degree of ltration of the exhaust air depends on the exhaust air contaminants and local environmental regulations.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 93F EISupply air-handling unit Exhaust air-handling unit Optional filtration depending on exhaust air contaminantsProduction facilityCooling coilPrimary filter Primary filterSupply air Page Energy-recovery wheels should normally not be used in multiproduct facilities. When such wheels are used they should not become a source of possible contamination (see Fig. 27). Note : Alternatives to the energy-recovery wheels, such as crossover plate heat exchangers and water-coil heat exchangers,may be used in multiproduct facilities. 7.3.3 The potential for air leakage between the supply air and exhaust air as it passes through the wheel should be prevented. The relative pressures betweensupply and exhaust air systems should be such that the exhaust air system oper-ates at a lower pressure than the supply system. 8. Commissioning, qualication and maintenance 8.1 Commissioning 8.1.1 Commissioning should include the setting up, balancing, adjustment andtesting of the entire HVAC system, to ensure that it meets all the requirements,as specied in the user requirement specication (URS), and capacities as specied by the designer or developer. 8.1.2 The installation records of the system should provide documented evi- dence of all measured capacities of the system.QUALITY ASSURANCE energy recoveryQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 948.1.3 The data should include items such as the design and measurement gures for airflows, water flows, system pressures and electrical amperages. Theseshould be contained in the operating and maintenance manuals (O & Mmanuals). 8.1.4 Acceptable tolerances for all system parameters should be specied prior to commencing the physical installation. 8.1.5 Training should be provided to personnel after installation of the system, and should include operation and maintenance. 8.1.6 O & M manuals, schematic drawings, protocols and reports should be maintained as reference documents for any future changes and upgrades to thesystem. 8.1.7 Commissioning should be a precursor to system qualication and process validation. 8.2 Qualication 8.2.1 Validation is a many-faceted and extensive activity and is beyond thescope of these guidelines. Qualication and validation guidelines are includedin: Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Fortieth report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2005 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 937), Annex 4 (see also Fig. 28). Manufacturers should qualify HVAC systems using a risk-based approach. The basic concepts of qualication of HVAC systems are set out below. 8.2.2 The qualication of the HVAC system should be described in a valida- tion master plan (VMP).MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 95Equip, equipment.Equip 1 Equip 2 Equip3 Equip 4 Equip 5 Equip 6 QUALIFICATION VALIDATIONEquip 7 System 2 System 1 ProcessFigure 28. Qualication is a part of validationQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 958.2.3 It should dene the nature and extent of testing and the test procedures and protocols to be followed. 8.2.4 Stages of the qualication of the HVAC system should include DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ. 8.2.5 Critical and non-critical parameters should be determined by means of a risk analysis for all HVAC installation components, subsystems and controls. 8.2.6 Any parameter that may affect the quality of the pharmaceutical product, or a direct impact component, should be considered a critical parameter. 8.2.7 All critical parameters should be included in the qualication process.Note: A realistic approach to differentiating between critical and non-critical parameters is required, to avoid making the validation process unnecessarilycomplex. Example:The humidity of the room where the product is exposed should be considered a critical parameter when a humidity-sensitive product is being manufactured.The humidity sensors and the humidity monitoring system should, therefore,be qualied. The heat transfer system, chemical drier or steam humidier, whichis producing the humidity controlled air, is further removed from the productand may not require operational qualication. A room cleanliness classication is a critical parameter and, therefore, the room air change rates and HEPA lters should be critical parameters and requirequalication. Items such as the fan generating the airflow and the primary andsecondary lters are non-critical parameters, and may not require operationalqualication. 8.2.8 Non-critical systems and components should be subject to GEP and may not necessarily require qualication. 8.2.9 A change control procedure should be followed when changes are planned to the direct impact HVAC system, its components and controls thatmay affect critical parameters. 8.2.10 Acceptance criteria and limits should be dened during the design stage.8.2.11 The manufacturer should dene design conditions, normal operating ranges, operating ranges, and alert and action limits. 8.2.12 Design condition and normal operating ranges should be identied and set to realistically achievable parameters. 8.2.13 All parameters should fall within the design condition range during system operational qualication. Conditions may go out of the design conditionQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 96QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 96range during normal operating procedures but they should remain within the operating range. 8.2.14 Out-of-limit results (e.g. action limit deviations) should be recorded and form part of the batch manufacturing records. 8.2.15 The relationships between design conditions, operating range and qualied acceptance criteria are given in Fig. 29. 8.2.16 A narrow range of relative humidities coupled with a wide range of tem- peratures is unacceptable as changes in temperature will automatically give riseto variations in the relative humidity. 8.2.17 For a pharmaceutical facility, based on a risk assessment, some of the typical HVAC system parameters that should be qualied may include: \u2014 temperature \u2014 relative humidity\u2014 supply air quantities for all diffusers\u2014 return air or exhaust air quantities\u2014 room air change rates\u2014 room pressures (pressure differentials)\u2014 and surface counts where appropriate\u2014 operation of de-dusting\u2014 warning/alarm systems where applicable.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 97Figure 29.

The type of facility under test and the product level of protec-tion should be considered. Note: Table 3 gives intervals for reference purposes only. The actual test periods may be more frequent or less frequent, depending on the product and process. 8.2.19 Periodic requalication of parameters should be done at regular inter- vals, e.g. annually. 8.2.20 Requalication should also be done when any change, which could affect system performance, takes place. 8.2.21 Clean-up or recovery times normally relate to the time it takes to \"clean up\" the room from one condition to another, e.g. the relationship between \"at-rest\" and \"operational\" conditions in the clean area may be used as the criteriaSchedule of tests to demonstrate continuing compliance Test parameter Clean room classMax. time intervalTest procedure Particle count test (Veri cation of cleanliness)All classes 6 months Dust particle counts to be carried out and printouts of results pro-duced.No. of readings and positions of tests to be in accordance with ISO 14644-1 Annex B Air pressure difference (To verify absence of cross-contamination)All classes 12 months Log of pressure differential readings to be produced or critical plants should be logged daily, preferably continuously.

Introduction Validation is an essential part of good manufacturing practices (GMP). It is,therefore, an element of the quality assurance programme associated with a particular product or process. The basic principles of quality assurance have astheir goal the production of products that are t for their intended use. Theseprinciples are as follows:MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 1011Supplementary guidelines on good manufacturing practices: validation. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Fortieth report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2006 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 937), Annex 4.QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 101 Quality, safety and efcacy must be designed and built into the product. Quality cannot be inspected or tested into the product. Each critical step of the manufacturing process must be validated. Other steps in the process must be under control to maximize the probability thatthe nished product consistently and predictably meets all quality and designspecications. Validation of processes and systems is fundamental to achieving these goals. It is by design and validation that a manufacturer can establish condence thatthe manufactured products will consistently meet their product specications. Documentation associated with validation includes: \u2014 standard operating procedures (SOPs) \u2014 specications\u2014 validation master plan (VMP)\u2014 qualication protocols and reports\u2014 validation protocols and reports. The implementation of validation work requires considerable resources such as:Time: generally validation work is subject to rigorous time schedules. Financial: validation often requires the time of specialized personnel and expensive technology. Human: validation requires the collaboration of experts from various disci- plines (e.g. a multidisciplinary team, comprising quality assurance, engineer-ing, manufacturing and other disciplines, depending on the product andprocess to be validated). These guidelines aim to give guidance to inspectors of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products on therequirements for validation. The main part covers the general principles of val-idation and qualication. In addition to the main part, appendices on validationand qualication (e.g. cleaning, computer and computerized systems, equip-ment, utilities and systems, and analytical methods) are included. 2. Scope 2.1 These guidelines focus mainly on the overall concept of validation and areintended as a basic guide for use by GMP inspectors and manufacturers. It isnot the intention to be prescriptive in specic validation requirements. This doc-ument serves as general guidance only, and the principles may be considereduseful in its application in the manufacture and control of active pharmaceuti-cal ingredients (APIs) and nished pharmaceutical products. Validation of specic processes and products, for example in sterile product manufacture,requires much more consideration and a detailed approach that is beyond thescope of this document.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 102QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1022.2 There are many factors affecting the different types of validation and it is, therefore, not intended to dene and address all aspects related to one partic-ular type of validation here. 2.3 Manufacturers should plan validation in a manner that will ensure regula- tory compliance and ensuring that product quality, safety and consistency arenot compromised. 2.4 The general text in the main part of these guidelines may be applicable to validation and qualication of premises, equipment, utilities and systems, and processes and procedures. More specic principles of qualication and validation are addressed in the appendices. Semi-automatic or fully automaticclean-in-place (CIP) systems and other special cases should be treated separately. 3. Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts. calibration The set of operations that establish, under specied conditions, the relationshipbetween values indicated by an instrument or system for measuring (forexample, weight, temperature and pH), recording, and controlling, or the valuesrepresented by a material measure, and the corresponding known values of areference standard. Limits for acceptance of the results of measuring should beestablished. cleaning validation Documented evidence to establish that cleaning procedures are removingresidues to predetermined levels of acceptability, taking into considerationfactors such as batch size, dosing, toxicology and equipment size. commissioning The setting up, adjustment and testing of equipment or a system to ensure thatit meets all the requirements, as specied in the user requirement specication,and capacities as specied by the designer or developer. Commissioning iscarried out before qualication and validation. computer validation Documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a com-puterized system analyses, controls and records data correctly and that data pro-cessing complies with predetermined specications.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR 12:12 PM Page 103concurrent validation Validation carried out during routine production of products intended for sale. design qualication (DQ) Documented evidence that the premises, supporting systems, utilities, equip- ment and processes have been designed in accordance with the requirements of GMP . good engineering practices (GEP) Established engineering methods and standards that are applied throughout theproject life-cycle to deliver appropriate, cost-effective solutions. installation qualication (IQ) The performance of tests to ensure that the installations (such as machines, mea-suring devices, utilities and manufacturing areas) used in a manufacturingprocess are appropriately selected and correctly installed and operate in accor-dance with established specications. operational qualication (OQ) Documented verication that the system or subsystem performs as intendedover all anticipated operating ranges. performance qualication (PQ) Documented verication that the equipment or system operates consistently andgives reproducibility within dened specications and parameters for prolongedperiods. (In the context of systems, the term \"process validation\" may also beused.) process validation Documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a specicprocess will consistently result in a product that meets its predetermined spec-ications and quality characteristics. prospective validation Validation carried out during the development stage on the basis of a risk analy-sis of the production process, which is broken down into individual steps; theseare then evaluated on the basis of past experience to determine whether theymay lead to critical situations. qualication Action of proving and documenting that any premises, systems and equipmentare properly installed, and/or work correctly and lead to the expected results.Qualication is often a part (the initial stage) of validation, but the individualqualication steps alone do not constitute process validation.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 104QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 104retrospective validation Involves the evaluation of past experience of production on the condition that composition, procedures, and equipment remain unchanged. revalidation Repeated validation of an approved process (or a part thereof) to ensure con-tinued compliance with established requirements. standard operating procedure (SOP) An authorized written procedure giving instructions for performing operationsnot necessarily specic to a given product or material but of a more generalnature (e.g. equipment operation, maintenance and cleaning; validation; clean-ing of premises and environmental control; sampling and inspection). CertainSOPs may be used to supplement product-specic master batch productiondocumentation. validation Action of proving and documenting that any process, procedure or methodactually and consistently leads to the expected results. validation master plan (VMP) The VMP is a high-level document that establishes an umbrella validation planfor the entire project and summarizes the manufacturer's overall philosophy andapproach, to be used for establishing performance adequacy. It provides infor-mation on the manufacturer's validation work programme and denes details ofand timescales for the validation work to be performed, including a statementof the responsibilities of those implementing the plan. validation protocol (or plan) (VP) A document describing the activities to be performed in a validation, includingthe acceptance criteria for the approval of a manufacturing process\u2014or a partthereof\u2014for routine use. validation report (VR) A document in which the records, results and evaluation of a completed vali-dation programme are assembled and summarized. It may also contain propos-als for the improvement of processes and/or equipment. verication The application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addi-tion to monitoring, to determine compliance with the GMP principles.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 105QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 105worst case A condition or set of conditions encompassing the upper and lower processing limits for operating parameters and circumstances, within SOPs, which pose thegreatest chance of product or process failure when compared to ideal condi-tions. Such conditions do not necessarily include product or process failure. 4. Relationship between validation and qualication Validation and qualication are essentially components of the same concept.The term qualication is normally used for equipment, utilities and systems, andvalidation for processes. In this sense, qualication is part of validation. 5. Validation 5.1 Approaches to validation 5.1.1 There are two basic approaches to validation\u2014one based on evidenceobtained through testing (prospective and concurrent validation), and onebased on the analysis of accumulated (historical) data (retrospective validation).Whenever possible, prospective validation is preferred. Retrospective validationis no longer encouraged and is, in any case, not applicable to the manufactur-ing of sterile products. 5.1.2 Both prospective and concurrent validation, may include: extensive product testing, which may involve extensive sample testing (with the estimation of condence limits for individual results) and the demon-stration of intra- and inter-batch homogeneity; simulation process trials; challenge/worst case tests, which determine the robustness of the process; and control of process parameters being monitored during normal production runs to obtain additional information on the reliability of the process. 5.2 Scope of validation 5.2.1 There should be an appropriate and sufcient system including organi-zational structure and documentation infrastructure, sufcient personnel andnancial resources to perform validation tasks in a timely manner. Managementand persons responsible for quality assurance should be involved. 5.2.2 Personnel with appropriate qualications and experience should be responsible for performing validation. They should represent different depart-ments depending on the validation work to be performed.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 106QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1065.2.3 There should be proper preparation and planning before validation is per- formed. There should be a specic programme for validation activities. 5.2.4 Validation should be performed in a structured way according to the doc- umented procedures and protocols. 5.2.5 Validation should be performed:\u2014 for new premises, equipment, utilities and systems, and processes and procedures; \u2014 at periodic intervals; and\u2014 when major changes have been made. (Periodic revalidation or periodic requalication may be substituted, where appropriate, with periodic evaluation of data and information to establishwhether requalication or revalidation is required.) 5.2.6 Validation should be performed in accordance with written protocols. A written report on the outcome of the validation should be produced. 5.2.7 Validation should be done over a period of time, e.g. at least three con- secutive batches (full production scale) should be validated, to demonstrate con-sistency. Worst case situations should be considered. 5.2.8 There should be a clear distinction between in-process controls and validation. In-process tests are performed during the manufacture of each batchaccording to specications and methods devised during the development phase.Their objective is to monitor the process continuously. 5.2.9 When a new manufacturing formula or method is adopted, steps should be taken to demonstrate its suitability for routine processing. The denedprocess, using the materials and equipment specied, should be shown to resultin the consistent yield of a product of the required quality. 5.2.10 Manufacturers should identify what validation work is needed to prove that critical aspects of their operations are appropriately controlled. Signicantchanges to the facilities or the equipment, and processes that may affect thequality of the product should be validated. A risk assessment approach shouldbe used to determine the scope and extent of validation required. 6. Qualication 6.1 Qualication should be completed before process validation is performed.The process of qualication should be a logical, systematic process and shouldstart from the design phase of the premises, equipment, utilities and equipment. 6.2 Depending on the function and operation of the equipment, utility or system, only installation qualication (IQ) and operational qualication (OQ)may be required, as the correct operation of the equipment, utility or systemMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 107QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 107could be considered to be a sufcient indicator of its performance (refer to Section 11 for IQ, OQ and performance qualication (PQ)). (The equipment,utility and system should then be maintained, monitored and calibrated accord-ing to a regular schedule.) 6.3 Major equipment and critical utilities and systems, however, require IQ, OQ and PQ. 7. Calibration and verication 7.1 Calibration and verication of equipment, instruments and other devices,as applicable, used in production and quality control, should be performed atregular intervals. 7.2 Personnel who carry out calibration and preventive maintenance should have appropriate qualications and training. 7.3 A calibration programme should be available and should provide informa- tion such as calibration standards and limits, responsible persons, calibrationintervals, records and actions to be taken when problems are identied. 7.4 There should be traceability to standards (e.g. national, regional or inter- national standards) used in the calibration. 7.5 Calibrated equipment, instruments and other devices should be labelled, coded or otherwise identied to indicate the status of calibration and the dateon which recalibration is due. 7.6 When the equipment, instruments and other devices have not been used for a certain period of time, their function and calibration status should be veried and shown to be satisfactory before use. 8. Validation master plan The validation master plan (VMP) should reflect the key elements of the validation programme. It should be concise and clear and contain at least thefollowing: \u2014 a validation policy \u2014 organizational structure of validation activities\u2014 summary of facilities, systems, equipment and processes validated and to be validated \u2014 documentation format (e.g. protocol and report format)\u2014 planning and scheduling\u2014 change control\u2014 references to existing documents.QUALITY OF 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1089. Qualication and validation protocols 9.1 There should be qualication and validation protocols describing the qual- ication and validation study to be performed. 9.2 As a minimum the protocols should include the following signicant back- ground information: \u2014 the objectives of the study \u2014 the site of the study\u2014 the responsible personnel\u2014 description of SOPs to be followed\u2014 equipment to be used; standards and criteria for the relevant products and processes \u2014 the type of validation\u2014 the processes and/or parameters\u2014 sampling, testing and monitoring requirements\u2014 predetermined acceptance criteria for drawing conclusions. 9.3 There should be a description of the way in which the results will be analysed. 9.4 The protocol should be approved prior to use. Any changes to a protocol should be approved prior to implementation of the change. 10. Qualication and validation reports 10.1 There should be written reports on the qualication and validation performed. 10.2 Reports should reflect the protocols followed and include at least the title and objective of the study; reference to the protocol; details of material, equip-ment, programmes and cycles used; procedures and test methods. 10.3 The results should be evaluated, analysed and compared against the pre- determined acceptance criteria. The results should meet the acceptance crite-ria; deviations and out-of-limit results should be investigated. If these deviationsare accepted, this should be justied. Where necessary further studies shouldbe performed. 10.4 The departments responsible for the qualication and validation work should approve the completed report. 10.5 The conclusion of the report should state whether or not the outcome of the qualication and/or validation was considered successful. 10.6 The quality assurance department should approve the report after the nal review. The criteria for approval should be in accordance with the company'squality assurance system.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 109QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 10910.7 Any deviations found during the validation process should be acted upon and documented as such. Corrective actions may be required. 11. Qualication stages 11.1 There are four stages of qualication: \u2014 design qualication (DQ); (PQ). 11.2 All SOPs for operation, maintenance and calibration should be prepared during qualication. 11.3. Training should be provided to operators and training records should be maintained. Design qualication 11.4 Design qualication should provide documented evidence that the design specications were met. Installation qualication 11.5 Installation qualication should provide documented evidence that the installation was complete and satisfactory. 11.6 The purchase specications, drawings, manuals, spare parts lists and vendor details should be veried during installation qualication. 11.7 Control and measuring devices should be calibrated. Operational qualication 11.8 Operational qualication should provide documented evidence that utili- ties, systems or equipment and all its components operate in accordance withoperational specications. 11.9 Tests should be designed to demonstrate satisfactory operation over the normal operating range as well as at the limits of its operating conditions(including worst case conditions). 11.10 Operation controls, alarms, switches, displays and other operational com- ponents should be tested. 11.11 Measurements made in accordance with a statistical approach should be fully described.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 110QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 110Performance qualication 11.12 Performance qualication should provide documented evidence that utilities, systems or equipment and all its components can consistently performin accordance with the specications under routine use. 11.13 Test results should be collected over a suitable period of time to prove consistency. Requalication 11.14 Requalication should be done in accordance with a dened schedule. The frequency of requalication may be determined on the basis of factors suchas the analysis of results relating to calibration, verication and maintenance. 11.15 There should be periodic requalication, as well as requalication after changes (such as changes to utilities, systems, equipment; maintenance work;and movement). (See also point 5.2.5 above and section 12 below.) 11.16 Requalication should be considered as part of the change control procedure. Revalidation 11.17 Processes and procedures should be revalidated to ensure that they remain capable of achieving the intended results. 11.18 There should be periodic revalidation, as well as revalidation after changes. (See also points 5.2.5 above, point 11.21 below and section 12 below.) 11.19 Revalidation should be done in accordance with a dened schedule.11.20 The frequency and extent of revalidation should be determined using a risk-based approach together with a review of historical data. Periodic revalidation 11.21 Periodic revalidation should be performed to assess process changes that may occur gradually over a period of time, or because of wear of equipment. 11.22 The following should be considered when periodic revalidation is performed: \u2014 master formulae and specications; \u2014 SOPs;\u2014 (e.g. of calibration, maintenance and cleaning); analytical methods.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PM Page 111Revalidation after change 11.23 Revalidation should be performed following a change that could have an effect on the process, procedure, quality of the product and/or the productcharacteristics. Revalidation should be considered as part of the change controlprocedure. 11.24 The extent of revalidation will depend on the nature and signicance of the change(s). 11.25 Changes should not adversely affect product quality or process characteristics. 11.26 Changes requiring revalidation should be dened in the validation plan and may include: changes in starting materials (including physical properties, such as density, viscosity or particle size distribution that may affect the process or product); change of starting material manufacturer; transfer of processes to a different site (including change of facilities and installations which influence the process); changes of primary packaging material (e.g. substituting plastic for glass); changes in the manufacturing process (e.g. mixing times or drying temperatures); changes in the equipment (e.g. addition of automatic detection systems, installation of new equipment, major revisions to machinery or apparatus andbreakdowns); production area and support system changes (e.g. rearrangement of areas, or a new water treatment method); appearance of negative quality trends; appearance of new ndings based on current knowledge, e.g. new technology; support system changes. Changes of equipment which involve the replacement of equipment on a \"like- for-like\" basis would not normally require a revalidation. For example, instal-lation of a new centrifugal pump to replace an older model would not necessarilyrequire revalidation. 12. Change control 12.1 Changes should be controlled in accordance with a SOP as changes mayhave an impact on a qualied utility, system or piece of equipment, and a vali-dated process and/or procedure. 12.2 The procedure should describe the actions to be taken, including the need for and extent of qualication or validation to be done.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 112QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 11212.3 Changes should be formally requested, documented and approved before implementation. Records should be maintained. 13. Personnel 13.1 Personnel should demonstrate that they are appropriately qualied, whererelevant. 13.2 Personnel requiring qualication include, for example:\u2014 laboratory analysts; \u2014 personnel following critical procedures;\u2014 personnel doing data entry in computerized systems; and\u2014 risk assessors. Appendix 1 Validation of heating, ventilation air-conditioningsystems 1. General 113 2. Commissioning 1133. Qualication 1144. Reference 118 1. General 1.1 The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system plays an important role in the protection of the product, the personnel and the environment. 1.2 For all HVAC installation components, subsystems or parameters, critical parameters and non-critical parameters should be determined. 1.3 Some of the parameters of a typical HVAC system that should be qualied include: \u2014 room temperature and humidity; \u2014 supply air and return air quantities;\u2014 room pressure, air change rate, flow patterns, particle count and cleanup rates; and \u2014 unidirectional flow velocities and HEPA lter penetration tests. 2. Commissioning 2.1 Commissioning should involve the setting up, balancing, adjustment andtesting of the entire HVAC system, to ensure that the system meets all theMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 113QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 113requirements, as specied in the user requirement specication, and capacities as specied by the designer or developer. 2.2 The installation records of the system should provide documented evidence of all measured capacities of the system. 2.3 The data should include items such as the design and measured gures for airflows, water flows, system pressures and electrical amperages. These shouldbe contained in the operating and maintenance manuals (O & M manuals). 2.4 Acceptable tolerances for all system parameters should be specied prior to commencing the physical installation. 2.5 Training should be provided to personnel after installation of the system, and should include how to perform operation and maintenance. 2.6 O & M manuals, schematic drawings, protocols and reports should be maintained as reference documents for any future changes and upgrades to thesystem. 2.7 Commissioning should be a precursor to system qualication and validation. 3. Qualication 3.1 Manufacturers should qualify HVAC systems using a risk-based approach.The basic concepts of qualication of HVAC systems are set out in Fig. 1 below. 3.2 The qualication of the HVAC system should be described in a validation master plan (VMP). 3.3 The validation master plan should dene the nature and extent of testing and the test procedures and protocols to be followed. 3.4 Stages of the qualication of the HVAC system should include design qualication (DQ), qualication (IQ), operational quali cation(OQ), and performance (PQ). 3.5 Critical and non-critical parameters for all HVAC installation components, subsystems and controls should be determined by means of a risk analysis. 3.6 Any parameter that may affect the quality of the pharmaceutical product should be considered a critical parameter. 3.7 All critical parameters should be included in the qualication process.Note: A realistic approach to differentiating between critical and noncritical parameters is required, to avoid making the validation process unnecessarilycomplex. Example:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 114QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 114The humidity of the room where the product is exposed should be considered a critical parameter when a humidity-sensitive product is being manufactured.The humidity sensors and the humidity monitoring system should, therefore,be qualied. The heat transfer system, chemical drier or steam humidier, whichis producing the humidity-controlled air, is further removed from the productand may not require operational qualication. A room cleanliness classication is a critical parameter and, therefore, the room air-change rates and high-efciency particulate air (HEPA) lters should be critical parameters and require qualication. Items such as the fan generatingthe airflow and the primary and secondary lters are non-critical parameters,and may not require operational qualication. 3.8 Non-critical systems and components should be subject to good engineer- ing practice (GEP) and may not necessarily require full qualication. 3.9 A change control procedure should be followed when changes are planned to the HVAC system, its components, and controls, that may affect critical parameters. 3.10 Acceptance criteria and limits should be dened during the design stage.3.11 The manufacturer should dene design conditions, normal operating ranges, operating ranges, and alert and action limits. 3.12 Design condition and normal operating ranges should be identied and set to realistically achievable parameters. 3.13 All parameters should fall within the design condition range during system operational qualication. Conditions may go out of the design condition rangeMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 115Equip 4 Equip 1 Equip 2 Equip 3 Equip 5 Equip 6 QUALIFICATIONEquip 7 System 2 System 1 ProcessFigure 1. Qualication is a part of validationQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 115during normal operating procedures but they should remain within the operat- ing range. 3.14 Out-of-limit results (e.g. action limit deviations) should be recorded and form part of the batch manufacturing records. 3.15 The relationships between design conditions, operating range and quali- ed acceptance criteria are given in Figure 2. 3.16 A narrow range of relative humidities coupled with a wide range of tem- peratures is unacceptable as changes in temperature will automatically give riseto variations in the relative humidity. 3.17 Some of the typical HVAC system parameters that should be qualied for a pharmaceutical facility may include: \u2014 temperature \u2014 relative humidity\u2014 supply air quantities for all diffusers\u2014 return air or exhaust air quantities\u2014 room air-change rates\u2014 pressures (pressure and surface counts where appropriate\u2014 operation of de-dusting\u2014 warning/alarm systems where applicable.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 116 Action limit timil trelA timil trelAAction limit Design condition Normal operating range Operating range - validated acceptance criteriaFigure 2. System operating rangesQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1163.18 The maximum time interval between tests should be dened by the man- ufacturer. The type of facility under test and the product level of protectionshould be considered. Note: Table 1 gives intervals for reference purposes only. The actual test periods may be more or less frequent, depending on the productand process. 3.19 Periodic requalication of parameters should be done at regular intervals, e.g. annually. 3.20 Requalication should also be done when any change, which could affect system performance, takes place. 3.21 Clean-up times normally relate to the time it takes to \"clean up\" the room from one condition to another, e.g. the relationship between \"at-rest\" and\"operational\" conditions in the clean area may be used as the criteria for clean-up tests. Therefore, the clean-up time can be expressed as the time taken tochange from an \"operational\" condition to an \"at-rest\" condition.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 117Source: ISO 14644 Standard, given for reference purposes only.Schedule of tests to demonstrate continuing compliance Test parameter Clean area classMax. time intervalTest procedure Particle count test (veri cation of cleanliness)All classes 6 months Dust particle counts to be carried out and printouts of results pro- duced.

General 1.1 All water-treatment systems should be subject to planned maintenance, val-idation and monitoring. 1.2 Validation of water systems should consist of at least three phases: Phase 1: investigational phase; Phase 2: short-term control; and Phase 3: long-termcontrol. 1.3 During the period following phase 3 (typically running for one year) the objective should be to demonstrate that the system is under control over a longperiod of time. Sampling may be reduced from, e.g. daily to weekly. 1.4 The validation performed and revalidation requirements should be included in the \"Water quality manual\". 2. Start-up and commissioning of water systems 2.1 Planned, well-dened, successful and well-documented commissioning isan essential precursor to successful validation of water systems. The commis-sioning work should include setting to work, system set-up, controls, looptuning and recording of all system performance parameters. If it is intended touse or refer to commissioning data within the validation work then the qualityof the commissioning work and associated data and documentation must becommensurate with the validation plan requirements. 3. Qualication 3.1 Water for pharmaceutical use (WPU), puried water (PW), highly puriedwater (HPW) and water for injections (WFI) systems are all considered to beQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 118QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 118direct impact, quality critical systems that should be qualied. The qualication should follow the validation convention of design review or design qualication(DQ), installation qualication (IQ), operational qualication (OQ) and per-formance qualication (PQ). 3.2 This guidance does dene the standard requirements for the conven- tional validation stages DQ, IQ and OQ, but concentrates on the particular PQapproach that should be used for WPU systems to demonstrate their consistentand reliable performance. A three-phase approach should be used to satisfy theobjective of proving the reliability and robustness of the system in service overan extended period. Phase 1. A test period of 2-4 weeks should be spent monitoring the system inten- sively. During this period the system should operate continuously without failureor performance deviation. The following procedures should be included in thetesting approach. Undertake chemical and microbiological testing in accordance with a dened plan. Sample the incoming feed-water to verify its quality. Sample after each step in the purication process daily. Sample at each point of use and at other dened sampling points daily. Develop appropriate operating ranges. Develop and nalize operating, cleaning, sanitizing and maintenance procedures. Demonstrate production and delivery of product water of the required quality and quantity. Use and rene the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for operation, maintenance, sanitization and troubleshooting. Verify provisional alert and action levels. Develop and rene the test-failure procedure. Phase 2. A further test period of 2-4 weeks should be spent carrying out further intensive monitoring while deploying all the rened SOPs after the satisfactorycompletion of phase 1. The sampling scheme should be generally the same asin phase 1. Water can be used for manufacturing purposes during this phase.The approach should also: \u2014 demonstrate consistent operation within established ranges; and \u2014 demonstrate consistent production and delivery of water of the required quantity and quality when the system is operated in accordance with theSOPs. Phase 3. Phase 3 typically runs for one year after the satisfactory completion of phase 2. Water can be used for manufacturing purposes during this phase whichhas the following objectives and features:MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 119QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 119 Demonstrate extended reliable performance.

Establishing acceptable limits 127 1. Principle 1.1 The objectives of good manufacturing practices (GMP) include the pre-vention of possible contamination and cross-contamination of pharmaceuticalstarting materials and products. 1.2 Pharmaceutical products can be contaminated by a variety of substances such as contaminants associated with microbes, previous products (both activepharmaceutical ingredients (API) and excipient residues), residues of cleaningagents, airborne materials, such as dust and particulate matter, lubricants andancillary material, such as disinfectants, and decomposition residues from:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 120QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 120 4. Reference\u2014 product residue breakdown occasioned by, e.g. the use of strong acids and alkalis during the cleaning process; and \u2014 breakdown products of the detergents, acids and alkalis that may be used as part of the cleaning process. 1.3 Adequate cleaning procedures play an important role in preventing conta- mination and cross-contamination. Validation of cleaning methods providesdocumented evidence that an approved cleaning procedure will provide cleanequipment, suitable for its intended use. 1.4 The objective of cleaning validation is to prove that the equipment is con- sistently cleaned of product, detergent and microbial residues to an acceptablelevel, to prevent possible contamination and cross-contamination. 1.5 Cleaning validation is not necessarily required for non-critical cleaning such as that which takes place between batches of the same product (or different lotsof the same intermediate in a bulk process), or of floors, walls, the outside ofvessels, and following some intermediate steps. 1.6 Cleaning validation should be considered important in multiproduct facilities and should be performed among others, for equipment, sanitizationprocedures and garment laundering. 2. Scope 2.1 These guidelines describe the general aspects of cleaning validation, exclud-ing specialized cleaning or inactivation that may be required, e.g. for removalof viral or mycoplasmal contaminants in the biological manufacturing industry. 2.2 Normally cleaning validation would be applicable for critical cleaning such as cleaning between manufacturing of one product and another, of surfaces thatcome into contact with products, drug products and API. 3. General 3.1 There should be written SOPs detailing the cleaning process for equipmentand apparatus. The cleaning procedures should be validated. 3.2 The manufacturer should have a cleaning policy and an appropriate pro- cedure for cleaning validation, covering: surfaces that come into contact with the product; cleaning after product changeover (when one pharmaceutical formulation is being changed for another, completely different formulation); between batches in campaigns (when the same formula is being manufac- tured over a period of time, and on different days);MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 121QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 121 bracketing products for cleaning validation. (This often arises where pro- ducts contain substances with similar properties (such as solubility) or thesame substance in different strengths. An acceptable strategy is to rst man-ufacture the more dilute form (not necessarily the lowest dose) and then themost concentrated form. There are sometimes \"families\" of products whichdiffer slightly as to actives or excipients.); and periodic evaluation and revalidation of the number of batches manufactured between cleaning validations. 3.3 At least three consecutive applications of the cleaning procedure should be performed and shown to be successful to prove that the method is validated. 4. Cleaning validation protocols and reports 4.1 Cleaning validation protocols 4.1.1 Cleaning validation should be described in cleaning validation protocols, which should be formally approved, e.g. by the quality control or quality assur-ance unit. 4.1.2 In preparing the cleaning validation protocol, the following should be considered: \u2014 disassembly of system; \u2014 precleaning;\u2014 cleaning agent, concentration, solution volume, water quality;\u2014 time and temperature;\u2014 flow rate, pressure and rinsing;\u2014 complexity and design of the equipment;\u2014 training of operators; and\u2014 size of the system. 4.1.3 The cleaning validation protocol should include: the objectives of the validation process; the people responsible for performing and approving the validation study; the description of the equipment to be used, including a list of the equip- ment, make, model, serial number or other unique code; the interval between the end of production and the commencement of the cleaning procedure (interval may be part of the validation challenge studyitself) \u2014 the maximum period that equipment may be left dirty before being cleaned as well as the establishment of the time that should elapse aftercleaning and before use;QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 122QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 122 the levels of microorganisms (bioburden); the cleaning procedures (documented in an existing SOP , including deni- tion of any automated process) to be used for each product, each manufac-turing system or each piece of equipment; all the equipment used for routine monitoring, e.g. conductivity meters, pH meters and total organic carbon analysers; the number of cleaning cycles to be performed consecutively; the sampling procedures to be used (direct sampling, rinse sampling, in- process monitoring and sampling locations) and the rationale for their use; the data on recovery studies (efciency of the recovery of the sampling tech- nique should be established); the analytical methods (specicity and sensitivity) including the limit of detection and the limit of quantication; the acceptance criteria (with rationale for setting the specic limits) includ- ing a margin for error and for sampling efciency; the choice of the cleaning agent should be documented and approved by the quality unit and should be scientically justied on the basis of, e.g. \u2014 the solubility of the materials to be removed; \u2014 the design and construction of the equipment and surface materials to be cleaned; \u2014 the safety of the cleaning agent;\u2014 the ease of removal and detection;\u2014 the product attributes;\u2014 the minimum temperature and volume of cleaning agent and rinse solution; \u2014 the manufacturer's recommendations; revalidation requirements.4.1.4 Cleaning procedures for products and processes which are very similar do not need to be individually validated. A validation study of the \"worst case\"may be considered acceptable. There should be a justied validation programmefor this approach referred to as \"bracketing\", addressing critical issues relatingto the selected product, equipment or process. 4.1.5 Where \"bracketing\" of products is done, consideration should be given to type of products and equipment. 4.1.6 Bracketing by product should be done only when the products concerned are similar in nature or property and will be processed using the same equip-ment. Identical cleaning procedures should then be used for these products. 4.1.7 When a representative product is chosen, this should be the one that is most difcult to clean.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 123QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1234.1.8 Bracketing by equipment should be done only when it is similar equip- ment, or the same equipment in different sizes (e.g. 300-l, 500-l and 1000-ltanks). An alternative approach may be to validate the smallest and the largestsizes separately. 4.2 Cleaning validation reports 4.2.1 The relevant cleaning records (signed by the operator, checked by pro- duction and reviewed by quality assurance) and source data (original results)should be kept. The results of the cleaning validation should be presented incleaning validation reports stating the outcome and conclusion. 5. Personnel 5.1 Personnel or operators who perform cleaning routinely should be trainedand should be effectively supervised. 6. Equipment 6.1 Normally only procedures for the cleaning of surfaces of the equipment thatcome into contact with the product need to be validated. Consideration shouldbe given to \"non-contact\" parts of the equipment into which product or anyprocess material may migrate. Critical areas should be identied (independentlyfrom method of cleaning), particularly in large systems employing semi-automatic or fully automatic clean-in-place systems. 6.2 Dedicated equipment should be used for products which are difcult to clean, equipment which is difcult to clean, or for products with a high safetyrisk where it is not possible to achieve the required cleaning acceptance limitsusing a validated cleaning procedure. 6.3 Ideally, there should be one process for cleaning a piece of equipment or system. This will depend on the products being produced, whether the clean-ing occurs between batches of the same product (as in a large campaign) orwhether the cleaning occurs between batches of different products. 6.4 The design of equipment may influence the effectiveness of the cleaning process. Consideration should therefore be given to the design of the equip-ment when preparing the cleaning validation protocol, e.g. V-blenders, transferpumps or lling lines. 7. Detergents 7.1 Detergents should facilitate the cleaning process and be easily removable.Detergents that have persistent residues such as cationic detergents whichQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 124QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 124adhere very strongly to glass and are difcult to remove, should be avoided where possible. 7.2 The composition of the detergent should be known to the manufacturer and its removal during rinsing, demonstrated. 7.3 Acceptable limits for detergent residues after cleaning should be dened. The possibility of detergent breakdown should also be considered when vali-dating cleaning procedures. 7.4 Detergents should be released by quality control and, where possible, should meet local food standards or regulations. 8. Microbiology 8.1 The need to include measures to prevent microbial growth and remove con-tamination where it has occurred should be considered. 8.2 There should be documented evidence to indicate that routine cleaning and storage of equipment does not allow microbial proliferation. 8.3 The period and conditions for storage of unclean equipment before clean- ing, and the time between cleaning and equipment reuse, should form part ofthe validation of cleaning procedures. 8.4 Equipment should be stored in a dry condition after cleaning. Stagnant water should not be allowed to remain in equipment after cleaning. 8.5 Control of the bioburden through adequate cleaning and appropriate storage of equipment is important to ensure that subsequent sterilization or san-itization procedures achieve the necessary assurance of sterility, and the controlof pyrogens in sterile processing. Equipment sterilization processes may not beadequate to achieve signicant inactivation or removal of pyrogens. 9. Sampling 9.1 General 9.1.1 Equipment should normally be cleaned as soon as possible after use. This may be especially important for operations with topical products, suspensionsand bulk drug or where the drying of residues will directly affect the efciencyof a cleaning procedure. 9.1.2 Two methods of sampling are considered to be acceptable. These are direct surface sampling and rinse samples. A combination of the two methodsis generally the most desirable. 9.1.3 The practice of resampling should not be used before or during cleaning and operations and is acceptable only in rare cases. Constant retesting andMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 125QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 125resampling can show that the cleaning process is not validated because these retests actually document the presence of unacceptable residue and contami-nants resulting from an ineffective cleaning process. 9.2 Direct surface sampling (direct method) Note: This method of sampling is the most commonly used and involves taking an inert material (e.g. cotton wool) on the end of a probe (referred to as a\"swab\") and rubbing it methodically across a surface. The type of samplingmaterial used and its potential impact on the test data is important as the sam-pling material may interfere with the test. (For example, the adhesive used inswabs has been found to interfere with the analysis of samples.) 9.2.1 Factors that should be considered include the supplier of the swab, area swabbed, number of swabs used, whether they are wet or dry swabs, swab handling and swabbing technique. 9.2.2 The location from which the sample is taken should take into considera- tion the composition of the equipment (e.g. glass or steel) and the location (e.g.blades, tank walls or ttings). Worst case locations should be considered. Theprotocol should identify the sampling locations. 9.2.3 Critical areas, i.e. those hardest to clean, should be identied, particularly in large systems that employ semi-automatic or fully automatic clean-in-placesystems. 9.2.4 The sampling medium and solvent used should be appropriate to the task. 9.3 Rinse samples (indirect method) Note: This method allows sampling of a large surface, of areas that are inacces- sible or that cannot be routinely disassembled and provides an overall picture.Rinse samples may give sufcient evidence of adequate cleaning where accessi-bility of equipment parts can preclude direct surface sampling, and may beuseful for checking for residues of cleaning agents, e.g. detergents. 9.3.1 Rinse samples should be used in combination with other sampling methods such as surface sampling. 9.3.2 There should be evidence that samples are accurately recovered. For example, a recovery of >80% is considered good, >50% reasonable and <50% questionable. 9.4 Batch placebo method Note: This method relies on the manufacture of a placebo batch which is then checked for carry-over of the previous product. It is an expensive and labori-QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 126QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 126ous process. It is difcult to provide assurance that the contaminants will be dislodged from the equipment surface uniformly. Additionally, if the particlesof the contaminant or residue are large enough, they may not be uniformly dis-persed in the placebo batch. 9.4.1 The batch placebo method should be used in conjunction with rinse and/or surface sampling method(s). 9.4.2 Samples should be taken throughout the process of manufacture. Traces of the preceding products should be sought in these samples. (Note that thesensitivity of the assay may be greatly reduced by dilution of the contaminant.) 10. Analytical methods 10.1 The analytical methods should be validated before the cleaning validationis performed. 10.2 The methods chosen should detect residuals or contaminants specic for the substance(s) being assayed at an appropriate level of cleanliness (sensitivity). 10.3 Validation of the analytical method should include as appropriate:\u2014 precision, linearity and selectivity (the latter if specic analytes are targeted); \u2014 limit of detection (LOD);\u2014 limit (LOQ);\u2014 recovery, by spiking with the analyte; and\u2014 reproducibility. 10.4 The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufciently sen- sitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminants. 10.5 Suitable methods that are sensitive and specic should be used where pos- sible and may include chromatographic methods (e.g. high pressure liquid chro-motography (HPLC), gas chromotography (GC), and high pressure thin-layerchromatography (HPTLC)). Other methods may include (alone or in combi-nation) measurement of total organic carbon (TOC), pH, or conductivity; ultra-violet (UV) spectroscopy; and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 11. Establishing acceptable limits Note: uniform distribution of contaminants is not guaranteed. 11.1 The acceptance criteria established for contaminant levels in the sample should be practical, achievable and veriable. The rationale for the residue limitsestablished should be logical, and based on the knowledge of the materialsinvolved.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 127QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 12711.2 Each situation should be assessed individually. The manner in which limits are established should be carefully considered. In establishing residual limits itmay not be adequate to focus only on the principal reactant, because otherchemical variations may be more difcult to remove. 11.3 Where necessary, screening using thin-layer chromatography should be performed in addition to chemical analyses. 11.4 There should be no residue from the previous product, from reaction by- products and degradants, or from the cleaning process itself (e.g. detergents orsolvents). 11.5 The limit-setting approach can: be product-specic; group products into families and choose a worst case product; group products into groups according to risk, e.g. very soluble products, products with similar potency, highly toxic, or difcult to detect products; use different safety factors for different dosage forms based on physiological response (this method is essential for potent materials). 11.6 Limits may be expressed as a concentration in a subsequent product (ppm), limit per surface area (mcg/cm 2), or in rinse water as ppm. 11.7 The sensitivity of the analytical methods should be dened to enable rea- sonable limits to be set. 11.8 The rationale for selecting limits for carry-over of product residues should meet dened criteria. 11.9 The three most commonly used criteria are: visually clean. (No residue should be visible on equipment after cleaning.) Spiking studies should determine the concentration at which most activeingredients are visible. This criterion may not be suitable for high-potency,low-dosage drugs; no more than 10 ppm of one product will appear in another product (basis for heavy metals in starting materials); and no more than 0.1% of the normal therapeutic dose of one product will appear in the maximum daily dose of a subsequent product. 11.10 The most stringent of three options should be used.11.11 Certain allergenic ingredients (e.g. penicillins and cephalosporins) and highly potent material (e.g. anovulent steroids, potent steroids and cytotoxics)should be undetectable by the best available analytical methods. (In practicethis may mean that dedicated manufacturing facilities should be used for themanufacturing and processing of such products.)QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 128QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 128Appendix 4 Analytical method validation Principle 129 2.

Principle 1.1 This appendix presents some information on the characteristics that shouldbe considered during validation of analytical methods. Approaches other thanthose specied in this appendix may be followed and may be acceptable. Manu-facturers should choose the validation protocol and procedures most suitablefor testing of their product. 1.2 The manufacturer should demonstrate (through validation) that the analyt- ical procedure is suitable for its intended purpose. 1.3 Analytical methods, whether or not they indicate stability, should be validated. 1.4 The analytical method should be validated by research and development before being transferred to the quality control unit when appropriate. 2. General 2.1 There should be specications for both, materials and products. The teststo be performed should be described in the documentation on standard testmethods. 2.2 Specications and standard test methods in pharmacopoeias (\"pharma- copoeial methods\"), or suitably developed specications or test methods (\"non-pharmacopoeial methods\") as approved by the national drug regulatoryauthority may be used. 2.3 Well-characterized reference materials, with documented purity, should be used in the validation study. 2.4 The most common analytical procedures include identication tests, assay of drug substances and pharmaceutical products, quantitative tests for contentof impurities and limit tests for impurities. Other analytical procedures includedissolution testing and determination of particle size.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 129QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1292.5 The results of analytical procedures should be reliable, accurate and repro- ducible. The characteristics that should be considered during validation of analytical methods are discussed in paragraph 6. 2.6 Verication or revalidation should be performed when relevant, for example, when there are changes in the process for synthesis of the drug sub-stance; changes in the composition of the nished product; changes in the ana-lytical procedure; when analytical methods are transferred from one laboratoryto another; or when major pieces of equipment instruments change. 2.7 The verication or degree of revalidation depend on the nature of the change(s). 2.8 There should be evidence that the analysts, who are responsible for certain tests, are appropriately qualied to perform those analyses (\"analyst prociency\"). 3. Pharmacopoeial methods 3.1 When pharmacopoeial methods are used, evidence should be available to prove that such methods are suitable for routine use in the laboratory (verication). 3.2 Pharmacopoeial methods used for determination of content or impurities in pharmaceutical products should also have been demonstrated to be specicwith respect to the substance under consideration (no placebo interference). 4. Non-pharmacopoeial methods 4.1 Non-pharmacopoeial methods should be appropriately validated. 5. Method validation 5.1 Validation should be performed in accordance with the validation proto-col. The protocol should include procedures and acceptance criteria for all char-acteristics. The results should be documented in the validation report. 5.2 Justication should be provided when non-pharmacopoeial methods are used if pharmacopoeial methods are available. Justication should include datasuch as comparisons with the pharmacopoeial or other methods. 5.3 Standard test methods should be described in detail and should provide sufcient information to allow properly trained analysts to perform the analysisin a reliable manner. As a minimum, the description should include the chro-matographic conditions (in the case of chromatographic tests), reagents needed,reference standards, the formulae for the calculation of results and system suit-ability tests.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 130QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1306. Characteristics of analytical procedures 6.1 Characteristics that should be considered during validation of analytical methods include: 6.1.1 Accuracy is the degree of agreement of test results with the true value, or the closeness of the results obtained by the procedure to the true value. It isnormally established on samples of the material to be examined that have beenprepared to quantitative accuracy. Accuracy should be established across thespecied range of the analytical procedure. Note: it is acceptable to use a \"spiked\" placebo where a known quantity or con- centration of a reference material is used. 6.1.2 Precision is the degree of agreement among individual results. The com- plete procedure should be applied repeatedly to separate, identical samplesdrawn from the same homogeneous batch of material. It should be measuredby the scatter of individual results from the mean (good grouping) andexpressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD). 6.1.2.1 Repeatability should be assessed using a minimum of nine determina- tions covering the specied range for the procedure e.g. three concentra-tions/three replicates each, or a minimum of six determinations at 100% of thetest concentration. 6.1.2.2 Intermediate precision expresses within-laboratory variations (usually on different days, different analysts and different equipment). If reproducibility isassessed, a measure of intermediate precision is not required. 6.1.2.3 Reproducibility expresses precision between laboratories. 6.1.3 Robustness (or ruggedness ) is the ability of the procedure to provide ana- lytical results of acceptable accuracy and precision under a variety of conditions.The results from separate samples are influenced by changes in the operationalor environmental conditions. Robustness should be considered during thedevelopment phase, and should show the reliability of an analysis when delib-erate variations are made in method parameters. 6.1.3.1 Factors that can have an effect on robustness when performing chro- matographic analysis include:MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 131QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 131\u2014 stability of test and standard samples and solutions; \u2014 reagents (e.g. different suppliers);\u2014 different columns (e.g. different lots and/or suppliers);\u2014 extraction time;\u2014 variations of pH of a mobile phase;\u2014 variations in mobile phase composition;\u2014 temperature; and\u2014 flow rate. 6.1.4 Linearity indicates the ability to produce results that are directly propor- tional to the concentration of the analyte in samples. A series of samples shouldbe prepared in which the analyte concentrations span the claimed range of theprocedure. If there is a linear relationship, test results should be evaluated byappropriate statistical methods. A minimum of ve concentrations should beused. 6.1.5 Range is an expression of the lowest and highest levels of analyte that have been demonstrated to be determinable for the product. The specied range isnormally derived from linearity studies. 6.1.6 Specicity (selectivity ) is the ability to measure unequivocally the desired analyte in the presence of components such as excipients and impurities thatmay also be expected to be present. An investigation of specicity should beconducted during the validation of identication tests, the determination ofimpurities and assay. 6.1.7 Detection limit (limit of detection ) is the smallest quantity of an analyte that can be detected, and not necessarily determined, in a quantitative fashion.Approaches may include instrumental or non-instrumental procedures andcould include those based on: \u2014 visual evaluation; \u2014 signal to noise ratio;\u2014 standard deviation of the response and the slope;\u2014 standard deviation of the blank; and\u2014 calibration curve. 6.1.8 Quantitation limit (limit of quantitation ) is the lowest concentration of an analyte in a sample that may be determined with acceptable accuracy and pre-cision. Approaches may include instrumental or non-instrumental proceduresand could include those based on: \u2014 visual evaluation; \u2014 signal to noise ratio;\u2014 standard deviation of the response and the slope;\u2014 standard deviation of the blank; and\u2014 calibration PHARMACEUTICALS 132QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1326.2 Characteristics (including tests) that should be considered when using different types of analytical procedures aresummarized in Table 1. 6.3 System suitability testingSystem suitability testing is an integral part of many analytical procedures. The tests are based on the concept that the equipment, electronics, analytical operations and samples to be analysed constitute an integral system that can beevaluated as such. System suitability test parameters that need to be establishedfor a particular procedure depend on the type of procedure being evaluated,for instance, a resolution test for an HPLC procedure.

Characteristics to consider during analytical validationQAP1 12/16/06 Page 1335. Back-ups 136 6. Validation Validation of hardware and software 136 7.1 Hardware 1367.2 Software 138 1. General 1.1 Computer systems should be validated at the level appropriate for their useand application. This is of importance in production as well as in quality control. 1.2 The use of a computer system includes different stages. These are planning, specication, programming, testing, commissioning, document operation, monitoring and modifying. 1.3 The purpose of validation of a computer system is to ensure an acceptable degree of evidence (documented, raw data), condence (dependability and thorough, rigorous achievement of predetermined specications), intended use,accuracy, consistency and reliability. 1.4 Both the system specications and functional specications should be validated. 1.5 Periodic (or continuous) evaluation should be performed after the initial validation. 1.6 There should be written procedures for performance monitoring, change control, programme and data security, calibration and maintenance, personneltraining, emergency recovery and periodic re-evaluation. 1.7 Aspects of computerized operations that should be considered during validation include: \u2014 networks \u2014 manual back-ups\u2014 input/output monitoring\u2014 alarms\u2014 shutdown recovery. 2. System specication 2.1 There should be a control document or system specication. The controldocument should state the objectives of a proposed computer system, the datato be entered and stored, the flow of data, how it interacts with other systemsand procedures, the information to be produced, the limits of any variable andQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 134QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 134the operating programme and test programme. (Examples of each document produced by the programme should be included.) 2.2 System elements that need to be considered in computer validation include hardware (equipment), software (procedures) and people (users). 3. Functional specication 3.1 A functional or performance specication should provide instructions fortesting, operating, and maintaining the system, as well as names of the person(s)responsible for its development and operation. 3.2 The following general aspects should be kept in mind when using computer systems: \u2014 location \u2014 power supply\u2014 temperature, and\u2014 magnetic disturbances. Fluctuations in the electrical supply can influence computer systems and power supply failure can result in loss of memory. 3.3 The following general good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements are applicable to computer systems. Verication and revalidation. After a suitable period of running a new system it should be independently reviewed and compared with the system speci-cation and functional specication. Change control. Alterations should only be made in accordance with a dened procedure which should include provision for checking, approving andimplementing the change. Checks. Data should be checked periodically to conrm that they have been accurately and reliably transferred. 4. Security 4.1 This is of importance in production as well as in quality control. 4.2 Data should be entered or amended only by persons authorized to do so. Suitable security systems should be in place to prevent unauthorized entry ormanipulation of data. The activity of entering data, changing or amending incor-rect entries and creating back-ups should all be done in accordance with written,approved standard operating procedures (SOPs). 4.3 The security procedures should be in writing. Security should also extend to devices used to store programmes, such as tapes, disks and magnetic stripcards. Access to these devices should be controlled.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 135QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1354.4 Traceability is of particular importance and it should be able to identify the persons who made entries/changes, released material, or performed othercritical steps in manufacture or control. 4.5 The entry of critical data into a computer by an authorized person (e.g. entry of a master processing formula) requires an independent veri cation andrelease for use by a second authorized person. 4.6 SOPs should be validated for certain systems or processes, e.g. the proce- dures to be followed if the system fails or breaks down should be dened andtested. Alternative arrangements should be made by the validation team, and adisaster recovery procedure should be available for the systems that need to beoperated in the event of a breakdown. 5. Back-ups 5.1 Regular back-ups of all les and data should be made and stored in a securelocation to prevent intentional or accidental damage. 6. Validation 6.1 Planning, which should include the validation policy, project plan andSOPs, is one of the steps in the validation process. 6.2 The computer-related systems and vendors should be dened and the vendor and product should be evaluated. The system should be designed andconstructed, taking into consideration the types, testing and quality assuranceof the software. 6.3 After installation of the system it should be qualied. The extent of the qual- ication should depend on the complexity of the system. The system should beevaluated and performance qualication, change control, maintenance and calibration, security, contingency planning, SOPs, training, performance moni-toring and periodic re-evaluation should be addressed. 7. Validation of hardware and software Table 1 indicates aspects of computer systems that should be subjected to validation. 7.1 Hardware 7.1.1 As part of the validation process appropriate tests and challenges to the hardware should be performed.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 136QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1367.1.2 Static, dust, power-feed voltage fluctuations and electromagnetic inter- ference could influence the system. The extent of validation should depend onthe complexity of the system. Hardware is considered to be equipment, and thefocus should be on location, maintenance and calibration of hardware, as wellas on validation/qualication. 7.1.3 The validation/qualication of the hardware should prove: that the capacity of the hardware matches its assigned function (e.g. foreign language);MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 137Table 1.

However, the ultimate responsibility for the suitability of equipmentused remains with the company. 7.1.7 Hardware validation data and protocols should be kept by the company. When validation information is produced by an outside rm, e.g. computervendor, the records maintained by the company need not include all of the voluminous test data; however, such records should be sufciently complete(including general results and protocols) to allow the company to assess the adequacy of the validation. A mere certication of suitability from the vendor,for example, will be inadequate. 7.2 Software 7.2.1 Software is the term used to describe the complete set of programmes used by a computer, and which should be listed in a menu. 7.2.2 Records are considered as software; focus is placed on accuracy, security, access, retention of records, review, double checks, documentation and accu-racy of reproduction. Identication 7.2.3 The company should identify the following key computer programmes: language, name, function (purpose of the programme), input (determineinputs), output (determine outputs), xed set point (process variable that cannotbe changed by the operator), variable set point (entered by the operator), edits(reject input/output that does not conform to limits and minimize errors, e.g.four- or ve-character number entry), input manipulation (and equations) andprogramme overrides (e.g. to stop a mixer before time). 7.2.4 The personnel who have the ability and/or are authorized to write, alter or have access to programmes should be identied.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 138QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1387.2.5 Software validation should provide assurance that computer programmes (especially those that control manufacturing and processing) will consistentlyperform as they are supposed to, within pre-established limits. When planning the validation, the following points should be considered. Function: does the programme match the assigned operational function (e.g. generate batch documentation, different batches of material used in a batchlisted)? Worst case: perform validation under different conditions (e.g. speed, data volume, frequency). Repeats: sufcient number of times (replicate data entries). Documentation: protocols and reports. Revalidation: needed when signicant changes are made. Appendix 6 Qualication of systems and equipment 1. Principle 139 2. Scope 1393. General 1404. Design qualication systems and equipment 165 1. Principle 1.1 Systems and equipment should be appropriately designed, located,installed, operated and maintained to suit their intended purpose. 1.2 Critical systems, i.e. those whose consistent performance may have an impact on the quality of products, should be qualied. These may include,where appropriate, water purication systems, air-handling systems, compressedair systems and steam systems. 1.3 The continued suitable performance of equipment is important to ensure batch-to-batch consistency. Critical equipment should therefore be qualied. 2. Scope 2.1 These guidelines describe the general aspects of qualication for systemsand equipment.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 139QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1392.2 Normally qualication would be applicable to critical systems and equipment whose performance may have an impact on the quality of theproduct. 3. General 3.1 The manufacturer should have a qualication policy for systems and equipment. 3.2 Equipment (including instruments) used in production and quality control should be included in the qualication policy and programme. 3.3 New systems and equipment should pass through all stages of qualication including design qualication (DQ), installation qualication (IQ), operationalqualication (OQ) and performance qualication (PQ) as appropriate (Fig. 1). 3.4 In some cases, not all stages of qualication may be required. See also the guidelines on the qualication of water purication systems in Appendix 2 andheating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) in Appendix 1. 3.5 Systems should be qualied before equipment.3.6 Equipment should be qualied prior to being brought into routine use to provide documented evidence that the equipment is t for its intended purpose. 3.7 Systems and equipment should undergo periodic requalication, as well as requalication after change.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 140Design qualification Installation qualification Operational qualification Performance qualification Change controlFigure 1. Stages of qualicationQAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1403.8 Certain stages of the equipment qualication may be done by the supplier or a third party. 3.9 The relevant documentation associated with qualication including stan- dard operating procedures (SOPs), specications and acceptance criteria, cer-ticates and manuals should be maintained. 3.10 Qualication should be done in accordance with predetermined and approved qualication protocols. The results of the qualication should berecorded and reflected in qualication reports. 3.11 The extent of the qualication should be based on the criticality of a system or equipment (e.g. blenders, autoclaves or computerized systems). 4. Design qualication Note: see also \"Validation\". 4.1 User requirements should be considered when deciding on the specic design of a system or equipment. 4.2 A suitable supplier should be selected for the appropriate system or equip- ment (approved vendor). 5. Installation qualication Note: see also \"Validation\". 5.1 Systems and equipment should be correctly installed in accordance with an installation plan and installation qualication protocol. 5.2 Requirements for calibration, maintenance and cleaning should be drawn up during installation. 5.3 Installation qualication should include identication and verication of all system elements, parts, services, controls, gauges and other components. 5.4 Measuring, control and indicating devices should be calibrated against appropriate national or international standards, which are traceable. 5.5 There should be documented records for the installation (installation qual- ication report) to indicate the satisfactoriness of the installation, which shouldinclude the details of the supplier and manufacturer, system or equipment name,model and serial number, date of installation, spare parts, relevant proceduresand certicates.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 141QAP1 12/16/06 installed conforms to the purchase speci cations and the manufacturer details and literature, and to document the information that ________________________ (system/equipment) meets its speci cations.Equipment inventory number: _____________________________________________________ Scope To perform installation quali cation as described in this IQ protocol at the time ofinstallation, modi cation and relocation.

The frequency of requalication may be determinedon the basis of factors such as the analysis of results relating to calibration, ver-ication and maintenance. 8.2 There should be periodic requalication.8.3 There should be requalication after changes. The extent of requalication after the change should be justied based on a risk-assessment of the change.Requalication after change should be considered as part of the change controlprocedure. 9. Qualication of \"in-use\" systems and equipment 9.1 There should be data to support and verify the suitable operation and performance of systems and equipment that have been \"in use\" for a period of time, and which had not been subjected to installation and or operationalqualication. 9.2 These should include operating parameters and limits for critical variables, calibration, maintenance and preventive maintenance, standard operating pro-cedures (SOPs) and records. 10. Reference A WHO guide to good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements. Part 2: Validation. Geneva, Global Programme for Vaccines and Immunization, Vaccine Supply and Quality, Global Training Network, World Health Organization, 1997(WHO/VSQ/97.02). Appendix 7 Non-sterile process validation 1. Principle 166 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1651. Principle 1.1 Process validation provides documented evidence that a process is capable of reliably and repeatedly rendering a product of the required quality. 1.2 The principles of planning, organizing and performing process validation are similar to those for qualication. It should be done in accordance withprocess validation protocols, data should be collected and reviewed against pre-determined acceptance criteria, and reflected in process validation reports. 2. Scope 2.1 These guidelines describe the general aspects of process validation for themanufacture of non-sterile nished products. 2.2 Normally process validation should cover at least the critical steps and para- meters (e.g. those that may have an impact on the quality of the product) in theprocess of manufacturing a pharmaceutical product. 3. General 3.1 The policy and approach to process validation should be documented, e.g.in a validation master plan, and should include the critical process steps andparameters. 3.2 Process validation should normally begin only once qualication of support systems and equipment is completed. In some cases process validation may beconducted concurrently with performance qualication. 3.3 Process validation should normally be completed prior to the manufacture of nished product that is intended for sale ( prospective validation ). Process validation during routine production may also be acceptable ( concurrent validation ). 4. Prospective validation 4.1 Critical factors or parameters that may affect the quality of the nished product should be identied during product development. To achieve this, the production process should be broken down into individual steps, and eachstep should be evaluated (e.g. on the basis of experience or theoretical considerations). 4.2 The criticality of these factors should be determined through a \"worst-case\" challenge where possible. 4.3 Prospective validation should be done in accordance with a validation protocol. The protocol should include:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 166QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 166\u2014 a description of the process; \u2014 a description of the experiment;\u2014 details of the equipment and/or facilities to be used (including measuring or recording equipment) together with its calibration status; \u2014 the variables to be monitored;\u2014 the samples to be taken\u2014where, when, how, how many and how much (sample size); \u2014 the product performance characteristics/attributes to be monitored, together with the test methods; \u2014 the acceptable limits;\u2014 time schedules;\u2014 personnel responsibilities; and\u2014 details of methods for recording and evaluating results, including statistical analysis. 4.4 All equipment, the production environment and analytical testing methods to be used should have been fully validated (e.g. during installation qualica-tion and operational qualication). 4.5 Personnel participating in the validation work should have been appropri- ately trained. 4.6 Batch manufacturing documentation to be used should be prepared after these critical parameters of the process have been identied, and machine settings, component specications and environmental conditions have beendetermined and specied. 4.7 A number of batches of the nal product should then be produced. The number of batches produced in this validation exercise should be sufcient toallow the normal extent of variation and trends to be established and to providesufcient data for evaluation. 4.8 Data within the nally agreed parameters, from at least three consecutive batches, giving product of the desired quality may be considered to constitutea proper validation of the process. 4.9 The batches should be of the same size, and should be the same as the batch size intended in full-scale production. Where this is not possible, the reducedbatch size should be considered in the design of the protocol and when full-scale production starts, the validity of any assumptions made should bedemonstrated. 4.10 Extensive testing should be performed on the product at various stages during the manufacturing process of the batches, including on the nal productand its package. 4.11 The results should be documented in the validation report. As a minimum, the report should include:MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 167QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 167 a description of the process: batch/packaging document, including details of critical steps; a detailed summary of the results obtained from in-process and nal testing, including data from failed tests. When raw data are not included, referenceshould be made to the sources used and where it can be found; any work done in addition to that specied in the protocol, or any deviations from the protocol should be formally noted along with an explanation; a review and comparison of the results with those expected; and formal acceptance or rejection of the work by the team or persons designated as being responsible for the validation, after completion of any correctiveaction or repeated work. 4.12 A conclusion and recommendation should be made on the extent of mon- itoring and the in-process controls necessary for routine production, on the basisof the results obtained. 4.13 The conclusion and recommendation should be incorporated into the batch manufacturing and batch packaging documents and/or standard operat-ing procedures (SOPs) for routine use. Limits and frequencies of testing andmonitoring should be specied. Actions to be taken in the event of the limitsbeing exceeded should be specied. 4.14 Batches manufactured as part of the validation exercise, and intended to be sold or supplied, should have been manufactured under conditions thatcomply fully with the requirements of good manufacturing practice and the marketing authorization (where applicable). 5. Concurrent validation 5.1 In certain cases, it may be appropriate to validate a process during routine production, e.g. where the product is a different strength of a previouslyvalidated product, a different tablet shape or where the process is well understood. 5.2 The decision to carry out concurrent validation should be made by appro- priately authorized personnel. 5.3 It is essential that the premises and equipment to be used during concur- rent validation have been previously qualied. 5.4 Prospective validation should be done in accordance with a validation protocol. 5.5 The results should be documented in the validation report.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 168QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1686. Retrospective validation 6.1 Retrospective validation is based on a comprehensive review of historical data to provide the necessary documentary evidence that the process is doingwhat it is believed to do. This type of validation also requires the preparationof a protocol, the reporting of the results of the data review, a conclusion anda recommendation. 6.2 Retrospective validation is not the preferred method of validation and should be used in exceptional cases only. It is acceptable only for well-established processes and will be inappropriate where there have been changesin the composition of the product, operating procedures or equipment. 6.3 Sufcient data should be reviewed to provide a statistically signicant conclusion. 6.4 When the results of retrospective validation are considered satisfactory, this should serve only as an indication that the process does not need to be sub-jected to validation in the immediate future. 7. Revalidation Note: see main text on \"Validation\". The need for periodic revalidation of non- sterile processes is considered to be a lower priority than for sterile processes. 7.1 In the case of standard processes using conventional equipment, a data review similar to that which would be required for retrospective validation mayprovide an adequate assurance that the process continues to be under control.The following points should also be considered: \u2014 the occurrence of any changes in the master formula, methods, starting mate- rial manufacturer, equipment and/or instruments; \u2014 equipment calibrations and preventive maintenance carried out;\u2014 standard operating procedures (SOPs); and\u2014 cleaning and hygiene programme. 8. Change control Note: see main text on \"Validation\". 8.1 Products manufactured by processes that have been subjected to changes should not be released for sale without full awareness and consideration of thechange and its impact on the process validation. 8.2 Changes that are likely to require revalidation may include:\u2014 changes in the manufacturing process (e.g. mixing times, drying temperatures);MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 169QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 169\u2014 changes in the equipment (e.g. addition of automatic detection systems); \u2014 production area and support system changes (e.g. rearrangement of areas or a new water treatment method); \u2014 transfer of processes to another site; and\u2014 unexpected changes (e.g. those observed during self-inspection or during routine analysis of process trend data).

Introduction 1.1 Scope of the document The guidance contained in this document is intended to provide informationabout the available specications for water for pharmaceutical use (WPU), guid-ance about which quality of water to use for specic applications, such as themanufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and dosage forms, andto provide guidance on the good manufacturing practice (GMP) regarding thedesign, installation and operation of pharmaceutical water systems. Althoughthe focus of this document is on water for pharmaceutical applications, theguidelines may also be relevant to other industrial or specic uses where thespecications and practices can be applied. The GMP guidance for WPU contained in this document is intended to be supplementary to the general GMP guidelines for pharmaceutical products pub-lished by WHO ( WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-seventh report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 908), Annex 4). This document refers to available specications, such as the pharma- copoeias and industry guidance for the use, production, storage and distribu-tion of water in bulk form. In order to avoid confusion it does not attempt toduplicate such material. Note : This document does not cover waters for admin- istration to patients in their formulated state or the use of small quantities ofwater in pharmacies to compound individually prescribed medicines. The guidance provided in this document can be used in whole or in part as appropriate to the application under consideration. Where subtle points of difference exist between pharmacopoeial specica- tions, the manufacturer will be expected to decide which option to choose inaccordance with the related marketing authorization submitted to the nationaldrug regulatory authority. 1.2 Background to water requirements and uses Water is the most widely used substance, raw material or starting material in theproduction, processing and formulation of pharmaceutical products. It hasunique chemical properties due to its polarity and hydrogen bonds. This meansit is able to dissolve, absorb, adsorb or suspend many different compounds.These include contaminants that may represent hazards in themselves or thatMAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 171QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 171may be able to react with intended product substances, resulting in hazards to health. Different grades of water quality are required depending on the route of administration of the pharmaceutical products. One source of guidance aboutdifferent grades of water is the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Note for guidance on quality of water for pharmaceutical use (CPMP/QWP/158/01). Control of the quality of water throughout the production, storage and dis- tribution processes, including microbiological and chemical quality, is a majorconcern. Unlike other product and process ingredients, water is usually drawnfrom a system on demand, and is not subject to testing and batch or lot releasebefore use. Assurance of quality to meet the on-demand expectation is, there-fore, essential. Additionally, certain microbiological tests may require periods ofincubation and, therefore, the results are likely to lag behind the water use.Control of the microbiological quality of WPU is a high priority. Some types ofmicroorganism may proliferate in water treatment components and in thestorage and distribution systems. It is very important to minimize microbial con-tamination by routine sanitization and taking appropriate measures to preventmicrobial proliferation. 1.3 Applicable guides In addition to the specic guidance provided in this document, the Bibliographylists some relevant publications that can serve as additional background material when planning, installing and using systems intended to provide WPU. 2. General requirements for pharmaceutical water systems Pharmaceutical water production, storage and distribution systems should be designed, installed, commissioned, validated and maintained to ensure the reliable production of water of an appropriate quality. They should not be operated beyond their designed capacity. Water should be produced, stored anddistributed in a manner that prevents unacceptable microbial, chemical or phys-ical contamination (e.g. with dust and dirt). The use of the systems following installation, commissioning, validation and any unplanned maintenance or modication work should be approved by thequality assurance (QA) department. If approval is obtained for planned pre-ventive maintenance tasks, they need not be approved after implementation. Water sources and treated water should be monitored regularly for quality and for chemical, microbiological and, as appropriate, endotoxin contamina-tion. The performance of water purication, storage and distribution systemsshould also be monitored. Records of the monitoring results and any actionstaken should be maintained for an appropriate length of time.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 172QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 172Where chemical sanitization of the water systems is part of the biocontam- ination control programme, a validated procedure should be followed to ensurethat the sanitizing agent has been effectively removed. 3. Water quality specications 3.1 General The following requirements concern water processed, stored and distributed inbulk form. They do not cover the specication of waters formulated for patientadministration. Pharmacopoeias include specications for both bulk anddosage-form waters. Pharmacopoeial requirements for WPU are described in national and inter- national pharmacopoeias and limits for various contaminants are given. Com-panies wishing to supply multiple markets should set specications that meetthe strictest requirements from each of the relevant pharmacopoeias. 3.2 Drinking-water Drinking-water should be supplied under continuous positive pressure in aplumbing system free of any defects that could lead to contamination of anyproduct. Drinking-water is unmodied except for limited treatment of the water derived from a natural or stored source. Examples of natural sources includesprings, wells, rivers, lakes and the sea. The condition of the source water willdictate the treatment required to render it safe for human consumption (drink-ing). Typical treatment includes softening, removal of specic ions, particlereduction and antimicrobial treatment. It is common for drinking-water to bederived from a public water supply that may be a combination of more thanone of the natural sources listed above. It is also common for public water-supply organizations to conduct tests and guarantee that the drinking-waterdelivered is of potable quality. Drinking-water quality is covered by the WHO drinking-water guidelines, standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) andother regional and national agencies. Drinking-water should comply with therelevant regulations laid down by the competent authority. If drinking-water is used directly in certain stages of pharmaceutical man- ufacture or is the feed-water for the production of higher qualities of WPU,then testing should be carried out periodically by the water user's site to conrmthat the quality meets the standards required for potable water. 3.3 Puried water Puried water (PW) should be prepared from a potable water source as aminimum-quality feed-water, should meet the forMAIN 173QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 173chemical and microbiological purity, and should be protected from recontami- nation and microbial proliferation. 3.4 Highly puried water Highly puried water (HPW) should be prepared from potable water as aminimum-quality feed-water. HPW is a unique specication for water foundonly in the European Pharmacopoeia . This grade of water must meet the same quality standard as water for injections (WFI) including the limit for endo-toxins, but the water-treatment methods are not considered to be as reliable asdistillation. HPW may be prepared by combinations of methods such as reverseosmosis, ultraltration and deionization. 3.5 Water for injections Water for injections (WFI) should be prepared from potable water as aminimum-quality feed-water. WFI is not sterile water and is not a nal dosageform. It is an intermediate bulk product. WFI is the highest quality of phar-macopoeial WPU. Certain pharmacopoeias place constraints upon the permitted purication techniques as part of the specication of the WFI. The International Pharma- copoeia and the European Pharmacopoeia , for example, allow only distillation as the nal purication step. 3.6 Other grades of water When a specic process requires a special non-pharmacopoeial grade of water,this should be specied and should at least satisfy the pharmacopoeial require-ments of the grade of WPU required for the type of dosage form or processstep. 4. Application of specic waters to processes and dosage forms Product licensing authorities dene the requirement to use the specic grades of WPU for different dosage forms or for different stages in washing, prepara-tion, synthesis, manufacturing or formulation. The grade of water used should take into account the nature and intended use of the intermediate or nished product and the stage in the manufacturingprocess at which the water is used. HPW can be used in the preparation of products when water of high quality (i.e. very low in microorganisms and endotoxins) is needed, but the processstage or product requirement does not include the constraint on the produc-tion method dened in some of the pharmacopoeial monographs for ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 174QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 174WFI should be used in injectable product preparations, for dissolving or diluting substances or preparations for parenteral administration before use,and for sterile water for preparation of injections. WFI should also be used forthe nal rinse after cleaning of equipment and components that come intocontact with injectable products as well as for the nal rinse in a washing processin which no subsequent thermal or chemical depyrogenization process isapplied. When steam comes into contact with an injectable product in its nal con- tainer, or equipment for preparing injectable products, it should conform withthe specication for WFI when condensed. 5. Water purication methods 5.1 General considerations The specications for WPU found in compendia (e.g. pharmacopoeias) are gen-erally not prescriptive as to permissible water purication methods other thanthose for WFI (refer to section 3.5). The chosen water purication method, or sequence of purication steps, must be appropriate to the application in question. The following should beconsidered when selecting the water treatment method: \u2014 the water quality specication; \u2014 the yield or efciency of the purication system;\u2014 feed-water quality and the variation over time (seasonal changes);\u2014 the reliability and robustness of the water-treatment equipment in operation;\u2014 the availability of water-treatment equipment on the market;\u2014 the ability to adequately support and maintain the water purication equip- ment; and \u2014 the operation costs. The specications for water purication equipment, storage and distribution systems should take into account the following: \u2014 the risk of contamination from leachates from contact materials; \u2014 the adverse impact of adsorptive contact materials;\u2014 hygienic or sanitary design, where required;\u2014 corrosion resistance;\u2014 freedom from leakage;\u2014 conguration to avoid proliferation of microbiological organisms;\u2014 tolerance to cleaning and sanitizing agents (thermal and chemical);\u2014 the system capacity and output requirements; and\u2014 the provision of all necessary instruments, test and sampling points to allow all the relevant critical quality parameters of the complete system tobe monitored.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 175QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 175The design, conguration and layout of the water purication equipment, storage and distribution systems should also take into account the followingphysical considerations: \u2014 the space available for the installation; \u2014 structural loadings on buildings;\u2014 the provision of adequate access for maintenance; and\u2014 the ability to safely handle regeneration and sanitization chemicals. 5.2 Production of drinking-water Drinking-water is derived from a raw water source such as a well, river or reser-voir. There are no prescribed methods for the treatment of raw water to producepotable drinking-water from a specic raw water source. Typical processes employed at a user plant or by a water supply authority include: \u2014 ltration; \u2014 softening;\u2014 disinfection or sanitization (e.g. by injec- of specic inorganic/organic materials. The drinking-water quality should be monitored routinely. Additional testing should be considered if there is any change in the raw-water source, treatmenttechniques or system conguration. If the drinking-water quality changes signicantly, the direct use of this water as a WPU, or as the feed-water to downstream treatment stages, should be reviewed and the result of the reviewdocumented. Where drinking-water is derived from an \"in-house\" system for the treat- ment of raw water, the water-treatment steps used and the system congurationshould be documented. Changes to the system or its operation should not bemade until a review has been completed and the change approved by the QAdepartment. Where drinking-water is stored and distributed by the user, the storage systems must not allow degradation of the water quality before use. After anysuch storage, testing should be carried out routinely in accordance with adened method. Where water is stored, its use should ensure a turnover of thestored water sufcient to prevent stagnation. The drinking-water system is usually considered to be an \"indirect impact system\" and does not need to be qualied. Drinking-water purchased in bulk and transported to the user by tanker presents special problems and risks not associated with potable water deliveredQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 176QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 176by pipeline. Vendor assessment and authorized certication activities, including conrmation of the acceptability of the delivery vehicle, should be undertakenin a similar way to that used for any other starting material. Equipment and systems used to produce drinking-water should be able to be drained and sanitized. Storage tanks should be closed with appropriately pro-tected vents, allow for visual inspection and for being drained and sanitized.Distribution pipework should be able to be drained, or flushed, and sanitized. Special care should be taken to control microbiological contamination of sand lters, carbon beds and water softeners. Once microorganisms haveinfected a system, the contamination can rapidly form biolms and spreadthroughout the system. Techniques for controlling contamination such as back-flushing, chemical or thermal sanitization and frequent regeneration should beconsidered. Additionally, all water-treatment components should be maintainedwith continuous water flow to inhibit microbial growth. 5.3 Production of puried water There are no prescribed methods for the production of PW in the pharma-copoeias. Any appropriate qualied purication technique or sequence of tech-niques may be used to prepare PW . Typically ion exchange, ultraltrationand/or reverse osmosis processes are used. Distillation can also be used. The following should be considered when conguring a water purication system: \u2014 the feed-water quality and its variation over seasons; \u2014 the required water-quality specication;\u2014 the sequence of purication stages required;\u2014 the energy consumption;\u2014 the extent of pretreatment required to protect the nal purication steps;\u2014 performance optimization, including yield and efciency of unit treatment- process steps; \u2014 appropriately located sampling points designed in such a way as to avoid potential contamination; and \u2014 unit process steps should be provided with appropriate instrumentation to measure parameters such as flow, pressure, temperature, conductivity, pHand total organic carbon. Ambient-temperature PW systems are especially susceptible to microbio- logical contamination, particularly when equipment is static during periods of noor low demand for water. It is essential to consider the mechanisms for microbi-ological control and sanitization. The following techniques should be considered: \u2014 maintenance of flow through water-purication equipment at all times; \u2014 control of temperature in the system by pipeline heat exchange or plant- room cooling to reduce the risk of microbial growth (guidance value <25\u00b0C);MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 177QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 177\u2014 provision of ultraviolet disinfection; \u2014 selection of water-treatment components that can be thermally sanitized; and/or \u2014 application of chemical sanitization (including agents such as ozone). 5.4 Production of highly puried water There are no prescribed methods for the production of HPW in any major phar-macopoeia, including the European Pharmacopoeia . Any appropriate qualied purication technique or sequence of techniques may be used to prepare HPW .Typically ion exchange, ultraltration and/or reverse osmosis processes are used. The guidance provided in section 5.3 for PW is equally applicable to HPW . 5.5 Production of water for injections The pharmacopoeias prescribe or limit the permitted nal water puricationstage in the production of WFI. Distillation is the preferred technique; it is con-sidered a more robust technique based on phase change, and in some cases,high temperature operation of the process equipment. The following should be considered when designing a water purication system: \u2014 the feed-water quality; \u2014 the required water quality specication;\u2014 the optimum generator size to avoid over-frequent start/stop cycling;\u2014 blow-down and dump functions; and\u2014 cool-down venting to avoid contamination ingress. 6. Water purication, storage and distribution systems This section applies to WPU systems for PW , HPW and WFI. The water storageand distribution should work in conjunction with the purication plant toensure consistent delivery of water to the user points, and to ensure optimumoperation of the water purication equipment. 6.1 General The storage and distribution system should be considered as a key part of thewhole system, and should be designed to be fully integrated with the waterpurication components of the system. Once water has been puried using an appropriate method, it can either be used directly or, more frequently, it will be fed into a storage vessel for subse-quent distribution to points of use. The following text describes the require-ments for storage and distribution systems.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 178QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 178The storage and distribution system should be congured to prevent recon- tamination of the water after treatment and be subjected to a combination ofonline and offline monitoring to ensure that the appropriate water specicationis maintained. 6.2 Materials that come into contact with systems for water for pharmaceutical use This section applies to generation equipment for PW , HPW and WFI, and the associated storage and distribution systems. The materials that come into contact with WPU, including pipework, valves and ttings, seals, diaphragms and instruments, should be selected to satisfy thefollowing objectives. Compatibility. All materials used should be compatible with the temperature and chemicals used by or in the system. Prevention of leaching. All materials that come into contact with WPU should be non-leaching at the range of working temperatures. Corrosion resistance . PW , HPW and WFI are highly corrosive. To prevent failure of the system and contamination of the water, the materials selectedmust be appropriate, the method of jointing must be carefully controlled,and all ttings and components must be compatible with the pipework used.Appropriate sanitary-specication plastics and stainless steel materials areacceptable for WPU systems. When stainless steel is used it should be at leastgrade 316 L. The system should be passivated after initial installation or aftermodication. When accelerated passivation is undertaken, the system shouldbe thoroughly cleaned rst, and the passivation process should be under-taken in accordance with a clearly dened documented procedure. Smooth internal nish . Once water has been puried it is susceptible to microbiological contamination, and the system is subject to the formation ofbiolms when cold storage and distribution is employed. Smooth internalsurfaces help to avoid roughness and crevices within the WPU system.Crevices are frequently sites where corrosion can commence. The internalnish should have an arithmetical average surface roughness of not greaterthan 0.8 micrometre arithmetical mean roughness (Ra). When stainlesssteelis used, mechanical and electropolishing techniques may be employed. Elec-tropolishing improves the resistance of the stainless steel material to surfacecorrosion. Jointing . The selected system materials should be able to be easily jointed by welding in a controlled manner. The control of the process should includeas a minimum, qualication of the operator, documentation of the welder set-up, work-session test pieces, logs of all welds and visual inspection of adened proportions of welds.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 179QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 179Design of flanges or unions . Where flanges or unions are used, they should be of a hygienic or sanitary design. Appropriate checks should be carried outto ensure that the correct seals are used and that they are tted and tight-ened correctly. Documentation. All system components should be fully documented and be supported by original or certied copies of material certicates. Materials. Suitable materials that may be considered for sanitary elements of the system include 316 L (low carbon) stainless steel, polypropylene,polyvinylidenedifluoride and perfluoroalkoxy. Other materials such asunplasticized polyvinylchloride (uPVC) may be used for treatment equip-ment designed for less pure water such as ion exchangers and softeners. 6.3 System sanitization and bioburden control Water treatment equipment, storage and distribution systems used for PW ,HPW and WFI should be provided with features to control the proliferationof microbiological organisms during normal use, as well as techniques for san-itizing or sterilizing the system after intervention for maintenance or modica-tion. The techniques employed should be considered during the design of thesystem and their performance proven during the commissioning and qualica-tion activities. Systems that operate and are maintained at elevated temperatures, in the range of 70-80\u00b0C, are generally less susceptible to microbiological contamina-tion than systems that are maintained at lower temperatures. When lower tem-peratures are required due to the water treatment processes employed or thetemperature requirements for the water in use, then special precautions shouldbe taken to prevent the ingress and proliferation of microbiological contami-nants (see section 6.5.3 for guidance). 6.4 Storage vessel requirements The water storage vessel used in a system serves a number of important purposes. The design and size of the vessel should take into consideration thefollowing. 6.4.1 Capacity The capacity of the storage vessel should be determined on the basis of the fol- lowing requirements. It is necessary to provide a buffer capacity between the steady-state genera- tion rate of the water-treatment equipment and the potentially variable simul-taneous demand from user points.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 180QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 180 The water treatment equipment should be able to operate continuously for signicant periods to avoid the inefciencies and equipment stress that occurwhen the equipment cycles on and off too frequently. The capacity should be sufcient to provide short-term reserve capacity in the event of failure of the water-treatment equipment or inability to producewater due to a sanitization or regeneration cycle. When determining the sizeof such reserve capacity, consideration should be given to providing suf-cient water to complete a process batch, work session or other logical periodof demand. 6.4.2 Contamination control considerations The following should be taken into account for the efcient control of contamination. The headspace in the storage vessel is an area of risk where water droplets and air can come into contact at temperatures that encourage the prolifera-tion of microbiological organisms. The water distribution loop should becongured to ensure that the headspace of the storage vessel is effectivelywetted by a flow of water. The use of spray ball or distributor devices to wetthe surfaces should be considered. Nozzles within the storage vessels should be congured to avoid dead zones where microbiological contamination might be harboured. Vent lters are tted to storage vessels to allow the internal level of liquid to fluctuate. The lters should be bacteria-retentive, hydrophobic and ideallybe congured to allow in situ testing of integrity. Offline testing is also accept-able. The use of heated vent lters should be considered to prevent con-densation within the lter matrix that might lead to lter blockage and tomicrobial grow-through that could contaminate the storage vessels. Where pressure-relief valves and bursting discs are provided on storage vessels to protect them from over-pressurization, these devices should be ofa sanitary design. Bursting discs should be provided with external ruptureindicators to prevent accidental loss of system integrity. 6.5 Requirements for water distribution pipework The distribution of PW , HPW and WFI should be accomplished using a con-tinuously circulating pipework loop. Proliferation of contaminants within thestorage tank and distribution loop should be controlled. Filtration should not usually be used in distribution loops or at takeoff user points to control biocontamination. Such lters are likely to conceal systemcontamination.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 181QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1816.5.1 Temperature control and heat exchangers Where heat exchangers are employed to heat or cool WPU within a system, pre- cautions should be taken to prevent the heating or cooling utility from conta-minating the water. The more secure types of heat exchangers of the doubletube plate or double plate and frame conguration should be considered. Wherethese types are not used, an alternative approach whereby the utility is main-tained and monitored at a lower pressure than the WPU may be considered. Where heat exchangers are used they should be arranged in continually cir- culating loops or subloops of the system to avoid unacceptable static water insystems. When the temperature is reduced for processing purposes, the reduction should occur for the minimum necessary time. The cooling cycles and theirduration should be proven satisfactory during the qualication of the system. 6.5.2 Circulation pumps Circulation pumps should be of a sanitary design with appropriate seals that prevent contamination of the system. Where stand-by pumps are provided, theyshould be congured or managed to avoid dead zones trapped within thesystem. 6.5.3 Biocontamination control techniques The following control techniques may be used alone or more commonly in combination. Maintenance of continuous turbulent flow circulation within water distribu- tion systems reduces the propensity for the formation of biolms. The main-tenance of the design velocity for a specic system should be proven duringthe system qualication and the maintenance of satisfactory performanceshould be monitored. During the operation of a distribution system, short-term fluctuations in the flow velocity are unlikely to cause contaminationproblems provided that cessation of flow, flow reversal or pressure loss doesnot occur. The system design should ensure the shortest possible length of pipework. For ambient temperature systems, pipework should be isolated from adja- cent hot pipes. Deadlegs in the pipework installation greater than 1.5 times the branch diam- eter should be avoided. Pressure gauges should be separated from the system by membranes. Hygienic pattern diaphragm valves should be used. Pipework should be laid to falls to allow drainage. The growth of microorganisms can be inhibited by:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 182QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 182\u2014 ultraviolet radiation sources in pipework; \u2014 maintaining the system heated (guidance temperature 70-80\u00b0C);\u2014 sanitizing the system periodically using hot water (guidance temperature >70\u00b0C); \u2014 sterilizing or sanitizing the system periodically using superheated hot water or clean steam; and \u2014 routine chemical sanitization using ozone or other suitable chemical agents. When chemical sanitization is used, it is essential to prove thatthe agent has been removed prior to using the water. Ozone can be effec-tively removed by using ultraviolet radiation. 7. Operational considerations 7.1 Start-up and commissioning of water systems Planned, well-dened, successful and well-documented commissioning is anessential precursor to successful validation of water systems. The commission-ing work should include setting to work, system setup, controls loop tuning andrecording of all system performance parameters. If it is intended to use or referto commissioning data within the validation work then the quality of the com-missioning work and associated data and documentation must be commensu-rate with the validation plan requirements. 7.2 Qualication WPU, PW , HPW and WFI systems are all considered to be direct impact,quality critical systems that should be qualied. The qualication should followthe validation convention of design (IQ), operational qualication (PQ). This guidance does not dene the standard requirements for the conven- tional validation stages DQ, IQ and OQ, but concentrates on the particular PQapproach that should be used for WPU systems to demonstrate their consistentand reliable performance. A three-phase approach should be used to satisfy theobjective of proving the reliability and robustness of the system in service overan extended period. Phase 1 . A test period of 2-4 weeks should be spent monitoring the system intensively. During this period the system should operate continuously withoutfailure or performance deviation. The following should be included in thetesting approach. Undertake chemical and microbiological testing in accordance with a dened plan. Sample the incoming feed-water daily to verify its quality. Sample after each step in the purication process daily.MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 183QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 183 Sample at each point of use and at other dened sample points daily. Develop appropriate operating ranges. Develop and nalize operating, cleaning, sanitizing and maintenance proce- dures. Demonstrate production and delivery of product water of the required quality and quantity. Use and rene the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for operation, maintenance, sanitization and troubleshooting. Verify provisional alert and action levels. Develop and rene test-failure procedure. Phase 2. A further test period of 2-4 weeks should be spent carrying out further intensive monitoring while deploying all the rened SOPs after the satisfactorycompletion of phase 1. The sampling scheme should be generally the same asin phase 1. Water can be used for manufacturing purposes during this phase.The approach should also: \u2014 demonstrate consistent operation within established ranges; and \u2014 demonstrate consistent production and delivery of water of the required quantity and quality when the system is operated in accordance with theSOPs. Phase 3 . Phase 3 typically runs for 1 year after the satisfactory completion of phase 2. Water can be used for manufacturing purposes during this phase whichhas the following objectives and features. Demonstrate extended reliable performance. Ensure that seasonal variations are evaluated. The sample locations, sampling frequencies and tests should be reduced to the normal routine pattern based on established procedures proven duringphases 1 and 2. 7.3 Continuous system monitoring After completion of phase 3 of the qualication programme for the WPUsystem, a system review should be undertaken. Following this review, a routinemonitoring plan should be established based on the results of phase 3. Monitoring should include a combination of online instrument monitoring of parameters such as flow, pressure, temperature, conductivity and total organiccarbon, and offline sample testing for physical, chemical and microbiologicalattributes. Offline samples should be taken from points of use and specicsample points. Samples from points of use should be taken in a similar way tothat adopted when the water is being used in service. Tests should be carried out to ensure that the selected pharmacopoeia spec- ication has been satised, and should include, as appropriate, determinationQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 184QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 184of conductivity, pH, heavy metals, nitrates, total organic carbon, total viable count, presence of specic pathogens and endotoxins. Monitoring data should be subject to trend analysis. 7.4 Maintenance of water systems WPU systems should be maintained in accordance with a controlled, docu-mented maintenance programme that takes into account the following: \u2014 dened frequency for system elements; \u2014 the calibration programme;\u2014 SOPs for specic tasks;\u2014 control of approved spares;\u2014 issue of clear maintenance plan and instructions;\u2014 review and approval of systems for use upon completion of work; and\u2014 record and review of problems and faults during maintenance. 7.5 System reviews WPU (PW , HPW and WFI) systems should be reviewed at appropriate regularintervals. The review team should comprise representatives from engineering,QA, operations and maintenance. The review should consider matters such as: \u2014 changes made since the last review; \u2014 system performance;\u2014 reliability;\u2014 quality trends;\u2014 failure installation;\u2014 updated installation documentation;\u2014 log books; and\u2014 the status of the current SOP list. 8. Inspection of water systems WPU (PW , HPW and WFI) systems are likely to be the subject of regulatoryinspection from time to time. Users should consider conducting routine auditand self-inspection of established water systems. This GMP guidance can beused as the basis of inspection. The following list identies items and a logicalsequence for a WPU system inspection or audit: \u2014 a sampling and monitoring plan with a drawing of all sample points; \u2014 the setting of monitoring alert and action levels;MAIN PRINCIPLES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 185QAP1 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 185\u2014 monitoring results and evaluation of trends; \u2014 inspection of the last annual system review;\u2014 review of any changes made to the system since the last audit and check that the change control has been implemented; \u2014 review of deviations recorded and their investigation;\u2014 general inspection of system for status and condition;\u2014 review of maintenance, failure and repair logs; and\u2014 checking calibration and standardization of critical instruments. For an established system that is demonstrably under control, this scope of review should prove adequate. For new systems, or systems that display instability or unreliability, the fol- lowing should also be reviewed: \u2014 performance qualication; \u2014 operational qualication; and\u2014 installation qualication.

WHO good manufacturing practices: starting materials Active pharmaceutical ingredients (bulk drug substances)1,2 Explanation 188 General considerations 1881. Personnel 1892. Premises 1903. Equipment 1904. Sanitation 1915. Documentation 1916. Production 1937. Packaging 194 Explanation Since there are fundamental distinctions between the production of bulk activepharmaceutical ingredients and the formulation of nished pharmaceuticalproducts, the strict application of GMP as set forth in the main part of thisguide is not always practical or necessary. The present supplementary guidelinesoutline procedures and practices that manufacturers should employ to ensurethat the methods, facilities, and controls used for the production of active phar-maceutical ingredients are operated or managed so that such products have thequality and purity appropriate for their use in nished pharmaceutical products. General considerations In the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients, overall control is essen-tial to ensure high quality. Haphazard operations cannot be permitted in themanufacture of substances that may be used to save life or to restore or promotehealth. 1Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products, Part Three, section 18. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-second report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 1992: 72-79 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 823). 2Introductory note, General considerations, main principles and Glossary of Good manufacturing prac-tices for pharmaceutical products are reproduced elsewhere in this volume (see pp. 7-57).QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 188Recommended practices for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients are set out below. Adherence to these practices, complementing thevarious control tests carried out from the beginning to the end of the produc-tion cycle, will contribute substantially to the production of consistently uniformbatches of high-quality active pharmaceutical ingredients. The manufacturer must assume responsibility for the quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredients produced. The manufacturer alone can avoid mis-takes and prevent mishaps by exercising adequate care in both production andcontrol procedures. Full evidence of compliance with GMP should be givenfrom the step from which the processes or the starting materials used have acritical influence on the quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Thisstep should be determined in each individual case by agreement between thecompetent authority and the manufacturer. The good practices outlined below should be considered general guides; whenever necessary, they may be adapted to meet individual needs provided theestablished standards of quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredients are stillachieved. The good practices are intended to apply to the manufacturingprocesses (including packaging and labelling) used in the production of activepharmaceutical ingredients. Sometimes several rms cooperate in the production (including packaging and labelling) of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. It may also happen thata nished, packed, and labelled active pharmaceutical ingredient is repackedand/or relabelled and given a new designation. Since such procedures consti-tute part of a manufacturing operation, they should be subject to the relevantguidelines set out below. The practices outlined below are intended to apply to active pharmaceuti- cal ingredients for both human and veterinary preparations. 1. Personnel 1.1 Each rm should employ personnel with the necessary qualications andcompetence for the production and quality control of active pharmaceuticalingredients. There should be an adequate number of staff with appropriate edu-cation, technical knowledge, and practical experience related to the job theyperform. 1.2 The rm should have a dened organization represented in a chart. Indi- vidual responsibilities should be laid down in written instructions, to ensure thatthere are no gaps or overlaps. The responsibilities placed on any one individualshould not be so extensive as to incur any risk to quality. 1.3 Staff at all levels should be adequately trained for the tasks and responsi- bilities assigned to them.STARTING MATERIALS 189QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1891.4 Measures should be taken to ensure that no person affected by a disease in a communicable form or having open lesions on the exposed surface of the bodyis engaged in any production step involving direct contact with the active phar-maceutical ingredients. 2. Premises 2.1 Premises, including areas containing open tanks, should be of suitable construction. They should provide a suitable environment for manufacturingoperations and should be adequately adapted to and of a sufcient size for theirintended use. The premises should not contribute to actual or potential mix-ups or contamination of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. The arrangementshould provide for a logical work flow. 2.2 For special purposes, such as the production of sterile products and of certain antibiotics, hormones, and cytostatic substances, separate specicallydesigned enclosed areas with completely separate air-handling systems shouldbe provided. 2.3 To maintain hygienic working conditions, the premises should include facilities for changing clothes, washing, and toilet purposes as well as for eating,drinking, and smoking. 3. Equipment 3.1 Manufacturing equipment should be designed, constructed, located, andmaintained in such a way as to: (a) be suitable for its intended use; (b) facilitate thorough cleaning;(c) minimize the risk of contamination of products and containers during pro- duction; and (d) facilitate efcient and, if applicable, validated and reliable operation. 3.2 Production and testing equipment should be cleaned, sterilized when nec- essary, used, and maintained in accordance with specic written instructions.Before production of another product is started, multipurpose equipment usedshould be thoroughly cleaned and checked for cleanliness. Appropriate recordsof such procedures should be maintained. 3.3 If necessary, equipment used for production and testing should have been shown to be capable of carrying out the processes for which it is intended. 3.4 Process-monitoring systems should be available where necessary. Measur- ing, recording, and control equipment should be calibrated and checked at suit-able intervals by appropriate methods. Appropriate records of such tests shouldbe maintained.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 190QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1903.5 Defective equipment should be labelled immediately as defective and repaired or removed as soon as possible. Technical maintenance and repairshould be documented. 4. Sanitation 4.1 Written sanitation programmes should be available. These should includevalidated cleaning procedures for premises and equipment, a quality standardfor water, instructions for hygiene when manufacturing and handling goods, andinstructions relating to the health, hygienic practices, and clothing of personneland the disposal procedures for waste materials and unusable residues. 4.2 These programmes should be implemented; they should regularly be brought to the attention of the personnel involved and emphasized during con-tinued staff training. 4.3 Protective garments and other protective items appropriate to the processes being carried out should be worn. 4.4 Eating, smoking, and unhygienic practices should not be permitted in man- ufacturing areas. 5. Documentation Master formulae 5.1 Written instructions covering each stage of production, storage, and qualitycontrol should be available, and they should be updated whenever necessary. 5.2 There should be a master formula setting out in writing the starting materials and packaging materials (quality and quantity), as well as detailed production and quality control procedures for each active pharmaceutical ingredient. Wherever possible, the master formula should be prepared for standard batch sizes. 5.3 Competent persons experienced in production and quality control should be responsible for the content and distribution within the rm of instructionsand master formulae. These should be duly signed and dated. 5.4 Outdated master formulae should be withdrawn but retained for reference. Copies of the master formula should be prepared in a manner that will elimi-nate any possibility of transcription error. 5.5 In certain circumstances, for example in the rst production runs follow- ing pilot development, the master formula might need to be amended. Anyamendments must be formally authorized and signed by competent person(s).The amended document should be replaced at the earliest opportunity by anewly prepared master formula.STARTING MATERIALS 191QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 191Batch documentation 5.6 A batch manufacturing record should be completed during the production of each batch of intermediate products and of active pharmaceutical ingredi-ents. It should contain the relevant parts of the master formula and shouldinclude the following: (a) the name of the product (if applicable, the International Nonproprietary Name) or stage and the size and number of the batch; (b) the dates of the different stages of production;(c) production details, including reference to the main equipment used and yields; (d) the batch or reference number (or analytical control number), if any, of starting materials used in the production; (e) a record of the in-process controls followed and the results obtained;(f) details of, and signed authorization for, any deviation from the master formula (any unplanned deviation being subject to investigation in rela-tion to product quality); (g) any recovered materials, and procedures applied;(h) the initials of the operators and signature of the person responsible for the production operations and the date of signature; (i) all analytical records relating to the batch, or a reference that will permit their retrieval; (j) a decision for the release or rejection of the batch with the date and sig- nature of the person responsible for the decision; (k) the production record review (see section 17.21). 5.7 Where circumstances require the use of contract production and control facilities, this fact should be stated in the batch record. 5.8 Data may be recorded by electronic data-processing systems or by photo- graphic or other reliable means. Master formulae and detailed standard operating procedures relating to the system in use should be available and theaccuracy of the records should be checked. If documentation is handled by elec-tronic data-processing methods, only authorized persons should be able to enteror modify data in the computer, and there should be a record of changes anddeletions; access should be restricted by passwords or other means, and theentry of critical data should be independently checked. Batch records electron-ically stored should be protected by back-up transfer on magnetic tape, micro-lm, paper print-outs, or other means. It is particularly important that, duringthe period of retention, the data are readily available. Retention of records and reference samples 5.9 Records should be kept in such a way that activities concerning the pro-duction and quality control of active pharmaceutical ingredients are traceable.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 192QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1925.10 Records and reference samples of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, and, where necessary, of intermediate products, should be retained at least oneyear beyond the expiry date of the nished product or for a specied period ifthere is no expiry date. 6. Production Processing procedures 6.1 Processing should be carried out in accordance with the master formula. 6.2 Steps that are critical for the quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredi- ent should be dened and the procedures applied should be validated. 6.3 Processing should be supervised and performed by competent persons.6.4 During processing, vessels, containers, and signicant equipment should be unambiguously labelled or identied with the name of the product and the batchnumber. 6.5 Information on the daily activities in each processing department should be available in addition to the batch documentation. Starting materials 6.6 Starting materials should be received, quarantined, sampled, identied,examined for compliance with established specications, released or rejected,stored, labelled, and dispensed in accordance with written instructions. 6.7 Some starting materials may not be tested for compliance because of the hazards involved (e.g., phosphorus pentachloride and dimethyl sulfate). This isacceptable when a batch certicate of analysis is available from the vendor andwhen there is a reason based on safety or other valid considerations. Intermediate products 6.8 Intermediate products should, where necessary, be tested in accordancewith the specications and should be conspicuously labelled/identied andproperly stored. Active pharmaceutical ingredients 6.9 Each batch of nished active pharmaceutical ingredient must meet estab-lished specications for quality, purity, identity, and potency, including, whereapplicable, specications for tests and limits for residues of solvents and otherreactants.STARTING MATERIALS 193QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 1936.10 For the production of sterile active pharmaceutical ingredients, the rst section of chapter 3 (\"Sterile pharmaceutical products\") may be applicable tothe steps at which the process may have a critical influence on the quality attrib-utes of the nished pharmaceutical product. 7. Packaging 7.1 Care should be exercised when packaging materials are selected for activepharmaceutical ingredients. The materials should have no detrimental effect onthe substance, and should give adequate protection against external influencesand potential contamination. Suitable written specications should be available. 7.2 Attention should be directed at all stages to the prevention of packaging errors. Sound procedures must be employed to protect the quality of theproduct when it is packaged and to ensure that the correct labels are appliedto the containers. 7.3 The containers should be conspicuously marked with the following information: (a) the name of the product; (b) its quality, if specied;(c) the batch number;(d) the expiry or retest date, if specied;(e) warnings, if required;(f) storage conditions, if specied; and(g) the names of the manufacturer and the supplier. Quality control 7.4 Every manufacturer should have an independent quality control unit, thehead of which is directly responsible to the management of the rm. The prin-cipal duties of the quality control unit are listed below. (a) It should approve: (i) specications and testing methods for starting materials, intermediate products and, if required, packaging materials and active pharma-ceutical ingredients; (ii) sampling procedures;(iii) instructions regarding sanitation and hygiene;(iv) reprocessing procedures for rejected batches or recovered materials;(v) other instructions related to the quality of the product. (b) It should be responsible for the release or rejection of starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, packaging materials, and, if required,intermediate products.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 194QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 194(c) It should ensure that the stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients is monitored. (d) It should be responsible for the investigation of complaints related to the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredients. 7.5 Every manufacturer should have access to a control laboratory. The labo- ratory should be staffed and fully equipped for performing all quality controltests required. The tests should be performed in accordance with written andvalidated procedures. Instruments should be calibrated at suitable intervals andreagents should be of appropriate quality. 7.6 Where circumstances require the use of outside laboratories, this fact should be stated in the analytical records. Stability studies 7.7 A written stability-testing programme should be established for active phar-maceutical ingredients. Stability-indicating methods should be used. 7.8 Samples should be stored in suitable containers and in simulated market containers at room temperature or the recommended temperature and understress conditions. 7.9 Expiry dates do not usually need to be set for active pharmaceutical ingre- dients. If testing does not indicate a reasonable shelf-life, e.g. two years or moreunder anticipated storage conditions, then the product can be labelled with anappropriate arbitrary expiry date and should be retested on or before that date. Self-inspection and quality audits 7.10 In order to maintain strict adherence to GMP and to all manufacturingprocedures and prescribed controls, it is advisable for a rm to designate anexpert or a team of experts to conduct regular independent inspections of itsoverall production and control procedures. Such experts should be as inde-pendent as possible in their inspection of production and control procedures. 7.11 Self-inspections and audits (see section 9) should be recorded. Storage 7.12 Active pharmaceutical ingredients should be stored under conditions established by the manufacturer on the basis of stability studies. 7.13 Records should be maintained on the distribution of each batch of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in order to facilitate the recall of the batch ifnecessary, according to written procedures.STARTING MATERIALS 195QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 195Complaints and defects 7.14 The manufacturer should maintain written instructions for dealing with complaints and defects concerning the quality of active pharmaceuticalingredients. 7.15 All necessary action should be taken promptly, the complaints thoroughly investigated, and all facts recorded. 7.16 The manufacturer should have a system to allow review of all products that may have been affected by a repetitive error or a failure in the proceduresof the rm. Rejected materials 7.17 The manufacturer should maintain written instructions concerning thehandling of rejected materials, whether starting materials, intermediate prod-ucts, packaging materials, or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Rejected materials should be conspicuously identied as such and stored in a controlledmanner pending destruction, reprocessing, or return to the supplier. Pharmaceutical excipients1 1.

General considerations These guidelines, which focus on aspects of good manufacturing practices(GMP) specic for pharmaceutical excipients, supplement the general GMPguidelines for pharmaceutical products published by WHO. 1They also incor- porate some of the concepts for quality management systems determined by theInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). Excipients signicantly affect the nished product quality, in some cases making up almost the entire formulation. Many pharmaceutical excipients areused in much greater quantities in other industries, such as the food, cosmeticor industrial chemical industry. Consistency and rigour of product specicationsmay not be as critical in these industries as they are for pharmaceuticals, andmany of the excipients used are highly variable. Therefore, a programme mustbe in place which will monitor these excipients and provide the necessary assur-ance that they meet the quality parameters for pharmaceutical manufacturingprocesses. The purpose of this document is to lay out some criteria which maybe used to achieve this level of assurance. The formulator of the nished dosage form is highly dependent on the excipient manufacturer to provide bulk substances that are uniform inSTARTING MATERIALS 1971Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specica- tions for Pharmaceutical Preparations, Thirty-second report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 908), Annex 4. In this volume, see pp. 7-58.QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 197chemical and physical characteristics. This is particularly important in the product approval process, where bioequivalence comparisons are made betweenclinical bioequivalence (\"biobatch\") production and commercial scale-upbatches. To provide adequate assurance of drug product performance in vivo,the excipient used to manufacture commercial batches should not differ signi-cantly from that used in biobatches. Where signicant differences may beexpected, additional testing by the nished dosage manufacturer may be requiredto establish the bioequivalence of the nished product. It remains equally impor-tant to ensure that the bioequivalence of subsequent, post-approval commercialbatches of drug products is not adversely affected over time. In general, excipients are used as purchased, with no further renement or purication. Consequently, impurities present in the excipient will be carriedover to the nished dosage form. While dosage form manufacturers may havea limited control over excipient quality (i.e. by obtaining certicates of analysisand testing representative samples), the excipient manufacturer has greatercontrol over physical characteristics, quality, and the presence of trace-levelimpurities in the excipient. The excipient manufacturer should perform peri-odic performance trend analyses of processes, and the purchaser of the mater-ial should also maintain a trend analysis of all testing done on the excipient uponreceipt. In the manufacture of excipients, the environmental conditions, equipment and operational techniques employed reflect the chemical industry rather thanthe nished drug manufacturing industry. In some processes chemical and bio-chemical mechanisms have not been fully characterized; therefore, the methodsand procedures for materials accountability will often differ from those applic-able to the manufacture of nished dosage forms. Many chemical processes areperformed in closed systems that tend to provide protection against contami-nation, even when the reaction vessels are not enclosed in buildings. However,this does not preclude the introduction of contaminants from equipment, mate-rials used to protect equipment, corrosion, cleaning and personnel. Some excipient manufacturing processes may require observance of GMP applicable to nished drug products or bulk active ingredients because of theexcipient's intended use. However, such observance is neither feasible nor nec-essary in many processes, particularly during the early processing steps. Therequirements increase as the process progresses. At some logical processing step,usually well before the nal nishing operation, appropriate GMP should beimposed and maintained throughout the remainder of the process. To deter-mine the processing step at which these GMP should be implemented, goodjudgement and a thorough knowledge of the process are required. A detailedprocess flow should identify the unit operations, equipment used, stages atwhich various substances are added, key steps in the process, critical parame-ters (time, temperature, pressure, etc.) and monitoring points. An excipient manufacturer should be able to identify critical or key points in the process where selective intermediate sampling and testing is necessary inQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 198QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 198order to monitor process performance. Towards the end of the process, the records should be increasingly thorough. Signicant processing steps, required to produce an excipient that meets the established physical and chemical criteria, should be identied by the excip-ient manufacturer. These steps can involve a number of unit operations or unitprocesses. Unit operations include physical processing steps involving energytransfer where there is no chemical change of the molecule. Unit processes arethose processing steps where the molecule undergoes a chemical change. Signicant processing steps include but are not limited to the following: Phase changes involving either the desired molecule, a solvent, inert carrier or vehicle (e.g. dissolution, crystallization, evaporation, drying, sublimation,distillation or absorption). Phase separation (e.g. ltration or centrifugation). Chemical changes involving the desired molecule (e.g. removal or addition of water of hydration, acetylation, formation of a salt). Adjustments of the solution containing the molecule (e.g. adjustment of pH). Precision measurement of added excipient components, in-process solutions, recycled materials (e.g. weighing, volumetric measuring). Mixing of multiple components. Changes that occur in surface area, particle size or batch uniformity (e.g. milling, agglomeration, blending). Automated process controls and processing equipment are more likely to be used in an excipient plant than in a plant manufacturing nished dosage forms.Use of automated equipment is appropriate when adequate inspection, calibra-tion, and maintenance procedures are performed. Production equipment andoperations will vary depending on the type of excipient being produced, thescale of production, and the type of operation (i.e. batch versus continuous). ISO \"certication\" for excipient manufacture is increasingly being required by nal dosage formulators in the USA, Europe and Japan. Compliance to theInternational Standards of ISO 9000 series, in particular to ISO 9002, can confergreater acceptability of a supplier's excipients in world markets. There is addi-tional value to applying the principles of ISO 9000 to excipient manufacture,since quality system measures enhance GMP . Such ISO considerations as con-formance to specic customer requirements, purchase of raw materials and statistical techniques benet both the excipient customer and the manufacturer,and strengthen the relationship between the two. It is therefore recommended that excipient manufacturers establish and implement a formal company-wide quality policy. Management should be com-mitted to this policy and should appoint appropriate company personnel to beresponsible for coordination and implementation of the quality system. Man-agement should participate in the development of the company's quality policyand provide the resources necessary for development, maintenance and peri-odic review of such a policy and quality system. Any signicant changes in theSTARTING MATERIALS 199QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 199processes should be validated with respect to excipient performance. It is rec- ommended that all pharmaceutical manufacturers and also local agents shouldbe informed of these changes. Ideally, excipient manufacturers should not subcontract any part of their process without the explicit knowledge of the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Safe handling instructions should be provided by the excipient manu- facturer to ensure that the purchaser is adequately equipped to handle the material. This should include information on the material's toxicity and the measurements to be taken upon accidental exposure. The equipment require-ments for proper handling of the material should also be established. 2. Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts. commingling The blending of carry-over material from one grade of an excipient with another,usually due to a continuous process. drug masterle1 Detailed information concerning a specic facility, process or product submit-ted to the drug regulatory authority, intended for incorporation into the appli-cation for marketing authorization. model product A product which simulates a group of similar products. mother liquor A concentrated solution from which the product is obtained by evaporation,freezing, and/or crystallization. pharmaceutical excipients Substances, other than the active ingredient, which have been appropriatelyevaluated for safety and are included in a drug delivery system to: \u2014 aid in the processing of the drug delivery system during its manufacture; \u2014 protect, support or enhance stability, bioavailability, or patient acceptability; \u2014 assist in product identication; or\u2014 enhance any other attribute of the overall safety and effectiveness of the drug during storage or use.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2001This term appears to be specic to United States regulations.QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2003. Self-inspection and quality audits An inspection team consisting of appropriate personnel (e.g. auditors, engineers, laboratory analysts, purchasing agents, computer experts) should participate ininspections. The operational limitations and validation of the critical processingsteps of a production process should be examined, to make sure that the man-ufacturer is taking adequate steps to check that the process works consistently. The excipient's end-use should be identied and considered during inspec- tion of excipient manufacturers. It is particularly important to know whetherthe excipient is a direct or indirect component of a drug dosage form; whetherthe excipient will be used in the preparation of a sterile dosage form; andwhether the excipient is presented as pyrogen/endotoxin free. The excipientmanufacturer is responsible for ensuring that excipients are pyrogen free if themanufacturer makes such a representation in specications, labels or a drugmaster le. A good starting point for an excipient plant inspection is a review of the following areas: Non-conformance, such as the rejection of a batch not complying with spec- ications, return of a product by a customer, or recall of a product. The causeof non-conformance should have been determined by the manufacturer, areport of the investigation prepared, and subsequent corrective action initi-ated and documented. Records and documents should be reviewed to ensurethat such non-conformance is not the result of a poorly developed or incon-sistent process. Complaint les. Customers may report some aspects of product attributes that are not entirely suitable for their use. These may be caused by impuri-ties or inconsistencies in the excipient manufacturing process. Change control documentation. Master formula and batch production records. Frequent revisions may reveal problems in the production process. Specications for the presence of unreacted intermediates and solvent residues in the nished excipient. Storage areas for rejected products. In evaluating the adequacy of measures taken to preclude contamination of materials in the process, it is appropriate to consider the following factors: Type of system (e.g. open or closed). \"Closed\" systems in chemical plants are often not closed when they are being charged and/or when the nal productis being removed. Also, the same reaction vessels are sometimes used for dif-ferent reactions. Form of the material (e.g. wet or dry). Stage of processing and use of the equipment and/or area (e.g. multipurpose or dedicated).STARTING MATERIALS 201QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 201Other factors that should be considered in evaluating an excipient plant are: Degree of exposure of the material to adverse environmental conditions. Relative ease and thoroughness of clean-up. Sterile versus non-sterile operations. 4. Equipment 4.1 Use of equipment Many excipients are produced using multipurpose equipment. Fermentationtanks, reactors, driers, grinders, centrifuges and other pieces of equipment arereadily used or adapted for a variety of products. With few exceptions such multiple usage is satisfactory provided the equipment can be adequately cleanedaccording to written procedures. Equipment that contains tarry or gummyresidues that cannot be removed easily should be dedicated for use with theseproducts only. Some fermentation tanks, reaction vessels, and other equipment are not sit- uated within a building and a considerable amount of processing occurs out ofdoors. Such processing is acceptable provided it occurs in a closed system. Where temperature control is important, temperature recording devices should be used, with recording charts kept as part of the batch record. 4.2 Cleaning programme Where multipurpose equipment is in use, it is important to be able to deter-mine previous usage when investigating cross-contamination or the possibilityof such contamination. An equipment cleaning and use log, while desirable andperhaps preferable, is not the only method of determining prior use. Any doc-umentation system which clearly identies the previous batch and shows thatthe equipment was cleaned is acceptable. For operations where multiple gradesof the same chemical entity are processed, there must be documentationshowing that the previous grade was removed. Validation data must exist toprove acceptability of the cleaning procedure. Cleaning of multiple-use equipment should be conrmed. The manufac- turer should determine the effectiveness of the cleaning procedure for eachexcipient or intermediate chemical used in that particular piece of equipment.The validation data required depend on the types of materials being made inthe multiple-use equipment and the impact of trace contaminants on drug safetyand performance. Validation data should verify that the cleaning process hasremoved residues to an acceptable level. As an example, an equipment cleaning programme may include, but is not limited to, the following.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 202QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2024.2.1 Detailed cleaning procedure There should be a written equipment cleaning procedure that provides details of what should be done and which cleaning materials should be used. Some manufacturers list the specic solvents used for each excipient and intermediate. 4.2.2 Sampling plan There should be some periodic testing after cleaning, to ensure that the surface has been cleaned to the required level. One common method is to analyse thenal rinse water or solvent for the presence of the substance last used in thatpiece of equipment. In some cases, visual inspections may be appropriate. Aspecic analytical method to determine residual substances may not always beavailable, but is preferred. The need for an analytical method would be basedon the potential adverse effect on product quality, performance or safety. Whensafety is a concern, there should be a specic analytical determination for a residual substance. 4.2.3 Analytical methods/cleaning limits The toxicity of the residual materials should be considered when deciding on the appropriate analytical method and the residual cleaning limits. The residuelimits established for each piece of apparatus should be practical, achievableand veriable. The manufacturer should be able to show, with supporting data,that the residual level permitted is scientically based. Another factor to con-sider is the possible non-uniformity of the residue. The level of residue foundby random sampling, such as taking a swab from a limited area on a piece ofequipment, does not necessarily represent the highest level of contamination. 5. Materials 5.1 General In the case of labile products that may be sensitive to environmental factors suchas air, light, water, heat or cold, appropriate manufacturing and storage condi-tions must be used to ensure product quality throughout the process. 5.2 Starting materials The excipient manufacturer should verify that the supplier of starting materialsand components can meet the agreed-upon requirements. This may require peri-odic audits of the vendor's plant if necessary. Purchasing agreements shouldcontain data clearly describing the product ordered including, where applica-ble, the following:STARTING MATERIALS 203QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 203 The name, type, class, style, grade, item code numbers or other precise iden- tication as appropriate. Drawings, process requirements, inspection instructions and other relevant technical data, including requirements for approval or verication ofproduct, procedures, process equipment and personnel. Starting materials, including solvents and recovered solvents, are sometimes stored in silos or other large containers, making precise separation of batchesdifcult. Usage of such materials should be demonstrated, via inventory or otherrecords, with reasonable accuracy. When purchased and recovered solvents are commingled, the suitability of the recovered solvent must be demonstrated through either validation or actualtesting. The purchased materials should comply with existing specications. Outdoor storage of starting materials (e.g. acids, other corrosive substances, explosive materials) is acceptable if the containers give suitable protection totheir contents, identifying labels remain legible and containers are adequatelycleaned prior to opening and use. 5.3 Rejected and recovered materials Any starting material or intermediate or nished excipient not complying withspecications must be clearly identied and segregated to prevent inadvertentuse or release for sale. A record of non-compliance should be maintained. Allcases of non-compliance should be investigated to identify the root cause. These materials may be: \u2014 reprocessed/reworked to meet the specied requirements; \u2014 regraded for alternative applications; or\u2014 rejected or scrapped. Occasional reprocessing/reworking of an excipient may be acceptable. However, relying on the nal testing only of the reprocessed excipient todemonstrate compliance to specication is not acceptable. The quality of thereprocessed material must be evaluated and documented showing adequateinvestigation and demonstrating that the reprocessed excipient is at least equiv-alent to other acceptable excipients. When reprocessing has to be done fre-quently, it may be an indication that the process, work instruction or training isinadequate and needs to be adjusted or reinforced. 5.4 Returned excipients Returned excipients should be identied as such and kept. If the conditionsunder which the products have been stored and shipped or if the condition ofthe container itself casts doubt on the safety, quality or purity of the excipient,the product should be destroyed, unless thorough examination, testing, or otherinvestigation shows that the product meets the appropriate predened stan-QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 204QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 204dards. If returned excipient containers are reused, all previous labelling should be removed or defaced. If the containers are used repeatedly solely for the sameexcipient, all previous batch numbers, or the entire label, should be removedor completely obliterated. 5.5 Storage practices Pharmaceutical excipients should be stored under conditions established by themanufacturer on the basis of stability data. Records should be kept of the dis-tribution of each batch of pharmaceutical excipient, to facilitate the recall of thebatch if necessary, according to written procedures. 6. Documentation 6.1 General The excipient manufacturer should have a system to cover all documents anddata that relate to the requirements of the quality system. Documents, and subsequent changes to the documents, should be reviewed and approved bydesignated personnel before being issued to the appropriate areas identied inthe documents. A record should be kept of where the documents are located. The following minimal requirements for documentation should be applied: To assign a unique batch number to the excipient to be released and/or certied. To prepare a batch record. To demonstrate that the batch has been prepared under GMP conditions from the processing point at which excipient GMP have been applied. To demonstrate that the batch is homogeneous within the manufacturer's specications. This does not require a nal blending of continuous process material, if process controls can demonstrate compliance with specications throughout the batch. To demonstrate that the batch has not been commingled with material from other batches for the purpose of either hiding or diluting an adulterated substance. To demonstrate that the batch has been sampled in accordance with a sam- pling plan that ensures a representative sample of the batch is taken. To demonstrate that the batch has been analysed using scientically estab- lished tests and methods designed to ensure that the product meets acceptedstandards and specications for quality, identity and purity. To demonstrate that the batch has stability data to support the intended period of use; these data can be obtained from actual studies on the specicexcipient or from applicable \"model product\" stability studies that can rea-sonably be expected to simulate the performance of the excipient.STARTING MATERIALS 205QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2056.2 Specications Starting material specications should be organized to separate those tests that are routine from those that are performed infrequently or only for new suppli-ers. Relevant pharmacopoeial monographs, when available, provide a basis forthe development of internal manufacturer's specications. A positive identication test uniquely applicable to the excipients should be established through analytical technology, such as infrared spectrophotome-try and chromatography. It is important that manufacturers identify and set appropriate limits for impurities. These limits should be based upon appropriate toxicological data,or limits described in national compendial requirements. Manufacturingprocesses should be adequately controlled so that the impurities do not exceedsuch established specications. Many excipients are extracted from or puried by the use of organic sol- vents. These solvents are normally removed by drying the moist excipient. Inview of the varying and sometimes unknown toxicity of solvents, it is importantthat excipient specications include tests and limits for residues of solvents andother reactants. Container specications should be established for all excipients to assure consistency in protecting the product during transport from the excipient man-ufacturer to the pharmaceutical producer. The specications should not onlyprovide for containers that maintain the stability of the product, but should alsomeet requirements for protection during shipping, against insect infestation,during handling, etc. 6.3 Batch production records Computer systems are increasingly used to initiate, monitor, adjust and other-wise control manufacturing processes. These operations may be accompaniedby recording charts that show key parameters (e.g. temperature) at suitableintervals, or even continuously, throughout the process. In other cases, key mea-surements (e.g. pH) may be displayed temporarily on a monitor screen, but arenot available in hard copy. Records showing addition of ingredients, actual performance of operations by identiable individuals, and other information usually seen in conventionalrecords, may be missing. When computers and other sophisticated equipmentare employed, the emphasis must change from conventional, hand-writtenrecords to: \u2014 systems and procedures that show that the equipment and software is in fact performing as intended; \u2014 checking and calibration of the equipment at appropriate intervals;\u2014 retention of suitable back-up systems such as copies of the programme and les, duplicate tapes or microlm;QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 206QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 206\u2014 assurance that changes in the programme are made only by authorized per- sonnel and that they are clearly documented and validated. 6.4 Other documents Shipping and storage requirements should be established to ensure that theproduct reaches the manufacturer with proper quality attributes. This shouldbe mutually agreed upon between the vendor and the purchaser and establishedprior to transportation of the product. Written procedures should be established and followed for maintenance of the equipment. All maintenance activities performed must be recorded; this maybe in the form of a log, computer database or other appropriate documenta-tion, as long as the system can identify who was responsible for performing eachfunction. 7. Good practices in production and quality control 7.1 Change control and process validation Process changes may lead to changes in inherent product characteristics. Manufacturers should have a formal process change system in place, withwritten standard operating procedures covering such changes. Management ofthe change system should be assigned to an independent quality unit havingresponsibility and authority for nal approval of process changes. Manufacturers of excipients often produce laboratory or pilot batches. Scale-up to commercial production may involve several stages and data shouldbe reviewed to demonstrate the adequacy of the scale-up process. Scale-up mayintroduce signicant problems of consistency between batches. Pilot batchesshould serve as the basis for establishing in-process and nished product purityspecications. Typically, manufacturers will generate reports that discuss the development and limitation of the manufacturing process. Summaries of such reports shouldbe reviewed to determine if the plant is capable of producing the excipient. Thereports serve as the basis for the validation of the manufacturing and controlprocedures, as well as the basic documentation to demonstrate that the processworks consistently. A document comprising scale-up data and describing the process reactions, operating parameters, purications, impurities and key tests needed for processcontrol should be written. A retrospective analysis of historical data (throughstatistical data and process capability data analysis) as well as the previous doc-umentation will provide a good basis for validation.STARTING MATERIALS 207QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2077.2 Good practices in production 7.2.1 Prevention of cross-contamination The potential for cross-contamination should be considered in the design of the manufacturing process and facility. The degree to which cross-contaminationshould be minimized depends on the safety and intended use of the excipient. The precautions taken to minimize cross-contamination should be appro- priate to the conditions of the manufacturing facility and will take account ofthe range of materials manufactured. When the excipient product is initiallyrecovered, it should be in a clean environment and not exposed to airborne con-taminants, such as dust from other excipient or industrial chemicals. Typically,the damp product will be unloaded into clean, covered containers and transported for drying and other manipulations. These subsequent operationsshould be performed in separate areas or under controlled conditions becauseonce dry, the excipient is more likely to contaminate its environment, includingany surrounding products. The primary consideration is that the building andfacilities should not contribute to an actual or potential contamination of theexcipient. The air-handling systems at the site of manufacture should be designed to prevent cross-contamination. In dedicated areas processing the same excipient,it is permissible to recycle a portion of the exhaust air back into the same area.The adequacy of such a system of operation for multi-use areas, especially ifseveral products are processed simultaneously, should be carefully analysed. Inmulti-use areas where several products are completely conned in closed vesselsand piping systems, ltration of the supply air (combined fresh make-up air andrecycled air) is acceptable if the conditions are consistent with other existingregulations (e.g. environmental, safety). In those areas where the excipient is in a damp or moistened form, such as lter or centrifuge cake, and may be exposed to room air, lter efciencies inthe supply air system as low as 85% may be adequate. In those areas where oneor more of the products is being processed in a dry form, such ltration maynot be enough to prevent cross-contamination. In all cases, manufacturersshould be able to demonstrate the adequacy of their air-handling systems. Excipient manufacturers should have a documented programme identify- ing all insecticides, pesticides, rodenticides and herbicides used at the site ofmanufacture. Adequate measures should be taken to prevent these agents fromcontaminating the excipients. 7.2.2 In-process blending/mixing Some processes require blending or mixing. Such in-process blending is accept- able provided it is adequately documented in batch production records. Exam-ples include:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 208QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 208 Collection of multiple batches or continuous accumulation of batches with dened endpoint in a single holding tank (with a new batch number). Recycling material from one batch for further use in a subsequent batch. Repeated crystallizations of the same mother liquor for better yield of crystals. Collecting several centrifuge loads in a single drier/blender. Incidental carry-over is another type of in-process mixing that frequently occurs. Examples include: Residue adhering to the wall of a micronizer used for milling the nished excipient. Residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge bowl after discharge of the bulk of the crystals from a prior batch. Incomplete discharge of fluids, crystals or particles from a processing vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. These residues are usually acceptable since clean-up between successive batches of the same excipient is not normally required during production. However, inthe case of non-dedicated production units, complete cleaning proceduresdesigned to prevent contamination that would alter the quality of the substancemust be employed when changing from one excipient to another. Checking theeffectiveness of these cleaning procedures may require the use of analyticaltesting for the substances involved. In contrast to in-process blending and incidental carry-over discussed above, other blending operations should be directed towards achieving homo-geneity of the nished excipient batch. Three areas in the processing of nishedbatches of an excipient which should be examined carefully and critically are: \u2014 the nal blending operation to produce the nished batch; \u2014 the point in the process at which the batch number is assigned;\u2014 the sampling procedure used to obtain the sample that is intended to be rep- resentative of the batch. Blending of excipient batches to salvage adulterated material is not an accept- able practice. Mother liquors containing recoverable amounts of excipients are frequently reused. Secondary recovery procedures for such excipients are acceptable, if therecovered excipient meets its specications and if recovery procedures are indi-cated in batch production records. Secondary recovery procedures for reactantsand intermediates are acceptable provided that the recovered materials meetsuitable specications. 7.2.3 Control of microbial contamination The manufacture of sterile excipients for use in aseptic/sterile processing pre- sents technical challenges. It is essential that adequately qualied and trainedSTARTING MATERIALS 209QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 209personnel be used to supervise and perform procedures associated with the manufacture of sterile excipients. The environment in which procedures areconducted, and the operators themselves, are signicant potential sources ofcontamination in aseptic operations. Processes should be designed to minimizecontact between excipient and the environment and operators. Those asepticexcipient operations which require considerable operator involvement musthave adequate controls. Major potential problem areas include aseptic removalof the excipient from centrifuges, manual transfer to drying trays and mills, andthe inability to sterilize the drier. Not all equipment currently in use can be sterilized. The excipient manufacturer must document the cleaning of critical pro- cessing equipment such as centrifuges and driers. Any manipulation of sterileexcipients after sterilization must be performed as a validated aseptic process.This is particularly important for those excipients which are not further steril-ized prior to packaging into nal containers. In some instances, the compendialmonographs may specify that an excipient which does not meet parenteral gradestandards must be labelled as not suitable for use in the preparation of injectableproducts. Some manufacturers of non-sterile excipients use heat, gamma radiation and other methods to reduce the microbial burden. These methods are accept-able provided the manufacturer has shown that the product meets microbialrequirements and that the process is under control within the manufacturer'sspecications. Any procedure should be validated in accordance with recog-nized international standards to demonstrate that the process will produce theintended result. Post-production treatment of excipients should not be used asa substitute for attention to microbiological control during production. A protected environment may be necessary to avoid microbial contamina- tion or degradation caused by exposure to heat, air or light. The degree of pro-tection required may vary depending on the stage of the process. Often, directoperator contact is involved in the unloading of centrifuge bags, transfer hoses(particularly those used to transfer powders), drying equipment and pumps, andequipment should be designed to minimize the possibility of contamination. Thesanitary design of transfer and processing equipment should be evaluated.Those with moving parts should be assessed for the integrity of seals and otherpacking materials to avoid product contamination. Special environments required by some processes must be monitored at all times to ensure product quality (e.g. inert atmosphere, protection from light).If interruptions in the special environment occur, adequate evidence must beprovided that they have not compromised the quality of the excipient. Suchenvironmental concerns become increasingly important after purication of theexcipient has been completed. The environment to which the excipient may be exposed should be similar to that used in the manufacture of the nal dosage form. This is especially truein the case of excipients intended for parenteral dosage forms. For example,QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 210QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 210controlled areas may need to be established along with appropriate air quality classications. Such areas should be serviced by suitable air-handling systemsand there should be adequate environmental monitoring programmes. Anymanipulation of sterile excipient after sterilization must be performed as anaseptic process, using Class 100 air 1and other aseptic controls. 7.2.4 Water systems/water quality While drinking-water is used for many excipient processes, puried water is also widely used. Because of the well-known potential for microbial growth in deion-izers and ultraltration or reverse-osmosis systems used to produce puriedwater, such systems must be properly validated and checked. Proper controlmethods include the establishment of water quality specications and corre-sponding action levels, remedial action when microbial levels are exceeded, and adequate maintenance procedures such as regeneration and sanitation/ sterilization. Appropriate specications for chemical and microbial quality should be established and periodic testing conducted. Such specications will varydepending on the process and the point in the process when the water is used.For example, in some cases, if the water is used in later processing steps suchas for a nal wash of the lter cake, or if the excipient is crystallized from anaqueous system, the water quality standards may need to be higher than nor-mally specied for puried water. This is particularly important where the excip-ient's intended use is in parenteral dosage forms. The frequency of microbialand chemical testing of puried water depends on a variety of factors, includ-ing the test results and the point in the process (e.g. nal wash in centrifuge) atwhich such water is used. Most puried water and water for injection systems, including reverse- osmosis and ultraltration systems, have the potential for endotoxin contami-nation. If the nal excipient is supposed to be pyrogen free or sterile, or will be used in preparing parenteral products, validation of the system to controlendotoxins should be conducted and routine testing of the process water forendotoxins should be performed (preferably by the LAL ( Limulus amoebocyte lysate) method). 7.2.5 Packaging operations When the programme for packaging operations is being set up, particular atten- tion should be given to minimizing the risk of cross-contamination, mix-ups, orSTARTING MATERIALS 2111Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specica- tions for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-second report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 1992 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 823), Annex 1, Section 17.3. In this volume, see p. 88.QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 211substitutions. Different products should not be packaged in close proximity unless there is physical segregation or the use of electronic surveillance. 7.2.6 Delivery The manufacturer should arrange for the protection of the product after nal inspection and testing. Where contractually agreed, this protection shouldinclude delivery to destination. Distribution records should be kept. 7.3 Good practices in quality control 7.3.1 General The quality control unit, in addition to having the responsibility and authority to approve or reject all components, in-process materials, packaging materialsand nished excipients, and to review production records, etc., should also beresponsible for approving or rejecting excipients manufactured, processed,packaged, or held under contract by another company, as well as for approvingor rejecting all procedures, specications and process changes having an effecton the quality of the excipient. 7.3.2 Control of starting materials All starting materials must be tested or otherwise veried prior to use. Veri- cation should include a certicate of analysis from the supplier and, whereverfeasible, an identication test. There should be clear guidance or standard oper-ating procedures established for the approval of each starting material. Starting materials are usually subjected to an identity test and additional testing to conrm that they meet appropriate specications. Some starting mate-rials may not be acceptance tested by the manufacturer because of the hazardsinvolved or other valid considerations. In such cases, quality certication foreach batch from the vendor should be on le. There should always be some evi-dence of an attempt by the excipient manufacturer to establish identity, even ifit is only a visual examination of containers, examination of labels, or record-ing of batch numbers from the labels. 7.3.3 In-process testing In-process inspection and testing should be performed by monitoring the process or by actual sample analysis at dened locations and times. The resultsshould conform to established process parameters or acceptable tolerances.Work instructions should delineate the procedure to follow and how to use theinspection and test data to control the process.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 212QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2127.3.4 Quality records and retention samples The manufacturer should establish and maintain procedures for identication, collection, indexing, ling, storage, maintenance and availability of qualityrecords. Quality records should be maintained to demonstrate achievement ofthe required quality and the effective operation of the quality system. These datashould include pertinent subcontractor quality records. All quality records should be legible and identiable with the product involved. Quality records should be stored and maintained in such a way thatthey are readily retrievable, in facilities that provide a suitable environment tominimize deterioration or damage and to prevent loss. Retention times of qualityrecords should be established and recorded. Where agreed contractually, qualityrecords should be made available for evaluation by the purchaser or the pur-chaser's representative for an agreed period. All appropriate records relating to inspection and testing must be available for review. Where the process is continuously monitored, acknowledgementmust be made of this and the results of the monitoring should be available. Reserve samples of the released excipient should be retained for one year after the expiry or re-evaluation date, or for one year after distribution is com-plete. Sample size should be twice the amount required to perform release spec-ication testing. 7.3.5 Stability studies Many excipient products are very stable and may not require extensive testing to check stability. The stability of some excipients may be affected by unde-tected changes in starting material specications, or subtle changes in manu-facturing procedures. Excipients may also be shipped in a large variety ofdifferent packaging types that can affect their stability (e.g. metal and plasticdrums, bags, plastic and glass bottles, bulk tankers). Some excipients may be similar in chemical structure to other excipients, and some may be mixtures or blends of other excipients. These excipients maybe very similar to others within a product group. Minor quantitative differencesof some of the components may be the only signicant variation from oneproduct to another. For these excipients, a \"model product\" approach to assessthe stability may be appropriate. Stability studies of this type should involveselection of several \"model products\" that would be expected to simulate thestability of the product group being assessed. This selection must be scienti-cally based. Data from stability studies of these \"model products\" can be usedto determine the theoretical stability of similar products. The full stability testing programme, when needed, usually contains the fol- lowing features and takes into account historical data:STARTING MATERIALS 213QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 213 The programme should be formalized in writing and ongoing studies should be reviewed at least annually. The programme should periodically include a sample from at least one com- mercial size batch. Stability samples should be stored in containers that approximate the primary market container. Simulations of all types of containers are not required,unless there are theoretical reasons to indicate that stability may be affectedby container type. The samples should be stored under conditions similar to those recom- mended for the marketed excipient product. Additional samples may be stored under stress conditions (e.g. elevated tem- perature, light, humidity or freezing) if such conditions might reasonably beencountered during distribution and storage. Stability-indicating test methods should be used. Where stability of the excipient appears to be a signicant issue in its use in pharmaceutical manufacturing, additional periodic testing of either the spe-cic material or \"model products\" may have to be performed to ensure thatthe expected stability does not signicantly change with future batches. Thefrequency of testing should be determined by the impact that the excipient'sstability may have on its usage. 7.3.6 Expiry/re-evaluation dating Conducting a stability testing programme does not necessarily mean that expiry dates must be used. Where stability testing indicates a limited shelf-life, the labelshould declare an expiry date or indicate the need for re-evaluation testing atan appropriate interval to assure quality at time of use. If the need for special storage conditions exists (e.g. protection from light, heat), such restrictions should be placed on the label. 7.3.7 Calibration of measuring and test equipment All measuring and test equipment identied as being part of the quality system should be properly calibrated and maintained. This includes all in-processinstruments identied as critical quality instruments, as well as test equipmentused in the laboratory. The control programme should include the standard-ization or calibration of reagents, instruments, apparatus, gauges and recordingdevices at suitable intervals, in accordance with an established written pro-gramme containing specic directions, schedules, limits for accuracy and pre-cision, and provisions for remedial action in the event that accuracy and/orprecision limits are not met. Reagents, instruments, apparatus, gauges andrecording devices not meeting established specications should not be used.Computer systems used to verify that the product conforms to specicationsmust be audited to ensure satisfactory performance in the laboratory.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 214QAP2 12/16/06 12:12 PM Page 2142153.

It is not exhaustive in char-acter, and some technical requirements may change in line with developmentsin the eld of good manufacturing practices (GMP) or advances in engineeringdesign. 1. General considerations 1.1 The production of sterile preparations should be carried out in clean areas,entry to which should be through airlocks for personnel and/or for equipmentand materials. Clean areas should be maintained to an appropriate standard of 1Good manufacturing practices for sterile pharmaceutical products. In: WHO Expert Committee on Spec- ications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-sixth report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2002 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 902), Annex 6.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 215cleanliness and supplied with air that has passed through lters of the required efciency. 1.2 The various operations of component preparation (such as those involving containers and closures), product preparation, lling and sterilization should becarried out in separate areas within a clean area. These areas are classied intofour grades (see section 4.1). 1.3 Manufacturing operations are divided here into two categories: rst, those where the product is terminally sterilized, and second, those which are con-ducted aseptically at some or all stages. 2. Quality control 2.1 Samples taken for sterility testing should be representative of the whole ofthe batch, but should, in particular, include samples taken from parts of thebatch considered to be most at risk of contamination, for example: (a) for products that have been lled aseptically, samples should include con- tainers lled at the beginning and end of the batch and after any signi-cant interruption of work; (b) for products that have been heat sterilized in their nal containers, con- sideration should be given to taking samples from that part of the load thatis potentially the coolest. 2.2 The sterility of the nished product is ensured by validation of the steril- ization cycle in the case of terminally sterilized products, and by \"media-lls\"runs for aseptically processed products. Batch processing records and, in thecase of aseptic processing, environmental quality records, should be examinedin conjunction with the results of the sterility tests. The sterility test procedureshould be validated for a given product. Pharmacopoeial methods must be usedfor the validation and performance of the sterility test. 2.3 For injectable products, the water for injection and the intermediate and nished products should be monitored for endotoxins, using an establishedpharmacopoeial method that has been validated for each type of product. Forlarge-volume infusion solutions, such monitoring of water or intermediatesshould always be done, in addition to any tests required by an approved mono-graph for the nished product. When a sample fails a test, the cause of suchfailure should be investigated and remedial action taken where necessary. 3. Sanitation 3.1 The sanitation of clean areas is particularly important. They should becleaned frequently and thoroughly in accordance with an approved written programme. Monitoring should be regularly undertaken in order to detect theQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 216QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 216emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms. In view of its limited effec- tiveness, ultraviolet light should not be used as a substitute for chemical disin-fection. 3.2 Disinfectants and detergents should be monitored for microbiological con- tamination; dilutions should be kept in previously cleaned containers andshould only be stored for dened periods unless sterilized. Disinfectants anddetergents used in grade A and B areas (see section 4.1) should be sterilizedbefore use. 3.3 In order to control the microbiological cleanliness of the various grades in operation, the clean areas should be monitored. Where aseptic operations areperformed, monitoring should be frequent and methods such as settle plates,and volumetric air and surface sampling (e.g. swabs and contact plates) shouldbe used. The zones should not be contaminated through the sampling methodsused in the operations. The results of monitoring should be considered whenbatch documentation for release of the nished product is reviewed. Both sur-faces and personnel should be monitored after critical operations. 3.4 Levels (limits) of detection of microbiological contamination should be established for alert and action purposes, and for monitoring the trends in airquality in the facility. Limits expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) for themicrobiological monitoring of clean areas in operation are given in Table 1. Thesampling methods and numerical values included in the table are not intendedto represent specications, but are for information only. 4. Manufacture of sterile preparations 4.1 Clean areas for the manufacture of sterile products are classied accordingto the required characteristics of the environment. Each manufacturing opera-tion requires an appropriate environmental cleanliness level in the operationalSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 217Table 1.

In order to meet \"in operation\" conditions, these areas should be designed to reach certain specied air-cleanliness levels in the \"at rest\" occupancy state.This latter state is the condition where the installation is complete, and pro-duction equipment has been installed and is operating, but no operating personnel are present. The \"in operation\" state is the condition where the instal-lation is functioning in the dened operating mode and the specied numberof personnel are present. For the manufacture of sterile pharmaceutical preparations, four grades are distinguished here, as follows: Grade A : The local zone for high-risk operations, e.g. lling and making aseptic connections. Normally such conditions are provided by a laminar-airflow workstation. Laminar-airflow systems should provide a homogeneousair speed of approximately 0.45 m/s \u00b120% (guidance value) at the working position. Grade B : In aseptic preparation and lling, the background environment for the grade A zone. Grades C and D : Clean areas for carrying out less critical stages in the man- ufacture of sterile products. The airborne particulate classication for the four grades is given in Table 2. To obtain air of the required characteristics, methods specied by national author-ities should be used. It should be noted that: In order to reach the B, C and D air grades, the number of air changes should be appropriate for the size of the room and the equipment and personnelpresent in it. At least 20 air changes per hour are usually required for a roomwith a good airflow pattern and appropriate high-efciency particulate air(HEPA) lters.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 218Table 2.

Reference shouldbe made to other guidelines published in compendia such as the European,Japanese or United States pharmacopoeias, or in documents issued by theEuropean Committee for Standardization and the International Organizationfor Standardization (ISO). The different airborne particulate classication systems for clean areas are shown in Table 3. 4.2 The particulate conditions given in Table 2 for the \"at rest\" state should be achieved in the absence of the operating personnel after a short \"clean-up\"period of about 15-20 minutes (guidance value), after completion of the oper-ations. The particulate conditions given in Table 2 for grade A \"in operation\"should be maintained in the zone immediately surrounding the product when-ever the product or open container is exposed to the environment. It is acceptedthat it may not always be possible to demonstrate conformity with particulatestandards at the point of ll when lling is in progress, owing to the generationof particles or droplets from the product itself. 4.3 In order to control the particulate cleanliness of the various clean areas during operation, they should be monitored. 4.4 Appropriate alert and action limits should be set for the results of parti- culate and microbiological monitoring. If these limits are exceeded, the appropriate corrective actions should be taken, as prescribed in the operatingprocedures. 4.5 The area grades as specied in sections 4.6-4.14 must be selected by the manufacturer on the basis of the nature of the process operations being performed and validation runs (e.g. sterile media lls). The determination of anappropriate process area environment and a time limit should be based on themicrobiological contamination (bioburden) found.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 219Table 3.

Where the product is at unusual risk of microbialcontamination (e.g. because it actively supports microbial growth, must be heldfor a long period before sterilization, or is necessarily not processed mainly in closed vessels), the preparation should generally be done in a grade C environment. 4.7 The lling of products for terminal sterilization should generally be done in at least a grade C environment. 4.8 Where the product is at unusual risk of contamination from the environ- ment (e.g. because the lling operation is slow or the containers are wide-neckedor are necessarily exposed for more than a few seconds before sealing), the llingshould be done in a grade A zone with at least a grade C background. 4.9 The preparation and lling of ointments, creams, suspensions and emul- sions should generally be done in a grade C environment before terminal sterilization. Aseptic preparation 4.10 Components after washing should be handled in at least a grade D envi- ronment. The handling of sterile starting materials and components, unless sub-jected to sterilization or ltration through a microorganism-retaining lter laterin the process, should be done in a grade A environment with a grade B background. 4.11 The preparation of solutions which are to be sterile ltered during the process should be done in a grade C environment; if not sterile ltered, thepreparation of materials and products should be done in a grade A environmentwith a grade B background. 4.12 The handling and lling of aseptically prepared products, as well as the handling of exposed sterile equipment, should be done in a grade A environ-ment with a grade B background. 4.13 The transfer of partially closed containers, as used in freeze-drying, should, before stoppering is completed, be done either in a grade A environment witha grade B background or in sealed transfer trays in a grade B environment. 4.14 The preparation and lling of sterile ointments, creams, suspensions and emulsions should be done in a grade A environment with a grade B backgroundwhen the product is exposed and is subsequently ltered.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 220QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 220Processing 4.15 Precautions to minimize contamination should be taken during all pro- cessing stages, including the stages before sterilization. 4.16 Preparations containing live microorganisms should not be made or con- tainers lled in areas used for the processing of other pharmaceutical products;however, vaccines consisting of dead organisms or of bacterial extracts may bedispensed into containers, after validated inactivation and validated cleaningprocedures, in the same premises as other sterile pharmaceutical products. 4.17 The validation of aseptic processing should include simulating the process using a nutrient medium. The form of the nutrient medium used should gen-erally be equivalent to the dosage form of the product. The process-simulationtest should imitate as closely as possible the routine aseptic manufacturingprocess and include all the critical subsequent manufacturing steps. Consider-ation should be given to simulation of the worst expected condition. Theprocess-simulation test should be repeated at dened intervals and after any sig-nicant modication to the equipment and process. The number of containersused for a medium ll should be sufcient to ensure a valid evaluation. For smallbatches, the number of containers for the medium ll should be at least equalto the size of the product batch. 4.18 Care should be taken to ensure that any validation does not compromise the processes. 4.19 Water sources, water-treatment equipment and treated water should be monitored regularly for chemicals, biological contamination and contaminationwith endotoxins to ensure that the water complies with the specications appro-priate to its use. Records should be maintained of the results of the monitoringand of any action taken. 4.20 Activities in clean areas, especially when aseptic operations are in progress, should be kept to a minimum, and the movement of personnel should be controlled and methodical, so as to avoid excessive shedding of particles andorganisms due to over-vigorous activity. The ambient temperature and humid-ity should not be uncomfortably high because of the nature of the garmentsworn. 4.21 The presence of containers and materials liable to generate bres should be minimized in clean areas and avoided completely when aseptic work is inprogress. 4.22 Components, bulk-product containers and equipment should be handled after the nal cleaning process in such a way that they are not recontaminated.The stage of processing of components, bulk-product containers and equipmentshould be properly identied.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 221QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2214.23 The interval between the washing and drying and the sterilization of components, bulk-product containers and equipment, as well as between sterilization and use, should be as short as possible and subject to a time-limitappropriate to the validated storage conditions. 4.24 The time between the start of the preparation of a solution and its steril- ization or ltration through a bacteria-retaining lter should be as short as pos-sible. A maximum permissible time should be set for each product that takesinto account its composition and the prescribed method of storage. 4.25 Any gas that is used to purge a solution or blanket a product should be passed through a sterilizing lter. 4.26 The bioburden of products should be monitored before sterilization. There should be a working limit on the contamination of products immediatelybefore sterilization that is related to the efciency of the method to be used andthe risk of pyrogens. All solutions, in particular large-volume parenterals, shouldbe passed through a microorganism-retaining lter, if possible immediatelybefore the lling process. Where aqueous solutions are held in sealed vessels,any pressure-release outlets should be protected, e.g. by hydrophobic microbi-ological air lters. 4.27 Components, bulk-product containers, equipment and any other articles required in a clean area where aseptic work is in progress should be sterilizedand, wherever possible, passed into the area through double-ended sterilizerssealed into the wall. Other procedures that prevent the introduction of conta-mination (e.g. triple wrapping) may be acceptable in some circumstances. 4.28 The efcacy of any new processing procedure should be validated, and the validation should be repeated at regular intervals thereafter or when any signif-icant change is made in the process or equipment. 5. Sterilization 5.1 Whenever possible, products intended to be sterile should preferably beterminally sterilized by heat in their nal container. Where it is not possible tocarry out terminal sterilization by heating due to the instability of a formulation,a decision should be taken to use an alternative method of terminal sterilizationfollowing ltration and/or aseptic processing. 5.2 Sterilization can be achieved by the use of moist or dry heat, by irradiation with ionizing radiation (but not with ultraviolet radiation unless the process isthoroughly validated), by ethylene oxide (or other suitable gaseous sterilizingagents) or by ltration with subsequent aseptic lling of sterile nal containers.Each method has its particular advantages and disadvantages. Where possibleand practicable, heat sterilization is the method of choice.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 222QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2225.3 The microbiological contamination of starting materials should be minimal, and their bioburden should be monitored before sterilization. Specicationsshould include requirements for microbiological quality when the need for thishas been indicated by monitoring. 5.4 All sterilization processes must be validated. Particular attention should be given when the adopted sterilization method is not in accordance with phar-macopoeial or other national standards or when it is used for a preparation thatis not a simple aqueous or oily solution. 5.5 Before any sterilization process is adopted, its suitability for the product and its efcacy in achieving the desired sterilizing conditions in all parts of eachtype of load to be processed should be demonstrated by physical measurementsand by biological indicators, where appropriate. The validity of the processshould be veried at scheduled intervals, at least annually, and whenever sig-nicant modications have been made to the equipment. Records should bekept of the results. 5.6 For effective sterilization, the whole of the material should be subjected to the required treatment and the process should be designed to ensure that thisis achieved. 5.7 Biological indicators should be considered only as an additional method of monitoring the sterilization process. They should be stored and used accordingto the manufacturer's instructions, and their quality checked by positive con-trols. If they are used, strict precautions should be taken to avoid any transferof microbiological contamination from them. 5.8 There should be a clear means of differentiating products that have not been sterilized from those that have. Each basket, tray, or other carrier of productsor components should be clearly labelled with the name of the material, its batchnumber, and an indication of whether or not it has been sterilized. Indicatorssuch as autoclave tape may be used, where appropriate, to indicate whether ornot a batch (or sub-batch) has passed through a sterilization process, but theydo not give a reliable indication that the batch is, in fact, sterile. 5.9 Sterilization records should be available for each sterilization run. They should be approved as part of the batch-release procedure. 6. Terminal sterilization Sterilization by heat 6.1 Each heat-sterilization cycle should be recorded by means of appropriateequipment of suitable accuracy and precision, e.g. on a time/temperature chartwith a suitably large scale. The temperature should be recorded by a probe at the coolest part of the load or loaded chamber, this point having been SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 223QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 223determined during the validation; the temperature should preferably be checked against a second independent temperature probe located at the same position.The chart, or a photocopy of it, should form part of the batch record. Chemi-cal or biological indicators may also be used but should not take the place ofphysical controls. 6.2 Sufcient time must be allowed for the whole of the load to reach the required temperature before measurement of the sterilizing time is started. Thistime must be determined for each type of load to be processed. 6.3 After the high-temperature phase of a heat sterilization cycle, precautions should be taken against contamination of a sterilized load during cooling. Anycooling fluid or gas in contact with the product should be sterilized. Sterilization by moist heat 6.4 Sterilization by moist heat (heating in an autoclave) is suitable only forwater-wettable materials and aqueous formulations. Both temperature and pres-sure should be used to monitor the process. The temperature recorder shouldnormally be independent of the controller, and there should be an independenttemperature indicator, the reading from which should be routinely checkedagainst the chart recorder during the sterilization period. For sterilizers ttedwith a drain at the bottom of the chamber, it may also be necessary to recordthe temperature at this position throughout the sterilization period. Thereshould be regular leak tests on the chamber when a vacuum phase is part of thecycle. 6.5 The items to be sterilized, other than products in sealed containers, should be wrapped in a material that allows the removal of air and the penetration ofsteam but prevents recontamination after sterilization. All parts of the loadshould be in contact with water or saturated steam at the required temperaturefor the required time. 6.6 Care should be taken to ensure that the steam used for sterilization is of suitable quality and does not contain additives at a level that could cause con-tamination of the product or equipment. Sterilization by dry heat 6.7 Sterilization by dry heat may be suitable for non-aqueous liquids or drypowder products. The process used should include air circulation within the chamber and the maintenance of a positive pressure to prevent the entry ofnon-sterile air. If air is supplied, it should be passed through a microorganism-retaining lter (e.g. an HEPA lter). Where sterilization by dry heat is alsointended to remove pyrogens, challenge tests using endotoxins will be requiredas part of the validation.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 224QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 224Sterilization by radiation 6.8 Sterilization by radiation is used mainly for the sterilization of heat- sensitive materials and products. Many pharmaceutical products and somepackaging materials are radiation-sensitive, so this method is permissible onlywhen the absence of deleterious effects on the product has been conrmedexperimentally. Ultraviolet irradiation is not an acceptable method for terminal sterilization. 6.9 If sterilization by radiation is carried out by an outside contractor, the manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of section 6.8are met, and that the sterilization process is validated. The responsibilities of the radiation plant operator (e.g. for using the correct dose) should also be specied. 6.10 During the sterilization procedure, the radiation dose should be measured. For this purpose, the dosimeters used must be independent of the dose rate andmust provide a quantitative measurement of the dose received by the productitself. Dosimeters should be inserted in the load in sufcient number, and closeenough together to ensure that there is always a dosimeter in the chamber.Where plastic dosimeters are employed, they should be used within the time-limit of their calibration. Dosimeter absorbances should be read shortly afterexposure to radiation. Biological indicators may be used only as an additionalcontrol. Radiation-sensitive colour discs may be used to differentiate betweenpackages that have been subjected to irradiation and those that have not; theyare not indicators of successful sterilization. The information obtained shouldconstitute part of the batch record. 6.11 Validation procedures should ensure that consideration is given to the effects of variations in the density of the packages. 6.12 Handling procedures should prevent any misidentication of irradiated and non-irradiated materials. Each package should carry a radiation-sensitiveindicator to show whether or not it has been subjected to radiation treatment. 6.13 The total radiation dose should be administered within a predetermined period of time. Sterilization by gases and fumigants 6.14 This method of sterilization should only be used for products where thereis no suitable alternative. 6.15 Various gases and fumigants may be used for sterilization (e.g. ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide vapour). Ethylene oxide should be used only whenno other method is practicable. During process validation it should be shownthat the gas has no damaging effect on the product and that the conditions andSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 225QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 225time allowed for degassing are such as to reduce any residual gas and reaction products to dened acceptable limits for the type of product or material con-cerned. These limits should be incorporated in the specications. 6.16 Direct contact between gas and microorganisms is essential; precautions should therefore be taken to avoid the presence of organisms likely to beenclosed in materials such as crystals or dried protein. The nature and quantityof packaging materials can signicantly affect the process. 6.17 Before exposure to the gas, materials should be brought into equilibrium with the humidity and temperature required by the process. This requirementshould be balanced against the need to minimize the waiting time before sterilization. 6.18 Each sterilization cycle should be monitored with suitable biological indi- cators, using the appropriate number of test pieces distributed throughout theload. The information so obtained should form part of the batch record. 6.19 Biological indicators should be stored and used according to the manu- facturer's instructions, and their performance checked by positive controls. 6.20 For each sterilization cycle, records should be made of the time taken to complete the cycle, of the pressure, temperature and humidity within thechamber during the process, and of the gas concentration. The pressure andtemperature should be recorded on a chart throughout the cycle. The recordsshould form part of the batch record. 6.21 After sterilization, the load should be stored in a controlled manner under ventilated conditions to allow concentrations of residual gas and reaction prod-ucts to fall to their prescribed levels. This process should be validated. 7. Aseptic processing and sterilization by ltration 7.1 The objective of aseptic processing is to maintain the sterility of a productthat is assembled from components, each of which has been sterilized by oneof the above methods (see sections 5 and 6). 7.2 The operating conditions should be such as to prevent microbial contamination. 7.3 In order to maintain the sterility of the components and the product during aseptic processing, careful attention needs to be given to: (a) the environment;(b) the personnel; (c) the critical surfaces; (d) the container/closure sterilizationand transfer procedures; (e) the maximum holding period of the product beforelling into the nal container; and (f) the sterilizing lter. 7.4 Certain solutions and liquids that cannot be sterilized in the nal container can be ltered through a sterile lter of nominal pore size 0.22 mm (or less), orQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 226QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 226with at least equivalent microorganism-retaining properties, into a previously sterilized container. Such lters can remove bacteria and moulds, but not allviruses or mycoplasmas. Consideration should be given to complementing theltration process with some degree of heat treatment. 7.5 Owing to the potential additional risks of the ltration method as compared with other sterilization processes, a double lter layer or second ltration via afurther sterilized microorganism-retaining lter immediately prior to lling maybe advisable. The nal sterile ltration should be carried out as close as possi-ble to the lling point. 7.6 The bre-shedding characteristics of lters should be minimal (virtually zero). Asbestos-containing lters must not be used under any circumstances. 7.7 The integrity of the lter should be checked by an appropriate method such as a bubble-point, diffusive-flow or pressure-hold test, immediately after use (itmay also be useful to test the lter in this way before use). The time taken tolter a known volume of bulk solution and the pressure difference to be usedacross the lter should be determined during validation, and any signicant dif-ferences from these values should be noted and investigated. The results of thesechecks should be recorded in the batch record. The integrity of critical gas andair vent lters should be conrmed after use. The integrity of other lters shouldbe conrmed at appropriate intervals. Consideration should be given toincreased monitoring of lter integrity in processes that involve harsh condi-tions, e.g. the circulation of high-temperature air. 7.8 The same lter should not be used for more than one working day unless such use has been validated. 7.9 The lter should not affect the product either by removing ingredients from it or by releasing substances into it. 8. Personnel 8.1 Only the minimum number of personnel required should be present inclean areas; this is particularly important during aseptic processes. Inspectionsand controls should be conducted from outside such areas as far as possible. 8.2 All personnel (including those concerned with cleaning and maintenance) employed in such areas should receive initial and regular training in disciplinesrelevant to the correct manufacture of sterile products, including hygiene andthe basic elements of microbiology. When outside staff who have not receivedsuch training (e.g. building or maintenance contractors) need to be brought in,particular care should be taken over their instruction and supervision. 8.3 Staff who have been engaged in the processing of animal-tissue materials or of cultures of microorganisms other than those used in the current manufac-SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 227QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 227turing process should not enter sterile-product areas unless rigorous and clearly dened decontamination procedures have been followed. 8.4 High standards of personal hygiene and cleanliness are essential, and per- sonnel involved in the manufacture of sterile preparations should be instructedto report any conditions that may cause the shedding of abnormal numbers ortypes of contaminants; periodic health checks for such conditions are desirable.The action to be taken in respect of personnel who might be introducing unduemicrobiological hazards should be decided by a designated competent person. 8.5 Outdoor clothing should not be brought into clean areas, and personnel entering changing rooms should already be clad in standard factory protectivegarments. Changing and washing should follow a written procedure designedto minimize the contamination of clean area clothing or the carry-through ofcontaminants to clean areas. 8.6 Wrist-watches and jewellery should not be worn in clean areas, and cos- metics that can shed particles should not be used. 8.7 The clothing worn and its quality should be appropriate for the process and the grade of the working area (workplace). It should be worn in such a way asto protect the product from contamination. The clothing required for eachgrade is as follows: Grade D . The hair and, where relevant, beard and moustache should be covered. Protective clothing and appropriate shoes or overshoes should beworn. Appropriate measures should be taken to avoid any contaminationfrom outside the clean area. Grade C . The hair and, where relevant, beard and moustache should be covered. A single or two-piece trouser suit, gathered at the wrists and witha high neck, and appropriate shoes or overshoes should be worn. The cloth-ing should shed virtually no bres or particulate matter. Grades A/B . Headgear should totally enclose the hair and, where relevant, beard and moustache. A single or two-piece trouser suit, gathered at thewrists and with a high neck, should be worn. The headgear should be tuckedinto the neck of the suit. A face mask should be worn to prevent the shed-ding of droplets. Appropriate, sterilized, non-powdered rubber or plasticgloves and sterilized or disinfected footwear should be worn. Trouser-bottoms should be tucked inside the footwear and garment sleeves into thegloves. The protective clothing should shed virtually no bres or particulatematter and should retain particles shed by the body. 8.8 Outdoor clothing should not be brought into changing rooms leading to grade B and C rooms. For every worker in a grade A/B room, clean, sterilizedor adequately sanitized protective garments should be provided at each worksession, or at least once a day if monitoring results justify this. Gloves shouldbe regularly disinfected during operations. Masks and gloves should be changedQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 228QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 228at least at every working session. The use of disposable clothing may be necessary. 8.9 Clothing used in clean areas should be laundered or cleaned in such a way that it does not gather additional particulate contaminants that can later be shed.Separate laundry facilities for such clothing are desirable. If bres are damagedby inappropriate cleaning or sterilization, there may be an increased risk of shed-ding particles. Washing and sterilization operations should follow standardoperating procedures. 9. Premises 9.1 All premises should, as far as possible, be designed to avoid the unneces-sary entry of supervisory or control personnel. Grade B areas should be designedso that all operations can be observed from outside. 9.2 In clean areas, all exposed surfaces should be smooth, impervious and unbroken in order to minimize the shedding or accumulation of particles ormicroorganisms and to permit the repeated application of cleaning agents anddisinfectants, where used. 9.3 To reduce the accumulation of dust and to facilitate cleaning, there should be no uncleanable recesses and a minimum of projecting ledges, shelves, cup-boards and equipment. Doors should be carefully designed to avoid unclean-able recesses; sliding doors are undesirable for this reason. 9.4 False ceilings should be sealed to prevent contamination from the space above them. 9.5 Pipes and ducts and other utilities should be installed so that they do not create recesses, unsealed openings and surfaces that are difcult to clean. 9.6 Sinks and drains should be avoided wherever possible and should be excluded from grade A/B areas where aseptic operations are carried out. Whereinstalled, they should be designed, located and maintained so as to minimizethe risks of microbiological contamination; they should be tted with effective,easily cleanable traps and with air breaks to prevent backflow. Any floor chan-nels should be open and easily cleanable and be connected to drains outside thearea in a manner that prevents the ingress of microbiological contaminants. 9.7 Changing rooms should be designed as airlocks and used to separate the different stages of changing, thus minimizing particulate and microbiologicalcontamination of protective clothing. They should be effectively flushed withltered air. The use of separate changing rooms for entering and leaving cleanareas is sometimes necessary. Hand-washing facilities should be provided onlyin the changing rooms, not in areas where aseptic work is done.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 229QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2299.8 Airlock doors should not be opened simultaneously. An interlocking system and a visual and/or audible warning system can be installed to prevent theopening of more than one door at a time. 9.9 A ltered air supply should be used to maintain a positive pressure and an airflow relative to surrounding areas of a lower grade under all operational con-ditions; it should flush the area effectively. Adjacent rooms of different gradesshould have a pressure differential of approximately 10-15 pascals (guidancevalue). Particular attention should be paid to the protection of the zone of great-est risk, i.e. the immediate environment to which the product and the cleanedcomponents in contact with it are exposed. The various recommendationsregarding air supplies and pressure differentials may need to be modied whereit becomes necessary to contain certain materials, e.g. pathogenic, highly toxic,radioactive or live viral or bacterial materials or products. The decontaminationof the facilities and the treatment of air leaving a clean area may be necessaryfor some operations. 9.10 It should be demonstrated that airflow patterns do not present a contam- ination risk; for example, care should be taken to ensure that particles from aparticle-generating person, operation or machine are not conveyed to a zone ofhigher product risk. 9.11 A warning system should be included to indicate failure in the air supply. An indicator of pressure difference should be tted between areas where thisdifference is important, and the pressure difference should be regularlyrecorded. 9.12 Consideration should be given to restricting unnecessary access to critical lling areas, e.g. grade A lling zones, by means of a physical barrier. 10. Equipment 10.1 A conveyor belt should not pass through a partition between a grade A orB clean area and a processing area of lower air cleanliness, unless the belt itselfis continuously sterilized (e.g. in a sterilizing tunnel). 10.2 Whenever possible, equipment used for processing sterile products should be chosen so that it can be effectively sterilized by steam or dry heat or othermethods. 10.3 As far as possible, equipment ttings and services should be designed and installed so that operations, maintenance and repairs can be carried out outsidethe clean area. Equipment that has to be taken apart for maintenance shouldbe resterilized after complete reassembly, wherever possible. 10.4 When equipment maintenance is carried out within a clean area, clean instruments and tools should be used, and the area should be cleaned and QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 230QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 230disinfected again, where appropriate, before processing recommences if the required standards of cleanliness and/or asepsis have not been maintainedduring the maintenance work. 10.5 All equipment, including sterilizers, air-ltration systems, and water- treatment systems, including stills, should be subject to planned maintenance,validation and monitoring; its approved use following maintenance work shouldbe documented. 10.6 Water-treatment plants and distribution systems should be designed, con- structed and maintained so as to ensure a reliable source of water of an appro-priate quality. They should not be operated beyond their designed capacity.Consideration should be given to including a testing programme in the main-tenance of a water system. Water for injection should be produced, stored anddistributed in a manner which prevents the growth of microorganisms, e.g. byconstant circulation at a temperature above 70\u00b0C or not more than 4\u00b0C. 11. Finishing of sterile products 11.1 Containers should be closed by appropriately validated methods. Samplesshould be checked for integrity according to appropriate procedures. 11.2 Containers sealed under vacuum should be sampled and the samples tested, after an appropriate predetermined period, to ensure that the vacuumhas been maintained. 11.3 Filled containers of parenteral products should be inspected individually. When inspection is done visually, it should be done under suitable and con-trolled conditions of illumination and background. Operators doing the inspec-tion should pass regular eyesight checks, with spectacles if worn, and be allowedfrequent breaks from inspection. Where other methods of inspection are used,the process should be validated and the performance of the equipment checkedat intervals. The results should be recorded. References 1.

Scope of these guidelines These guidelines are intended to complement those provided in \"Good manu-facturing practices for pharmaceutical products\" ( 1). The regulatory procedures necessary to control biological products are in large part determined by the sources of products and methods of manufacture.Manufacturing procedures within the scope of these guidelines include: \u2014 growth of strains of microorganisms and eukaryotic cells, \u2014 extraction of substances from biological tissues, including human, animal and plant tissues (allergens), \u2014 recombinant DNA (rDNA) techniques,\u2014 hybridoma techniques,\u2014 propagation of microorganisms in embryos or animals. Biological products manufactured by these methods include allergens, antigens, vaccines, hormones, cytokines, enzymes, human whole blood and plasma deriv-atives, immune sera, immunoglobulins (including monoclonal antibodies),products of fermentation (including products derived from rDNA) and diag-nostic agents for in vitro use.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2321Good manufacturing practices for biological products.

Principles The manufacture of biological products shall be undertaken in accordance with the basic principles of good manufacturing practices (GMP). The pointscovered by these guidelines should therefore be considered supplementary tothe general requirements set out in \"Good manufacturing practices for phar-maceutical products\" ( 1), and relate specically to the production and control of biological products. In drawing up these guidelines, due consideration wasgiven to the draft \"Guidelines for national authorities on quality assurance for biological products\", the nal version of which appears as Annex 2 to theforty-second report of the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standard-ization ( 2). The way in which biological products are produced, controlled and admin- istered makes some particular precautions necessary. Unlike conventional phar-maceutical products, which are normally produced and controlled usingreproducible chemical and physical techniques, biological products are manu-factured by methods involving biological processes and materials, such as cul-tivation of cells or extraction of material from living organisms. These processesdisplay inherent variability, so that the range and nature of by-products are vari-able. For this reason, in the manufacture of biological products full adherenceto GMP is necessary for all production steps, beginning with those from whichthe active ingredients are produced. Control of biological products nearly always involves biological techniques that have a greater variability than physicochemical determinations. In-processcontrols take on a great importance in the manufacture of biological productsbecause certain deciencies may not be revealed by testing the nished product. The present guidelines do not lay down detailed requirements for specic classes of biological products, and attention is therefore directed to other guidance issued by WHO, and in particular to the Requirements for BiologicalSubstances, which include requirements for vaccines ( 2, Annex 7). 3. Personnel 3.1 The manufacturing establishment and its personnel shall be under the authority of a person who has been trained in the techniques used in manufac-turing biological substances and who possesses the scientic knowledge uponwhich the manufacture of these products is based. The personnel shall includespecialists with training appropriate to the products made in the establishment. 3.2 Personnel required to work in clean and aseptic areas should be selected with care, to ensure that they may be relied upon to observe the appropriatecodes of practice and are not subject to any disease or condition that could com-promise the integrity of the product microbiologically or otherwise. High standards of personal hygiene and cleanliness are essential. Staff should beinstructed to report any conditions (e.g. diarrhoea, coughs, colds, infected skinSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 233QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 233or hair, wounds, fever of unknown origin) that may cause the shedding of abnor- mal numbers or types of organisms into the working environment. Healthchecks on personnel for such conditions should be required before employmentand periodically thereafter. Any changes in health status that could adverselyaffect the quality of the product shall preclude the person concerned fromworking in the production area. 3.3 Only the minimum number of personnel required should be present in clean and aseptic areas when work is in progress. Inspection and control pro-cedures should be conducted from outside these areas as far as possible. 3.4 During the working day, personnel shall not pass from areas where live microorganisms or animals are handled to premises where other products ororganisms are handled unless clearly dened decontamination measures, includ-ing a change of clothing and shoes, are followed. Persons not concerned withthe production process should not enter the production area except for essen-tial purposes, and in that case they shall be supplied with sterile protective clothing. 3.5 The staff engaged in the manufacturing process should be separate from the staff responsible for animal care. 3.6 The names and qualications of those responsible for approving lot pro- cessing records (protocols) should be registered with the national controlauthority. 3.7 To ensure the manufacture of high-quality products, personnel should be trained in good manufacturing and laboratory practices in appropriate eldssuch as bacteriology, virology, biometry, chemistry, medicine, immunology andveterinary medicine. 3.8 Training records should be maintained and periodic assessments of the effectiveness of training programmes should be made. 3.9 All personnel engaged in production, maintenance, testing and animal care (and inspectors) should be vaccinated with appropriate vaccines and, whereappropriate, be submitted to regular testing for evidence of active tuberculosis.Apart from the obvious problem of exposure of staff to infectious agents, potenttoxins or allergens, it is necessary to avoid the risk of contamination of a pro-duction batch with these agents. 3.10 Where BCG vaccines are being manufactured, access to production areas shall be restricted to staff who are carefully monitored by regular health checks.In the case of manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma,vaccination of workers against hepatitis B is recommended.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 234QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2344. Premises and equipment 4.1 As a general principle, buildings must be located, designed, constructed, adapted and maintained to suit the operations to be carried out within them.Laboratories, operating rooms and all other rooms and buildings (includingthose for animals) that are used for the manufacture of biological products shallbe designed and constructed of materials of the highest standard so that clean-liness, especially freedom from dust, insects and vermin, can be maintained. 4.2 Interior surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings) shall be smooth and free from cracks; they shall not shed matter and shall permit easy cleaning and disinfec-tion. Drains should be avoided wherever possible and, unless essential, shouldbe excluded from aseptic areas. Where installed they should be tted with effec-tive, easily cleanable traps and with breaks to prevent back-flow. The traps maycontain electrically operated heating devices or other means for disinfection.Any floor channels should be open, shallow and easily cleanable and be con-nected to drains outside the area in a manner that prevents ingress of microbialcontaminants. 4.3 Sinks shall be excluded from aseptic areas. Any sink installed in other clean areas shall be of suitable material such as stainless steel, without an overflow,and be supplied with water of potable quality. Adequate precautions shall betaken to avoid contamination of the drainage system with dangerous effluents.Airborne dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses used for pro-duction and the possibility of contamination by other types of viruses or sub-stances during the production process, including those from personnel, shall beavoided. 4.4 Lighting, heating, ventilation and, if necessary, air-conditioning should be designed to maintain a satisfactory temperature and relative humidity, to mini-mize contamination and to take account of the comfort of personnel workingin protective clothing. Buildings shall be in a good state of repair. The condi-tion of the buildings should be reviewed regularly and repairs carried out whenand where necessary. Special care should be exercised to ensure that buildingrepair or maintenance operations do not compromise products. Premises shouldprovide sufcient space to suit the operations to be carried out, allowing an ef-cient flow of work and effective communication and supervision. All buildingsand rooms shall be clean and sanitary at all times. If rooms intended for themanufacture of biological substances are used for other purposes, they shall becleaned thoroughly and, if necessary, sanitized before the manufacture of bio-logical substances is resumed. Areas used for processing animal tissue materi-als and microorganisms not required for the current manufacturing process andfor performing tests involving animals or microorganisms must be separatedfrom premises used for manufacturing sterile biological products and have com-pletely separate ventilation systems and separate staff.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 235QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2354.5 If certain products are to be produced on a campaign basis, the layout and design of the premises and equipment shall permit effective decontaminationby fumigation, where necessary, as well as cleaning and sanitizing after the pro-duction campaign. 4.6 Seed lots and cell banks used for the production of biological products should be stored separately from other material. Access should be restricted toauthorized personnel. 4.7 Live organisms shall be handled in equipment that ensures that cultures are maintained in a pure state and are not contaminated during processing. 4.8 Products such as killed vaccines, including those made by rDNA tech- niques, toxoids and bacterial extracts may after inactivation be dispensed intocontainers on the same premises as other sterile biological products, providingthat adequate decontamination measures are taken after lling, including, ifappropriate, sterilization and washing. 4.9 Spore-forming organisms shall be handled in facilities dedicated to this group of products until the inactivation process is accomplished. For Bacillus anthracis , Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani , strictly dedicated facil- ities should be utilized for each individual product. Where campaign manufac-ture of spore-forming organisms occurs in a facility or suite of facilities, onlyone product should be processed at any one time. 4.10 Dedicated facilities and equipment shall be used for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma. 4.11 All containers of biological substances, regardless of the stage of manu- facture, shall be identied by securely attached labels. Cross-contaminationshould be prevented by adoption of some or all of the following measures: \u2014 processing and lling in segregated areas; \u2014 avoiding manufacture of different products at the same time, unless they are effectively segregated; \u2014 containing material transfer by means of airlocks, air extraction, clothing change and careful washing and decontamination of equipment; \u2014 protecting against the risks of contamination caused by recirculation of untreated air, or by accidental re-entry of extracted air; \u2014 using \"closed systems\" of manufacture;\u2014 taking care to prevent aerosol formation (especially by centrifugation and blending); \u2014 excluding pathological specimens sent in for diagnosis from areas used for manufacturing biological substances; \u2014 using containers that are sterilized or are of documented low \"bioburden\". 4.12 Positive-pressure areas should be used to process sterile products, but neg- ative pressure is acceptable in specic areas where pathogens are processed. InQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 236QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 236general, any organisms considered to be pathogenic should be handled within specically designed areas under negative pressures, in accordance with con-tainment requirements for the product concerned. 4.13 Air-handling units should be dedicated to the processing area concerned. Air from operations involving pathogens shall not be recirculated and, in thecases of organisms in a group above Risk Group 2 ( 3), shall be exhausted through sterilizing lters that are regularly checked for performance. 4.14 Specic decontamination systems should be considered for effluent when infectious and potentially infectious materials are used for production. 4.15 Pipework, valves and vent lters shall be properly designed to facilitate cleaning and sterilization. Valves on fermentation vessels shall be completelysteam-sterilizable. Air-vent lters shall be hydrophobic and shall be validatedfor their designated use. 4.16 Small stocks of substances that have to be measured or weighed during the production process (e.g. buffers) may be kept in the production area, pro-vided that they are not returned to the general stocks. Otherwise, dry materialsused to formulate buffers, culture media, etc. should be weighed and put intosolution in a contained area outside the purication and aseptic areas in orderto minimize particulate contamination of the product. 5. Animal quarters and care1 5.1 Animals are used for the manufacture and control of a number of biologi-cal products. Animals shall be accommodated in separate buildings with self-contained ventilation systems. The buildings' design and construction materialsshall permit maintenance in a clean and sanitary condition free from insects andvermin. Facilities for animal care shall include isolation units for quarantine ofincoming animals and provision for vermin-free food storage. Provision shallalso be made for animal inoculation rooms, which shall be separate from thepostmortem rooms. There shall be facilities for the disinfection of cages, if pos-sible by steam, and an incinerator for disposing of waste and of dead animals. 5.2 The health status of animals from which starting materials are derived and of those used for quality control and safety testing should be monitored andrecorded. Staff employed in animal quarters must be provided with specialclothing, changing facilities and showers. Where monkeys are used for the production or quality control of biological products, special consideration isrequired, as laid down in the revised Requirements for Biological SubstancesNo. 7 (Requirements for Poliomyelitis Vaccine (Oral)) ( 5).SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 2371General requirements for animal quarters, care and quarantine are given in reference 4.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2376. Production 6.1 Standard operating procedures shall be available and maintained up to date for all manufacturing operations. 6.2 Specications for starting materials should include details of their source, origin and method of manufacture and of the controls applied, in particularmicrobiological controls, to ensure their suitability for use. Release of a nishedproduct is conditional on satisfactory results being obtained in the tests on start-ing materials. 6.3 Media and cultures shall be added to fermenters and other vessels under carefully controlled conditions to avoid contamination. Care shall be taken to ensure that vessels are correctly connected when cultures are added. 6.4 If possible, media should be sterilized in situ. In-line sterilizing lters for routine addition of gases, media, acids, alkalis, defoaming agents, etc. to fer-menters should be used where possible. 6.5 Careful consideration should be given to the validation of sterilization methods. 6.6 When an inactivation process is performed during manufacture, measures should be taken to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between treated anduntreated products. 6.7 A wide variety of equipment is used for chromatography; in general such equipment should be dedicated to the purication of one product and shouldbe sterilized or sanitized between batches. Problems of decontamination andpurication may arise through repeated use of the same equipment at the sameor different stages of processing. The life span of columns and the sterilizationmethod shall be dened. Particular care should be given to monitoring micro-bial loads and endotoxins. 7. Labelling 7.1 All products shall be clearly identied by labels. The labels used mustremain permanently attached to the containers under all storage conditions andan area of the container should be left uncovered to allow inspection of the con-tents. If the nal container is not suitable for labelling (for example a capillarytube), it should be in a labelled package. 7.2 The information given on the label on the container and the label on the package shall be approved by the national control authority. 7.3 The label on the container shall show:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 238QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 238\u2014 the name of the drug product; \u2014 a list of the active ingredients and the amount of each present, with a state- ment of the net contents, e.g. number of dosage units, weight or volume; \u2014 the batch or nal lot number assigned by the manufacturer;\u2014 the expiry date;\u2014 recommended storage conditions or handling precautions that may be necessary; \u2014 directions for use, and warnings and precautions that may be necessary;\u2014 the nature and amount of any substance used in the preparation of the biological product that is likely to give rise to an adverse reaction in somerecipients; \u2014 the name and address of the manufacturer or the company and/or the person responsible for placing the drug on the market. 7.4 The label on the package shall, in addition to the information shown on the label on the container, show at least the nature and amount of any preservativeor additive in the product. 7.5 The leaflet in the package should provide instructions for the use of the product, and mention any contraindications or potential adverse reactions. 8. Lot processing records (protocols) and distribution records 8.1 Processing records of regular production lots must provide a complete account of the manufacturing history of each lot of a biological preparation,showing that it has been manufactured, tested, dispensed into containers anddistributed in accordance with the licensed procedures. 8.2 A separate processing record should be prepared for each lot of biological product, and should include the following information: \u2014 the name and dosage of the product; \u2014 the date of manufacture;\u2014 the lot identication number;\u2014 the complete formulation of the lot, including identication of seed or starting materials; \u2014 the batch number of each component used in the formulation;\u2014 the yield obtained at different stages of manufacture of the lot;\u2014 a duly signed record of each step followed, precautions taken and special observations made throughout the manufacture of the lot; \u2014 a record of all in-process control tests and of the results obtained;\u2014 a specimen of the label;\u2014 identication of packaging materials, containers and closures used;\u2014 a dated signature of the expert responsible for approving the manufacturing operations;SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 239QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 239\u2014 an analytical report, dated and signed by the responsible expert, showing whether the lot complies with the specications described in the standardoperating procedure registered with the national control authority; \u2014 a record of the decision regarding the release or rejection of the lot by the quality control department and, if the lot is rejected, a record of its disposalor use. 8.3 The records shall be of a type approved by the national control authority. They shall be retained for at least two years after the expiry date of a lot or batchof a biological product and be available at all times for inspection by the nationalcontrol authority. 8.4 Records must make it possible to trace all steps in the manufacture and testing of a lot, and should include records of sterilization of all apparatus andmaterials used in its manufacture. Distribution records must be kept in a mannerthat permits rapid recall of any particular lot, if necessary. 9. Quality assurance and quality control 9.1 The quality assurance and/or quality control department should have thefollowing principal duties: \u2014 to prepare detailed instructions for each test and analysis; \u2014 to ensure adequate identication and segregation of test samples to avoid mix-up and cross-contamination; \u2014 to ensure that environmental monitoring and equipment validation are con- ducted as appropriate for evaluating the adequacy of the manufacturing conditions; \u2014 to release or reject raw materials and intermediate products, if necessary;\u2014 to release or reject packaging and labelling materials and the nal contain- ers in which drugs are to be placed; \u2014 to release or reject each lot of nished preparation;\u2014 to evaluate the adequacy of the conditions under which raw materials, inter- mediate products, and nished biological preparations are stored; \u2014 to evaluate the quality and stability of nished products and, when neces- sary, of raw materials and intermediate products; \u2014 to establish expiry dates on the basis of the validity period related to specied storage conditions; \u2014 to establish and, when necessary, revise control procedures and specica- tions; and \u2014 to be responsible for the examination of returned preparations to determine whether such preparations should be released, reprocessed or destroyed;adequate records of the distribution of such preparations should be maintained.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 240QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2409.2 A manufacturer's quality control laboratory shall be separated from the pro- duction area and ideally should be in a separate building. The control labora-tory should be designed and equipped and of such a size as to be a self-containedentity, with adequate provision for the storage of documents and samples, prepa-ration of records and performance of the necessary tests. 9.3 In-process controls play a specially important role in ensuring the consis- tent quality of biological products. Tests that are crucial for quality control butthat cannot be carried out on the nished product shall be performed at anappropriate stage of production. 9.4 Performance of all qualitative and quantitative tests mentioned in the spec- ications for starting materials may be replaced by a system of certicates issuedby the producer of the starting material, provided that: \u2014 there is a history of reliable production, \u2014 the producer is regularly audited, and\u2014 at least one specic identity test is conducted by the manufacturer of the nal product. 9.5 Samples of intermediate and nal products shall be retained in sufcient amount and under appropriate storage conditions to allow the repetition or con-rmation of a batch control. However, reference samples of certain startingmaterials, e.g. components of culture media, need not necessarily be retained. 9.6 Certain operations require the continuous monitoring of data during a pro- duction process, for example monitoring and recording of physical parametersduring fermentation. 9.7 Special consideration needs to be given to the quality control requirements arising from production of biological products by continuous culture.

Introductory note The legal status of investigational pharmaceutical products for human use varies from country to country; in some of them (e.g. Germany, the United States andothers), these products are manufactured and inspected like \"normal\" licensedpharmaceutical products. In most other countries, however, they are notcovered by legal and regulatory provisions in the areas of good manufacturingpractice (GMP) inspection, etc. However, the EC guide on GMP ( 1) recommends that the principles of GMP should be applied, as appropriate, to the preparation of these products,QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2421Good manufacturing practices: supplementary guidelines for the manufacture of investigational pharmaceutical products for clinical trials in humans. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-fourth report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 1996 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 863), Annex 7.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 242and the WHO guide on GMP , according to the statement in the general con- siderations, is applicable to \"the preparation of clinical trials supplies\" ( 2, page 18). 2. General considerations The present guidelines supplement both the WHO guide on GMP and theguidelines on good clinical practice (GCP) for trials on pharmaceutical prod-ucts ( 3). The application of the principles of GMP to the preparation of inves- tigational products is necessary for several reasons: To assure consistency between and within batches of the investigational product and thus assure the reliability of clinical trials. To assure consistency between the investigational product and the future commercial product and therefore the relevance of the clinical trial to theefcacy and safety of the marketed product. To protect subjects of clinical trials from poor-quality products resulting from manufacturing errors (omission of critical steps such as sterilization, conta-mination and cross-contamination, mix-ups, wrong labelling, etc.), or fromstarting materials and components of inadequate quality. To document all changes in the manufacturing process. In this context, the selection of an appropriate dosage for clinical trials is impor- tant. While it is accepted that in early trials the dosage form may be very dif-ferent from the anticipated nal formulation (e.g. a capsule instead of a tablet),in the pivotal Phase III studies it should be similar to the projected commercialpresentation; otherwise these trials will not necessarily prove that the marketedproduct is both efcacious and safe. If there are signicant differences between the clinical and commercial dosage forms, data should be submitted to the registration authorities to demon-strate that the nal dosage form is equivalent, in terms of bioavailability and sta-bility, to that used in the clinical trials. Final manufacturing methods must berevalidated following changes in processes, scaling-up, transfer to other manu-facturing sites, etc. This section specically addresses those practices that may be different for investigational products, which are usually not manufactured in accordance witha set routine, and which may possibly be incompletely characterized during theinitial stages of clinical development. 3. Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 243QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 243clinical trial Any systematic study on pharmaceutical products in human subjects, whether in patients or other volunteers, in order to discover or verify the effects of,and/or identify any adverse reaction to, investigational products, and/or to studythe absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the products with theobject of ascertaining their efcacy and safety. Clinical trials are generally divided into Phases I-IV . It is not possible to draw clear distinctions between these phases, and different opinions aboutdetails and methodology do exist. However, the individual phases, based ontheir purposes as related to the clinical development of pharmaceutical prod-ucts, can be briefly dened as follows: Phase I . These are the rst trials of a new active ingredient or new formu- lations in humans, often carried out in healthy volunteers. Their purpose is tomake a preliminary evaluation of safety, and an initial pharmacokinetic/ phar-macodynamic prole of the active ingredient. Phase II . The purpose of these therapeutic pilot studies is to determine activity and to assess the short-term safety of the active ingredient in patientssuffering from a disease or condition for which it is intended. The trials are per-formed in a limited number of subjects and are often, at a later stage, of a com-parative (e.g. placebo-controlled) design. This phase is also concerned with thedetermination of appropriate dose ranges/regimens and (if possible) the clari-cation of dose-response relationships in order to provide an optimal backgroundfor the design of extensive therapeutic trials. Phase III . This phase involves trials in large (and possibly varied) patient groups for the purpose of determining the short- and long-term safety-efcacybalance of formulation(s) of the active ingredient, and assessing its overall andrelative therapeutic value. The pattern and prole of any frequent adverse reac-tions must be investigated, and special features of the product must be explored(e.g. clinically relevant drug interactions, factors leading to differences in effect,such as age). The trials should preferably be randomized double-blind, but otherdesigns may be acceptable, e.g. long-term safety studies. In general, the condi-tions under which the trials are conducted should be as close as possible to thenormal conditions of use. Phase IV . In this phase studies are performed after the pharmaceutical product has been marketed. They are based on the product characteristics onwhich the marketing authorization was granted and normally take the form ofpost-marketing surveillance, and assessment of therapeutic value or treatmentstrategies. Although methods may differ, the same scientic and ethical stan-dards should apply to Phase IV studies as are applied in premarketing studies.After a product has been placed on the market, clinical trials designed to explorenew indications, new methods of administration or new combinations, etc., arenormally regarded as trials of new pharmaceutical products.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 244QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 244investigational product Any pharmaceutical product (new product or reference product) or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial. investigator The person responsible for the trial and for protecting the rights, health andwelfare of the subjects in the trial.

When anSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 245QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 245investigator independently initiates and takes full responsibility for a trial, the investigator then also assumes the role of the sponsor. 4. Quality assurance Quality assurance of pharmaceutical products has been dened and discussedin detail in the guide on GMP ( 2, pages 25-26). The quality of dosage forms in Phase III clinical studies should be charac- terized and assured at the same level as for routinely manufactured products.The quality assurance system, designed, established and veried by the manu-facturer, should be described in writing, taking into account the GMP princi-ples to the extent that they are applicable to the operations in question. Thissystem should also cover the interface between the manufacture and the trialsite (e.g. shipment, storage, occasional additional labelling). 5. Validation1 Some of the production processes for investigational products that have notreceived marketing authorization may not be validated to the extent necessaryfor a routine production operation. The product specications and manufac-turing instructions may vary during development. This increased complexity inthe manufacturing operations requires a highly effective quality assurancesystem. For sterile products, there should be no reduction in the degree of valida- tion of sterilizing equipment required. Validation of aseptic processes presentsspecial problems when the batch size is small, since the number of units lledmay not be adequate for a validation exercise. Filling and sealing, which is oftendone by hand, can compromise the maintenance of sterility. Greater attentionshould therefore be given to environmental monitoring. 6. Complaints The conclusions of any investigation carried out in response to a complaintshould be discussed between the manufacturer and the sponsor (if different) orbetween the persons responsible for manufacture and those responsible for therelevant clinical trial in order to assess any potential impact on the trial and onthe product development, to determine the cause, and to take any necessary cor-rective action.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2461For additional advice on Validation of manufacturing processes, pp. 53-71.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2467. Recalls Recall procedures should be understood by the sponsor, investigator and monitor in addition to the person(s) responsible for recalls, as described in theguide on GMP ( 2, pages 28-29). 8. Personnel Although it is likely that the number of staff involved will be small, people should be separately designated as responsible for production and qualitycontrol. All production operations should be carried out under the control ofa clearly identied responsible person. Personnel concerned with development,involved in production and quality control, need to be instructed in the princi-ples of GMP . 9. Premises and equipment During the manufacture of investigational products, different products may behandled in the same premises and at the same time, and this reinforces the needto eliminate all risks of contamination, including cross-contamination. Specialattention should be paid to line clearance in order to avoid mix-ups. Validatedcleaning procedures should be followed to prevent cross-contamination. For the production of the particular products referred to in section 11.20 of the guide on GMP ( 2, page 38), campaign working may be acceptable in place of dedicated and self-contained facilities. Because the toxicity of the mate-rials may not be fully known, cleaning is of particular importance; accountshould be taken of the solubility of the product and excipients in various clean-ing agents. 10. Materials Starting materials The consistency of production may be influenced by the quality of the startingmaterials. Their physical, chemical and, when appropriate, microbiologicalproperties should therefore be dened, documented in their specications, andcontrolled. Existing compendial standards, when available, should be taken intoconsideration. Specications for active ingredients should be as comprehensiveas possible, given the current state of knowledge. Specications for both activeand non-active ingredients should be periodically reassessed. Detailed information on the quality of active and non-active ingredients, as well as of packaging materials, should be available so as to make it possible torecognize and, as necessary, allow for any variation in production.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 247QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 247Chemical and biological reference standards for analytical purposes Reference standards from reputable sources (WHO or national standards) should be used, if available; otherwise the reference substance(s) for the activeingredient(s) should be prepared, tested and released as reference material(s)by the producer of the investigational pharmaceutical product, or by the pro-ducer of the active ingredient(s) used in the manufacture of that product. Principles applicable to reference products for clinical trials In studies in which an investigational product is compared with a marketedproduct, steps should be taken to ensure the integrity and quality of the refer-ence products (nal dosage form, packaging materials, storage conditions, etc.).If signicant changes are to be made in the product, data should be available(e.g. on stability, comparative dissolution) that demonstrate that these changesdo not influence the original quality characteristics of the product. 11. Documentation Specications (for starting materials, primary packaging materials, intermediateand bulk products and nished products), master formulae, and processing andpackaging instructions may be changed frequently as a result of new experiencein the development of an investigational product. Each new version should takeinto account the latest data and include a reference to the previous version sothat traceability is ensured. Rationales for changes should be stated andrecorded. Batch processing and packaging records should be retained for at least 2 years after the termination or discontinuance of the clinical trial, or after theapproval of the investigational product. Order The order may request the processing and/or packaging of a certain number ofunits and/or their shipping. It may only be given by the sponsor to the manu-facturer of an investigational product. It should be in writing (though it may betransmitted by electronic means), precise enough to avoid any ambiguity andformally authorized, and refer to the approved product specication le (seebelow). Product specication le(s) A product specication le (or les) should contain the information necessaryto draft the detailed written instructions on processing, packaging, qualityQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 248QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 248control testing, batch release, storage conditions and/or shipping. It should indi- cate who has been designated or trained as the authorized person responsiblefor the release of batches (see reference 2, page 18). It should be continuously updated while at the same time ensuring appropriate traceability to the previ-ous versions. Specications In developing specications, special attention should be paid to characteristicswhich affect the efcacy and safety of pharmaceutical products, namely: The accuracy of the therapeutic or unitary dose: homogeneity, content uniformity. The release of active ingredients from the dosage form: dissolution time, etc. The estimated stability, if necessary, under accelerated conditions, the pre- liminary storage conditions and the shelf-life of the product. 1 In addition, the package size should be suitable for the requirements of the trial. Specications may be subject to change as the development of the product progresses. Changes should, however, be made in accordance with a written pro-cedure authorized by a responsible person and clearly recorded. Specicationsshould be based on all available scientic data, current state-of-the-art technol-ogy, and the regulatory and pharmacopoeial requirements. Master formulae and processing instructions These may be changed in the light of experience, but allowance must be madefor any possible repercussions on stability and, above all, on bioequivalencebetween batches of nished products. Changes should be made in accordancewith a written procedure, authorized by a responsible person and clearlyrecorded. It may sometimes not be necessary to produce master formulae and processing instructions, but for every manufacturing operation or supply thereshould be clear and adequate written instructions and written records. Recordsare particularly important for the preparation of the nal version of the docu-ments to be used in routine manufacture. Packaging instructions The number of units to be packaged should be specied before the start of the packaging operations. Account should be taken of the number of units SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 2491See Quality assurance of pharmaceuticals: a compendium of guidelines and related materials. Vol. 1 . Geneva, World Health Organization, 1997:46-61.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 249necessary for carrying out quality controls and of the number of samples from each batch used in the clinical trial to be kept as a reference for further recheck-ing and control. A reconciliation should be carried out at the end of the pack-aging and labelling process. Labelling instructions The information presented on labels should include: The name of the sponsor. A statement: \"for clinical research use only\". A trial reference number. A batch number. The patient identication number. 1 The storage conditions. The expiry date (month/year) or a retest date. Additional information may be displayed in accordance with the order (e.g. dosing instructions, treatment period, standard warnings). When necessary forblinding purposes, the batch number may be provided separately (see also\"Blinding operations\" on p. 123). A copy of each type of label should be keptin the batch packaging record. Processing and packaging batch records Processing and packaging batch records should be kept in sufcient detail forthe sequence of operations to be accurately traced. They should contain any rel-evant remarks which increase existing knowledge of the product, allow improve-ments in the manufacturing operations, and justify the procedures used. Coding (or randomization) systems Procedures should be established for the generation, distribution, handling andretention of any randomization code used in packaging investigational products. A coding system should be introduced to permit the proper identication of \"blinded\" products. The code, together with the randomization list, mustpermit proper identication of the product, including any necessary trace-ability to the codes and batch number of the product before the blinding operation. The coding system must permit determination without delay in anemergency situation of the identity of the actual treatment product received byindividual subjects.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2501This is not necessarily inserted at the manufacturing facility but may be added at a later stage.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 25012. Production Products intended for use in clinical trials (late Phase II and Phase III studies) should as far as possible be manufactured at a licensed facility, e.g.: A pilot plant, primarily designed and used for process development. A small-scale facility (sometimes called a \"pharmacy\")1separate both from the company's pilot plant and from routine production. A larger-scale production line assembled to manufacture materials in larger batches, e.g. for late Phase III trials and rst commercial batches. The normal production line used for licensed commercial batches, and some- times for the production of investigational pharmaceutical products if thenumber, e.g. of ordered ampoules, tablets or other dosage forms, is largeenough. The relation between the batch size for investigational pharmaceutical prod- ucts manufactured in a pilot plant or small-scale facility and the planned full-size batches may vary widely depending on the pilot plant or \"pharmacy\" batchsize demanded and the capacity available in full-size production. The present guidelines are applicable to licensed facilities of the rst and second types. It is easier to assure compliance with GMP in facilities of thesecond type, since processes are kept constant in the course of production andare not normally changed for the purpose of process development. Facilities ofthe remaining types should be subject to all GMP rules for pharmaceutical products. Administratively, the manufacturer has yet another possibility, namely to contract out the preparation of investigational products. Technically, however,the licensed facility will be of one of the above-mentioned types. The contractmust then clearly state, inter alia, the use of the pharmaceutical product(s) inclinical trials. Close cooperation between the contracting parties is essential. Manufacturing operations Validated procedures may not always be available during the developmentphase, which makes it difcult to know in advance what are the critical para-meters and what in-process controls would help to control these parameters.Provisional production parameters and in-process controls may then usually bededuced from experience with analogous products. Careful consideration bykey personnel is called for in order to formulate the necessary instructions andto adapt them continuously to the experience gained in production. For sterile investigational products, assurance of sterility should be no less than for licensed products. Cleaning procedures should be appropriatelySPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 2511Some manufacturers use the term \"pharmacy\" to designate other types of premises, e.g. areas where starting materials are dispensed and batches compounded.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 251validated and designed in the light of the incomplete knowledge of the toxicity of the investigational product. Where processes such as mixing have not beenvalidated, additional quality control testing may be necessary. Packaging and labelling The packaging and labelling of investigational products are likely to be morecomplex and more liable to errors (which are also harder to detect) when\"blinded\" labels are used than for licensed products. Supervisory proceduressuch as label reconciliation, line clearance, etc., and the independent checks byquality control staff should accordingly be intensied. The packaging must ensure that the investigational product remains in good condition during transport and storage at intermediate destinations. Anyopening of, or tampering with, the outer packaging during transport should bereadily discernible. Blinding operations In the preparation of \"blinded\" products, in-process control should include acheck on the similarity in appearance and any other required characteristics ofthe different products being compared. 13. Quality control As processes may not be standardized or fully validated, end-product testing ismore important in ensuring that each batch meets its specication. Product release is often carried out in two stages, before and after nal packaging: 1 1. Bulk product assessment: this should cover all relevant factors, including production conditions, the results of in-process testing, a review of manu-facturing documentation and compliance with the product specication leand the order. 2. Finished product assessment: this should cover, in addition to the bulk product assessment, all relevant factors, including packaging conditions, theresults of in-process testing, a review of packaging documentation and com-pliance with the product specication le and the order. When necessary, quality control should also be used to verify the similarity in appearance and other physical characteristics, odour, and taste of \"blinded\"investigational products.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2521This practice also exists at certain large companies with regard to licensed products.QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 252Samples of each batch of product should be retained in the primary con- tainer used for the study or in a suitable bulk container for at least 2 years afterthe termination or completion of the relevant clinical trial. If the sample is notstored in the pack used for the study, stability data should be available to justifythe shelf-life in the pack used. 14. Shipping, returns, and destruction The shipping, return and destruction of unused products should be carried outin accordance with the written procedures laid down in the protocol. All unusedproducts sent outside the manufacturing plant should, as far as possible, eitherbe returned to the manufacturer or destroyed in accordance with clearly denedinstructions. Shipping Investigational products should be shipped in accordance with the orders givenby the sponsor. A shipment is sent to an investigator only after the following two-step release procedure: (i) the release of the product after quality control (\"techni-cal green light\"); and (ii) the authorization to use the product, given by thesponsor (\"regulatory green light\"). Both releases should be recorded. The sponsor should ensure that the shipment will be received and acknowl- edged by the correct addressee as stated in the protocol. A detailed inventory of the shipments made by the manufacturer should be maintained, and should make particular mention of the addressee's identication. Returns Investigational products should be returned under agreed conditions denedby the sponsor, specied in written procedures, and approved by authorizedstaff members. Returned investigational products should be clearly identied and stored in a dedicated area. Inventory records of returned medicinal products should bekept. The responsibilities of the investigator and the sponsor are dealt with ingreater detail in the WHO guidelines on GCP ( 3). Destruction The sponsor is responsible for the destruction of unused investigational prod- ucts, which should therefore not be destroyed by the manufacturer withoutprior authorization by the sponsor. Destruction operations should be carriedout in accordance with environmental safety requirements.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 253QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 253Destruction operations should be recorded in such a manner that all oper- ations are documented. The records should be kept by the sponsor. If requested to destroy products, the manufacturer should deliver a certi- cate of destruction or a receipt for destruction to the sponsor. These documentsshould permit the batches involved to be clearly identied. References 1.Good manufacturing practice for medicinal products in the European Community .

As partof this series, the WHO Supplementary guidelines for the manufacture of herbal medicinal products (2) were issued in 1996. The guidelines were also reproduced in the second volume of the WHO compendium on Quality assurance of phar- maceuticals (3). Related WHO documents such as Guidelines for the assessment of herbal medicines (4), General Guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine (5), Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials (6), Guidelines on good agricultural and collection practices for medici- nal plants (7) were also issued. WHO's Good manufacturing practices: main principles for pharmaceutical products were updated in 2003 ( 1, 8). Around the turn of the millenium, various product-specic good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines coveringherbal medicines were developed by several WHO Member States, and by theEuropean Union. They covered several issues relevant to the production andquality control of herbal medicines in more detail. For this reason, within theframework of the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2000-2005 , revision of the present supplementary guidelines was considered desirable; this was alsoendorsed by the WHO Expert Committee on Pharmaceutical Specications atits meetings in 2002, 2003 and 2004. These guidelines are intended to complement those provided in Good man- ufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products (1) and should be read in con- junction with the parent guide. The additional standards addressed by thepresent guidelines should therefore be considered supplementary to the generalrequirements set out in ( 1). They relate specically to the production and control of herbal medicines, insofar as they mainly focus on identifying the critical stepsneeded to ensure good quality. Therefore the structure of these supplementaryguidelines follows that of WHO's GMP main principles. The supplementary guidelines are intended to provide WHO Member States with general and minimum technical requirements for quality assuranceSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 255QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 255and control in the manufacture of herbal medicines. Each Member State should develop its own national GMP for manufacturing herbal medicines that areappropriate to the country's actual situation. These supplementary guidelinesdeal exclusively with herbal medicines. Combination of herbal materials withanimal materials, mineral materials, chemicals and other substances is notcovered in these guidelines. General Unlike conventional pharmaceutical products, which are usually produced fromsynthetic materials by means of reproducible manufacturing techniques andprocedures, herbal medicines are prepared from materials of herbal origin,which are often obtained from varied geographical and/or commercial sources.As a result it may not always be possible to ascertain the conditions to whichthey may have been subjected. In addition, they may vary in composition andproperties. Furthermore, the procedures and techniques used in the manufac-ture and quality control of herbal medicines are often substantially differentfrom those employed for conventional pharmaceutical products. Because of the inherent complexity of naturally grown medicinal plants and the often variable nature of cultivated ones, the examples of contamination withtoxic medicinal plants and/or plant parts and the number and small quantity ofdened active ingredients, the production and primary processing has a directinfluence on the quality of herbal medicines. For this reason, application ofGMPs in the manufacture of herbal medicines is an essential tool to assure theirquality. Glossary Established terms such as batch, bulk, intermediate product, qualication, start-ing material and validation are used as dened in the WHO Good manufactur- ing practices for pharmaceutical products (1). The denitions given below apply to the terms as used in these guidelines. These terms and their denitions have been selected and adopted from otherWHO documents and guidelines that are widely used by the WHO MemberStates ( 1,2,5,7,8). However, they may have different meanings in other contexts. It should be noted that, as a consequence of the various types of \"herbal medicines\", the same type of material may be classied, depending on the case,in different ways (e.g. powdered plant material may be both herbal material and herbal preparation or, in a packed form, herbal medicinal product ). active ingredients (5) The herbal material(s) or the herbal preparation(s) will be considered to be active ingredient(s) of a herbal medicine(s). However, if constituents withQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 256QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 256known therapeutic activities are known, the active ingredients should be stan- dardized to contain a dened amount of this/these constituent(s). blending Blending is the process of combining materials or different batches to producea homogeneous intermediate or nished product. constituents with known therapeutic activity (5) Constituents with known therapeutic activity are substances or groups of sub-stances which are chemically dened and known to contribute to the therapeuticactivity of a herbal material or of a preparation. herbal medicines (5) Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and nished herbal products. Herbs include crude materials which could be derived from lichen, algae, fungi or higher plants, such as leaves, flowers, fruit, fruiting bodies, seeds,stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes or other parts, which may be entire, frag-mented or powdered. Herbal materials include, in addition to herbs, fresh juices, gums, xed oils, essential oils, resins and dry powders of herbs. In some countries, these materials may be processed by various local procedures, such assteaming, roasting or stir-baking with honey, alcoholic beverages or othermaterials ( 5). Herbal preparations are the basis for nished herbal products and may include comminuted or cut herbal materials, or extracts, tinctures and fattyoils of herbal materials. They are produced by extraction, fractionation,purication, concentration, or other physical or biological processes. Theyalso include preparations made by steeping or heating herbal materials inalcoholic beverages and/or honey, or in other materials. Finished herbal products consist of herbal preparations made from one or more herbs. If more than one herb is used, the term \"mixture herbalproduct\" can also be used. Finished herbal products and mixture herbalproducts may contain excipients in addition to the active ingredients.However, nished herbal products or mixture herbal products to whichchemically dened active substances have been added, including syntheticcompounds and/or isolated constituents from herbal materials, are not con-sidered to be herbal ( 5). markers Markers are chemically dened constituents of a herbal material utilized for control purposes. They may or may not contribute to the clinical efcacy. WhenSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 257QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 257they contribute to the clinical efcacy, however, evidence that they are solely responsible for the clinical efcacy may or may not be available. Markers aregenerally employed when constituents of known therapeutic activity are notknown or are not clearly identied, and may be used to identify the herbal mate-rial or preparation or calculate their quantity in the nished product. medicinal plant (2) Medicinal plants are plants (wild or cultivated) used for medicinal purposes. medicinal plant materials see herbal materials (2) therapeutic activity (5) Therapeutic activity refers to the successful prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illnesses, improvement of symptoms of illnesses, as wellas benecial alteration or regulation of the physical and mental status of thebody and development of a sense of general well-being. 1. Quality assurance in the manufacture of herbal medicines In addition to the use of modern analytical techniques (especially high- performance thin-layer (MS) and atomic absorption (AA) to characterizeherbal medicines, quality assurance also requires the control of starting materi-als, storage and processing. For this reason, an appropriate quality assurancesystem should be applied in the manufacture of herbal medicines. Note: The methods of choice may depend on the country's infrastructure. 2. Good manufacturing practice for herbal medicines 2.1 The general principles of GMP are set out in the parent guidelines ( 1). Cul- tivation and collection of medicinal plants, as the starting materials for herbalmedicines, are covered by other guidelines (7). The rst critical step of theirproduction where the application of GMP starts should be clearly designated(see subsection 16.1). This is of particular importance for those products whichconsist solely of comminuted or powdered herbal materials. 3. Sanitation and hygiene 3.1 Because of their origin, herbal materials may contain microbiological con-taminants. Furthermore, during the course of harvesting and processing, herbalproducts that may be especially prone to microbiological contamination are pro-duced. To avoid alterations and to reduce contamination in general, a high levelQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 258QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 258of sanitation and hygiene during manufacture is necessary (for guidelines on personal hygiene see section 11, and for those on sanitation see section 12). 3.2 Water supply to the manufacturing unit should be monitored, and, if nec- essary treated appropriately to ensure consistency of quality. 3.3 Waste from the manufacturing unit should be disposed of regularly so as to maintain a high standard of hygiene in the manufacturing area. Clearlymarked waste-bins should be available, emptied and cleaned as needed, but atleast daily. 4. Qualication and validation 4.1 Qualication of critical equipment, process validation and change controlare particularly important in the production of herbal medicines with unknowntherapeutically active constituents. In this case, the reproducibility of the pro-duction process is the main means for ensuring consistency of quality, efcacyand safety between batches. 4.2 The written procedure should specify critical process steps and factors (such as extraction time, temperature and solvent purity) and acceptance crite-ria, as well as the type of validation to be conducted (e.g. retrospective, prospec-tive or concurrent) and the number of process runs. 4.3 A formal change control system should be established to evaluate the poten- tial effects of any changes on the quality of the herbal medicines, particularlycontent of the active ingredients. Scientic judgement should be used to deter-mine which additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justifya change in a validated process. 5. Complaints 5.1 The person responsible for handling complaints and deciding on the measures to be taken to deal with them should have appropriate training and/orexperience in the specic features of the quality control of herbal medicines. 5.2 There are basically two types of complaint, product quality complaints and adverse reactions/events. 5.3 The rst type of complaint may be caused by problems such as faulty man- ufacture, product defects or deterioration as well as, particular to herbal med-icines, adulteration of the herbal material. These complaints should be recordedin detail and the causes thoroughly investigated (e.g. by comparison with thereference samples kept from the same batch). There should also be written pro-cedures to describe the action to be taken.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 259QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2595.4 To address the second type of complaint, reports of any adverse re- action/event should be entered in a separate register in accordance with nationaland international requirements. An investigation should be conducted to ndout whether the adverse reaction/event is due to a quality problem and whethersuch reactions/events have already been reported in the literature or whether itis a new observation. In either case, complaint records should be reviewed reg-ularly to detect any specic or recurring problems requiring special attentionand possible recall of marketed products. The WHO guidelines on safety mon- itoring of herbal medicines in pharmacovigilance systems deal with specic issues relating to adverse reactions and adverse events following treatment with herbalmedicines ( 9). 5.5 The licensing authority should be kept informed of any complaints leading to a recall or restriction on supply and the records should be availablefor inspection. 6. Product recalls 6.1 The product recall procedure depends very much on the national regula-tions. There should be a standard operating procedure (SOP) for storage ofrecalled herbal medicines in a secure segregated area, complying with therequirements specied under subsection 12.1 (Storage areas), while their fate isdecided. 7. Contract production and analysis 7.1 The contract partner should have adequate premises and equipment for theproduction of herbal medicines according to GMP . Validated methods shouldbe applied for cleaning the equipment and premises carefully before using themto produce different herbal medicinal, food or cosmetic products. In the caseof raw materials used for producing food, it is realistic to require manufactur-ing departments to be separated from those where the plant raw material willbe cut or powdered for use in the preparation of medicines. 7.2 Technical aspects of the contract should be drawn up by competent persons suitably knowledgeable on the specic characteristics of herbal medicines,including their production and quality control testing. 8. Self-inspection 8.1 At least one member of the self-inspection team should possess a thoroughknowledge of herbal medicines.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 260QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2609. Personnel 9.1 General guidance in relation to personnel involved in the manufacture of medicinal products is given in the parent guide ( 1). 9.2 The release of herbal medicines should be authorized by a person who has been trained in the specic features of the processing and quality control ofherbal materials, herbal preparations and nished herbal products. 9.3 Personnel dealing with the production and quality control of herbal medi- cines should have adequate training in the specic issues relevant to herbal medicines. 10. Training 10.1 The personnel should have adequate training in appropriate elds such aspharmaceutical technology, taxonomic botany, phytochemistry, pharmacognosy,hygiene, microbiology and related subjects (such as traditional use of herbalmedicines). 10.2 Training records should be maintained and periodic assessments of the effectiveness of training programmes should be made. 11. Personal hygiene 11.1 Personnel entrusted with the handling of herbal materials, herbal prepa-rations and nished herbal products should be required to have a high degreeof personal hygiene and to have received adequate training in maintainingappropriate standards of hygiene. The personnel should not work if they haveinfectious diseases or skin diseases. Written procedures listing the basic hygienerequirements should be made available. 11.2 Personnel must be protected from contact with toxic irritants and poten- tially allergenic plant materials by means of adequate protective clothing. Theyshould wear suitable gloves, caps, masks, work suits and shoes throughout thewhole procedure from plant processing to product manufacture. 12. Premises 12.1 As a general principle, premises should be designed, located, constructed,adapted and maintained to suit the operations to be carried out according toGMP ( 1). 12.2 Because of their potential for degradation and infestation with certain pests as well as their sensitivity to microbiological contamination, production,and particularly storage, of herbal materials and herbal preparations assumespecial importance.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 261QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 261Storage areas 12.3 Storage areas should be well organized and tidy. Special attention should be paid to cleanliness and good maintenance. Any accidental spillageshould be cleaned up immediately using methods that minimize the risk of cross-contamination of other materials, and should be reported. 12.4 The set-up of storage areas depends on the type of materials stored. The areas should be well labelled and materials stored in a such a way as to avoidany risk of cross-contamination. An area should be identied for the quarantineof all incoming herbal materials. 12.5 Storage areas should be laid out to permit effective and orderly segrega- tion of the various categories of materials stored, and to allow rotation of stock.Different herbal materials should be stored in separate areas. 12.6 To protect the stored material, and reduce the risk of pest attacks, the duration of storage of any herbal material in unpacked form should be kept toa minimum. 12.7 Incoming fresh herbal materials should be processed, unless specied oth- erwise, as soon as possible. If appropriate, they should be stored between 2 \u00b0Cand 8 \u00b0C, whereas frozen materials should be stored below 18 \u00b0C. 12.8 Where materials are stored in bulk, to reduce the risk of mould formation or fermentation it is advisable to store them in aerated rooms or containers usingnatural or mechanical aeration and ventilation. These areas should also beequipped in such a way as to protect against the entry of insects or animals,especially rodents. Effective measures should be taken to limit the spread ofanimals and microorganisms brought in with the plant material and to preventcross-contamination. 12.9 Herbal materials, even when stored in bre drums, bags or boxes, should be stored off the floor and suitably spaced to permit cleaning and inspection. 12.10 The storage of plants, extracts, tinctures and other preparations may require special conditions of humidity and temperature or protection from light;appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that these conditions are provided,maintained, monitored and recorded. 12.11 Herbal materials, including raw herbal materials, should be kept in a dry area protected from moisture and processed following the principle of \"rst in,rst out\" (FIFO). Production areas 12.12 Production areas should comply with the general requirements of GMP (1). As a rule, campaign work in their processing is necessary. However, if fea- sible, the use of dedicated premises is encouraged. Moreover, the special natureQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 262QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 262of the production of herbal medicines requires that particular attention be given to processing products that generate dust. When heating or boiling of the mate-rials is necessary, a suitable air exhaust mechanism should be employed toprevent accumulation of fumes and vapours. 12.13 To facilitate cleaning and to avoid cross-contamination, adequate pre- cautions should be taken during the sampling, weighing, mixing and process-ing of medicinal plants, e.g. by use of dust extraction and air-handling systemsto achieve the desired differential pressure and net airflow. 13. Equipment 13.1 Processing of herbal materials may generate dust or material which is susceptible to pest-infestation or microbiological contamination and cross-contamination. Effective cleaning of the equipment is therefore particularlyimportant. 13.2 Vacuum or wet-cleaning methods are preferred. If wet-cleaning is done, the equipment should be dried immediately after cleaning to prevent the growthof microorganisms. Cleaning with compressed air and brushes should be usedwith care and avoided if possible, as these methods increase the risk of productcontamination. 13.3 Non-wooden equipment should be used unless tradition demands wooden material. Where it is necessary to use traditional equipment (such as woodenimplements, clay pots, pallets, hoppers, etc.), this should be dedicated, unlessotherwise justied. When such equipment is used, it is advisable that it does notcome into direct contact with chemicals or contaminated material. If the use ofwooden equipment is unavoidable, special consideration must be given to itscleaning as wooden materials may retain odours, be easily discoloured and areeasily contaminated. 14. Materials 14.1 All incoming herbal materials should be quarantined and stored underappropriate conditions that take into account the degradability of herbal mate-rials and herbal preparations. 14.2 Only permitted substances should be used for fumigation, and allowable limits for their residues together with specications for the apparatus usedshould be set according to the national regulations. Reference samples and standards 14.3 The reference standard for a herbal medicine may be a botanical sample of the herbal material; a sample of the herbal preparation, e.g. extract; or aSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 263QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 263chemically dened substance, e.g. a known active constituent, a marker sub- stance or a known impurity. The reference standard should be of a qualityappropriate to its purpose. If the herbal medicine is not described in a recog-nized pharmacopoeia, a herbarium sample of the flowering or fruiting top ofthe whole medicinal plant or part of the medicinal plant (e.g. if the whole med-icinal plant is a tree) should be available. All reference standards should bestored under appropriate conditions to prevent degradation. Their expiryand/or revalidation date should be determined and indicated. 15. Documentation 15.1 The general principles for documentation are set out in the parent guide-lines ( 1). Specications 15.2 The specications for herbal starting materials, for herbal preparations and nished herbal products are primarily intended to dene the quality rather thanto establish full characterization, and should focus on those characteristicsfound to be useful in ensuring safety and efcacy. Consistent quality for herbalmedicines (nished herbal products) can only be assured if the starting herbalmaterials are dened in a rigorous and detailed manner. In some cases moredetailed information may be needed on aspects of collection or agricultural pro-duction. For instance, the selection of seeds, conditions of cultivation and har-vesting are important aspects in producing a reproducible quality of herbalmedicines ( 7). Their characterization (which also includes a detailed evaluation of the botanical and phytochemical aspects of the medicinal plant, manufactureof the herbal preparation and the nished herbal product) is therefore essentialto allow the establishment of specications which are both comprehensive andrelevant. 15.3 For this reason, in addition to the data called for in ( 1), the specications for herbal materials should as far as possible include, as a minimum, the fol-lowing information: 15.4 Herbal materials The family and botanical name of the plant used according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and the authority, i.e. the reference to the orig-inator of the classication, e.g. Linnaeus). It may also be appropriate to addthe vernacular name and the therapeutic use in the country or region of originof the plant. Details of the source of the plant, such as country and/or region (also state and province, if applicable) of origin, whether it was cultivated or collectedfrom the wild and, where applicable, method of cultivation, dates and QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 264QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 264conditions of harvesting (e.g. whether there was extreme weather), collection procedures, collection area, and brand, quantity and date of pesticide appli-cation, as required by the WHO Guideline on good agricultural and collec- tion practices (7). Whether the whole plant or only a part is used. In the latter case, which part of the plant is used and its state, e.g. whole or reduced. For dried plant mate-rial, the drying system should be specied, if applicable. A description of the plant material based on visual (macroscopic) and/or microscopic examination. Suitable identity tests including, where appropriate, identication tests (such as TLC or other chromatographic ngerprint) for known active ingredientsor markers. A reference sample should be available for identication purposes. Details of the assay, where appropriate, of active constituents or markers. Limit tests such as dry residue of liquids, ash value (total ash, and ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid), water-soluble extractives, moisture/watercontent and loss on drying (taking into account the presence of essential oilsif any). Suitable methods for the determination of possible pesticide contamination and the acceptable limits for such contamination in herbal materials or herbalpreparations used in the manufacture of herbal medicines. Tests for toxic metals and for likely contaminants, foreign materials and adulterants. Tests for fungal and/or microbiological contamination, fumigant residues (if applicable), mycotoxins, pest-infestations, radioactivity and their acceptablelimits. Other appropriate tests (e.g. particle size, swelling index and residual solvents in herbal preparations and biological ngerprints such as inducedfluorescent markers). 15.5 Specications for starting materials (and also of primary or printed pack- aging materials) should include, if applicable, reference to a pharmacopoeialmonograph. 15.6 If the herbal material for processing does not comply with its quality spec- ications, the rules that apply for its rejection, and to storage and disposal ofthe rejected herbal material should be included. 15.7 Starting materials derived from or comprising genetically modied organ- isms should comply with existing national or international regulations and thelabel should include this information. Chemical protection of herbal materialsshould be in accordance with national and/or international regulations ( 7). 15.8 Qualitative and quantitative information on the active ingredients or con- stituents with known therapeutic activity in herbal materials and herbal prepa-rations should be given as described in subsection 17.5 (labelling).SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 265QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 26515.9 Finished herbal products Tests for microbiological contamination and tests for other toxicants. Uniformity of weight (e.g. for tablets, single-dose powders, suppositories, capsules and herbal tea in sachets), disintegration time (for tablets, capsules,suppositories and pills), hardness and friability (for example, uncoatedtablets), viscosity (for internal and external fluids), consistency (semisolidpreparations), and dissolution (tablets or capsules), if applicable. Physical appearance such as colour, odour, form, shape, size and texture. Loss on drying, or water content. Identity tests, qualitative determination of relevant substances of the plants (e.g. ngerprint chromatograms). Quantication of relevant active ingredients, if they have been identied, and the analytical methods that are available. Limit tests for residual solvents. 15.10 The control tests and specications for the nished herbal product should be such as to allow the qualitative and quantitative determination of themain active constituents. If the therapeutic activity of constituents is known,these constituents should be indicated in the documentation. If such substancesare not known (e.g. because they are part of a complex mixture), the con-stituents useful for assessing the quality should be identied as markers. In bothcases, the assay (i.e. quantitative determination) specications should bedened. When the therapeutic activity of the constituents cannot be determinedquantitatively, specications should be based on the determination of markers. 15.11 If either the nal product or the herbal preparation contains several herbal materials and a quantitative determination of each active ingredient isnot feasible, the mixture of several active ingredients may be determined. Theneed for such a procedure should be justied. 15.12 The concept of different acceptance criteria for release versus shelf-life specications applies to nished herbal medicines only and not to herbal mate-rials and herbal preparations. Adequate retest periods should be established forthe latter. Examples where this may be applicable include assay and impurity(degradation product) levels. 15.13 Herbal preparations The specications of herbal preparations consist, depending on the preparation in question, of the relevant items of the specications for herbal materials or fornished herbal products as outlined above. Processing instructions 15.14 The processing instructions should describe the different operations to be performed on the plant material, such as drying, crushing, milling and sifting.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 266QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 266They should also include the time and, if applicable, temperatures required in the drying process, and the methods to be used to control fragment or particlesize. Instructions on removing foreign matters and other unwanted materialsshould also be given. 15.15 The drying conditions chosen should be appropriate to the type of plant material processed. These depend on both the character of the active ingredi-ents (e.g. essential oils) and the type of plant part collected (e.g. root, leaf orflower). Drying by direct exposure to sunlight, if not specically contraindi-cated, is possible, but drying on the ground should be avoided. If the plantshould be processed fresh, without drying, the reasons and criteria determiningthe use of fresh material should be stated. 15.16 For the production of processed extracts, the instructions should specify details of any vehicle or solvent that may be used, the durations and tempera-tures needed for extraction, and any concentration stages and methods that maybe required. 15.17 The permissible environmental conditions e.g. temperature, humidity and standard of cleanliness, should be stated. 15.18 Any treatment, such as fumigation, used to reduce fungal or micro- biological contamination or other infestation, together with methods of deter-mining the extent of such contamination and potential residues, should bedocumented. Instructions on the conduct of such procedures should be avail-able and should include details of the process, tests and allowable limits forresidues together with specications for apparatus used. 15.19 Steps in the processes of blending and adjustment to reach dened con- tents of pharmacologically active constituents should be clearly documented. 15.20 The rules that apply to the disposal of spent herbal material after pro- cessing should also be elaborated. 16. Good practices in production 16.1 To ensure not only the quality, but also the safety and efcacy of complexproducts of biological origin such as herbal medicines, it is essential that thesteps in their production are clearly dened. Selection of the rst production step covered by these guidelines 16.2 For medicinal plants--which are either cultivated or collected from the wild, and which may be used in crude form or subjected to simple processingtechniques (such as cutting or comminuting)--the rst critical step of their pro-duction, i.e. where the application of these guidelines starts, should be clearlydesignated. The rationale for this designation should be stated and documented.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 267QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 267Guidance is provided below. However, for processes such as extraction, fermentation and purication, this rationale should be established on a case-by-case basis. Collection/cultivation and/or harvesting of medicinal plants should follow other relevant guidance such as the WHO Guideline on good agriculture and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants (7) or a national guideline. Generally, postharvest processing including primary cutting is (or should be) covered by GACP . If further comminuting is carried out in the manufactur-ing processing, it should be covered by GMP , or by these supplementaryguidelines. If cutting and comminuting considerably reduce the probabilityof detection of adulteration or mix-up of herbal materials, application ofthese supplementary guidelines may be extended to encompass these steps. When the active ingredient, as dened in the Glossary, consists exclusively of comminuted or powdered herbs, application of these guidelines starts atthe physical processing following primary cutting and comminuting, andincludes packaging. When herbal extracts are used, the principles of these guidelines should apply to any production step following postharvest processing. In the case of nished herbal products manufactured by fermentation, appli- cation of GMP should cover any production step following primary cuttingand comminuting. Particular attention should be given to the introductionof cells from a cell bank into the fermentation process. General considerations 16.3 Materials should be handled in a fashion that is not detrimental to the product. On arrival at the processing facility, the herbal material should bepromptly unloaded and unpacked. During this operation, the herbal materialshould not come into direct contact with the soil. Moreover, it should not beexposed directly to the sun (except in cases where this is a specic requirement,e.g. sun-drying) and it should be protected from rain and microbiological contamination. 16.4 Attention should be paid to \"classication\" of clean area requirements taking into account the possible high degree of initial microbial contaminationof herbal materials. Classication of premises as applied to sites for the pro-duction of other pharmaceutical substances may not be applicable to process-ing of herbal materials. Specic and detailed requirements should be developedto cover microbial contamination of equipment, air, surfaces and personnel, andalso for rest rooms, utilities, ancillary and supporting systems (e.g. water andcompressed air). 16.5 Care should be taken to choose cleaning methods appropriate to the char- acteristics of the herbal materials being processed. Washing dried herbal mate-rials with water is generally inappropriate. When it is necessary to clean them,QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 268QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 268an air duster or air shower should be employed. In cases when immersion of herbal materials in water or other appropriate agents (such as disinfectants) forcleaning is unavoidable (e.g. to eliminate suspected coliform bacteria), it shouldbe kept to a minimum. 16.6 The presence of plant materials from different species and varieties, or dif- ferent plant parts should be controlled during the entire production process toavoid contamination, unless it is assured that these materials are equivalent. 16.7 If time limits are specied in the master production instructions, these limits should not be exceeded, to ensure the quality of intermediates and nished products. The less is known about the constituents responsible for thetherapeutic activity, the more strictly this rule should be obeyed. Such timelimits, however, may be inappropriate when processing to achieve a target value(e.g. drying to a predetermined specication) because completion of processingsteps is determined by in-process sampling and testing. Mixing of batches and blending 16.8 Herbal medicines with constituents of known therapeutic activity are often standardized (i.e. adjusted to a dened content of such constituents). Themethods used to achieve such standardization should be documented. If anothersubstance is added for these purposes, it is necessary to specify, as a range, thequantity that may be added. Blending different batches of a specic herbal material (e.g. before extraction) or by mixing different lots of similar herbalpreparations may also be acceptable. Records should be maintained to ensuretraceability. The blending process should be adequately controlled and docu-mented and the blended batch should be tested for conformity with establishedspecications where appropriate. 16.9 Batches should be mixed only if it can be guaranteed that the mixture will be homogeneous. Such processes should be well documented. 16.10 Out-of-specication batches of herbal medicines should not be blended with other batches for the purpose of meeting specications, except for stan-dardization of the content of constituents with known pharmaceutical thera-peutic effect. Every batch incorporated into the blend should have beenmanufactured using an established process and should have been individuallytested and found to meet appropriate specications prior to blending. 16.11 Where particular physical attributes of the material are critical, blending operations should be validated to show uniformity of the combined batch. Val-idation should include testing of critical attributes (e.g. particle size distribu-tion, bulk density and tap density) that may be affected by the blending process. 16.12 The expiry date of the blended batch should be chosen according to the date of manufacture of the oldest batch in the blend.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 269QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 26917. Good practices in quality control 17.1 General 17.1.1 The personnel of quality control units should have the necessary exper- tise in herbal medicines to enable them to carry out identication tests and rec-ognize adulteration, the presence of fungal growth or infestations and lack ofuniformity in a consignment of herbal materials. 17.1.2 The quality control of the herbal material, herbal preparations and n- ished herbal products should establish their quality but does not imply thecontrol of every single constituent. 17.2 Sampling 17.2.1 Because herbal materials are an aggregate of individual plants and/ ordifferent parts of the same plant and thus have an element of heterogeneity, sam-pling should be carried out with special care by personnel with the necessaryexpertise. 17.2.2 Further advice on sampling and visual inspection is given in the WHO document Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials (6). 17.3 Testing 17.3.1 The identity and quality of herbal material, herbal preparations and of nished herbal products should be tested as described in the Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials (6). The minimum requirement for the technical equipment is for instruments to perform the tests described in ( 6). Moreover, each country should develop this basic requirement for technicalequipment further, according to the country's needs. 17.3.2 Herbal material, herbal preparations (including extracts) and nished herbal products can be categorized as follows: (a) the active constituents are identied, and may be quantied as such; (b) the main group of components which contribute to the activity (i.e. the constituents with known therapeutic activity) are known and can be quan-tied as a total (e.g. essential oils) or calculated using a representative sub-stance belonging to the group (e.g. fl avonoids); (c) the former are not identied and/or not quantiable, but marker sub- stances are; (d) others, where quantication (i.e. specication for a certain quantity of a constituent) is not applicable or feasible. 17.3.3 Identication methods may be based on:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 270QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 270 physical and, if applicable, (organoleptic) and microscopic and/or chemical reactions. 17.3.4 The identication test methods should be specic for the herbal mater- ial, herbal preparation or nished herbal product and ideally should be capableof discriminating between the required herbal material and potential substitutesor adulterants that are likely to occur. The identication methods used forgroups a and b should be capable of detecting the said active ingredients andat least the main ingredients should be stated on the label. For group c, the ana-lytical procedure should be based on characteristic constituents, if any. 17.3.5 Reference samples of herbal materials should be made available for use in comparative tests, e.g. visual and microscopic examination and chromatography. 17.3.6 Quantitative determination of known active components for members of groups a and b and of markers for members of group c is necessary. 17.3.7 The development and execution of quality control methods for herbal materials, herbal preparations and the nished herbal products should be in linewith subsection 15.1 (Specications). Tests and quality requirements that arecharacteristic of the given analyte should be selected. 17.3.8 Particularly for herbal materials in group d and for nished herbal prod- ucts containing such materials, characteristic chromatograms (and/or nger-print chromatograms) may be applicable. Using these methods may ensure thatthe main constituents can be easily followed throughout the production process.Caution is necessary, however, for every delivery of herbal materials and everybatch of herbal preparations (including extracts) will have slightly differentchromatograms/ngerprints resulting from differences in chemical composi-tions caused by intrinsic or extrinsic factors. 17.4 Stability studies 17.4.1 If the expiry date for a herbal material or herbal preparation is given,some stability data to support the proposed shelf-life under the specied storageconditions should be available. Stability data are always required to support theshelf-life proposed for the nished herbal products. 17.4.2 Finished herbal products may contain several herbal materials or herbal preparations, and it is often not feasible to determine the stability of each activeingredient. Moreover, because the herbal material, in its entirety, is regarded asthe active ingredient, a mere determination of the stability of the constituentsSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 271QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 271with known therapeutic activity will not usually be sufcient. Chromatography allows tracing of changes which may occur during storage of a complex mixtureof biologically active substances contained in herbal materials. It should beshown, as far as possible, e.g. by comparisons of appropriate characteristic/n-gerprint chromatograms, that the identied active ingredient (if any) and othersubstances present in the herbal material or nished herbal product are likewisestable and that their content as a proportion of the whole remains within thedened limits. 17.4.3 The ngerprint methods used for the stability studies should be as similar as possible to those used for quality control purposes. 17.4.4 For identied active ingredients, constituents with known therapeutic activity and markers, widely used general methods of assay, and physical andsensory or other appropriate tests may be applied. 17.4.5 To determine the shelf-life of nished herbal products, strong emphasis should also be placed on other tests in subsection 15.1 (Specications), such asmoisture content, microbial contamination and general form controltests. 17.4.6 The stability of preservatives and stabilizers should be monitored. When these are not used, alternative tests should be done to ensure that the productis self-preserving over its shelf-life. 17.4.7 Samples used for stability studies should be stored in the containers intended for marketing. 17.4.8 Normally the rst three commercial production batches should be included in the stability-monitoring programme to conrm the expiry date.However, where data from previous studies, including pilot batches, show thatthe product is expected to remain stable for at least two years, fewer than threebatches can be used. The testing frequency depends on the characteristics of the herbal medicinal products and should be determined on a case-by-casebasis. 17.4.9 The protocol for ongoing stability studies should be documented. This would normally involve one batch per year being included in a stability-monitoring programme. 17.5 Packaging materials and labelling 17.5.1 All packaging materials, such as bottles and other materials, should be stored properly. Controls on the issue and use of these packaging materials should be adequate to ensure that incorrect labels and cartons are notused.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 272QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 27217.5.2 All containers and closures should be thoroughly cleaned and dried before being used to pack the products. 17.5.3 There should be adequate information on the label (or the package insert) to inform the users of the composition of the product (in addition to thebrand name, if any), indications or actions, directions for use, cautions andadverse reactions if any, and the expiry date. 17.5.4 Finished herbal products may contain several herbal materials and/ or herbal preparations. Unless otherwise fully justied, the full quantitative com-position of the herbal ingredients should be stated on the product label. If thisis not possible, at least the main ingredients should be stated on the label whilethe full qualitative composition could appear on the package insert. 17.5.5 The qualitative and quantitative particulars of the active ingredients in herbal materials and herbal preparations should be expressed in the followingways: For herbal materials and herbal preparations consisting of comminuted or powdered herbal materials: (a) the quantity of the herbal material must be stated or, if constituents with known therapeutic activity are unidentied, the quantity of the herbalmaterial/herbal preparation should be stated; or (b) the quantity of the herbal material/herbal preparation should be given as a range, corresponding to a dened quantity of constituents withknown therapeutic activity (see examples). Examples:SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 273(a) Name of the active ingredient or active plant materialsQuantity of constituent Valerianae radix 900 mg (b) Name of the active ingredient or active herbal materialsQuantity of constituent Sennae folium 415-500 mg, corresponding to calculated as sennoside BQAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 273 For herbal preparations produced by steps, which exceed comminution, the nature and concentration of the solvent and the physical state of the extractshould be given. Furthermore, the following should be indicated: (a) the equivalent quantity or the ratio of a herbal material to herbal prepa- ration must be stated if therapeutic activity of the constituents isunknown (this does not apply to fatty or essential oils); or (b) if the therapeutic activity of the constituents is known, the quantity of the herbal preparation may be given as a range, corresponding to adened quantity of the constituents with known therapeutic activity (seeexamples). Examples:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 274(a) Name of the active substance or active herbal materialsQuantity of constituent Valerianae radix 25 mg dry ethanolic extract (8:1) or 125 mg ethanolic (96% v/v) extract, equivalent to 1000 mg of Valerianae radix other ingredient gm 05-02 nirtxeD (b) Name of the active substance or active herbal materialsQuantity of constituent Sennae folium 100-130 mg dry ethanolic (96% extract (8:1), to 25 mg of hydroxyanthracene glycosides, calculated as sennoside B other ingredient gm 05-02 nirtxeD 17.5.6 The composition of any solvent or solvent mixture used and the physi- cal state of the extract should be identied. 17.5.7 If any other substance is added during the manufacture of the herbal preparation to adjust the level of constituents of known therapeutic activity, orfor any other purpose, the added substance(s) should be described as such orQAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 274as \"other ingredients\" and the genuine extract as the \"active ingredient\". However, where different batches of the same extract are used to adjust con-stituents with known therapeutic activity to a dened content or for any otherpurpose, the nal mixture should be regarded as the genuine extract and listedas the \"active ingredient\" in the unit formula.

Scope of these guidelines These guidelines are intended to complement those already available for pharmaceutical products ( 1, 2) as well as those for sterile pharmaceutical products ( 3). The regulatory procedures necessary to control radiopharmaceutical prod- ucts are in large part determined by the sources of these products and themethods of manufacture. Manufacturing procedures within the scope of theseguidelines include: The preparation of radiopharmaceuticals in hospital radiopharmacies. The preparation of radiopharmaceuticals in centralized radiopharmacies. The production of radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear centres and institutes or by industrial manufacturers. The preparation and production of radiopharmaceuticals in positron emis- sion tomography (PET) Ready-for-use radioactive products. 2. Radionuclide generators.3. Non-radioactive components (\"kits\") for the preparation of labelled com- pounds with a radioactive component (usually the eluate from a radionu-clide generator). 4. Precursors used for radiolabelling other substances before administration (e.g. samples from patients). Radiopharmaceutical products include inorganic compounds, organic compounds, peptides, proteins, monoclonal antibodies and fragments, andQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2761Guidelines on good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products.

Principles Radiopharmaceuticals must be manufactured in accordance with the basic prin-ciples of good manufacturing practices (GMP). The matters covered by theseguidelines should therefore be considered as supplementary to the generalrequirements for GMP previously published ( 1, 2) and relate specically to the production and control of radiopharmaceuticals. In the preparation of theseguidelines, due consideration was given to national or international radiationsafety guidelines ( 4). Because of their short half-lives, many radiopharmaceuticals are released and administered to patients shortly after their production, so that qualitycontrol may sometimes be retrospective. Strict adherence to GMP is thereforemandatory. 3. Personnel 3.1 The manufacturing establishment, whether a hospital radiopharmacy, cen-tralized radiopharmacy, nuclear centre or institution, industrial manufacturer orPET centre, and its personnel should be under the control of a person who hasa proven record of academic achievement together with a demonstrated level ofpractical expertise and experience in radiopharmacy and radiation hygiene.Supporting academic and technical personnel should have the necessary post-graduate or technical training and experience appropriate to their function. 3.2 Personnel required to work in radioactive, clean and aseptic areas should be selected with care, to ensure that they can be relied on to observe the appro-priate codes of practice and are not subject to any disease or condition thatcould compromise the integrity of the product. Health checks on personnelshould be requested before employment and periodically thereafter. Anychanges in personal health status (e.g. in haematology) may require the tempo-rary exclusion of the person from further radiation exposure. 3.3 Only the minimum number of personnel required should be present in clean and aseptic areas when work is in progress. Access to these areas shouldbe restricted during the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, kits or sterile set-ups. Inspection and control procedures should be conducted from outside theseareas as far as possible. 3.4 During the working day, personnel may pass between radioactive and non- radioactive areas only if the safety rules of radiation control (health physicscontrol) are respected.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 277QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2773.5 The release of a batch may be approved only by a pharmacist or a person with academic qualications ofcially registered as a suitably qualied person,and with appropriate experience in the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals. 3.6 To ensure the safe manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals, personnel should be trained in GMP , the safe handling of radioactive materials and radiationsafety procedures. They should also be required to take periodic courses andreceive training to keep abreast of the latest developments in their elds. 3.7 Training records should be maintained and periodic assessments of the effectiveness of training programmes should be made. 3.8 All personnel engaged in production, maintenance and testing should follow the relevant guidelines for handling radioactive products and be moni-tored for possible contamination and/or irradiation exposure. 4. Premises and equipment 4.1 As a general principle, buildings must be located, designed, constructed,adapted and maintained to suit the operations to be carried out within them.Laboratories for the handling of radioactive materials must be specially designedto take into consideration aspects of radiation protection in addition to clean-liness and sterility. Interior surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings) should be smooth,impervious and free from cracks; they should not shed matter and should permiteasy cleaning and decontamination. Drains should be avoided wherever possi-ble and, unless essential, should be excluded from aseptic areas. 4.2 Specic disposal systems should be mandatory for radioactive effluents. These systems should be effectively and carefully maintained to prevent conta-mination and exposure of personnel to the radioactive waste both within andoutside the facility. 4.3 Sinks should be excluded from aseptic areas. Any sink installed in other clean areas should be of suitable material and be regularly sanitized .Adequate precautions should be taken to avoid contamination of the drainage system withradioactive effluents. 4.4 Lighting, heating, ventilation and, if necessary, air-conditioning should be designed to maintain a satisfactory temperature and relative humidity to ensurethe comfort of personnel working in protective clothing. Buildings should be ina good state of repair. The condition of the buildings should be reviewed reg-ularly and repairs carried out when and where necessary. Special care should beexercised to ensure that building repair or maintenance operations do not com-promise products. Premises should provide sufcient space for the operationsto be carried out, allowing an efcient flow of work and effective communica-tion and supervision. All buildings and rooms should be clean, sanitary and freefrom radioactive contamination.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 278QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2784.5 Ventilation of radiopharmaceutical production facilities should meet the requirement to prevent the contamination of products and the exposure ofworking personnel to radioactivity. Suitable pressure and airflow patternsshould be maintained by appropriate isolation/enveloping methods. Air-handling systems for both radioactive and non-radioactive areas should be ttedwith alarms so that the working personnel in the laboratory are warned of anyfailure of these systems. 4.6 Dedicated facilities and equipment should be used for the manufacture of any radiopharmaceutical product derived from human blood or plasma. Auto-claves used in production areas for radiopharmaceuticals may be placed behinda lead shield to minimize the radiation exposure of the operators. Such auto-claves should be checked for contamination immediately after use to minimizethe possibility of cross-contamination by radioactivity of the products in thenext autoclave cycles. 4.7 All containers of radiopharmaceutical substances, regardless of the stage of manufacture, should be identied by securely attached labels. Cross-contamination should be prevented by the adoption of some or all of the following measures: \u2014 processing and lling in segregated areas; \u2014 avoiding the manufacture of different products at the same time, unless they are effectively segregated; \u2014 containing material transfer by means of airlocks, air extraction, changing clothes and careful washing and decontamination of equipment; \u2014 protecting against the risks of contamination caused by recirculation of untreated air, or by accidental re-entry of extracted air; \u2014 using \"closed systems\" of manufacture;\u2014 taking care to prevent aerosol formation;\u2014 using sterilized containers. 4.8 Positive pressure areas should be used to process sterile products. In general, any radioactivity should be handled within specically designed areasmaintained under negative pressures. The production of sterile radioactiveproducts should therefore be carried out under negative pressure surroundedby a positive pressure zone ensuring that appropriate air quality requirementsare met. 4.9 Separate air-handling units should be used for radioactive and nonradioac- tive areas. Air from operations involving radioactivity should be exhaustedthrough appropriate lters that are regularly checked for performance. 4.10 Pipework, valves and vent lters should be properly designed to facilitate validated cleaning and decontamination.SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 279QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2795. Production 5.1 Standard operating procedures (SOPs) must be available for all operating procedures and should be regularly reviewed and kept up to date for all man-ufacturing operations. All entries on batch records should be initiated by theoperator and independently checked by another operator or supervisor. 5.2 Specications for starting materials should include details of their source, origin and (where applicable) method of manufacture and of the controls usedto ensure their suitability for use. Release of a nished product should be con-ditional on satisfactory results being obtained in the tests on starting materials. 5.3 Careful consideration should be given to the validation of sterilization methods. 5.4 A wide variety of equipment is used in the preparation of radiopharma- ceuticals. Equipment for chromatography should, in general, be dedicated tothe preparation and purication of one or several products labelled with thesame radionuclide to avoid radioactive cross-contamination. The life span ofcolumns should be dened. Great care should be taken in cleaning, sterilizingand operating freeze-drying equipment used for the preparation of kits. 5.5 A list of critical equipment should be drawn up, including any equipment such as a balance, pyrogen oven, dose calibrator, sterilizing lter, etc., where anerror in the reading or function could potentially cause harm to the patient beinggiven the nal product. These devices should be calibrated or tested at regularintervals and should be checked daily or before production is started. Theresults of these tests should be included in the daily production records. 5.6 Specic equipment for radioactive measurements may be required as well as radioactive reference standards. For the measurement of very short half-lives,national central laboratories should be contacted to calibrate the apparatus.Where this is not possible, alternative approaches, such as documented proce-dures, may be used. 5.7 In the case of labelling kits, freeze drying should be carried out as an aseptic procedure. If an inert gas such as nitrogen is used to ll vials, it must be lteredto remove possible microbial contamination. 5.8 The dispensing, packaging and transportation of radiopharmaceuticals should comply with the relevant national regulations and international guide-lines ( 5). 6. Labelling 6.1 All products should be clearly identied by labels, which must remain per- manently attached to the containers under all storage conditions. An area of thecontainer should be left uncovered to allow inspection of the contents. If theQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 280QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 280nal container is not suitable for labelling, the label should appear on its package. Information on batch coding must be provided to the national and/orregional authorities. 6.2 The labels of radiopharmaceuticals must comply with the relevant national regulations and international agreements. For registered radiopharmaceuticals,the national control authority should approve the labels. 6.3 The label on the container should show:(a) the name of the drug product and/or the product identication code; (b) the name of the radionuclide;(c) the name of the manufacturer or the company and/or the person respon- sible for placing the drug on the market; (d) the radioactivity per unit dose: \u2014 for liquid preparations, the total radioactivity in the container, or the radioactive concentration per millilitre, at a stated date and, if neces-sary, hour, and the volume of liquid in the container; \u2014 for solid preparations, such as freeze-dried preparations, the total radioactivity at a stated date and, if necessary, hour; \u2014 for capsules, the radioactivity of each capsule at a stated date and, if necessary, hour, and the number of capsules in the container; \u2014 where relevant, the international symbol for radioactivity. 6.4 The label on the package should state:(a) the qualitative and quantitative composition; (b) the radioactive isotopes and the amount of radioactivity at the time of dispatch; (c) the route of administration;(d) the expiry date;(e) any special storage conditions;(f) mandatory information related to transport regulations for radioactive materials. 6.5 The leaflet in the package should contain the specic product information and indications for use. This information is especially important for preparationkits (cold kits), and should include: (a) the name of the product and a description of its use; (b) the contents of the kit;(c) the identication and quality requirements concerning the radiolabelling materials that can be used to prepare the radiopharmaceutical, namely: \u2014 the directions for preparing the radiopharmaceutical, including the range of activity and the volume, together with a statement of thestorage requirements for the prepared radiopharmaceutical;SPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 281QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 281\u2014 a statement of the shelf-life of the prepared radiopharmaceutical; \u2014 the indications and contraindications (pregnancy, children, drug reac- tions, etc.) in respect of the prepared radiopharmaceutical; \u2014 warnings and precautions in respect of the components and the pre- pared radiopharmaceutical, including radiation safety aspects; \u2014 where applicable, the pharmacology and toxicology of the prepared radiopharmaceutical, including the route of elimination and the effec-tive half-life; \u2014 the radiation dose that a patient will receive from the prepared radio- pharmaceutical; \u2014 the precautions to be taken by users and patients during the prepara- tion and administration of the product and the special precautions forthe disposal of the container and any unconsumed portions; \u2014 a statement of the recommended use of the prepared radiopharmaceutical and the recommended dosage; \u2014 a statement of the route of administration of the prepared radiophar- maceutical; \u2014 if appropriate for particular kits (i.e. those subject to variability beyond the recommended limits), the methods and specications needed tocheck radiochemical purity. 7. Production and distribution records 7.1 The processing records of regular production batches must provide a com-plete account of the manufacturing history of each batch of a radiopharmaceu-tical, showing that it has been manufactured, tested, dispensed into containersand distributed in accordance with the written procedures. 7.2 Separate records for the receipt, storage, use and disposal of radioactive materials should be maintained in accordance with radiation protection regulations. 7.3 Distribution records should be kept. Since the return of radioactive prod- ucts is not practical, the purpose of recall procedures for such products is toprevent their use rather than an actual return. If necessary, the return of radio-active products should be carried out in accordance with international andnational transport regulations. 8. Quality assurance and quality control 8.1 Radiopharmaceuticals are nearly always used before all quality controltesting (e.g. tests for sterility, endotoxin, radionuclidic purity, etc.) has beencompleted. The implementation of and compliance with the quality assuranceprogramme are therefore essential.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 282QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 2828.2 Quality assurance and/or quality control should have the following princi- pal responsibilities: (a) the preparation of detailed instructions for each test and analysis; (b) ensuring the adequate identication and segregation of test samples to avoid mix-ups and cross-contamination; (c) ensuring that environmental monitoring and equipment and process vali- dation are conducted as appropriate for evaluating the adequacy of themanufacturing conditions; (d) the release or rejection of starting materials and intermediate products;(e) the release or rejection of packaging and labelling materials;(f) the release or rejection of each batch of nished preparation;(g) the evaluation of the adequacy of the conditions under which the starting materials, intermediate products and nished radiopharmaceutical prepa-rations are stored; (h) the evaluation of the quality and stability of the nished products and, when necessary, of the starting materials and intermediate products; (i) the establishment of expiry dates on the basis of the validity period related to specied storage conditions; (j) the establishment and revision of the control procedures and specications; (k) assuming the responsibility for retaining samples of radiopharmaceutical products; (l) assuming the responsibility for keeping adequate records of the distribu- tion of the radiopharmaceutical products. 8.3 Whenever the size of the establishment permits, quality assurance and quality control duties should be organized in separate groups. Quality assuranceshould also include the monitoring and validation of the production process. 8.4 A manufacturer's quality control laboratory should be separated from the production area. The control laboratory should be designed, equipped and ofsuch a size as to be a self-contained entity, with adequate provision for thestorage of documents and samples, the preparation of records and the perfor-mance of the necessary tests. 8.5 The performance of all qualitative and quantitative tests mentioned in the specications for the starting materials may be replaced by a system of certi-cates issued by the supplier of these materials, provided that: (a) there is a history of reliable production; (b) the producer or supplier is regularly audited;(c) at least one specic identity test is conducted by the manufacturer of the nished radiopharmaceutical. 8.6 Samples of the intermediate and nal products should be retained in suf- cient amounts and under appropriate storage conditions to allow repeatedSPECIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 283QAP3 12/16/06 12:13 PM Page 283testing or verication of a batch control. These samples should be kept for an appropriate period in accordance with the shelf-lives of the radioactive com-ponents concerned. However, this may sometimes not be applicable, e.g. forradiopharmaceuticals with a short half-life. 8.7 Sampling procedures may be adapted to the purpose of the sampling, the type of controls being applied, and the nature of the material being sampled(e.g. a small batch size and/or its radioactive content). The procedure shouldbe described in a written protocol. Acknowledgements These guidelines were prepared by the following experts: Mr P .O. Bremer (Norway), Mr C. Fallais (Belgium), Mr K.B.

General The advice provided here extends that given in the \"Provisional guidelines onthe inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers\" ( 1). The objectives of an inspection, as given in the introduction to the guidelines, are: \u2014 to control and enforce compliance with general good manufacturing prac- tices (GMP) ( 2); and \u2014 to authorize the manufacture of specic pharmaceutical products, normally in response to a licensing application. These guidelines are applicable mainly to inspections of the rst type, whether performed as a condition for the issue of a manufacturing licence/authorization,or on a periodic, routine basis. They are essentially concerned with inspectionsof manufacturing and quality control facilities conducted before a marketingauthorization (product licence or registration) for a pharmaceutical product isgranted. 2.

Method verication isconducted where the methods are compendial, to conrm whether the productas compounded can be analysed satisfactorily by the ofcial method. pre-approval batches Pilot or laboratory-scale batches, upon which the application is based, e.g.batches used for pivotal clinical trials and/or those used for bioavailability, bioequivalence and stability studies, and scale-up batches. 3. Objectives Before any application is approved, it is necessary to determine whether allestablishments participating in the manufacture of the nished dosage form arein compliance with GMP and the application commitments. Pre-approvalinspections have the following specic objectives: Evaluation of the establishment's compliance with GMP requirements, par- ticularly regarding proper environment, quality management, personnel,facilities and equipment. Evaluation of the procedures and controls implemented in the manufacture of the product (pre-approval batches), to determine whether they are in con-formity with the application commitments. Audit of the completeness and accuracy of the manufacturing and testing information submitted with the application, and of the conformity of pre-approval batches with planned commercial batches (process validation protocol). The collection of samples for the validation or verication of the analytical methods included in the application.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 286QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 2864. Priorities Pre-approval inspections are considered to be an important part of the appli- cation review and approval process. However, since this represents a consider-able workload, inspections are not normally carried out routinely, but ratheronly in specic cases where non-compliance is possible. Thus inspections maybe required for: \u2014 new chemical entities; \u2014 drugs of narrow therapeutic range, and drugs for serious conditions requir- ing an assured therapeutic response; \u2014 products previously associated with serious adverse effects, complaints, recalls, etc.; \u2014 products that are difcult to manufacture or test, or that are of doubtful stability (and therefore associated with the risk of defects); \u2014 new applicants or manufacturers; and\u2014 applications from manufacturers who have previously failed to comply with GMP or ofcial quality specications. For other applications, the drug regulatory authority will rely on the results of recent inspections of the applicant's or manufacturer's facilities for the produc-tion of dosage forms similar to that of the proposed product. 5. Preparation for the inspection An inspection team should, where possible, include analysts and other special-ists, e.g. in pharmaceutical technology, or if available, persons with expertise inthese elds, when needed. Team members may be assigned to inspect new oper-ations or manufacturing sites associated with product failures. When possible,the analyst involved in the laboratory evaluation of the product under reviewshould participate in the inspection. Pre-approval inspection is often carried outby a single inspector. It is necessary to verify that the applicant holds an appropriate manufac- turing authorization and that manufacturing is carried out in conformity withthat authorization (licence). An essential step in the review of applications is determining whether the commitments made by the manufacturer are reflected in actual practice. Areview of the application information is also important in preparing for inspec-tions of rms or processes with which the inspector is unfamiliar. The drug reg-ulatory authority should provide inspectors with relevant information on theapplication. (Some countries request an additional copy of this information fromapplicants which is forwarded to the inspection team.) The information pro-vided should include a copy of the manufacturing and controls section of theapplication, together with information relating to pre-approval batches.INSPECTION 287QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 287Reasonable efforts should be made to conduct pre-approval inspections at the earliest possible opportunity, since unnecessary delays will prevent the timelyreview of applications. However, in some facilities the development or the man-ufacturing processes may not have been completed. In addition, changes mayhave occurred in the status of the application, e.g. major deciencies in theapplication or the closure of an ancillary facility may affect the need for aninspection. In any case, the timing of the inspection should be coordinatedbetween the inspectorate and the applicant. For the inspection of major new facilities involving many applications, special coordination efforts are often benecial. When desirable, pre-approval inspections should be coordinated with the laboratory scheduled for method validation so as to enable it to participate inthe inspection and in the collection of samples. 6. Carrying out the inspection Emphasis should be placed on the evaluation of the manufacturing process,including data verication and the assessment of compliance with GMP . Theproduction and control procedures described in the application must be com-pared with those used for the manufacture of pre-approval batches. If warrantedby records of past label mix-ups, packaging and labelling control proceduresshould be evaluated. A programme of ongoing stability testing needs to beaddressed. The inspection team will determine whether the application provides the scientic data justifying full-scale production procedures and controls. The validation of pertinent manufacturing procedures, including equipment quali-cation, will also be evaluated. 1However, inspectors should not recommend withholding approval of applications based on a lack of complete full-scale, multiple-batch validation of sterile and non-sterile processes, unless the datasubmitted in the application are found to be of questionable validity or completeness. It should be understood that full-scale validation may be com-pleted after approval of the application, but before shipment of the rst com-mercial batches. Nevertheless, certain data must be included in the applicationto demonstrate that the sterilization or aseptic ll process has been qualied.The inspection team is expected to audit the data to determine their authentic-ity, accuracy and completeness. Investigational products are often produced in facilities other than those used for full-scale production ( 4). These facilities and the associated manufac- turing and control procedures are not routinely inspected unless validation ofthe transfer of the methods from the \"investigational\" facilities to the full-scalefacilities is lacking or questionable. The facilities may be periodically inspectedwhen this is required by national legislation/regulation.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 2881For details of recommended validation programmes, see reference 3.QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 288All suppliers and manufacturers of starting materials used in the formula- tion of pre-approval batches should be identied. The physical characteristicsand specications of the drug substance should be reviewed. This is particularlyimportant for solid oral dosage forms where the physical characteristics of thedrug substance often affect uniformity, dissolution and absorption of the dose. When a pharmaceutical manufacturer replaces the supplier or manufacturer of the drug substance used for the manufacture of the pre-approval batches byanother supplier or manufacturer, the application should include data demon-strating that the dosage forms formulated with the drug substance from the twodifferent sources are equivalent in terms of conformity with established speci-cations, including those given in the application. Specications should also coverthe physical characteristics of the drug substances. The addition of any new drug substance and/or dosage form to a produc- tion environment must be carefully evaluated in terms of its impact on otherproducts already under production. Any changes that may be necessary in thebuilding and facility must be assessed for their effect on overall compliance withGMP requirements. For example, a new toxic, potent or highly sensitizingproduct may require additional measures against cross-contamination, and facil-ities already operating at full capacity may not have adequate space for addi-tional products. The evaluation should also include an assessment of whetherany change in the manufacturing authorization is necessary. Laboratory equipment and procedures must be qualied and validated. Every pre-approval inspection should include an evaluation of laboratory con-trols and procedures, and a review of some of the raw data used to generateresults. The authenticity and accuracy of the data used in the development of atest method should be reviewed. The inspection team should pay special attention to any newly established facilities, newly installed equipment and/or new raw material suppliers. If unap-proved facilities are in use, this should be reported immediately. Inspections ofthese facilities are not normally required. 7. Sample collection and testing The pre-approval inspection may include the collection of samples for valida-tion of the analytical methods. Normally the sample size should be sufcient forthree full analyses. Unless otherwise indicated by the laboratory, samples of thefollowing sizes may be taken, depending on the dosage form of the product: \u2014 tablets and capsules: 300 units of production; \u2014 injections (single component): 100 units of production;\u2014 injections (combination): 100 units of production plus 10 samples of each component; \u2014 oral powders for reconstitution: 10 units of production;\u2014 liquids: 1 litre.INSPECTION 289QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 289It is important to collect, with the samples, the relevant manufacturer's analy- tical documentation, namely a copy of the analytical methods used by theinspected laboratory and the report of the analyses performed by the applicanton the batch sampled. A method validation report may be of some use in betterunderstanding and reproducing the analytical methods. Problems encounteredin the performance of the analyses may be resolved by an exchange of infor-mation between the applicant and the government laboratory. Samples are tested in accordance with methods described in the applica- tion. If there are problems with the methods that require additional informa-tion from the applicant, the laboratory director must review the situation anddecide whether the applicant should be contacted. The written request shouldbe included in the documentation submitted to the review analyst. Each method validation/verication report should contain the following: The identication of the test samples received, a description of the product tested, and conrmation of conformity with the product described in theapplication. The original analytical worksheets with calculations, the results of all tests performed, comments by the analyst(s), associated spectra, chromatograms,etc., and a comparison of the results obtained with the applicant's data andwith the applicable specications. An evaluation of each test performed by the applicant and the laboratory. A recommendation as to whether the methods are acceptable, acceptable only after specied changes have been made, or unacceptable. If samples have not been collected in the course of a pre-approval inspection, the results of the analytical examination of the samples submitted by the appli-cant may nevertheless be used as supporting information. The reserve samples, associated documentation and copies of laboratory reports should be stored in an orderly and retrievable way for a time periodspecied by national regulations. It is usually recommended that all materialshould be kept for a minimum of 3 years or for 1 year after the expiry date ofthe nished product. 8. Follow-up regulatory/administrative decisions The inspectorate (inspection group of the drug regulatory authority) should rec-ommend withholding approval when signicant deviations from GMP require-ments and other application commitments have occurred having an adverseeffect on the product covered by the application. Examples of signicant prob-lems are: Misrepresentation of data or conditions relating to pre-approval batches. Pre-approval batches not manufactured in accordance with GMP . Inconsistencies and/or discrepancies raising signicant questions concerning the validity of the records.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 290QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 290If applications are refused because of signicant non-compliance with GMP , action must be taken to ensure that the necessary corrective measures are taken. The drug regulatory authority is expected to advise the applicant that the inspectorate has recommended withholding approval of the application and givethe reasons for this recommendation.

Inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers1 These guidelines are intended to promote harmonization of pharmaceutical inspection practices among WHO Member States. They are directed to gov-ernment inspectors\u2014particularly those operating within small national regula-tory authorities ( 1)\u2014to assist them in assessing manufacturers' compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) ( 2). They will also be of value to manu- facturers themselves when engaged in self-inspection or audit. They cover inspection of the production and control of nal dosage forms of pharmaceutical products destined for human and veterinary use and of drugsubstances (active pharmaceutical ingredients or bulk drug substances)employed in their manufacture. Within the national context their scope mayneed to be extended since similar regulations are often enforced to control INSPECTION 2911Provisional guidelines on the inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-second report . Geneva, World Health Orga- nization, 1992 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 823), Annex 2.QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 291pharmaceutical and biological products, medical devices, diagnostic products, foods, and food additives. In all cases the same fundamental principles apply. Inspection and licensing of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities on the basis of compliance with GMP are a vital element of drug control. They are also pivotal to the operation of the WHO Certication Scheme on the Qualityof Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce ( 3), which requires an attestation by the competent regulatory authority in the exportingcountry that a given product is manufactured in premises and using operatingpractices that conform with GMP . The guidelines also have relevance in various other contexts, including: self-inspection or internal audit of a factory or a part of it carried out by per- sonnel of the company; Inspection by an independent person or group of persons as a review of the quality system of a company in compliance with the standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9000-9004 ( 4)) or the British Standards Institution (BS 5750 ( 5)) or with other equivalent national standards; audit of a manufacturer or supplier by authorized agents of the customer. The government inspectorate represents the enforcement arm of the national drug regulatory authority. Its function is to ensure adherence by manufacturersto all licensing provisions and specically to GMP . The objectives are to controland enforce general standards of production and to provide authorization for the manufacture of specic pharmaceutical products. The rst objectiveinvolves a sequential examination of production and control activities on thebasis of the GMP guidelines issued by WHO or of nationally determinedrequirements. The second requires verication that production and qualitycontrol procedures employed in the manufacture of specic products are per-formed correctly and that they accord with data supplied in the relevant licens-ing applications. Inspection will, of course, depend on national legislation and regulations and/or the resources available. The role of the inspector Inspectors should have previous training and practical experience in the man-ufacture and/or quality control of pharmaceutical products. Graduate pharma-cists, chemists, or scientists with an industrial background in pharmaceuticalproduction would qualify for consideration. In-post training should include an element of apprenticeship gained by accompanying experienced inspectors on site visits as well as participation incourses and seminars on relevant subjects including modern pharmaceuticaltechnology, microbiology, and the statistical aspects of quality control.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 292QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 292The primary responsibility of an inspector is to present a detailed factual report on standards of manufacture and control applied to specic products.However, inspection should not be limited to compilation of an inventory offaults, irregularities, and discrepancies. Provided it is in keeping with nationalpolicy and does not breach understandings regarding condentiality of infor-mation having commercial value, advice may be offered on how production andcontrol procedures can be usefully upgraded. An inspector should always beexpected, for example, to offer advice on how to improve an in-process test procedure or to offer other assistance which, in his or her opinion, serves thepublic interest. An inspection should be regarded as an opportunity to assistand motivate a manufacturer to comply with GMP and to correct any specic deciencies. The inspection process The planning, organization, method of work, and format of the resultant reportshould always be determined by the precise objective of the inspection. Inspec-tions vary in nature according to the objective: Routine inspection This is a full inspection of all applicable components of GMP and licensing pro-visions. It may be indicated when the manufacturer: \u2014 is newly established; \u2014 requests renewal of a licence to operate;\u2014 has introduced new product lines or new products, or has made signicant modications to manufacturing methods or processes, or has made changesin key personnel, premises, equipment, etc.; \u2014 has a history of non-compliance with GMP;\u2014 has not been inspected during the last 3-5 years. Concise inspection Manufacturers with a consistent record of compliance with GMP through previous routine inspections are eligible for concise inspection. The focus of aconcise inspection is on a limited number of GMP requirements selected as indi-cators of overall GMP performance, plus the identication of any signicantchanges that could have been introduced since the last inspection. Collectively,the information obtained will indicate the overall attitude of the rm towardsGMP . Evidence of unsatisfactory GMP performance observed during a conciseinspection should trigger a more comprehensive inspection.INSPECTION 293QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 293Follow-up inspection (reassessment or reinspection) Follow-up visits are made to monitor the result of corrective actions. They are normally carried out from 6 weeks to 6 months after the initial inspection,depending on the nature of the defects and the work to be undertaken. Theyare limited to specic GMP requirements that have not been observed or thathave been inadequately implemented. Special inspection Special visits may be necessary to undertake spot checks following complaintsor recalls related to suspected quality defects in products. Reports of adversedrug reactions may also indicate that all is not well. Such inspections may befocused on one product, a group of related products, or specic operations suchas mixing, sterilization, or labelling. Special visits may also be made to establish how a specic product is man- ufactured as a prerequisite for marketing approval or issuance of an export certicate. A further reason for special visits is to gather specic information on\u2014or to investigate\u2014specic operations and to advise the manufacturer of regulatoryrequirements. Quality systems review A quality systems review is a relatively new concept. Its purpose is to describea quality assurance system that has been shown to operate satisfactorily. It entailsa description of the quality system and the standards to be observed, normallyin a manual containing a statement of the manufacturer's policy on quality assur-ance. It should also dene the management structure needed to implement thepolicy, along with the procedures in each management area needed to ensurethat adequate quality standards are set for the product, manufacturing processesare correctly dened, records are kept, and quality control and other qualityassurance activities are carried out. Frequency and duration of inspections The frequency and duration of visits should be determined by the type of inspec-tion required as well as by the workload and number of inspectors. New man-ufacturing establishments must be inspected before they are licensed, and newfacilities must be inspected before production is started. For all companies, inspections should be carried out on a regular schedule, ideally annually. For large companies marketing a wide range of products, the inspection of the site may be split up into several visits over a longer period, e.g. 5 years whereQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 294QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 294this is the period of validity of the manufacturing licence or the GMP certicates. The length of a given inspection is determined by the size of the company and the purpose of the visit. It can extend from a few days to 2 weeks or more.The time taken also depends on the number of inspectors assigned to the visit.In many countries, visits are made by one (or more) inspectors, sometimesaccompanied by a specialist when production of biologicals, sterile productionareas, or other special facilities are to be examined. Preparing for the inspection Drug inspection begins at the desk of the inspector. A review should be madeof the documents relating to the company to be visited, available from the drugregulatory authority. These may include the manufacturing licence, the market-ing authorization dossiers for leading products, reports of adverse drug reac-tions, complaints and recall records, the results of regulatory (surveillance)testing, and the previous inspection reports. Company documents, including the annual report for the shareholders, the complaints le, and self-inspection/internal audit reports, are valuable sourcesof information. The last of these, depending on national legislation, may be with-held from the inspector. In some countries, a compromise is reached, thecompany presenting the internal audit reports to the inspector for general infor-mation after the latter's own report has been nalized. In any case, it should bepossible to verify the frequency of self-inspections, and to which parts of theplant they have been applied. Conduct Announced inspections cover regular visits to evaluate new plants and new pro-duction lines and to decide on the renewal of a licence. Unannounced inspections are necessary for concise, follow-up, and special visits. In certain countries regular inspections are unannounced as a matter of policy. The visit usually begins with a meeting between the inspector(s), repre- sentatives of the company or plant management, and those responsible for theproducts or areas to be inspected. Credentials should be presented, letters ofauthority inspected, and an explanation given of why the inspection is beingcarried out. It is advantageous for the company to appoint at least one \"escort\" who is directly involved in the preparation of the products that are the object of the inspection. Escorts should be chosen who are generally familiar with thequality systems of the company and who are involved in the self-inspection programme.INSPECTION 295QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 295The meeting may be followed by a perusal of the company's documents by the inspector or by a walk-through visit, or both. This will permit the inspectorto nalize the plan for the inspection. It is recommended that the inspector bothdevelops and follows this plan independently, rather than accepting guidancefrom company management. Some basic rules for conducting the inspection areas follows: Inspection should follow the original plan as far as possible; items that are specic to certain areas of the facility, such as in-process testing and workingdocuments, may need to be checked at the point of operation. Care shouldbe taken to cover activities such as water production, sample storage, andvalidation. It is advisable to follow production flow from reception of the starting mate- rials to the shipment of the nished products. The frequency of recalls andreturn of goods should be carefully noted. Documents such as master formulae, test specications, standard operating procedures, and batch records (including protocols of analyses, etc. and doc-uments relating to the control of printed materials and labelling operations)require close verication. Without prejudice to the need to verify documentation, it is essential that the inspection be based largely on observation and cover the total working hoursof the manufacturer. It is recommended that the inspector start the plant touras soon as possible after arrival. Inspectors can protably use a short checklist to ensure that all areas of operations have been investigated. A very detailed checklist developed fromGMP guidelines is of use specically for the training of inspectors. Experiencehas shown that rigid adherence to a too-detailed checklist can lead to possibleoverlooking of vulnerable areas of a quality assurance system specic to thecompany/plant under investigation. For an experienced inspector, knowledgeof the manufacturer's weak points allied with intuition may serve better than achecklist. Different checklists may be found in the recommended publicationsand documents listed in Appendix 1. Stability testing programme . The inspector should be satised that there exists a documented ongoing programme specifying the regular withdrawal ofsamples of all products from the production line for stability testing. The testingschedule for stored samples should employ appropriate conditions of tempera-ture and light stress, and suitable stability-indicating analytical methods thatyield conclusions consistent with claimed shelf-life. The systems should permitreevaluation of product stability following any changes in the manufacturingprocess or formula. Signicant changes in facilities, equipment, products, and senior personnel since the last inspection should be noted. The principle here is that changes rep-resent possible areas of weakness or causes of non-compliance with GMP . Forexample, new equipment may require changes to be made in procedures; newQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 296QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 296product lines may require new product master les; and departures of senior personnel such as the quality control manager may result in behavioural or pro-cedural changes. Occasionally, an inspector may require access to other premises, documents, or information on the company. Ideally, the inspector's authority should bedetermined by legislation, but in the absence of clear legal or regulatory provi-sions, it is suggested that the GMP code is used as a guide and the inspectorshould have the right to verify compliance with every requirement listed in thecode. The inspector should not be concerned about information not covered by GMP\u2014e.g. nance and personnel\u2014where this does not infringe on thecompany's responsibilities or staff education and training. Photographs or videos taken during the visit may be excellent illustrative material for the report. National legislation should stipulate that the inspectorhas the right to take visual records during the inspection to document the pro-duction premises or laboratories. In many cases, an aerial photograph of the manufacturing site, possibly with surrounding grounds, may be obtained from the company together with otherrelevant materials for inclusion in the report. Collecting samples . It is normal practice during the visit for the inspector to take samples for testing by the ofcial quality control laboratory. Samples areusually taken from released products (e.g. from the nished-goods warehouse)but may also be taken from stocks of raw materials or in-process material. Inorder to protect sample integrity, any protocol meant for enforcement or legalpurposes should set out the procedures for sample collection, analysis, and doc-umentation. The following should be stated: \u2014 name(s) of the sampled product(s), batch number(s), date, source, number of samples, and remarks on type of packaging and storage conditions; \u2014 circumstances of sampling, e.g., suspected quality defects, routine surveil- lance, verication of compliance with GMP; \u2014 instructions for the placing of seals on containers of sample materials;\u2014 written conrmation of the receipt of the samples by the inspector (possi- bly together with the manufacturer's certicates of analysis and any othersupporting documents). The manufacturer, represented by the company escort, should be encouraged to take duplicate samples from the same batch(es), for \"in-house\" testing if aproblem is later identied. Before the inspector leaves the premises after the inspection, a nal discus- sion with company management is recommended. If possible, the inspectorshould list any unsatisfactory ndings and outline any irregularities or otherobservations to which management may wish to respond.INSPECTION 297QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 297Report It is recommended that reports be divided into four parts: general information on the company or manufacturing facility, description of the inspection, obser-vations, and conclusions. Annexes may contain supporting information (a listof products manufactured, an organization chart, the annual company report,photographs, etc.). The third and fourth parts may be combined. Appendix 2,which is an extract from a document prepared for the Pharmaceutical Inspec-tion Convention, provides an example of the form and content of the inspec-tor's report. In order to save the inspector's time, the rst part of the report containing basic data may be supplied by the company beforehand, provided that this factis clearly stated in the report and the information supplied is veried by theinspector during the visit. An example of items that should be considered forinclusion is given in Appendix 2, section C, \"Site master le\". The second part should describe the complete progress of the inspection step by step, documenting which parts of the factory, warehouses, laboratories,records, documents, etc. were inspected. The third part is devoted to observations. Changes, improvements, and examples of deterioration since the previous inspection should be noted by theinspector. Positive observations should take the form of a description of the processes that the rm is carrying out particularly well and that may be considered exam-ples of particularly good manufacturing practice. Negative observations (non-compliance with GMP requirements) should distinguish between whether the defect lies in the system itself or in a failure tocomply with the system. For instance, when cleaning is found to be suboptimal,it is important to know whether the standard operating procedures are inade-quate or lacking, or whether adequate written procedures exist but are not beingfollowed by personnel. In the nal part of the report, the inspector should summarize deciencies, unsatisfactory practices, etc. (listed in decreasing order of importance), suggestcorrective actions, and make recommendations. This part, together with thethird part, should be discussed with the company management and responsibleauthorized persons at the end of the inspection. A copy of the complete written report, after supervisory approval, should be provided to the company management with a covering letter. The correctiveactions to be taken, together with a time limit for their execution, should alsobe presented to the management of the company. Inspection reports may be treated as condential documents depending on national legislation. Under certain international agreements, reports may beexchanged between drug regulatory authorities.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 298QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 298Regulatory actions Depending on national legislation, regulatory authorities may take action to correct unsatisfactory practices and prevent the distribution of products withsuspected quality defects or manufactured under conditions that do not complywith GMP requirements. In extreme cases, the closing down of operations maybe required. In practice, these measures are used only in exceptional cases con-stituting a hazard to health. In many countries, the drug regulatory authority has the legal power to suspend or revoke the marketing authorization for a product when the manu-facturer does not comply with GMP . In addition, manufacturing or marketingauthorizations (licences), the reregistration of products, and the issue of a vari-ation licence or a GMP certicate may be delayed until appropriate measureshave been taken by the company, and possibly have been conrmed by rein-spection. As a rule, the manufacturer concerned has the right to appeal. References 1. Guiding principles for small national drug regulatory authorities.

Compliance with these guidelines will ensure that products released for distribution are of the appropriate quality. However,if this is to be realized in practice, it is essential that an established drug regu-latory authority exists in a Member State, which complies at least with the\"Guiding principles for small national drug regulatory authorities\" ( 2). In addition, the holder of a marketing authorization for a pharmaceutical product, or alternatively the (legal) person responsible for the initial marketingof a product, who ideally should be a pharmacist or a pharmaceutical companyauthorized to practise in the Member State, should ensure that the product isonly released for distribution after it has been established that it conforms withthe product specication lodged with the drug regulatory authority. This level of quality should be maintained throughout the pharmaceutical supply system or distribution network. Basic principles of GMP are applicableto wholesale operations and (to some extent) to retail outlets. These principlesmay be summarized as follows: \u2014 only authorized products are distributed; \u2014 a quality system is in place which includes quality policy, quality manage- ment, appropriate analytical controls, self-inspection; \u2014 personnel are quality-conscious, adequately trained and motivated;QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 304QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 304\u2014 premises and equipment are suitable for their intended use, and kept in a good sanitary condition; \u2014 all products are received, stored and handled appropriately (protected against contamination, cross-contamination, mix-ups, environmental factorssuch as heat, severe cold, moisture, light); \u2014 all drug-related operations are performed in accordance with written pro- cedures, are properly supervised and adequately documented; documenta-tion ensures complete traceability of receipt of all materials, quality testingprocesses (if any) and shipping; \u2014 adequate provisions exist to handle complaints, recalls, and returned goods. At the same time, many provisions of the GMP guidelines published by WHO are clearly not addressed to wholesalers and retail pharmacies where specicrules and requirements apply. These rules are determined partly by pharma-ceutical science and common sense, and partly by national (regional) regulationsand standards. In this context reference is made particularly to the guidelinesentitled \"Good pharmacy practice in community and hospital pharmacy settings\" ( 3). It follows then that the \"Provisional guidelines on the inspection of pharmaceutical manufacturers\" ( 4), which are directed to government GMP inspectors, are not adequate to cover inspection in the distribution system. Thepresent document addresses this specic issue. These guidelines are intended for use by pharmaceutical inspectors in national drug regulatory authorities. They are therefore presented in a formatthat will allow for easy reference in the eld. They should, however, be adaptedby national drug regulatory authorities to suit their national legal requirementsand available resources. This document discusses the \"simplied\" situation when there is a single authority, the drug regulatory authority, where all kinds of drug inspections arelocated, ranging from those of drug manufacture to the inspections of pharma-cies. In reality, these tasks, requiring different inspection skills, are usually dis-tributed among different (national and local) authorities. General considerations A comprehensive system to assure the safety, efcacy and quality of pharma-ceutical products at a national level has the following elements: Legal: drug legislation Administrative: \u2014 drug regulatory authority with functions of product registration, licens- ing of manufacturers, importers and distributors (wholesale, retail andfor institutional supply), inspection and independent testing of samples; \u2014 enforcement.INSPECTION 305QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 and norms\u2014 guidelines\u2014 independent quality control laboratory(ies). This document focuses on one element\u2014inspection\u2014and in particular on inspection in the pharmaceutical supply system. The usefulness of drugs in the treatment of ailments, diseases and disorders is well recognized and appreciated. It is also recognized that the inappropriateuse of drugs can produce severe toxic effects, some of which may be fatal.National drug laws have therefore been introduced to reduce risks associatedwith the use, misuse and abuse of pharmaceutical preparations. Drugs differ in the severity of their side-effects and toxicity and these dif- ferences are taken into consideration in the classication of drugs in nationaldrug laws. Drugs may be classied into four types as follows: over-the-counterdrugs, pharmacy-only drugs, prescription-only drugs and prohibited drugs. The distribution, supply, import, export, sale, storage, advertisement and dispensing of drugs are normally regulated by national drug laws, which providefor a system of licences to be issued by a drug regulatory authority for suchdrug-related activities. The drug laws may identify a ministry/department/agency that would function as the drug regulatory authority as well as providefor the enforcement of the drug laws, using a system of inspections organizedthrough an inspectorate(s). The inspectorate advises on whether applicants and premises should be issued licences to engage in drug-related activities. The inspectorate ensures thatcounterfeit, spurious and substandard pharmaceutical products are not foundin the national pharmaceutical supply system or outside it, and that licensedpremises and authorized persons adhere to existing laws and regulations. To dothis, the inspectorate gathers information on the working of the drug laws byliaising with other law enforcement agencies and health institutions, includinghealth-care professional associations. Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts. batch A dened quantity of any drug product processed in a single process or seriesof processes such that it can reasonably be expected to be uniform in charac-ter and quality.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 306QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 306batch number1 A distinctive combination of numbers and/or letters which specically identi- es a batch on the labels, the batch records, the certicate of analysis, etc. controlled drugs Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances regulated by provisions of nationaldrug laws. counterfeit pharmaceutical product A pharmaceutical product which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelledwith respect to identity and/or source. Counterfeiting can apply to bothbranded and generic products and counterfeit products may include productswith the correct ingredients, with the wrong ingredients, without active ingre-dients, with an insufcient quantity of active ingredient or with fake packaging. drug (pharmaceutical product) Any substance or mixture of substances that is manufactured for sale or distri-bution, sold, supplied, offered for sale or presented for use in: (i) the treatment, mitigation, cure, prevention or diagnosis of disease, an abnormal physical state or the symptoms thereof and abnormal physio-logical conditions in human or animal; or (ii) the restoration, correction or modication of organic functions in human or animal. nished pharmaceutical product A pharmaceutical product that has undergone all stages of production andquality control, including being packaged in its nal container and labelled. good manufacturing practice1 Good manufacturing practice is that part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled to the qualitystandards appropriate to their intended use and as required by the marketingauthorization. good pharmacy practice The practice of pharmacy aimed at providing and promoting the best use ofdrugs and other health care services and products, by patients and members ofthe public. It requires that the welfare of the patient is the pharmacist's primeconcern at all times.INSPECTION 3071As 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 307over-the-counter drugs These are drugs that can be sold from licensed dealers without professional supervision and without prescriptions. These drugs are suitable for self-medication for minor diseases and symptoms. pharmacist A pharmacist is a holder of a degree or diploma in pharmacy from a recognizedhigher institution of learning and is registered or licensed to practise pharmacy. pharmacy-only drugs These are drugs authorized to be sold only in licensed pharmacies under thesupervision of licensed and registered pharmacists; they may be sold without aprescription. poison A preparation or substance dened by a national drug law as a poison. prescription-only drugs These are drugs supplied only in licensed pharmacies on the presentation ofsigned prescriptions issued by a licensed and registered medical practitioner,licensed and/or registered dentist (for dental treatment only), and/or licensedand/or registered veterinarian (for animal treatment only), and the supply anddispensing of these drugs must be carried out by a pharmacist or under thesupervision of a pharmacist. Prescription drugs are further subdivided into con-trolled drugs (narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances) and non-controlleddrugs. product recall Product recall is a process for withdrawing or removing a pharmaceuticalproduct from the pharmaceutical distribution chain because of defects in the product or complaints of serious adverse reactions to the product. The recallmight be initiated by the manufacturer/importer/distributor or a responsibleagency. prohibited drugs These are drugs with toxicity or side-effects that outweigh their therapeutic use-fulness, so that public health and welfare are protected by prohibiting their pro-duction, manufacture, export, import, trade, distribution, supply, possession oruse, except in amounts required for medical and scientic research. Prohibiteddrugs are normally determined by the national or supranational registration/licensing authority.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 308QAP4 12/16/06 308quality assurance1 Quality assurance is a wide-ranging concept covering all matters that individu- ally or collectively influence the quality of a product. It is the totality of thearrangements made with the object of ensuring that pharmaceutical productsare of the quality required for their intended use. quality control Quality control covers all measures taken, including the setting of specic-ations, sampling, testing and analytical clearance, to ensure that raw materials,intermediates, packaging materials and nished pharmaceutical productsconform with established specications for identity, strength, purity and othercharacteristics. unauthorized market (in some countries called parallel market) The unauthorized market consists of wholesale establishments and retail outletsdistributing or selling drugs without authorization from a competent authority. 1. Drug inspectors 1.1 Qualications Inspectors should normally be pharmacists who have working experience incommunity and/or hospital pharmacy. Where persons other than pharmacistsare employed as drug inspectors, they should be adequately experienced in drugcontrol affairs and suitably trained in inspectorate functions. The possibility ofhaving part-time inspectors with specialist knowledge as part of inspectionteams should also be considered. The inspector should possess the following attributes: \u2014 good knowledge of pharmacy, drugs, and poisons \u2014 good knowledge of the laws and regulations to be enforced\u2014 good command of technical terms and excellent communication skills\u2014 awareness of the probable methods of using forged or false documents for transactions in pharmaceutical preparations and skill in determining thegenuineness of documents presented for examination \u2014 maturity, honesty and integrity\u2014 responsible conduct which commands respect\u2014 willingness to accept challenges\u2014 ability to organize their own work with minimum supervision\u2014 ability to assess facts quickly and take rational and sound decisions without delay \u2014 ability to assess character and honesty of persons being interviewedINSPECTION 3091As dened in 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 309\u2014 good public relations image with key personnel/pharmacists in charge of premises while remaining rm, fair and resolute \u2014 ability to hold discussions with company management at the completion of inspection \u2014 ability to motivate others\u2014 commitment to hard work and long hours\u2014 ethical approach to any potential conflict of interest. 1.2 Organizational aspects Inspectors should be embedded in an organization, usually called an inspec-torate, which ensures the following aspects: A job description which describes the duties of the inspector. Proper reporting: inspectors should report either to the drug regulatory authority or to the pharmaceutical department (chief pharmacist) of the ministry of health. Uniformity of approach: (a) Regular meetings of inspectors, in which experiences on the job are exchanged, will help promote a uniform approach to inspection as wellas enhance the performance of the inspectors. (b) Inspectors should work according to a work plan and to standard oper- ating procedures (SOPs). (c) Inspection reports should preferably be in three or four parts: (i) date of inspection and general information on the establishment inspected, (ii) description of the inspection activities undertaken, including ana- lytical data of samples taken, (iii) observations and recommendations,(iv) conclusions. (d) Inspectors should be encouraged to submit weekly reports of work to headquarters. Total coverage of the country. This can be achieved by: (a) dividing the country into dened areas for the purpose of inspection and placing an inspector in charge of a dened area for the purpose ofinspecting wholesale, community and hospital pharmacies, and clinics, (b) inspection of ports and border posts in a dened area. Total coverage of the eld. The inspector will be expected to inspect establishments such as:(a) pharmaceutical manufacturers in respect of drug distribution,(b) pharmaceutical importers/exporters,(c) pharmaceutical wholesalers and retailers,(d) hospital pharmacies/clinics,(e) ports international border posts,QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 310QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 310(f) drug warehouses, stores and unauthorized markets. ( Note : The exis- tence of unauthorized markets for the distribution of drugs poses con-siderable health hazards. The inspectors should, with the assistance oftask forces if necessary, investigate the extent of the unauthorizedmarket, the types of drugs distributed and supplied, and the sources ofthe drugs. Where possible, unauthorized markets for drugs should beprohibited through effective inspectorate activities. Inspectors shouldalso investigate the sources of supply of suspect counterfeit or sub-standard pharmaceutical products.) Cooperation with other agencies. The inspector will be expected to interact and cooperate with other interested parties such as:(a) industrial, community and hospital pharmacists,(b) management and supervisory staff of pharmaceutical establishments and hospitals, (c) medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians, nurses and midwives and other health workers, (d) public analysts,(e) ministry of justice ofcials and court ofcials,(f) drug law enforcement ofcers including the police and customs,(g) ofcers of port authorities, clearing agents at the ports, importers and exporters, (h) members of the public,(i) staff of faculties of medicine/pharmacy,(j) foreign drug regulatory authorities. Independence. Inspectors should, for example, have the use of ofcial vehicles. Adherence to a code of inspection. 1.3 Methods of inspection The inspector uses different methods to check compliance with the national, supranational or international drug laws and regulations. Among thesemethods are: Comprehensive/routine inspection . This form of inspection is generally reserved for a new pharmaceutical establishment, when an establishment isapplying for permit to extend its scope of operations beyond that for whichit was originally licensed, has made important changes in key personnel or ischanging premises, has not been inspected for a long time (3-5 years), orwhen there is information (even of an informal nature) of serious lapses.Where the inspection is for a new establishment or for extension of scope ofoperation or because of changes in key personnel, the inspection should beannounced.INSPECTION 311QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 311Concise inspection . This is reserved for establishments that have previously been inspected with a view to assessing standards of good pharmacy prac-tice. The outcome of the inspection will help in the proper assessment of theestablishment. The inspection may be unannounced. Follow-up inspection . This is normally carried out to ensure that corrective measures have been undertaken following advice and notice given during aprevious inspection. Where a time limit was given for applying the correc-tive measures, the inspection may be unannounced. Special inspection . This is undertaken to deal with specic complaints received about lapses or non-compliance with standards of professional prac-tice. The inspection should preferably be unannounced. Investigative inspection . This type of inspection is used to assess the perfor- mance of a new establishment whose scope of operation was previouslyunknown. Any of these methods may be applied with or without prior announcement. Normally inspections should be announced but it serves a useful purpose toundertake some unannounced inspections. Follow-up, special and investigativeinspections should preferably be unannounced. Inspections should be held regularly. Premises should be inspected at least once every 12-18 months. Where contravention is often noticed, the inspectionshould be more frequent (e.g. every six months). For premises with a goodrecord, less frequent inspections may be needed. 1.4 Reference/information sources The reference/information sources of an inspector should include: Existing national and international drug laws and regulations, covering such aspects as:\u2014 licensing\u2014 GMP\u2014 good distribution practice\u2014 good pharmacy practice\u2014 promotion of pharmaceutical products\u2014 controlled drugs\u2014 counterfeit, spurious or substandard pharmaceutical products. Codes of inspection (national and regional), where in existence. Codes of professional ethics. Health consequences of drug abuse and misuse. Available data on imports/exports/prohibited drugs.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 312QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 3122. Inspection of establishments in the drug distribution chain 2.1 Broad objectives The welfare of patients and other members of the public is of prime concern in the distribution chain of drugs, either manufactured within the country orimported. Inspections of establishments are therefore undertaken to ensure: Protection of patients and members of the public from malpractice by dis- tributors and suppliers of drugs. Adherence to the drug laws and regulations governing compounding, distri- bution, importation, export and storage of drugs. High ethical and professional standards of pharmaceutical practice. 2.2 Establishments In the drug distribution chain several kinds of establishments can be distinguished: \u2014 production sites \u2014 storage or warehouse facilities\u2014 establishments for the supply, sale, dispensing and distribution of drugs, such as pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, ports and stores. 2.3 Inspections When inspecting these establishments the inspector uses the appropriate refer-ences. The method of inspection should be laid down in a SOP which also con-tains the requirements for a specic type of establishment. The inspection SOPmay be in the format of a checklist (see Appendix 1 for an example applicableto most drug distribution establishments). When sampling is part of the inspec-tion procedure, the SOP should contain detailed guidance for the inspector; anexample of this guidance is to be found in Appendix 2. 2.4 Special categories of drugs When special categories of drugs are present the inspector may require a mod-ied SOP . This situation is likely to occur with controlled drugs, pharmaceuti-cal products moving in international commerce, or with counterfeit, spuriousor substandard pharmaceutical products. For this last category, an example ofextra guidance is given in Appendix 3.INSPECTION 313QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 313References 1. Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products.

Appendix 2 Guidance on sampling This guidance is applicable to collecting samples of drugs to be tested by the ofcial quality control laboratory. The collection may be aimed either at assess-ing the quality of products on the market, in which case adequate sampling plansshould apply (see, for example, \"Sampling procedures for industrially manu-factured pharmaceuticals\" ( 1, 2)), or at detecting substandard, spurious and counterfeit pharmaceutical products. In this case sampling shall be based oninformation and may involve conscation of entire stocks to prevent further dis-tribution. Compliance with legal procedures for sample collection, analysis anddocumentation is obligatory. (a) Check that the sample is properly labelled with the following: (i) name of sampled pharmaceutical preparation(ii) batch number(iii) date and source of sample; the original manufacturer's label may be helpful. (b) Check that the records contain the following: (i) number of samples(ii) types of packaging and storage conditions(iii) circumstances of sampling that may include suspected quality defects. (c) Place seals on containers of the samples.(d) Hand over one-third of the samples to the representative of the inspected establishment. (e) Conrm in writing that samples were taken from the premises and have the conrmation countersigned by an appropriate ofcial of the inspectedestablishment (see, for example, the sample receipt form in Appendix 4).INSPECTION 319QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations.

A compendium of guidelines and related materi- als. Volume 1 . Geneva, World Health Organization, 1997. Appendix 3 Guidance for inspection when pharmaceutical productsare suspected to be counterfeit, spurious orsubstandard This section addresses specically the situation in which the inspector suspects counterfeit, spurious or substandard pharmaceutical products to be presentduring an inspection. This may be during either a regular inspection or an inves-tigation aimed at detecting such products. 1. Broad objective The presence of counterfeit, substandard and spurious pharmaceutical prod-ucts in the drug distribution channels may present a danger to public health,and it is imperative that suspect products are effectively and rapidly taken outof the distribution channels and quarantined. In order to facilitate the work ofthe inspector, the help of capable and experienced persons involved in the dis-tribution of products should be obtained on a proactive basis to help identifysuch products. 2. Standard operating procedures (a) A written SOP for inspectors should be drawn up and made available to them. This SOP should include at least the following information: (i) how the suspect product should be isolated to prevent its further distribution (ii) the size of the samples required for testing purposes(iii) the manner in which the samples should be taken(iv) the record-keeping procedure to be followed in recording the details of the action taken (v) the details which should be recorded on the receipt issued for the embargoed product and/or samples taken (vi) the type of materials which should be used for sealing samples or for embargoing or conscating suspect products (vii) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of persons who should be contacted to report on the action takenQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 320QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 320(viii) special precautions to be noted by the person initiating the sam- pling or seizure procedure, with particular reference to correct legalprocedures to be followed (ix) where appropriate, the manner in which the suspect product should be destroyed. (b) Where other persons are involved in the detection of counterfeit pharma- ceutical products they shall operate on the basis of a suitable SOP . In anycase of suspicion of counterfeit pharmaceutical products an inspector shallbe notied immediately. 3. Counterfeit products The following applies specically to counterfeit products: (a) When examining a possible counterfeit pharmaceutical product the inspector shall rst screen the product by looking, smelling, touching andlistening to the sound of the packing and its contents. The inspector shalllook for anything, in particular its labelling and packing, that makes theproduct look different from an original reference sample. A SOP may assistin examining the product in this way. (b) When the organoleptic examination does not give conclusive evidence the inspector shall have a sample tested using appropriate simple screeningmethods, such as the basic tests recommended by WHO or a suitable thin-layer chromatography method. (c) In addition to any full analytical testing, the drug regulatory authority of the country of origin stated on the label of the product may be asked toestablish whether the product is counterfeit. (d) Proven cases of counterfeit pharmaceutical products shall be fully docu- mented and communicated to all other inspectors, to increase their levelof expertise. Information on counterfeit products shall also immediatelybe made available to drug regulatory authorities of other countries con-cerned and to WHO.

In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-sixth report. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2002 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 902), Annex 8.QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 322Background Following the provisional guidelines on the inspection of pharmaceutical man- ufacturers ( 1), the WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceu- tical Preparations acknowledged that additional guidelines concerning nationalinspectorates would be of value in strengthening the implementation of goodmanufacturing practices (GMP) ( 2) and enhancing mutual recognition among inspectorates. A trend has recently become apparent in WHO Member States for non- commercial institutions, such as certication bodies, testing laboratories, etc.,to introduce quality systems principles in their internal operations. The sameprinciples are also being applied by governmental pharmaceutical inspectoratesand drug control laboratories. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention (PIC) published a document (3), with the objective of adapting the standards of the International Organiza- tion for Standardization (ISO) of the 9000 series and related norms ( 4-8) to the activities of the GMP inspectorates of Member States. It is based on EuropeanStandard EN 45012, General criteria for certication bodies operating quality systems certication (9), but was modied for this particular purpose. 1. Introduction These requirements are applicable to quality systems for the operation of inspec- tion services within competent authorities concerned with GMP inspections. Itis intended that each inspection service should use these requirements as thebasis for developing its own quality system. The establishment and operation of a quality system is an essential element in the mutual recognition of national GMP inspections. The willingness toaccept national inspections is signicantly enhanced when it is known that the GMP inspectorate of the competent authority follows uniform proceduresincorporating quality system principles. The quality system should include allthe activities involved in the inspection. 2. Glossary authorized person A person (among key personnel of a manufacturing establishment) responsiblefor the release of batches of nished products for sale ( 10). quality audit An examination and assessment of all or part of a quality system with the spe- cic purpose of improving it. A quality audit is usually conducted by outside or independent specialists or a team designated by the management for thispurpose. Such audits may also be extended to suppliers and contractors ( 2).INSPECTION 323QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 323quality manual A handbook that describes the various elements of the system for assuring the quality of the test results generated by a laboratory (see section 11). quality system An appropriate infrastructure, encompassing the organizational structure, pro-cedures, processes and resources necessary to ensure adequate condence thata product (or service) will satisfy given requirements for quality ( 2). standard operating procedure (SOP) An authorized written procedure giving instructions for performing operations not necessarily specic to a given product or material but of a more generalnature (e.g. equipment operation, maintenance and cleaning; validation; clean-ing of premises and environmental control; sampling and inspection). CertainSOPs may be used to supplement product-specic master and batch produc-tion documentation ( 2). 3. Administrative structure 3.1 The structure, membership and operation of the GMP inspectorate should be such that impartiality is safeguarded. 3.2 The national inspection services are responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the relevant national legislation are satised. 3.3 All personnel employed or used by the GMP inspectorate, including outside inspectors or subcontracted personnel, should not be subject to any commer-cial, nancial or other pressures which might affect their judgement. Theyshould not be under the control of pharmaceutical manufacturers, and must beassessed and licensed. 3.4 The system for obtaining fees should not improperly influence the inspec- tion procedure. Recommended procedure The administrative structure, membership, operation and legal status of theGMP inspectorate should be described in the quality manual (see section 11). The quality manual should show how all personnel working for the GMP inspectorate, including subcontracted staff or advisers, and persons serving oncommittees providing advice, can maintain their impartiality. The GMP inspec-torate should ensure that such persons: (a) are not subject to any commercial, nancial or other pressures which might influence their judgement;QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 324QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 324(b) are not improperly influenced in their inspection of pharmaceutical man- ufacturers or persons assessed; (c) have not been involved in the design or maintenance of inspected facili- ties by way of any consultancy service or commercial arrangement. The remuneration of GMP inspectorate personnel engaged in inspection activ- ities should not depend on the result of such activities or on the granting of amarketing authorization. Only in exceptional cases may GMP inspectorates provide advisory or con- sultancy services. Where the GMP inspectorate does provide such services, itshould develop a code of conduct or dened policy which clearly distinguishesbetween the process of inspection and that of providing an advisory or consul-tancy service to clients. This service should be of benet to all of industry, andnot solely to individual manufacturers. 4. Terms of reference 4.1 The functions of the GMP inspectorate should be clearly dened andshould cover: (a) legal responsibilities; (b) the formulation of policies;(c) an overview of the implementation of its policies;(d) an overview of its nances;(e) as required, the setting up of committees to which dened activities are delegated. Recommended procedure The terms of reference, legal responsibilities and functions of the GMP inspec-torate and the way in which policy guidelines are established should be docu-mented in the quality manual. For any committee established to advise the GMP inspectorate or the chief inspector, the following details should be included: (a) its role and function; (b) the procedure for selecting and appointing the members (the names of the chairperson, secretary and members, their current appointments and the interests, if any, which they represent on the committee, should beavailable); (c) the rules of procedure.INSPECTION 325QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 3255. Organizational structure 5.1 The GMP inspectorate should have an organization that enables it to main- tain the capability to perform its technical functions satisfactorily. 5.2 The GMP inspectorate should have:(a) documentation clearly identifying its legal status; (b) an organizational chart showing clearly the responsibility and reporting structure of the inspectorate and, in particular, the relationship betweenits inspection and authorization (licensing) functions; (c) a description of the means by which the inspectorate obtains nancial support; (d) a description of the relationship between the GMP inspectorate and other departments within the drug regulatory authority and other governmentagencies, where they operate as separate bodies. 5.3 The GMP inspectorate should have and make available a formal statement explaining how the results of inspections are taken into account in granting andmaintaining authorizations (licences). 5.4 The senior management of the GMP inspectorate should make a formal commitment to the recommended principles by ensuring that the quality policyof the inspectorate is documented, relevant to the objectives, and implemented. 5.5 The responsibility, authority and reporting structure of the GMP inspec- torate should be clearly dened and documented (see above) and should be sup-ported by written job descriptions for each member of staff. 5.6 An appropriately experienced, responsible and qualied person ( 2) should be nominated to carry out the quality assurance function, including imple-menting and maintaining the quality system. This person should have directaccess to senior management. If necessary, this task may be assigned to morethan one person. 5.7 The GMP inspectorate should have sufcient resources at all levels to enable it to attain its objectives effectively and efciently. Senior managementshould ensure that all personnel are competent to carry out their assigned duties.They should receive appropriate training that should be documented and itseffectiveness assessed. 5.8 Periodic management reviews of the quality system should be conducted and documented; records of these reviews should be retained for a speciedperiod of time. Recommended procedure The above-mentioned recommendations are intended to ensure a reasonablelevel of transparency, both nationally and internationally.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 326QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 326The organizational chart, source(s) of nance, legal status of the GMP inspectorate and its relationship with the drug regulatory authority and othergovernment agencies should be documented in the quality manual, togetherwith a description of the quality system. 6. Inspection personnel 6.1 The personnel of the GMP inspectorate should be competent to performthe functions that they undertake. 6.2 The GMP inspectorate should maintain information on the relevant quali- cations, training and experience of each inspector. Records of training andexperience should be kept up to date. 6.3 Personnel should have clear, documented instructions specifying their duties and responsibilities. These instructions should be kept up to date. 6.4 When work is subcontracted to an external body or use is made of experts, the inspectorate should ensure that the personnel employed meet the relevantrequirements of the quality system. The liability of third party inspectors shouldbe clearly dened in the contract or agreement. 6.5 The GMP inspectorate should possess the required personnel, expertise and other resources to perform inspections of manufacturers and wholesale dis-tributors to determine whether they comply with the principles and guidelinesof current good practices and with the relevant legislation. 6.6 The staff responsible for inspections should have appropriate qualications, training, experience and knowledge of the inspection process. They should havethe ability to make professional judgements as to the conformity of the inspectedparty with the requirements of good practices and the relevant legislation andbe able to make an appropriate risk assessment. Knowledge of current tech-nology is essential, including computerized systems and information technology. 6.7 The GMP inspectorate should establish a documented system for recruit- ing and training its personnel. The training received and the training needs ofeach member of staff should be regularly reviewed, and individual trainingrecords should be maintained. Recommended procedure The credibility of the GMP inspection process will depend to a large degree onthe technical competence and integrity of the inspectors. The quality manualshould provide up-to-date details of the names, qualications, experience andterms of reference (job description and duties to be performed) of each memberof staff engaged in the GMP inspection process (see also section 10).INSPECTION 327QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 327Formal arrangements should exist for personnel training, and details of these arrangements should be documented. Training undertaken by eachmember of staff engaged in GMP inspections should be documented (see also\"Recommended procedure\" in section 10). A documented procedure for selecting the members of an inspection team and deciding on its size should be available. The inspection team may includea person or persons with specialist knowledge and/or experience of a particu-lar area of technology. If an inspection is carried out on behalf of the GMP inspectorate by an external body or person, the GMP inspectorate should ensure that the externalpersonnel satisfy the relevant requirements contained in these recommenda-tions. GMP inspectors working with or advising the GMP inspectorate should: (a) be academically qualied in a recognized scientic/technological discipline related to pharmaceuticals (normally pharmacy, chemistry or microbiol-ogy); direct personal experience of pharmaceutical manufacture or controlis not a requirement but would be considered as a valuable asset for aninspector; (b) have satisfactorily completed a recognized training course on auditing quality management systems; (c) undergo at least 10 days of training per year (e.g. courses, symposia, con- ferences, etc.); (d) have a competent working knowledge of the WHO guidelines on GMP for pharmaceutical products ( 2) and/or the GMP inspection procedures of the relevant national regulatory authority; (e) have undergone appropriate training in the current procedures and tech- niques of GMP inspections before conducting an inspection alone; (f) have the necessary personal qualities of integrity, tact and character to perform the duties of a GMP inspector. 7. Documentation 7.1 The GMP inspectorate should maintain a system for the control of all doc-umentation relating to GMP inspections of manufacturers and recommenda-tions relating to authorization holders, and should ensure that: (a) the current versions of the appropriate documentation are available at all relevant locations; (b) all revised documents or amendments to documents are correctly autho- rized and processed in a manner which ensures that they are introducedwithout delay; (c) superseded documents are removed from use throughout the GMP inspec- torate and elsewhere in the organization and its agencies, but are retainedfor a dened period of time.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 328QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 3287.2 The GMP inspectorate should ensure that all of its activities are described in SOPs that clearly describe the responsibilities, policy and actions. Theseshould include, but not be limited to, training (introduction, GMP and task-related), inspections, reporting after inspections, handling of complaints,licensing (issue, suspension, revocation), certication, documentation control,planning and handling of appeals. 7.3 Proper and accessible records should be maintained of the activities carried out, including training, as well as the assessment of inspectors after training, thepreparation of inspection reports, the handling of complaints, and the drawingup of authorized checklists (where in use) and other related documents. 7.4 Reports should be prepared on all inspections performed. They should be prepared in the approved format, and signed and dated by the relevantinspector. 7.5 The documentation system should ensure that any changes to documents are made in a controlled manner and are properly authorized. There should bea means of identifying changes in individual documents. Recommended procedure The following information should be included or referred to in the qualitymanual: (a) a list of all the documents used; (b) for each document, the name(s) or position(s) of the person(s) responsi- ble for authorizing its issue and any subsequent amendments or changes; (c) a description of the system whereby relevant documents and subsequent amendments are made available at the appropriate location from the pointof view of the functioning of the inspection process; (d) the method by which amendments and changes are made, so that docu- ments are speedily updated, changes recorded and superseded documentspromptly withdrawn and archived. 8. Records 8.1 The GMP inspectorate should maintain a system of records to suit its par-ticular method of operation and circumstances. It must comply with the rele-vant obligations under national legislation and demonstrate that the qualitysystem is operating satisfactorily. 8.2 Records should be available which demonstrate that all the relevant pro- cedures have been followed in the performance of each GMP inspection, including the initial inspection, the recommendation for issue of a marketingauthorization, routine inspections and corrective action.INSPECTION 329QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 3298.3 All records should be safely stored for an adequate period, and held under conditions that guarantee their security and condentiality, unless otherwiserequired by the national legislation. Recommended procedure The quality manual should describe or refer to separate SOPs which describethe system adopted by the GMP inspectorate for maintaining its records. Themanual should include blank specimen copies of the various checklists, certi-cates and reports used during the inspection process and describe the way inwhich these are processed, stored and archived, and/or disposed of. The procedures for recommending to the authorization holder the issue, suspension or revocation of marketing authorizations should be described. Documented staff instructions on security and on the use and handling of inspection reports should be identied and described in accordance with thecondentiality requirements specied in national legislation. Information as towho should have access to condential information should be given and suchaccess should be controlled. Records associated with inspection activities should be retained for a minimum period of three full inspection cycles or for 6 years, whichever is thelonger. 9. Inspection procedures 9.1 The GMP inspectorate should have the required resources (nancial,human, facilities and others) and documented procedures to enable the inspec-tion of manufacturing operations to be carried out in accordance with therequirements of the WHO guidelines on GMP ( 2) and/or the national GMP guidelines. 9.2 The GMP inspectorate should require the manufacturer to have docu- mented procedures in accordance with a quality management system, and complying with the WHO guidelines on GMP ( 2) and/or the national GMP guidelines. 9.3 The GMP inspectorate should perform regular inspections of the manu- facturing premises, procedures and quality systems of authorization holders atleast once every 2 years in accordance with a written inspection programme.Written inspection reports should be prepared and sent to the national regula-tory authority to keep it informed of the outcome of such inspections. 9.4 The planning of inspections of manufacturers and the assessment of com- pliance with the planning regarding the performance of the different types ofinspections should be documented. The types of inspections should include asa minimum routine inspections, specic inspections, follow-up inspections andconcise inspections.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 330QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 3309.5 The activity of the GMP inspectorate should be described, indicat- ing how it relates to the system(s) for granting manufacturers' and product authorizations. 9.6 The activities relating to post-marketing surveillance and product testing should be described. The description should also cover the process of handlingnon-conforming products (e.g. substandard or counterfeit products). 9.7 The procedure for operations in support of a surveillance sampling pro- gramme should be documented. 9.8 The GMP inspectorate should have the documented procedures and resources to enable the inspection of manufacturing and wholesale distributionoperations to be carried out in accordance with the ofcial guidelines andnational legislation. A formal inspection plan should be followed. All instruc-tions, standards or written procedures, worksheets, checklists and referencedata relevant to the work of the GMP inspectorate should be kept up to dateand be readily available to staff. 9.9 A chief inspector should be appointed to coordinate inspection activities if more than one inspector is involved in an inspection. The lead inspector, whoshould be selected by all the participating inspectors, should normally preparethe inspection report. 9.10 Observations and/or data obtained in the course of inspections should be recorded in a timely manner to prevent loss of relevant information. 9.11 Completed inspections should be reviewed to ensure that the requirements have been met. Recommended procedure The procedures covering initial inspections of new applicants for marketingauthorizations and ongoing inspections of authorization holders should be documented. Manufacturers should be inspected at least every one or 2 years, although new authorization holders should be inspected more frequently until inspectorsare condent that the manufacturers are complying with the WHO guidelineson GMP and/or the national GMP guidelines. The frequency of inspectionshould not normally fall below once every 2 years as lack of continuity may giverise to a reduced awareness of current GMP or allow signicant deciencies todevelop. The time available for undertaking inspections should be adequate to enable sufcient investigations and enquiries to be made to give condence in the nd-ings of the inspection. The report to the authorization holders following GMP inspections should include as a minimum:INSPECTION 331QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 331(a) the name and location of the manufacturing site(s); (b) the date(s) of the inspection(s);(c) the reason for the inspection and the product categories and manufactur- ing areas inspected; (d) the suitability of key personnel, including the authorized person;(e) observations, failures to comply with the WHO guidelines on GMP and/or the national GMP guidelines, and the recommended frequency of reinspection; (f) a recommendation on the issue/continuation, suspension or revocation of the marketing authorization. The GMP inspectorate should have the power, under the national or regional legislation or other arrangements, to require reinspection of a manufacturer'spremises if there are changes in personnel, facilities, internal organization orscope of activity, or if analysis of a complaint or any other information indicatesthat the manufacturer is failing to comply with the requirements of the WHOguidelines on GMP and/or the national GMP guidelines, or with the conditionsimposed by the marketing authorization. 10. Inspection facilities required 10.1 The inspection service should have the required facilities in terms of staff,expertise, equipment and other resources to perform inspections of manufac-turers to determine compliance with the requirements of the WHO guidelineson GMP and/or the national GMP guidelines. This does not preclude the useof external resources, when necessary, provided that the requirements asdescribed for \"subcontracting\" are met (see section 3.3). 10.2 If inspections are carried out on behalf of the GMP inspectorate by an external body or person, the GMP inspectorate should ensure that this body or person satises the requirements specied in section 3.3. A properly documented agreement covering these arrangements, including condentiality aspects and the declaration of any conflict of interests, should bedrawn up. Recommended procedure A sufcient number of competent personnel should support the GMP inspectorate, whether employed or contracted for the functions that they undertake. The quality manual should describe the procedures for the management of the GMP inspectors and of the necessary records. A record should be kept foreach individual employed to carry out GMP inspections (whether an employeeor under contract), which should include the following information:QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 332QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 332(a) the name; (b) the designated area of responsibility within the declared scope of the GMP inspectorate; (c) the educational qualications;(d) the professional qualications, where relevant to the activities of the GMP inspectorate; (e) the work experience;(f) details of the GMP inspector training received, supported by documen- tary evidence of course attendance and assessment results. Where an external body or person carries out a GMP inspection, the quality manual should describe the process adopted by the GMP inspectorate tocomply with the above-mentioned requirements. Whenever an external body or person is used to carry out any function on behalf of a GMP inspectorate, the GMP inspectorate should have documentedevidence to demonstrate that the external body or person concerned is compe-tent to do so. Staff members authorized to carry out audits of external bodies or persons should be identied. Documented agreements with all external bodies or persons should be avail- able for scrutiny. A register of all external bodies or persons employed by the GMP inspec- torate should be maintained. The register should include: (a) the name of the external body or person; (b) the legal status of the external body and details of any relationship with a parent company, group of companies or any other organization of whichthe external body or person is part, with specic reference to possible con-flicts of interest; (c) the names and qualications of all personnel engaged in GMP inspection work for the GMP inspectorate. 11. Quality manual 11.1 The GMP inspectorate should dene and document its policy and objec-tives for, and commitment to, quality in a quality manual. It should ensure thatthis policy is understood, implemented and maintained at all levels in the organization. 11.2 The information contained in the quality manual and procedures should include at least: (a) a quality policy statement; (b) a brief description of the legal status of the GMP inspectorate (see section 4.1(a));INSPECTION 333QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 333(c) a code of ethics and conduct relating to GMP inspection activities; (d) a description of the organization of the GMP inspectorate, including details of any governing board, its constitution, terms of reference andrules of procedure (see section 5.2(b)); (e) the names, qualications, experience and terms of reference of the senior staff and other GMP inspection personnel, both internal and external (seesections 6 and 10); (f) details of training arrangements for inspection personnel (see sections 6 and 10); (g) an organizational chart showing the responsibility and reporting structure of the inspectorate and the allocation of functions stemming from theperson in charge of the GMP inspectorate (see section 5.2(b)); (h) details of the documented procedures for inspecting manufacturers under the WHO guidelines on GMP and/or the national GMP guidelines (seesection 8); (i) details of the documented procedures for recommendations to the autho- rization holder for the issue, suspension or revocation of marketing autho-rizations (see sections 7.2 and 8.1); (j) a list of any subcontractors used for GMP inspections and details of the documented procedures for assessing and monitoring their competence(see section 6); (k) details of appeals procedures (see section 14);(l) a procedure for ensuring that complaints made to the GMP inspectorate are investigated so that any shortcomings of the authorization holders arerevealed (see section 16); (m) a list of those staff members responsible for investigating complaints and those with the authority to take remedial action (see section 16); (n) details of internal quality audits (see section 15);(o) details of testing of samples (see sections 9.6-9.8);(p) the control of non-conforming products (see section 9.6). Recommended procedure In order to keep the quality manual brief, reference may be made to other doc-uments and/or procedures contained in other manuals. 12. Condentiality 12.1 The GMP inspectorate should have adequate arrangements to ensure con-dentiality of the information obtained in the course of its inspection activitiesat all levels of its organization, including committees. 12.2 The exchange of inspection reports between countries should be described. The format and content of reports should be specied.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 334QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 334Recommended procedure The quality manual should describe how the GMP inspectorate discharges its responsibility for ensuring that all communications between itself and the com-panies inspected are kept condential. The following are necessary: (a) instructions to personnel on condentiality; (b) a written undertaking by all personnel not to divulge to third parties any information gained about any business affairs of clients; (c) the inclusion of provisions in all subcontracts to maintain condentiality;(d) provisions to ensure the physical security of all documents and records relating to inspection activities. 13. Publications 13.1 The GMP inspectorate should produce and update, as necessary, a list ofauthorization holders, together with an outline of the scope of the marketingauthorization issued to each manufacturer. The extent to which this list will bedistributed should be specied. 13.2 An outline of the inspection and marketing authorization system should be available in published form. 13.3 Other publications, such as GMP guidelines and other guidelines and information brochures, should be available to industry and other interestedparties, as appropriate. Recommended procedure The quality manual should list the publications issued by the authorizationholder and GMP inspectorate. The following information should also be provided: (a) the name of the person responsible for compiling and updating each publication; (b) the frequency with which each publication is updated;(c) how the publications are distributed and to whom;(d) the procedure for issuing amendments. 14. Appeals 14.1 The GMP inspectorate should have procedures for the consideration ofappeals against its decisions.INSPECTION 335QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 335Recommended procedure Appeals procedures should be established by the GMP inspectorate and should include: (a) the method by which an appeal may be lodged; (b) the method by which an impartial appeals panel, independent of the activ- ity under review, is selected; (c) the names and positions of the members of the GMP inspectorate to whom appeals are referred, and the procedure for handling them; (d) a register of all appeals and their outcome. 15. Internal audit and periodic review 15.1 The GMP inspectorate should implement a system of planned and docu-mented internal audits and periodic reviews of its compliance with the criteriaof these guidelines. 15.2 There should be procedures for corrective and preventive action when- ever faults are detected in the quality system, or in the performance of inspec-tions and the general performance of the inspection service. 15.3 The management of the inspectorate should periodically review the quality system for its continuing suitability and effectiveness. 15.4 Inspectors should be evaluated before being allowed to perform inspec- tions. Periodic reviews should also be undertaken to examine the performanceof individual inspectors in order to ensure consistency among them, and in theoperations and procedures of the GMP inspectorate. 15.5 A record of all audits and reviews should be kept and should include the ndings, conclusions, recommendations and follow-up action. These recordsshould be retained for a specied period of time. Recommended procedure Internal periodic review procedures should be documented. The review pro-cedure should include internal audits by staff competent to ensure that all for-mulated procedures are adhered to. Based on the results of these audits,management must ensure that the GMP inspection system remains effective andthat inspections conducted by different inspectors arrive at similar conclusionswhen the same operation is inspected under the same conditions. Internal audit procedures should state: (a) the names or positions of staff members authorized to conduct internal audits; (b) what is to be examined and how often (a schedule for the examination of the whole organization over a given period should be drawn up);QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 336QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 336(c) how the audit will be conducted; (d) to whom the results will be reported;(e) who will initiate any corrective action. Management reviews should take account of the results of internal audits and should include: (a) consideration of the overall operation of the GMP inspectorate; (b) uncovering defects or irregularities in the operation of the GMP inspec- tion system; (c) ensuring that action has been taken to effectively correct defects revealed in previous reviews and audits. Periodic audit by an experienced person or persons from another national reg- ulatory authority is a useful means of providing an independent review of theGMP inspectorate's operations and procedures. 16. Complaints 16.1 The GMP inspectorate should have documented procedures for dealingwith complaints arising from its activities. 16.2 A record should be maintained of all complaints received and the actions taken by the GMP inspectorate. These records should be retained for a speci-ed period of time. Recommended procedure The GMP inspectorate should require each authorization holder to keep arecord of all complaints received, as well as remedial actions relating to the man-ufacturing activities and products covered by the marketing authorization. The GMP inspectorate should have a procedure for recording and investi- gating complaints received about its inspection activities. The procedure shouldinclude a list of those staff members responsible for investigating complaintsand those with the authority to take remedial action. 17. Recalls 17.1 The GMP inspectorate should have a documented procedure for dealingwith recalls and withdrawals of products from the market. 17.2 Records should be maintained of all recalls and withdrawals registered and dealt with by the inspectorate.INSPECTION 337QAP4 12/16/06 12:14 PM Page 337References 1.

Hazard and risk analysis in pharmaceutical products Application of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) methodology topharmaceuticals 1 1. Introduction Traditionally, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) methodology has been considered to be a food safety management system. Itaims to prevent known hazards and to reduce the risks that they will occur atspecic points in the food chain. The same principles are also increasingly beingapplied in other industries, such as the car industry, aviation and the chemicalindustry. This text provides general guidance on the use of the HACCP system to ensure the quality of pharmaceuticals, while recognizing that the details of itsapplication may vary depending on the circumstances (see Appendix 1). It doesnot provide detailed information on major hazards. Hazards affecting quality are controlled to a certain extent through the val- idation of critical operations and processes in the manufacture of nished phar-maceutical products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).However, GMP do not cover the safety of the personnel engaged in manufac-ture, while both aspects are covered by HACCP . Procedures, including GMP , address operational conditions and provide the basis for HACCP . HACCP is a systematic method for the identication,assessment and control of safety hazards. Such hazards are dened as biologi-cal, chemical, or physical agents or operations that are reasonably likely to cause illness or injury if not controlled. In the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, 2 these may include the manufacture of certain antibiotics, hormones, cytotoxicsubstances or other highly active pharmaceuticals, together with operations 1Application of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) methodology to pharmaceuticals. In: WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-seventh report.Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 908), Annex 7. 2Safety hazards are common in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients; e.g. dangerouschemical conversions such as catalytic hydrogenation or nitration, or handling reactions with extremelyhazardous chemicals such as phosgene or methyl isocyanate require special precaution and controlmeasures.QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 346such as fluid-bed drying and granulation, which are examples of hazard unit operations. The use of inflammable solvents (solutions) and certain laboratory opera- tions may also constitute hazards. The following elements of the HACCP methodology are integral parts of the validation master le: \u2014 development of a flow diagram of the process; \u2014 verication of the flow diagram on site. In addition, HACCP will extend this concept to include an analysis of the crit- ical quality variables as well as the assessment of hazards affecting the safety ofworkers and environmental pollution hazards directly related to the process (inparticular in open systems) concerned. GMP for pharmaceutical products require the validation of critical processes as well as of changes in the manufacturing process which may affectthe quality of the nal product. Experience shows that most manufacturingprocesses contain steps that are \"critical\" from the point of view of variationsin nal product quality. HACCP should not be confused with validation since its approach is broader; it thereby helps to identify matters on which validation should con-centrate. It is science-based and systematic, and identies specic hazards andmeasures for their control, as well as providing information on environmentalprotection and labour safety. HACCP is a tool to assess hazards and establishcontrol systems that focus on prevention rather than relying on corrective actionbased on end-product testing. All HACCP systems are capable of accommo-dating changes, such as advances in equipment design and processing proce-dures or technological developments. HACCP should not replace GMP; however, its application may be used as a rst step towards GMP . In countries where appropriate regulations exist and are enforced, compli- ance with GMP (including validation), drug regulatory activities and inspectionsprovide good assurance that risks are largely controlled. In countries wherecontrol is less effective, however, patients may be put at risk through the production of drugs of inadequate quality. The assessment of individual risksrelated to specic products and starting materials, and the recognition ofhazards at specic stages of production or distribution should permit regula-tory authorities to improve drug control by increasing the effectiveness of theiractivities within the limits of the available resources. The present guidelines are aimed at assisting industry to develop and implement effective HACCP plans covering activities such as research and development, sourcing of materials, manufacturing, packaging, testing anddistribution.HAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 347QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 3472. Links with other programmes In each stage of the manufacture and supply of pharmaceuticals, the necessary conditions should be provided and met to protect the pharmaceuticals concerned. This has traditionally been accomplished through the application of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), GMP and otherguidelines, which are considered to be essential to the development and imple-mentation of effective HACCP plans. HACCP plans are focused on hazards,the overall objective being to ensure that pharmaceuticals are safe for use. Theexistence and effectiveness of GCP , GLP and GMP should be assessed whendrawing up HACCP plans. 3. Denitions The following denitions apply to the terms as used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts. control (noun) The state wherein correct procedures are being followed and criteria are being met. control (verb) The taking of all necessary actions to ensure and maintain compliance with thecriteria established in the HACCP plan. control measure Any action and activity that can be used to prevent or eliminate a pharmaceu-tical quality hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. corrective action Any action to be taken when the results of monitoring at the CCP (see below)indicate a loss of control. critical control point (CCP) A step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminatea pharmaceutical quality hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. critical limit A criterion which separates acceptability from unacceptability. deviation Failure to meet a critical limit.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 348QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 348flow diagram A systematic representation of the sequence of steps or operations used in the production, control and distribution of a particular pharmaceutical.

Validation is the establishment of documented evidence that asystem does what it is supposed to do. verication The application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addi-tion to monitoring, to determine compliance with the HACCP plan. 4. Principles The HACCP system is based on seven principles. In applying these principles,12 stages are recommended and are discussed in section 7. Some stages arelinked to specic principles while others serve as an introduction to the concept. The seven principles are:HAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 349QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 3491. Conduct a hazard analysis. 2. Determine the critical control points (CCPs).3. Establish target levels and critical limit(s).4. Establish a system to monitor the CCPs.5. Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control. 6. Establish procedures to verify that the HACCP system is working effectively. 7. Establish documentation concerning all procedures and keep records appropriate to these principles and their application. 5. Guidelines for the application of the HACCP system The following guidelines will be found useful in applying the HACCP system: Before HACCP is applied to any sector, that sector should be operating in accordance with the principles of good practices and the relevant legislation. Management commitment is necessary if an effective HACCP system is to be implemented. HACCP should be applied to each specic operation separately. CCPs identied in any given example in any reference document (including GMP guidelines) may not be the only ones identied for a specic applica-tion or may be of a different nature. The HACCP application should be reviewed and necessary changes made when any modication is made in the product or process, or in any step. It is important, when applying HACCP , to take into account the nature and size of the operation. There should be a HACCP plan. The format of such plans may vary, but they should preferably be specic to a particular product, process or operation.Generic HACCP plans can serve as useful guides in the development ofproduct and process HACCP plans; however, it is essential that the uniqueconditions within each facility are considered during the development of allcomponents of the HACCP plan. 6. Training and education As HACCP is a relatively new concept in the pharmaceutical industry, trainingof personnel in industry, government and universities in HACCP principles andapplications is essential for its effective implementation. In developing specic training to support a HACCP plan, working instruc- tions and procedures should be drawn up which dene the tasks of the oper-ating personnel to be stationed at each critical control point. Specic trainingshould be provided in the tasks of employees monitoring each CCP .QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 350QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 350Cooperation between producers, traders and responsible authorities is of vital importance. Opportunities should be provided for the joint training ofindustrial staff and the control authorities to encourage and maintain a contin-uous dialogue and create a climate of understanding in the practical applicationof HACCP . The success of a HACCP system depends on educating and training man- agement and employees in the importance of their role in producing safe phar-maceuticals. Information should also be provided on the control of hazards atall stages of production and supply. Employees must understand what HACCP is, learn the skills necessary to make it function properly, and must also be given the materials and equipmentnecessary to control the CCPs. 7. Application The application of HACCP principles consists of the following 12 stages, asidentied in the logic sequence for application of HACCP . 7.1 Assemble a HACCP team The pharmaceutical manufacturer should assure that product-specic knowl-edge and expertise are available for the development of an effective HACCPplan. This may be best accomplished by assembling a multidisciplinary team.Team members should therefore represent all the relevant disciplines, such as research and development, production, quality control, quality assurance,microbiology, engineering and distribution or others as applicable. Team members should have specic knowledge and expertise regarding the product and process. Where such expertise is not available on site, expert adviceshould be obtained from other sources. Team members should be able to: (a) conduct a hazard analysis; (b) identify potential hazards;(c) identify hazards which should be controlled;(d) recommend controls and critical limits;(e) devise procedures for monitoring and verication;(f) recommend appropriate corrective action where deviations occur;(g) verify the HACCP plan. The scope of the HACCP plan should be dened. The scope should describe the segment of the process involved and the classes of hazards to be addressedshould be identied.HAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 351QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 3517.2 Describe the product and process A full description of the product and the process should be drawn up, includ- ing relevant quality information such as the composition, physical/chemicalproperties, structure, pH, temperatures, method of cleaning, bactericidal/bacteriostatic treatments (e.g. heat-treatment), drying, screening, mixing, blend-ing, packaging, and the storage conditions. The method of distribution andtransport should also be described, especially where products are thermolabile. 7.3 Identify the intended use The intended use should be based on the expected uses of the product by theend-user or consumer. In specic cases, vulnerable population groups, e.g. geri-atric patients, infants and immunocompromised patients, may have to be considered. 7.4 Construct a flow diagram The flow diagram should be constructed by the HACCP team, and should coverall operations and decisions in a process. When applying HACCP to a given operation, the steps preceding and fol- lowing that operation should also be considered. A block-type diagram may be sufciently descriptive. 7.5 On-site conrmation of flow diagram The HACCP team should conrm the processing operation against the flow diagram during all stages and hours of operation. Amendments to the flowdiagram may be made where appropriate, and should be documented. 7.6 List all potential hazards associated with each step, conduct a hazard analysis, and consider any measures to controlidentied hazards (Principle 1) When hazard analysis is conducted, safety concerns must be distinguished from quality concerns. The HACCP team should list all the hazards that may be reasonably expected to occur at each step from production, testing and distribution up tothe point of use. It should then conduct a hazard analysis to identify for theHACCP plan which hazards are of such a nature that their elimination or reduc-tion to acceptable levels is essential. A thorough hazard analysis is required to ensure an effective control point. A two-stage hazard analysis is recommended. During the rst stage, the teamshould review the materials, activities, equipment, storage, distribution andQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 352QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 352intended use of the product. A list of the potential hazards (biological, chemi- cal and physical) which may be introduced, increased or controlled in each stepshould be drawn up. In the hazard analysis, the following should be included wherever possible: \u2014 the probable occurrence of hazards and the severity of their adverse health effects; \u2014 the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the presence of hazards;\u2014 the survival or multiplication of microorganisms of concern;\u2014 the production or persistence in drugs of toxins, chemicals or physical agents; \u2014 the conditions leading to the above. During the second stage, a hazard evaluation should be conducted, i.e. the sever- ity of the potential hazards and the probability of their occurrence should beestimated. The team should then decide which potential hazards should be addressed in the HACCP plan, and what control measures, if any, exist that can be appliedfor each hazard. More than one control measure may be required to control aspecic hazard(s) and more than one hazard may be controlled by a speciedcontrol measure. Potential hazards in relation to at least the following should be considered: \u2014 materials and ingredients; \u2014 physical characteristics and composition of the product;\u2014 processing procedures;\u2014 microbial risk of mix-ups. Examples of common failures are given in Appendix 2. 7.7 Determine critical control points (Principle 2) A CCP in the HACCP system can be more easily determined by the use of a decision-tree, which facilitates a logical approach. The way that a decision-treeis used will depend on the operation concerned, e.g. production, packing, repro-cessing, storage, distribution. Training in the use of decision-trees should begiven. If a hazard has been identied at a step where control is necessary for safety, and no control measure exists at that step, or any other, the product or processHAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 353QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 353should be modied at that step, or at an earlier or later stage, to include such a control measure. 7.8 Establish critical limits for each CCP (Principle 3) Critical limits must be specied and veried, if possible, for each critical controlpoint. More than one critical limit may sometimes be elaborated at a particularstep. The criteria used often include measurements of temperature, time, mois-ture level, pH, and sensory parameters, such as visual appearance and texture.Critical limits should be scientically based. 7.9 Establish a monitoring system for each CCP (Principle 4) Monitoring is the scheduled measurement or observation of a CCP relative toits critical limits. Monitoring should be recorded. The monitoring procedures used must be able to detect loss of control at the CCP , and this information should ideally be available in time to make adjust-ments to ensure control of the process and prevent violations of the criticallimits. Where possible, process adjustments should be made when the moni-toring results indicate a trend towards loss of control at a CCP . These adjust-ments should be made before a deviation occurs. Data derived from monitoring must be evaluated by a designated person with the knowledge and authority to carry out corrective actions when indicated. If monitoring is not continuous, the amount or frequency of monitoring must be sufcient to guarantee that the CCP is under control. Most monitoring procedures for CCPs will need to be done rapidly because they relate to on-line processes and there will not be time for lengthy analyticaltesting. For this reason, physical and chemical measurements are often preferredto microbiological tests because they can be done rapidly and can often indicate the microbiological control of the product. The personnel conducting the monitoring of CCPs and control measures should be engaged in production (e.g. line supervisors, maintenance staff) and,where appropriate, staff from quality control. They should be trained in moni-toring procedures. Where continuous monitoring is possible, a reliable monitoring procedure and frequency should be identied. Statistically designed data collection or sam-pling systems should then be used. All records and documents associated with monitoring CCPs must be signed and dated by the person(s) carrying out the monitoring and by a respon-sible reviewing ofcial(s) of the company.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 354QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 3547.10 Establish corrective actions (Principle 5) Specic corrective actions should be developed for each CCP in the HACCP system in order to deal with deviations when they occur. These actions shouldensure that the CCP is brought under control. Corrective actions should includeat least the following: (a) determination and correction of the cause of non-compliance; (b) determination of the disposition of the non-compliant product;(c) recording of the corrective actions that have been taken. Specic corrective actions should be developed in advance for each CCP and included in the HACCP plan. As a minimum, this plan should specify what isto be done when a deviation occurs, who is responsible for implementing thecorrective actions, and that a record will be kept and maintained of the actionstaken. Individuals who have a thorough understanding of the process, productand HACCP plan should be assigned the responsibility for the oversight of cor-rective actions. As appropriate, experts may be consulted to review the information avail- able and to assist in determining the disposition of non-compliant product.Actions taken must also include the proper disposition of the affected product. Deviation and product disposition procedures must be documented in the HACCP records. 7.11 Establish verication procedures (Principle 6) Procedures should be established for verication. Verication and auditing methods, procedures and tests, including random sampling and analysis, can be used to determine whether the HACCP systemis working correctly. The frequency of verication should be sufcient toconrm the proper functioning of the HACCP system. Examples of verication activities include: \u2014 review of the HACCP system and its records; \u2014 review of deviations and product dispositions;\u2014 conrmation that CCPs are kept under control. Initial verication of the HACCP plan is necessary to determine whether it is scientically and technically sound, that all hazards have been identied, andthat, if the HACCP plan is properly implemented, these hazards will be effec-tively controlled. Information reviewed to verify the HACCP plan should include: (a) expert advice and scientic studies; (b) in-plant observations, measurements and evaluations. For example, veri- cation of the moist heat sterilization process for sterile injectables shouldinclude the scientic justication of the heating times, pressure and HAZARD AND RISK ANALYSIS IN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 355QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 355temperatures needed to obtain an appropriate destruction of pathogenic microorganisms (i.e. enteric pathogens) and studies to conrm that thesterilization conditions ensure that the whole load is kept at the requiredtemperature for the time required. Subsequent verications should be performed and documented by a HACCP team or an independent expert, as needed. For example, verications may beconducted when there is an unexplained system failure, a signicant change inproduct, process or packaging occurs, or new hazards are recognized. In addition, a periodic comprehensive evaluation of the HACCP system by an unbiased, independent third party is useful. This should include a technicalevaluation of the hazard analysis and each element of the HACCP plan as wellas an on-site review of all flow diagrams and appropriate records of the opera-tion of the plan. Such a comprehensive verication is independent of other ver-ication procedures and must be performed in order to ensure that the HACCPplan is resulting in the control of the hazards. If the results of the comprehen-sive verication identify deciencies, the HACCP team should modify theHACCP plan as necessary. Individuals doing verication should have appropriate technical expertise to perform this function. Where possible, verication should include actions to conrm the efcacy of all elements of the HACCP plan. 7.12 Establish documentation and record keeping (Principle 7) Efcient and accurate documentation and record keeping are essential to theapplication of a HACCP system and should be appropriate to the nature andsize of the operation. Examples of activities for which documentation is required include: \u2014 hazard analysis; \u2014 CCP determination;\u2014 HACCP plan;\u2014 critical limit determination. Examples of activities for which records are required include:\u2014 CCP monitoring activities; \u2014 process steps;\u2014 associated hazards;\u2014 HACCP PHARMACEUTICALS 356QAP5 12/16/06 12:15 PM Page 356Appendix 1 Illustrative examples of major industrial hazards thatmay form part of a HACCP plan The increasing use of hazardous chemicals in industry and trade further influ- ences the quality and safety of processes and the personnel responsible for pro-duction. It is important that both on-site and off-site safety should be consideredin all projects involving the storage and use of such chemicals. This Appendix is intended only as a reminder of the major hazards that may be associated with the production, control and distribution of pharmaceuticals.Other relevant literature should be consulted, depending on the type of phar-maceuticals concerned (e.g. active pharmaceutical ingredients, vaccines). 1. Explosions and res Explosions can cause damage to buildings, injuries to personnel and hazards to products. Types of explosions that should be considered include detonations,gas and dust explosions, and conned and unconned vapour-cloud explosions.Because of the possibility of explosions and res, industry is required to controloperations to prevent such hazards. An appropriate hazard-control systemshould therefore be in place at each site where such hazards are identied. 2. Workers' safety 3. External environment3.1 Hazardous waste3.2 Spillage Appendix 2 Examples of common failures Common failures should be identied and suitable control measures implemented. 1.

Deviations from normal operating conditions Deviations from normal operating conditions include failures in the monitoring of crucial process parameters (e.g. pressure, temperature), failures in utilitiessuch as steam, cooling, electricity and compressed air, failures in shut-down andstart-up procedures, and formation of by-products, residues and impurities. 3. Human and organizational errors A wide variety of errors can be made by operating personnel. Common errors include operator error, pressing wrong buttons, disconnecting alarms, mix-upsof materials, communication errors, and incorrect maintenance and repairs. 4. Natural forces External impacts may be caused by natural forces such as wind, water, sunlight and lightning. Bibliography HACCP: Introducing the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System.

Introduction These guidelines are primarily intended for use by governmental organizations, such as drug regulatory authorities (including inspectorates), quality controllaboratories and customs and police ofcials, but some of the general principlesmay also be appropriate for application by procurement agencies, manufactur-ers and customers. These guidelines should be useful when surveying the national markets for the quality of drug products in accordance with national drug quality surveil-lance programmes for marketed products, whether registered for sale or com-pounded in pharmacies. The choice of a sampling plan should always take into consideration the specic objectives of the sampling and the risks and consequences associatedwith inherent decision errors. The bibliography at the end of this Annex shouldbe consulted when justifying a sampling plan for a given purpose. 1.1 General considerations Sampling comprises the operations designed to select a portion of a pharma-ceutical product (for denition, see glossary) for a dened purpose. The sam-pling procedure should be appropriate to the purpose of sampling, to the typeof controls intended to be applied to the samples and to the material to besampled. The procedure should be described in writing. All operations related to sampling should be performed with care, using proper equipment and tools. Any contamination of the sample by dust or otherforeign material is liable to jeopardize the validity of the subsequent analyses. 1.2 Glossary The denitions given below apply to the terms as used in these guidelines. Theymay have different meanings in other contexts. Available sample Whatever total quantity of sample materials is available.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 360QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 360Batch A quantity of any drug produced during a given cycle of manufacture. If the manufacturing process is continuous, the batch originates in a dened periodof time during which the manufacturing conditions are stable and have not beenmodied. Combined sample Sample resulting from combining all or parts of two or more samples of thematerial. Consignment The quantity of a bulk starting material, or of a drug product, made by one man-ufacturer or supplied by an agent, and supplied at one time in response to aparticular request or order. A consignment may comprise one or more lot-identied packages or containers and may include material belonging to morethan one lot-identied batch. Final sample Sample ready for the application of the test procedure. Homogeneity A material is regarded as homogeneous when it is all of the same origin (e.g.from the same batch) and as non-homogeneous when it is of differing origins. Original sample Sample collected directly from the material. Pharmaceutical product Any material1or product intended for human or veterinary use presented in its nished dosage form or as a starting material for use in such a dosage form, thatis subject to control by pharmaceutical legislation in the exporting state and/orthe importing state. Prequalication The activities undertaken in dening a product or service need, seeking expres-sions of interest from enterprises to supply the product or service, and exam-ining the product or service offered against the specication, and the facilitywhere the product or service is prepared against common standards of goodmanufacturing practice (GMP). The examination of the product or service andof the facility where it is manufactured is performed by trained and qualiedinspectors against common standards. Once the product is approved, and theSAMPLING OPERATIONS 3611\"Material\" is used in the document for \"pharmaceutical products and related materials\".QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 361facility is approved for the delivery of the specied product or service, other procurement agencies are informed of the approval. Prequalication is requiredfor all pharmaceutical products regardless of their composition and place ofmanufacture or registration, but the amount and type of information requestedfrom the supplier for use in the assessment by the procurement agency maydiffer. Production All operations involved in the preparation of a pharmaceutical product, fromreceipt of materials, through processing, packaging and repackaging, labellingand relabelling, to completion of the nished product. Random sample Sample in which the different fractions of the material have an equal probabil-ity of being represented. Representative sample Sample obtained according to a sampling procedure designed to ensure that thedifferent parts of a batch or the different properties of a non-uniform materialare proportionately represented. Retention sample Sample collected as part of the original sampling process and reserved for futuretesting. The size of a retention sample should be sufcient to allow for at leasttwo conrmatory analyses. In some cases statutory regulations may require oneor more retention samples, each of which should be separately identied, pack-aged and sealed. Sample A portion of a material collected according to a dened sampling procedure.The size of any sample should be sufcient to allow all anticipated test proce-dures to be carried out, including all repetitions and retention samples. If thequantity of material available is not sufcient for the intended analyses and forthe retention samples, the inspector should record that the sampled material isthe available sample (see Sampling record ) and the evaluation of the results should take account of the limitations that arise from the insufcient samplesize. Sampler Person responsible for performing the sampling operations. Sampling method That part of the sampling procedure dealing with the method prescribed forwithdrawing samples.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 362QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 362Sampling plan Description of the location, number of units and/or quantity of material that should be collected, and associated acceptance criteria. Sampling procedure The complete sampling operations to be performed on a dened material for aspecic purpose. A detailed written description of the sampling procedure isprovided in the sampling protocol . Sampling record Written record of the sampling operations carried out on a particular material for a dened purpose. The sampling record should contain the batch number,date and place of sampling, reference to the sampling protocol used, a descrip-tion of the containers and of the materials sampled, notes on possible abnor-malities, together with any other relevant observations, and the name andsignature of the inspector. Sampling unit Discrete part of a consignment such as an individual package, drum or container. Selected sample Sample obtained according to a sampling procedure designed to select a frac-tion of the material that is likely to have special properties. A selected samplethat is likely to contain deteriorated, contaminated, adulterated or otherwiseunacceptable material is known as an extreme sample. Uniformity A starting material may be considered uniform when samples drawn from dif- ferent layers do not show signicant differences in the quality control tests whichwould result in non-conformity with specications. The following materials maybe considered uniform unless there are signs to the contrary: organic and inor-ganic chemicals; puried natural products; various processed natural productssuch as fatty oils and essential oils; and plant extracts. The assumption of uni-formity is strengthened by homogeneity, i.e. when the consignment is derivedfrom a single batch. 1.3 Purpose of sampling Sampling may be required for different purposes, such as pre-qualication;acceptance of consignments; batch release testing; in-process control; specialcontrols; inspection for customs clearance, deterioration or adulteration; or forobtaining a retention sample. The tests to be applied to the sample may include:SAMPLING OPERATIONS 363QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 363\u2014 verifying \u2014 performing complete pharmacopoeial or analogous testing; and\u2014 performing special or specic tests. 1.4 Classes and types of pharmaceutical products and related materials The materials to be sampled may belong to the following classes: \u2014 starting materials for use in the manufacture of nished pharmaceutical products; \u2014 intermediates in the manufacturing process (e.g. bulk granule);\u2014 pharmaceutical products (in-process as well as before and after packaging);\u2014 primary and secondary packaging materials; and\u2014 cleaning and sanitizing agents, compressed gases and other processing agents. 1.5 Sampling facilities Sampling facilities should be designed to: \u2014 prevent contamination of the opened container, the materials and the operator; \u2014 prevent cross-contamination by other materials, products and the environ- ment; and \u2014 protect the individual who samples (sampler) during the sampling procedure. Where possible, sampling should be performed in an area or booth designed for and dedicated to this purpose, although this will not be possible wheresamples are required to be taken from a production line (e.g. in-process controlsamples). The area in which the sample was taken should be recorded in thesampling record and a sequential log should be kept of all materials sampled ineach area. Sampling from large containers of starting material or bulk products can present difculties. Whenever possible, this work should be carried out in a sep-arate, closed cubicle within the warehouse, to reduce the risk of contamination(e.g. by dust) of either the sample or the materials remaining in the container,or of cross-contamination. Some materials should be sampled in special or dedicated environments (e.g. when sampling articles for which contamination with dirt or particles fromthe environment should be avoided, such as aerosol valves, hormones and penicillins). Generally, taking the original sales pack as a sample from outlets such as pharmacies or hospitals does not present problems. However, the inspectorQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 364QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 364should ensure that the quantity of sample taken is sufcient for the intended analyses and for the retention samples, and that all units sampled are derivedfrom the same batch and preferably from the same location. 1.6 Responsibilities for sampling Those responsible for sampling procedures include: governmental organizations , such as drug control authorities (including inspectorates); quality control laboratories; customs and police authoritiesresponsible for the clearance of drug products held in quarantine after manufacture or importation, and for the detection of pharmaceutical products that have deteriorated or have been contaminated, adulterated orcounterfeited; customers such as governmental or nongovernmental agencies involved in the acquisition of drug products; and manufacturers in the context of good manufacturing practices (GMP). The samplers need to be adequately trained in the practical aspects of sampling, qualied to perform the sampling operation, and should have sufcient knowl-edge of pharmaceutical substances to allow them to execute the work effectivelyand safely. Given that the sampling technique itself can introduce bias, it isimportant that personnel carrying out the sampling should be suitably trainedin the techniques and procedures used. The training should be documented inthe individual's training records. Sampling records should clearly indicate thedate of sampling, the sampled container and the identity of the person whosampled the batch. A conscientious approach, with meticulous attention to detail and cleanli- ness, is essential. The sampler should remain alert to any signs of contamina-tion, deterioration or tampering. Any suspicious signs should be recorded indetail in the sampling record. If a governmental agency needs to sample a sterile or bulk pharmaceutical product at the manufacturing site, it may be best to have the manufacturer'spersonnel collect the sample, using their own procedures. The regulatoryinspector would observe the procedure in such a way as not to increase thechance of contamination (e.g. for sterile pharmaceutical products, the inspec-tor would observe through a glass window outside the aseptic sampling area)and to preclude the possibility of the inspector inadvertently contaminating theremaining bulk pharmaceutical product through poor procedures, for example. 1.7 Health and safety It is the responsibility of the sampler to read the relevant health and safety information (e.g. the safety data sheet for a pharmaceutical product and related materials) before sampling the material. The information should includeSAMPLING OPERATIONS 365QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 365necessary safety precautions and requirements for both the operator and the environment. The sampler should wear appropriate protective clothing for the task. If specic safety precautions are required, such as the use of respiratory equip-ment, the sampler should be properly trained in its use. The sampler should have safe access to and egress from the place where the sample is taken, and the places where the samples are taken for storage. Thesample storage areas should have adequate light and ventilation and should bearranged to satisfy the requirements for safety as well as any special ones arisingfrom the characteristics of the material being sampled. Care should be taken to guard against collapse of stacked containers or solids in bulk. 2. Sampling process 2.1 Preparation for sampling For the sampling of products, the responsible person should have at his or herdisposal all the tools needed to open the containers (e.g. packages, barrels andothers). Tools may include knives, pliers, saws, hammers, wrenches, implementsto remove dust (preferably a vacuum cleaner), and material to reclose the pack-ages (such as sealing tape), as well as self-adhesive labels to indicate that someof the contents have been removed from a package or container. Containers dueto be sampled should be cleaned prior to sampling if necessary. Sampling of uniform starting materials does not require complicated tools. A variety of pipettes tted with suction bulbs, cups or beakers, dippers andfunnels are needed for liquids of low viscosity. The use of glass should beavoided. A suitable inert rod can be used for highly viscous liquid, and spatu-las or scoops are needed for powdered and granular solids. Sterile pharmaceu-tical products should be sampled under aseptic conditions, and only whendeemed absolutely essential, to avoid the risk of loss of sterility. The tools for sampling non-uniform materials are more complicated and more difcult to clean. For example, a sampling tube with a shutter at the lowerend may be used to sample liquids in drums or other large containers and aslotted tube with a pointed end may be used to sample solids. It is importantto follow the manufacturer's instructions for the use of sampling devices. All sampling tools and implements should be made of inert materials and kept scrupulously clean. After use or before reuse, they should be thoroughlywashed, rinsed with water or suitable solvent, and dried. They should be storedin clean conditions. Adequate washing facilities should be provided in, or inclose proximity to, the sampling area, otherwise samplers will need to bring sep-arate clean sets of implements for sampling each product. The cleaning proce-dure used for all sampling tools and implements should be documented andrecorded. The adequacy of the cleaning procedure for the material from whichQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 366QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 366the sampling tool is made should be demonstrated. The use of disposable sam- pling materials has distinct advantages. Examples of sampling tools suitable for each type of material are given in Appendix 1. 2.2 Sampling operation and precautions There should be a written procedure describing the sampling operation. Thisshould include details of the health and safety aspects of sampling. It shouldensure that representative samples are taken in sufcient quantity for testing inaccordance with specications. Closures and labels should preferably be suchthat unauthorized opening can be detected. Samples should never be returnedto the bulk. The sampling process should be appropriately supervised and documented (see Appendix 2 for an example of a sample collection form). The sampling procedure should be such that non-uniformity of the mater- ial can be detected. During the sampling procedure, attention should be paidto any signs of nonconformity of the material. Signs of non-uniformity include differences in shape, size or colour of particles in crystalline, granular or powdered solid substances; moist crusts onhygroscopic substances; deposits of solid pharmaceutical product in liquid orsemi-liquid products; and stratication of liquid products. Such changes, someof which may be readily reversible, can occur during prolonged storage or exposure to extreme temperatures during transportation. Homogeneous portions of the material or bulk such as those mentioned above should besampled and tested separately from the rest of the material that has a normalappearance. Pooling of the samples from the different portions should be avoided, because this can mask contamination, low potency or other quality problems. Labelling of samples should provide appropriate details, including the batch number and, if known, the container number from which the sample was taken,the amount taken and for what purpose. Labels should be applied at the timeof sampling. The container used to store the sample should also be properlylabelled with appropriate details such as sample type, name of material, identi-cation code, batch/lot number, code, quantity, date of sampling, storage con-ditions, handling precautions and container number. For nished drug products, the sampling procedure should take account of the ofcial and non-ofcial tests required for the individual dosage form (e.g.tablets or parenteral preparations). Non-ofcial tests could include testing for adulteration and counterfeiting .The sampling procedure should also take account of past experience with the pharmaceutical product or relatedmaterial and with the supplier, and of the number of sampling units in the consignment. Examples of steps for sampling are given in Appendix 3.SAMPLING OPERATIONS 367QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 367When a container is sampled outside the control of the consignee of the product, the following precautions should be taken. If the tamper-proof seal isbroken to obtain a sample, then the consignee of the product should beinformed and the container resealed with an appropriate tamper-proof seal, andthe consignee of the product informed of its type and its identication. If a baghas been punctured to take a sample, then the sampling hole should be appro-priately closed and identied as a sampling hole made by an authorized sampler.Sampled containers should be identied, as they may no longer contain thequantity of product stated on the label. In accordance with national legislationthere may be exceptions, e.g. during ongoing investigations of cases related tocounterfeit pharmaceutical products. 2.3 Storage and retention The container used to store a sample should not interact with the sampled material nor allow contamination. It should also protect the sample from light,air and moisture, as required by the storage directions for the pharmaceuticalproduct or related material sampled. As a general rule the container should besealed and preferably tamper-evident. Samples of loose materials, whether solid or liquid, should be placed in one or more clean containers. Liquid samples should be transported in suitablebottles closed by screw tops with inert liners that provide a good vapour-proof(moisture-proof) seal for the contents. Suitable screw-top jars in exceptionalcases only should be used for solid or semi-solid pharmaceutical products. Thecontainer should be inert. Light-sensitive materials should be protected by usingamber glass containers or by wrapping colourless glass containers in foil or dark-coloured paper. Headspace should be kept to a minimum to minimize any pos-sible degradation. Any special procedures, for example, nitrogen gassing, shouldbe discussed with the consignee of the material and carried out as appropriate. Solid dosage forms such as tablets or granules should be protected during transit, either by totally lling the container with the product or by lling anyresidual space with a suitable material. All containers should be sealed andlabelled, and all samples should be packaged adequately and transported in sucha way as to avoid breakage and contamination during transport. For all containers that come apart (e.g. screw-capped jars or metal tins with separate lids) precautions should be taken to avoid any mix-up when they areopened for examination, such as by labelling all parts of each container when-ever possible. If one sample is divided into several sample containers, they should be trans- ported in a suitably sealed box, which should be labelled with the identity ofthe product, the consignment from which the sample was drawn, the size of thesample, the date and place of sampling, and the name of the inspector. Security and adequate storage conditions should be ensured for the rooms in which samples are stored. Samples should be stored in accordance with theQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 368QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 368storage conditions as specied for the respective active pharmaceutical ingredi- ent (API), excipient or drug product. Packaging materials similar to those inwhich the bulk is supplied should be used for long-term storage. Examples of types of containers used to store samples of starting materials and bulk products are given in Appendix 4. 3. Regulatory issues When sampling for regulatory purposes, additional samples for regulatorytesting and verication purposes should be provided (e.g. for duplicate testingand parallel testing by different regulatory laboratories and by the consignee ofthe product). The consignee of the product should be informed that sampleshave been taken, and should the consignee wish to conduct his/her own testingof the sample taken for regulatory purposes, regulatory authorities shouldprovide a sample to the consignee of the goods. Sampling of products for prequalication purposes may follow similar procedures. 3.1 Pharmaceutical inspections Pharmaceutical inspectors may take samples from retail or hospital pharmacies(including samples of preparations manufactured in bulk on the premises), orfrom industry and wholesalers for a variety of reasons, such as: \u2014 routine monitoring and control; \u2014 following the suspicion or discovery of products that show signs of possible deterioration, contamination, adulteration or counterfeiting; and \u2014 when a particular product is suspected of being either ineffective or respon- sible for adverse clinical reactions. For deteriorated dosage forms, the sample should consist of one or more retail containers of the product that shows visual signs of deterioration. When a complaint has been received about a drug product, the sample should include the original container and, if possible, one or more unopenedcontainers containing the same product and bearing the same batch number.There should be good communication between the regulatory authority and theconsignee of the goods concerning the ndings and any necessary correctiveaction. 3.2 Surveillance programmes National drug regulatory authorities are responsible for monitoring the qualityof all drug products marketed in their country and as dened by legislation. Theextent to which routine surveillance should be undertaken, as opposed to assess-ment of suspect products, will depend upon factors such as:SAMPLING OPERATIONS 369QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 369\u2014 the capacity of the national quality control laboratory; \u2014 the extent to which the quality of the product has been assessed prior to registration; \u2014 the extent to which the requirements for GMP are implemented; and\u2014 the number of products that are imported from abroad. A systematic programme of drug quality surveillance should be in place which may include sampling of marketed products, whether registered for sale or com-pounded in pharmacies, as deemed necessary. Each product should be assessedregularly (e.g. every 2-3 years) for inclusion in the surveillance programme, butparticular attention should be accorded to products that are of prime impor-tance to public health programmes or that are potentially dangerous, unstableor difcult to formulate properly. The responsible laboratory should draw up the sampling programme, if nec- essary under the guidance of the drug regulatory authority, on a yearly or half-yearly basis. This programme should not only list the products to be sampledduring a given period, but should also specify the sampling procedures and thesize of the samples to be collected, taking into account the need for retentionsamples. The programme should state to what extent each brand of a givenproduct will be sampled and which local authority or inspector will be respon-sible for each sampling operation. It should indicate to which laboratory (if morethan one exists) each sample should be sent. Such a programme enables thefacilities of each laboratory to be used to best advantage. 4. Sampling on receipt (for acceptance) 4.1 Starting materials Testing of starting materials should be undertaken using samples collected inaccordance with an appropriate procedure. If the material of a consignment can be regarded as uniform, the sample can be taken from any part of the consignment. If, however, the material is notphysically uniform, special sampling tools may be required to withdraw a cross-sectional portion of the material. Alternatively, where applicable, a validatedprocedure can be followed to restore the uniformity of the material before sam-pling, based on information concerning the subsequent handling and manufac-turing steps. For example, a stratied liquid may be stirred or a solid deposit ina liquid may be dissolved by gentle warming and stirring. Such interventionsshould not be attempted without adequate knowledge of the properties of thecontents and appropriate discussions with the consignee of the goods. All partially processed natural products, both animal, herbal (dried plants and their parts) and mineral, should be treated as intrinsically non-uniform.Special procedures requiring considerable practice are needed to prepare rep-resentative samples from such consignments, including coning and quarteringand the treatment of nes. Details of appropriate procedures may be found inQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 370QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 370the relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents (see Bibliography). These procedures are not further described in these guidelines. 4.2 Intermediates in the manufacturing process and bulk pharmaceutical products Pharmaceutical intermediates and products supplied in bulk may need to be examined. These include liquids and semi-solid pharmaceutical products, pow-dered solids or granulates transported in large containers and intended eitherfor further processing or for direct packaging into nal market containers, andunit dosage forms (tablets, capsules) supplied in bulk which are intended forrepackaging into smaller containers. There is a risk of segregation of bulk mate-rials during transportation and this should be taken into account when drawingup the sampling plan. Products of this kind may be assumed to be uniform where the trans- portation process has been validated, provided that they: \u2014 are labelled with the name of the manufacturer and a single batch number; \u2014 have been produced in accordance with GMP; and\u2014 are supplied with a certicate, issued in the country of origin, according to the WHO Certication Scheme on the quality of pharmaceutical productsmoving in international commerce. In these circumstances the collection of a single sample, sufcient for the intended analyses, is adequate. 4.3 Finished products The quality of nished pharmaceutical products frequently needs to be veriedat the time of their importation or purchase. The necessary sampling should beperformed using an appropriate method and with regard to the presumed uni-formity. A single consignment of a product from a single manufacturer andlabelled with a single batch number may be assumed to be uniform. The minimum size of the samples will be determined by the requirements of the analytical procedure that will be used to test the product. Tests of unitdosage forms for uniformity of weight, volume or content can require a con-siderable number of units, as can tests for sterility. Depending upon the type ofmaterial, the size of the consignment and the way in which the material ispacked, a unit to be sampled may be regarded as the transport container, e.g.20 packs shrink-wrapped or boxed together, rather than an individual container.The required number of unit dosage forms is then withdrawn from any indi-vidual container in the selected transit container. Sampling and testing may be adjusted according to experience with the spe- cic source (e.g. manufacturer or supplier) of the product. If the consignmentSAMPLING OPERATIONS 371QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 371consists of one very large batch, or if little experience has been obtained with the product to be sampled, it may be prudent to carry out two independentanalyses. Two independent nal samples should then be taken from differentsampling units. Conversely, when a consignment is composed of two or threebatches from the same manufacturer, a single sample taken from each batch maysufce, provided that favourable documented experience has previously beengained with the product and the manufacturer, and that there is evidence fromthe expiry date, or other information, that the batches were produced at approx-imately the same time. Note: When sampling nished products, packaging materials may be retained for testing. 4.4 Packaging materials (primary and secondary) There is a potential for mixing up printed packaging materials during the sampling operations and, therefore, only one material should be handled at a time. Also, samples of packaging materials should never be returned to theconsignment. Adequate protection (e.g. collapsible metal tubes) and identication should be provided for the sample to avoid mixing or damage. Primary packaging materials should be adequately protected during the sampling operation to avoid environmental contamination. The nal use of thepackaging should be taken into consideration and appropriate sampling pro-tection afforded (e.g. in the sampling of parenteral ampoules). There are severalreasons why a consignment of packaging materials may not necessarily be con-sidered homogenous, for example: Materials were manufactured on different days or machines. Materials were manufactured on one machine, but on different stations (e.g. 16 printing dye stations or 12 moulding stations). Packaging was manufactured with different source materials (e.g. polyethyl- ene from two different sources). A change of quality occurred during the process (e.g. container-wall thick- ness, colour variation, text legibility or change of printing plate). It is, therefore, important at least to take random samples (e.g. from across the consignment), and to consider focused sampling, taking into account some ofthe above points. 5. Sampling plans for starting materials, packaging materials and nished products As stated in the introduction, these guidelines are intended primarily for drug regulatory authorities and procurement agencies. The following sampling plansQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 372QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 372are, therefore, not necessarily appropriate for manufacturers, although the guiding principles may be useful. The choice of the sampling plan should alwaystake into consideration the specic objectives of the sampling and the risks andconsequences associated with inherent decision errors. It should be noted thatsampling plans are not recommended for sampling of starting materials for identication tests (see Quality assurance of pharmaceuticals. A compendium of guidelines and related materials. Volume 2, 2nd Updated edition. Good manu-facturing practices and inspection . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2006; and WHO Expert Committee on Specications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. Thirty-ninth report . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2005 (WHO Techni- cal Report Series, No. 929), Annex 2). Ideally each sampling unit should be examined to ensure that it is intact and also checked for possible damage to the container. The contents should beinspected for uniformity and appropriately tested for identity. Uniformityshould be tested on selected layer samples at different points in the materialwithout previous intermixing. However, in cases when this ideal procedure isnot possible or justied by the purpose of sampling, a number of sampling unitsshould be randomly selected for sampling. It is not prudent to open all con-tainers of products, which are liable to deteriorate under the influence of mois-ture or oxygen when held in a transit warehouse. However, materials in damagedcontainers or those found to be non-uniform should either be rejected or individually sampled for a complete quality control. Unlabelled sampling unitsshould be rejected. For random sampling, whenever possible each sampling unit should be consecutively numbered and the required number of random sampling unitsselected using tables of random numbers. The number of units to be sampled depends on different assumptions and three possible plans are shown in Table 1. For more comprehensive, statistically-based sampling schemes, see Bibliography. It is important to recognize that the \" n-plan\" is not statistically based and should be used only as a guiding principle. 5.1 Starting materials When sampling starting materials proper consideration has to be given to decid-ing on a sampling plan. The following are examples of sampling plans that couldbe used. 5.1.1 The nplan The \" n plan\" should be used with great caution and only when the material to be sampled is considered uniform and is supplied from a recognized source.Samples can be withdrawn from any part of the container (usually from the toplayer). The n plan is based on the formula n =1 +N, where N is the numberSAMPLING OPERATIONS 373QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 373of sampling units in the consignment. The value of n is obtained by simple rounding. A minimum number of containers needs to be sampled, e.g. if N is less than or equal to 4, then every container is sampled. According to this plan,original samples are taken from n sampling units selected at random and these are subsequently placed in separate sample containers. The control laboratoryinspects the appearance of the material and tests the identity of each originalsample according to the relevant specication. If the results are concordant, theoriginal samples are combined into a nal, composite sample from which ananalytical sample is prepared, the remainder being kept as a retention sample. Note : The n plan is not recommended for use by control laboratories of manu- facturers who are required to analyse and release or reject each received con-signment of the starting materials used to produce a drug product. 5.1.2 The pplan The \" p plan\" may be used when the material is uniform, is received from a rec- ognized source and the main purpose is to test for identity. The p plan is based on the formula p =0.4N, where N is the number of sampling units. The gures for p are obtained by rounding up to the next highest integer. According to this plan, samples are taken from each of the N sampling units of the consignment and placed in separate sample containers. These original samples are transferredto the control laboratory, visually inspected and tested for identity (a simpliedmethod may be used). If the results are concordant, p nal samples are formed by appropriate pooling of the original samples.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 374Table 1. Values of n, p, or rfor the Nsampling unitsa Values of N Value of n, p, or rn plan pplan rplan 2 up to 3 up to 25 up plans work is given in Appendix 5.QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 3745.1.3 The rplan The \" r plan\" may be used when the material is suspected to be nonuniform and/or is received from a source that is not well known. The r plan may also be used for herbal medicinal products used as starting materials. This plan is basedon the formula r =1.5N, where Nis the number of sampling units. The gures for r are obtained by rounding up to the next highest integer. Samples are taken from each of the N sampling units of the consignment and placed in separate sample containers. These original samples are transferredto the control laboratory and tested for identity. If the results are concordant, r samples are randomly selected and individually subjected to testing. If these results are concordant, the r samples are combined for the retention sample. 5.2 Packaging materials Sampling plans for packaging materials should be based on dened sampling standards, for example, British Standard BS 6001-1, ISO 2859 or ANSI/ASQCZ1.4-1993. The objective is to ensure that there is a low probability of accepting mate- rial that does not comply with the predened acceptance level. 5.3 Finished products As for packaging materials, sampling plans for nished products should bebased on dened sampling standards such as BS 6001-1, ISO 2859 orANSI/ASQCZ 1.4-1993. In some cases it may be sufcient to limit examination of nished goods to visual inspection only. If physical and chemical testing is required, however, the sampling units should consist of whole packs. Individual packs should not bebroken open for the purposes of sampling. An example of the steps to be considered when sampling nished products is given in Appendix 3, based on the sampling plans given in ISO 2859-1.

Appendix 1 Types of sampling tools Scoops Small containers of solid materials may be adequately sampled using a spatula or scoop. The samples are then blended to provide a representative sample ofthat container. Figure 1 shows the recommended designs of scoops, whichshould preferably be rounded. If the scoop used is too small for the sizes of particle being sampled, large particles will roll off and testing bias may be introduced. On the other hand, ifQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 376QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 376the scoop is too big, an unnecessarily large sample will be obtained for a given number of increments. A scoopful of sample should be taken in a single movement and transferred to the sample container. Avoid tapping the scoop to remove pharmaceuticalproduct as this is likely to cause segregation of the sample. Dip tubes Dip tubes should be used for sampling liquid and topical products and should be made of an inert material, such as polypropylene or stainless steel. A typicaldip tube is shown in Figure 2.SAMPLING OPERATIONS 377 Figure 1. Sampling scoops for solidsQAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 377Weighted containers For taking samples from large tanks and storage vessels, a container in a weighted carrier can be used. The container is designed such that it can beopened at the required depth. Marks on the cord used for lowering the con-tainer can be used to determine when the correct sampling depth has beenreached. A typical weighted container is shown in Figure 3. Thieves Sample thieves should be used when taking samples from deep containers of solids. Typical thieves are shown in Figure 4. The plug thief typically consists of a hollow tube with an inner rod that has a tip on the end to allow the thief to enter the powder bed in the closedQUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 378Figure 2. Typical dip tubeQAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 378 SAMPLING OPERATIONS 379 Figure 3. Typical weighted container position (see Figure 4.i). The geometry of this tip can influence the sample taken; pointed tips distort the powder bed less than blunt-tipped probes, therebyreducing sampling error. Some thieves have a locking device that allows thesample volume to be set to the required sample weight, thereby reducing theweight variation in the sample population. A chamber thief generally consists of two concentric tubes (see Figure 4.ii); the inner tube is solid except for the chambers in which the sample is collected.The outer tube is hollow with openings that can be aligned with the chambersin the inner tube. A well-designed thief will have a sharp end to minimize dis-ruption to the powder bed. When it is inserted into a static powder blend a thief will distort the bed by carrying pharmaceutical product from the upper layers of the blend to thelower layers. The magnitude of this distortion can depend on whether the thiefQAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 379is inserted into the blend with a smooth, jerky or twisting action. Therefore, the correct sampling procedure should be dened and staff trained in using theappropriate technique. Thieves are also sometimes referred to as \"double-tubespears\". The angle at which the thief enters the powder bed can also influence sampling error. If a thief is inserted into the powder bed vertically, it can extract samples of different particle size from those that would be obtained usingthe same thief inserted at an acute angle. In addition the orientation of a chamberthief in relation to the powder bed (i.e. whether the chamber is at the top, thebottom or in the middle of the thief) may also influence the sampling error. The material from which the thief is constructed, e.g. stainless steel or polypropylene, may also have an effect on sampling error due to static effects. Sampling error can also be affected by bed depth, as the static pressure of the bulk blend forces the material into the sample chamber(s). This pressure isfar greater at the bottom of a large container than it is in the middle or at thetop. It is quite possible that the same thief could extract samples of differentparticle size from the top or bottom of a static powder blend. Simple bag-sampling spears Simple bag-sampling spears are the most commonly used instruments for taking samples from bags, because they are relatively cheap, simple and quick. Sam-pling spears generally have a maximum external diameter of about 12 mm, butcan be up to 25 mm in diameter. To obtain a good cross-sectional sample, thespear should be 40-45 cm in length. The tapered type of sampling spear pene-trates bags easily. Typical spears are shown in Figure 5.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 380 Figure 4.

Read and understand the precautions to be observed for the safe handling of the material.QUALITY ASSURANCE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 382QAP6 12/16/06 12:16 PM Page 3822. Gather together the required sampling equipment (sampling tube or weighted sampling can, sample bottles and labels) and check that all therequired items are clean. 3. Locate the batch.4. Examine the container(s) for signs of contamination of the batch. Record any faults. 5. Examine the labels for obvious differences and signs of changes including obliterations and mislabelling. Record any faults. 6. Investigate and clarify the sources of and reasons for any faults before proceeding. 7. Choose a liquid-sampling tube of size and orice suitable for the viscosity of the liquid being sampled. 8. Sample the liquid, suspension or emulsion (well stirred, if appropriate) by slowly pushing the open sampling tube vertically downwards through theliquid so that material is collected from each layer. 9. Seal the tube, withdraw it from the bulk liquid, and allow liquid adhering to the outside of the tube to drain. Transfer all the contents of the tube toa clean, labelled sample bottle. 10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until sufcient samples for analytical and retention purposes have been obtained. 11. Seal the sample bottle.12. Reseal the container from which the samples were taken and label as \"sampled\". 13. Clean and dry the sampling tube, observing the relevant safety precautions.14. Sample other required containers in the same manner following steps 8-12 above. 15. Clean the sampling tube using the recommended cleaning procedure.16. Deliver the analytical samples to the laboratory and the reserve samples to the retention sample store. Report any aspects of the sampling that shouldbe brought to the attention of the analyst or the inspector. 17. Check supplier certicate versus the specications, if applicable. Powdered starting material The steps to be considered in sampling a powdered starting material are asfollows. 1. Read and understand the precautions to be observed for the safe handling of the material. 2.
