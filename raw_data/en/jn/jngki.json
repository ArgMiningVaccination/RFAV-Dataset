Edzard Ernst, MD, PhD is systematically examining what research sponsored by the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has accomplished. His review of \"energy medicine\" studies has been published [1]. The NCCAM Web site describes \"energy medicine\" this way: Some CAM practices involve manipulation of various energy fields to affect health. Such fields may be characterized as veritable (measurable) or putative (yet to be measured). Practices based on veritable forms of energy include those involving electromagnetic fields (e.g., magnet therapy and light therapy). Practices based on putative energy fields (also called biofields) generally reflect the concept that human beings are infused with subtle forms of energy; qi gong, Reiki, and healing touch are examples of such practices [2]. NCCAM's description of nonmeasurable \"energy fields\" is to or to exist.\" [3] I believe that \"putative\" implies general acceptance. Most disctionaries do not include the word biofield. The most accurate way to characterize the \"energy fields\" of qi gong, reiki, and healing touch is that they do not exist and that belief in them is delusional, and therefore that tax dollars should not be spent studying them. But NCCAM prefers language that suggests that they might be real and therefore worthy of government-funded study. Dr. Ernst and his colleagues located five NCCAM-sponsored, randomized, controlled studies related to energy medicine that were published between 2006 and 2008. The modalities included were reiki, qigong, distant healing, and Johrei healing. (The Jyorei Web site describes Jyorei as \"a healing art that uses divine light to dissolve the spiritual impurities that are the source of all physical, emotional, and personal problems\" [4]. They concluded: - Three studies suggested that energy medicine had an effect,, but their authors either applied statistics inappropriately, confounded the effects of energy healing by adding unrelated interventions to the experimental condition, or failed to design or blind equivalent placebo controls. Their results are therefore untrustworthy. - The two studies that were well-designed failed to demonstrate effects from \"energy\" in healing. - The odds of generating a useful result of a clinical trial of energy medicine are small. Moreover,what impact would negative studies have? Scientists will simply say \"we could have told you so,\" and proponents are unlikely to change their mind. Proponents may then claim that the negative study must have been flawed or that energy medicine cannot be investigated by the tools of science. Or they might rely on the NCCAM-funded RCTs that generated biased but apparently positive results. - The NCCAM's approach encourages a self-perpetuating cycle of misinterpreting research and conducting flawed research, which inevitably generates some studies that erroneously claim positive effects and give the false impression that the efficacy of energy medicine is still scientifically unresolved. - Plausibility should be tested before clinical trials are conducted. If not, money and effort will just be wasted. - NCCAM should not fund poor-quality studies of implausible practices. I agree. NCCAM should not only stop funding \"putative\" energy medicine studies, but should also (a) stop pretending that the practices might be useful and (b) stop funding educational programs (in medical schools and elsewhere) that make the same pretense.

[An FDA official replied]that the agency has increased its surveillance of Internet promotion and advertising. Rob McKenna ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON 1125 Washington Street SE PO Box 40100 Olympia WA 98504-0100 December 20, 2007 Timothy Ulatowski Compliance Director U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health Room 244 Gaither Road Rockville, Maryland 20850 RE: \"Energy Medicine\" Medical Devices Dear Mr. Ulatowski: We were encouraged by your recently announced commitment to block the import of the EPFX, and to investigate its manufacturer, distributors and operators. We believe your response to the Seattle Times series that exposed the dangers of the EPFX was appropriate and commendable. While the Seattle Times series presented an in-depth look at the dangers of one \"energy medicine\" device, it also alluded to the existence of dozens of other devices that are equally dangerous. We encourage you to expand your import block and investigation to those other devices. In 2003, the state of Washington sued Pacific Health Center for, among other things, its use of an \"electrodermal testing\" device, the Omega Accubase C-29a. Investigations by our agencies and the Attorney General's Office lawsuit confirm our belief that targeting a singular device does not deter or immobilize the overall industry. This particular \"energy medicine\" device was purported to determine the presence of various conditions, including arthritis, immune deficiencies, high cholesterol and hypertension. It was also purported to be able to determine the proper remedy for these conditions. The Attorney General's Office lawsuit claimed that the efficacy of the device - which had been used on more than 5,000 people who each paid approximately $500\u2014had not been adequately substantiated. The suit also claimed that the operators of the device were practicing medicine, acupuncture and naturopathy without proper licensure. The State ultimately dropped its substantiation claims voluntarily when the court decided that the defendants were engaging in unlicensed practices. The defendants are no longer doing business in Washington, but continue to operate from locations in Oregon and Idaho. In the course of investigating and litigating the case, we learned an enormous amount about the \"energy medicine\" field. Our research of the device used by Pacific Health Center uncovered an entire industry devoted to the sale, distribution and use of various unproven devices. These devices were advertised widely on the Internet, sold by several manufacturers, and used in clinics across the country. We found no research that scientifically substantiated their effectiveness, not even one study that relied on the double-blinded clinical trials that are the scientific \"gold standard\" for proving the truth of medical claims. And yet, they were and are used widely for a variety of purposes including diagnosing and treating human and animal diseases, determining food sensitivities and allergies, and finding tooth decay. The amount of money spent by unwary consumers is enormous, and the risk that these consumers are foregoing traditional treatment in favor of \"snake oil\" cures is frightening. We request that the FDA consider not just the EPFX as the target of your investigation, but to include all of the unproven and dangerous medical devices that are currently being sold and used the U.S. market. In a recent review of Internet websites touting these devices, the Attorney General's Office was able to find the following numerous examples that are indistinguishable in their ineffectuality from the EPFX: NES, E-Lybra, LSA Interro, Interactive Query System, MORA, Matrix Physique System, Propylene, Punts III and Vitel. This list is not exhaustive, and there are even more devices on the market. The sale and use of untested medical devices is a national problem. States can chip away at it through actions under their consumer protection and medical licensing statutes, but the FDA is the most effective regulator in this area. We encourage you to ban the manufacture, distribution and use of these dangerous devices, to step up enforcement against those who are taking consumers' money and risking their health, and to generalize your approach to include more than just one device. We pledge to work with you in this endeavor and are happy to share our thoughts, research and the testimony of the experts we have consulted.

It holds that the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through channels, called meridians, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi.. Ancient practices such as acupuncture, Qigong, and the use of various herbs are claimed to restore \"balance.\" Although many research reports describe positive results, there is good reason to be skeptical of such reports. Traditional acupuncture, as now practiced, involves the insertion of stainless steel needles into various body areas. A low-frequency current may be applied to the needles to produce greater stimulation. Other procedures used separately or together with acupuncture include: moxibustion (burning of floss or herbs applied to the skin); injection of sterile water, procaine, morphine, vitamins, or homeopathic solutions through the inserted needles; applications of laser beams (laserpuncture); placement of needles in the external ear (auriculotherapy); and acupressure (use of manual pressure). Treatment is applied to \"acupuncture points,\" which are said to be located throughout the body. Originally there were 365 such points, corresponding to the days of the year, but the number identified by proponents during the past 2,000 years has increased gradually to about 2,000 [1]. Some practitioners place needles at or near the site of disease, whereas others select points on the basis of symptoms. In traditional acupuncture, a combination of points is usually used. Qigong is also claimed to influence the flow of \"vital energy.\" Internal Qigong involves deep breathing, concentration, and relaxation techniques used by individuals for themselves. External Qigong is performed by \"Qigong masters\" who claim to cure a wide variety of diseases with energy released from their fingertips. However, scientific investigators of Qigong masters in China have found no evidence of paranormal powers and some evidence of deception. They found, for example, that a patient lying on a table about eight feet from a Qigong master moved rhythmically or thrashed about as the master moved his hands. But when she was placed so that she could no longer see him, her movements were unrelated to his [2]. [Falun gong](http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm), which China banned several years ago, is a Qigong varient claimed to be \"a powerful mechanism for healing, stress relief and health improvements.\" Most acupuncturists espouse the traditional Chinese view of health and disease and consider acupuncture, herbal medicine, and related practices to be valid approaches to the full gamut of disease. Others reject the traditional approach and merely claim that acupuncture offers a simple way to achieve pain relief. The diagnostic process used by TCM practitioners may include questioning (medical history, lifestyle), observations (skin, tongue, color), listening (breathing sounds), and pulse-taking. Six pulse aspects said to correlate with body organs or functions are checked on each wrist to determine which meridians are \"deficient\" in chi. (Medical science recognizes only one pulse, corresponding to the heartbeat, which can be felt in the wrist, neck, feet, and various other places.) Some acupuncturists state that the electrical properties of the body may become imbalanced weeks or even months before symptoms occur. These practitioners claim that acupuncture can be used to treat conditions when the patient just \"doesn't feel right,\" even though no disease is apparent. TCM (as well as the folk medical practices of various other Asian countries) is a threat to certain animal species. For example, black bears\u2014valued for their gall bladders\u2014have been hunted nearly to extinction in Asia, and poaching of black bears is a serious problem in North America. Dubious Claims of Benefit The conditions claimed to respond to acupuncture include chronic pain (neck and back pain, migraine headaches), acute injury-related pain (strains, muscle and ligament tears), gastrointestinal problems (indigestion, ulcers, constipation, diarrhea), cardiovascular conditions (high and low blood pressure), genitourinary problems (menstrual irregularity, frigidity, impotence), muscle and nerve conditions (paralysis, deafness), and behavioral problems (overeating, drug dependence, smoking). However, the evidence supporting these claims consists mostly of practitioners' observations and poorly designed studies. A controlled study found that electroacupuncture of the ear was no more effective than placebo stimulation (light touching) against chronic pain [3]. In 1990, three Dutch epidemiologists analyzed 51 controlled studies of acupuncture for chronic pain and concluded that \"the quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. . . . The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful.\" [4] They also examined reports of acupuncture used to treat addictions to cigarettes, heroin, and alcohol, and concluded that claims that acupuncture is effective as a therapy for these conditions are not supported by sound clinical research [5]. Acupuncture anesthesia is not used for surgery in the Orient to the extent that its proponents suggest. In China physicians screen out patients who appear to be unsuitable. Acupuncture is not used for emergency surgery and often is accompanied by local anesthesia or narcotic medication [6]. How acupuncture could relieve pain is unclear. One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various \"gates\" to these areas. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic-like substances called endorphins, which reduce pain. Other theories suggest that the placebo effect, external suggestion (hypnosis), and cultural conditioning are important factors. Melzack and Wall noted that pain relief produced by acupuncture could also be produced by many other types of sensory hyperstimulation, such as electricity and heat at acupuncture points and elsewhere in the body. They conclude that \"the effectiveness of all of these forms of stimulation indicates that acupuncture is not a magical procedure but only one of many ways to produce analgesia [pain relief] by an intense sensory input.\" In 1981, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs noted that pain relief did not occur consistently or reproducibly in most people and did not operate at all in some people [7]. In 1995, George A. Ulett, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, University of Missouri School of Medicine, stated that \"devoid of metaphysical thinking, acupuncture becomes a rather simple technique that can be useful as a nondrug method of pain control.\" He believes that the traditional Chinese variety is primarily a placebo treatment, but electrical stimulation of about 80 acupuncture points has been proven useful for pain control [8]. In 1998, Parade magazine published an article in which Isadore Rosenfeld, M.D. described how he had observed a woman undergo what he believed to be open heart surgery using acupuncture for anesthesia. However, close analysis of the story indicates that there was fakery involved because the incident could not have taken place as described [9]. Untrustworthy Research The quality of TCM research in China has been extremely poor. A 1999 analysis of 2,938 reports of clinical trials reported in Chinese medical journals concluded that that no conclusions could be drawn from the vast majority of them. The researchers stated: In most of the trials, disease was defined and diagnosed according to conventional medicine; trial outcomes were assessed with objective or subjective (or both) methods of conventional medicine, often complemented by traditional Chinese methods. Over 90% of the trials in non-specialist journals evaluated herbal treatments that were mostly proprietary Chinese medicines. . . . Although methodological quality has been improving over the years, many problems remain. The method of randomisation was often inappropriately described. Blinding was used in only 15% of trials. Only a few studies had sample sizes of 300 subjects or more. Many trials used as a control another Chinese medicine treatment whose effectiveness had often not been evaluated by randomised controlled trials. Most trials focused on short term or intermediate rather than long term outcomes. Most trials did not report data on compliance and completeness of follow up. Effectiveness was rarely quantitatively expressed and reported. Intention to treat analysis was never mentioned. Over half did not report data on baseline characteristics or on side effects. Many trials were published as short reports. Most trials claimed that the tested treatments were effective, indicating that publication bias may be common; a funnel plot of the 49 trials of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke confirmed selective publication of positive trials in the area, suggesting that acupuncture may not be more effective than the control treatments. [10] Two scientists at the University of Heidelberg have developed a \"fake needle\" that may enable acupuncture researchers to perform better-designed controlled studies. The device is a needle with a blunt tip that moves freely within a copper handle. When the tip touches the skin, the patient feels a sensation similar to that of an acupuncture needle. At the same time, the visible part of the needle moves inside the handle so it appears to shorten as though penetrating the skin. When the device was tested on volunteers, none suspected that it had not penetrated the skin [11]. In 2004, a University of Heidelberg team proved the worth of their \"sham acupuncture\" technique in a study of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in women who underwent breast or gynecologic surgery. The study involved 220 women who received either acupuncture or the sham procedure at the acupuncture point \"Pericardium 6\" on the inside of the forearm. No significant difference in PONV or antivomiting medication use was found between the two groups or between the people who received treatment before anesthesia was induced and those who received it while anesthetized [12]. A subgroup analysis found that vomiting was \"significantly reduced\" among the acupuncture patients, but the authors correctly noted that this finding might be due to studying multiple outcomes. (As the number of different outcome measures increases, so do the odds that a \"statistically significant\" finding will be spurious.) This study is important because PONV reduction is one of the few alleged benefits of acupuncture supported by reports in scientific journals. However, the other positive studies were not as tightly controlled. Edzard Ernst M.D. has blogged repeatedly about why acupuncture research reports originating in China should be regarded with great skepticism. Among other things, investigations have found that many such reports are based on faked data [13-15]. Harriet Hall, a retired family practitioner who is interested in quackery, has summed up the significance of acupuncture research in an interesting way: Acupuncture studies have shown that it makes no difference where you put the needles. Or whether you use needles or just pretend to use needles (as long as the subject believes you used them). Many acupuncture researchers are doing what I call Tooth Fairy science: measuring how much money is left under the pillow without bothering to ask if the Tooth Fairy is real. Risks Exist Improperly performed acupuncture can cause fainting, local hematoma (due to bleeding from a punctured blood vessel), pneumothorax (punctured lung), convulsions, local infections, hepatitis B (from unsterile needles), bacterial endocarditis, contact dermatitis, and nerve damage. The herbs used by acupuncture practitioners are not regulated for safety, potency, or effectiveness. There is also risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition. The adverse effects of acupuncture are probably related to the nature of the practitioner's training. A survey of 1,135 Norwegian physicians revealed 66 cases of infection, 25 cases of punctured lung, 31 cases of increased pain, and 80 other cases with complications. A parallel survey of 197 acupuncturists, who are more apt to see immediate complications, yielded 132 cases of fainting, 26 cases of increased pain, 8 cases of pneumothorax, and 45 other adverse results [16]. However, a 5-year study involving 76 acupuncturists at a Japanese medical facility tabulated only 64 adverse event reports (including 16 forgotten needles and 13 cases of transient low blood pressure) associated with 55,591 acupuncture treatments. No serious complications were reported. The researchers concluded that serious adverse reactions are uncommon among acupuncturists who are medically trained [17]. In 2001, members of the British Acupuncture Council who participated in two prospective studies reported low complication rates and no serious complications among patients who underwent a total of more than 66,000 treatments [18,19]. An accompany editorial suggested that in competent hands, the likelihood of complcations is small [20]. Since outcome data are not available, the studies cannot compare the balance of risks vs benefit. Nor do the studies take into account the likelihood of misdiagnosis (and failure to seek appropriate medical care) by practitioners who use traditional Chinese methods. There is also financial risk. Online information suggests that the cost per visit ranges from about $50 to $100 per treatment, with the first visit to a practitioner costing more. Herbal products, which many practitioners commonly prescribe, could range anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per month. Questionable Standards In 1971, an acupuncture boom occurred in the United States because of stories about visits to China by various American dignitaries. Entrepreneurs, both medical and nonmedical, began using flamboyant advertising techniques to promote clinics, seminars, demonstrations, books, correspondence courses, and do-it-yourself kits. Today some states restrict the practice of acupuncture to physicians or others operating under their direct supervision. In about 20 states, people who lack medical training can perform acupuncture without medical supervision. The FDA now classifies acupuncture needles as Class II medical devices and requires labeling for one-time use by practitioners who are legally authorized to use them [21]. Acupuncture is not covered under Medicare. The March 1998 issue of the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association carried a five-part cover story encouraging chiropractors to get acupuncture training, which, according to one contributor, would enable them to broaden the scope of their practice [22]. The [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)](http://www.nccaom.org/) has set voluntary [certification standards](http://www.nccaom.org/certify.html) and offers separate certifications on Oriental medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbology, and Asian bodywork therapy. In 2007, it reported that its certification programs or exams were be recognized for licensure in 40 states and the District of Columbia and that more than 20,000 practitioners are licensed in the United States [23]. ( [The Acupuncture.com Web site provides information on the licensing status of each state](http://www.acupuncture.com/statelaws/statelaw.htm).) The credentials used by acupuncturists include C.A. (certified acupuncturist), Lic. Ac. (licensed acupuncturist), M.A. (master acupuncturist), Dip. Ac. (diplomate of acupuncture), Dipl.O.M. (diplomate of Oriental medicine), and O.M.D. (doctor of Oriental medicine). Some of these have legal significance, but they do not signify that the holder is competent to make adequate diagnoses or render appropriate treatment. In 1990, the U.S. Secretary of Education recognized what is now called the [Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM)](http://www.acaom.org/) as an accrediting agency. However, such recognition is not based on the scientific validity of what is taught but upon other criteria [24]. Ulett has noted: Certification of acupuncturists is a sham. While a few of those so accredited are naive physicians, most are nonmedical persons who only play at being doctor and use this certification as an umbrella for a host of unproven New Age hokum treatments. Unfortunately, a few HMOs, hospitals, and even medical schools are succumbing to the bait and exposing patients to such bogus treatments when they need real medical care. The [National Council Against Health Fraud](http://www.ncahf.org/pp/acu.html) has concluded: - Acupuncture is an unproven modality of treatment. - Its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge - Research during the past 20 years has not demonstrated that acupuncture is effective against any disease. - Perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion, counter-irritation, conditioning, and other psychologic mechanisms. - The use of acupuncture should be restricted to appropriate research settings, - Insurance companies should not be required by law to cover acupuncture treatment, - Licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out. - Consumers who wish to try acupuncture should discuss their situation with a knowledgeable physician who has no commercial interest [25]. The NIH Debacle In 1997, a Consensus Development Conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and several other agencies concluded that \"there is sufficient evidence . . . of acupuncture's value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value.\" [26] The panelists also suggested that the federal government and insurance companies expand coverage of acupuncture so more people can have access to it. These conclusions were not based on research done after NCAHF's position paper was published. Rather, they reflected the bias of the panelists who were selected by a planning committee dominated by acupuncture proponents [274]. NCAHF board chairman Wallace Sampson, M.D., described the conference \"a consensus of proponents, not a consensus of valid scientific opinion.\" Although the consensus report described some serious problems, it failed to place them into proper perspective. The panel acknowledged that \"the vast majority of papers studying acupuncture consist of case reports, case series, or intervention studies with designs inadequate to assess efficacy\" and that \"relatively few\" high-quality controlled trials have been published about acupuncture's effects. But it reported that \"the World Health Organization has listed more than 40 [conditions] for which [acupuncture] may be indicated.\" This sentence should have been followed by a statement that the list was not valid. Far more serious, although the consensus report touched on Chinese acupuncture theory, it failed to point out the danger and economic waste involved in going to practitioners who can't make appropriate diagnoses. The report noted: - The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. The acupuncturist can correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin. - Acupuncture focuses on a holistic, energy-based approach to the patient rather than a disease-oriented diagnostic and treatment model. - Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the \"acupuncture points,\" the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial. Even more elusive is the scientific basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of Qi, the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture. Simply stated, this means that if you go to a practitioner who practices traditional Chinese medicine, you are unlikely to be properly diagnosed. Very few publications have mentioned this, which strikes me as very strange. Even Consumer Reports magazine has advised readers who want acupuncture treatment to consult a practitioner who is NCCAOM-certified. I advise people to avoid \"certified\" practitioners.because the training needed for certification is based on nonsensical TCM theories, the safest way to obtain acupuncture is from a medical doctor who does research at a university-based medical school and does not espouse such theories. Diagnostic Variability In 1998, following a lecture I attended at a local college, an experienced TCM practitioner diagnosed me by taking my pulse and looking at my tongue. He stated that my pulse showed signs of \"stress\" and that my tongue indicated I was suffering from \"congestion of the blood.\" A few minutes later, he told a woman that her pulse showed premature ventricular contractions (a disturbance of the heart's rhythm that could be harmless or significant, depending on whether the individual has underlying heart disease). He suggested that both of us undergo treatment with acupuncture and herbs\u2014which would have cost about $90 per visit. I took the woman's pulse and found that it was completely normal. I believe that the majority of nonmedical acupuncturists rely on improper diagnostic procedures. The NIH consensus panel should have emphasized the seriousness of this problem. Subsequent research has confirmed that TCM diagnosis has very little to do with people's real health problems. At least six studies have found that when multiple practitioners see the same patient, their TCM diagnoses vary considerably. In a study published in 2001, a 40-year-old woman with chronic back pain who visited seven acupuncturists during a 2-week period was diagnosed with \"Qi stagnation\" by 6 of them, \"blood stagnation\" \"kidney Qi deficiency\" deficiency\" by 1, and \"liver Qi deficiency\" by 1. The proposed treatments varied even more. Among the six who recorded their recommendations, the practitioners planned to use between 7 and 26 needles inserted into 4 to 16 specific \"acupuncture points\" in the back, leg, hand, and foot. Of 28 acupuncture points selected, only 4 (14%) were prescribed by two or more acupuncturists. [28]. The study appears to have been designed to make the results as consistent as possible. All of the acupuncturists had been trained at a school of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Six other volunteers were excluded because they \"used highly atypical practices,\" and three were excluded because they had been in practice for less than three years. The study's authors stated that the diagnostic findings showed \"considerable consistency\" because nearly all of the practitioners found Qi or blood stagnation. However, the most likely explanation was that these are diagnosed in nearly everyone. In another study, six TCM acupuncturists evaluated the same six patients on the same day. Twenty diagnoses and 65 acupoints were used at least once. The diagnosis of \"Qi/Blood Stagnation with Kidney Deficiency\" and the acupoint UB23 were used for every patient by most acupuncturists. However, consistency across acupuncturists regarding diagnostic details and other acupoints was poor. No diagnoses, and only one acupoint, were used preferentially for a subgroup of patients. Some diagnoses and treatment recommendations were dependent more on the practitioner than on the patient. Fine-grained diagnoses and most acupoints were unrelated to either patient or practitioner. The researchers concluded that TCM diagnoses and treatment recommendations for specific patients with chronic low back pain vary widely from one practitioner to another [29]. Another study examined TCM diagnoses and treatments for patients with chronic low-back pain using two separate sets of treatment records. Information from more than 150 initial visits was available for analysis. A diagnosis of \"Qi and Blood Stagnation\" or \"Qi Stagnation\" was made for 85% of patients. A diagnosis of kidney deficiency (or one of its three subtypes) was made for 33%-51% of patients. Other specific diagnoses were made for less than 20% of the patients. An average of 12-13 needles was used in each treatment. Although more than 85 different acupoints were used in each data set, only 5 or 6 acupoints were used in more than 20 of the treatments in each data set. Only two of those acupoints (UB23, UB40) were the same for both sources of data. More than half of the patients received adjunctive treatments, including heat (36%-67%), and cupping (16%-21%). There was substantial variability in treatments among providers [30]. In a larger study published in 2004, three TCM practitioners examined the same 39 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients separately at the University of Maryland General Clinical Research Center. Each patient filled out a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination that included tongue and pulse diagnosis. Then each practitioner provided both a TCM diagnosis and a herbal prescription. Agreement on TCM diagnoses among the 3 pairs of TCM practitioners ranged from 25.6% to 33.3%. The degree to which the herbal prescriptions agreed with textbook recommended practice of each TCM diagnosis ranged from 87.2% to 100%. The study's authors concluded: The total agreement on TCM diagnosis on RA patients among 3 TCM practitioners was low. When less stringent, but theoretically justifiable, criteria were employed, greater consensus was obtained. . . . The correspondence between the TCM diagnosis and the herbal formula prescribed for that diagnosis was high, although there was little agreement among the 3 practitioners with respect to the herbal formulas prescribed for individual patients [31]. The University of Maryland researchers then repeated the above study using 40 RA patients and three practitioners who had had at least five years of experience. The results were nearly identical to the previous findings [32]. In another study, 37 participants with frequent headaches were independently evaluated by three licensed acupuncturists said to be highly trained in TCM. The acupuncturists identified the meridians and type of dysfunction they believed were contributing to the participants' symptoms. The acupuncturists also ascribed one or more TCM diagnoses to each participant and selected eight acupuncture points for needling. Some variation in TCM pattern diagnosis and point selection was observed for all subjects. \"Liver Yang\" and \"Qi dysfunction\" were diagnosed in more than two thirds of subjects. Acupuncture points Liver 3, Large Intestine 4, and Governing Vessel (DU) 20 were the most commonly selected points for treatment [33]. It would be fascinating to see what would happen if a healthy person who needed no medical treatment was examined by multiple acupuncturists. The Bottom Line TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses. Even if they could agree, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable its practitioners to offer rational care.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-twenty-two) [Do Pinched Nerves Reduce Nerve Energy Flow?](https://quackwatch.org/chiropractic/general/chiropinch/) Many chiropractors have claimed that spinal misalignments cause or contribute to disease by choking off \"nerve energy\" to body tissues. In 1975, I filed a criminal charge against a Pennsylvania chiropractor who, among other things, had faslely advertised that: When a spinal segment is not in its normal position, it partly closes nerve openings between the vertebrae, which in turn causes the nerves to be pinched. This will cause a reduction in the flow of nerve energy to some part of the body.

Many chiropractors have claimed that spinal misalignments cause or contribute to disease by choking off \"nerve energy\" to body tissues. In 1975, I filed a criminal charge against a Pennsylvania chiropractor who, among other things, had faslely advertised that: When a spinal segment is not in its normal position, it partly closes nerve openings between the vertebrae, which in turn causes the nerves to be pinched. This will cause a reduction in the flow of nerve energy to some part of the body. When this occurs the organs and tissues which the pinched nerve supplies cannot function properly . . . pain and susceptibility to disease will result. That is why the chiropractic profession has always stated that to maintain good health and freedom from disease, all spinal misalignments should be promptly checked and corrected. Edmund S. Crelin, Ph.D., Professor of Anatomy at the Yale University School of Medicine, served as an expert witness in the case and supplied detailed analyses of various claims. With respect to the above, he stated: Nerves do not give off a flow of nerve energy. Nerves are gland cells. They produce and release a hormone that causes the inhibition or the contraction of muscle cells and the inhibition or enhancement of secretion by a gland cell that includes another nerve cell. That is all they do, no more, no less. They do not actually conduct electricity or any other form of energy. When a nerve cell undergoes its function of secreting a hormone, changes occur in its outer cell membrane that allow electrically-charged ions to move in and out of the cell in a step-wise fashion along the full extent of the nerve. This is what really occurs when a nerve is described as \"conducting an impulse\" or \"firing.\" A spinal nerve at the intervertebral opening is actually a thin tube of connective tissue containing the extensions of millions of nerve cells. These extensions are the axons that are also described as \"fibers.\" This latter term is misleading because it connotes a certain firmness such as fine wires would have. Nothing could be more incorrect. The axons are delicate, flimsy structures. Since they are merely elongated or drawn out parts of cells they need nourishment along with the cells that make up their sheaths. Therefore, delicate blood vessels are contained in what is called a nerve at the visible level. If compression of a nerve does not directly kill the axons, the axons may die because the compression cuts off the flow of blood in the vessels of the nerve. Compression of a nerve cell anywhere along its extent can cause it to secrete its hormone. If it is a sensory nerve cell, it can cause the brain to experience pain. If it is a motor nerve cell, the hormone can cause a muscle cell to contract. If the motor nerve cells to a skeletal (voluntary) muscle die, the muscle will be paralyzed and also die. This is because the motor nerve cells continuously supply skeletal muscle cells with substances needed for their survival, above and beyond the hormone the nerve cells secrete to make the muscle contract. This is not the case with the motor nerve cells to glands, heart muscle, or smooth (involuntary) muscle. Complete severance of the motor nerves from the spinal nerves to the heart, glands (salivary, thyroid, liver, pancreas, etc.), and smooth muscle of the lungs, esophagus, stomach, gall bladder, intestines, etc., has only transient effects. The gland cells and smooth and cardiac muscle cells not only survive, but function normally. They surely do not become diseased. The 1975 court case could have been very important, because the validity of chiropractic theory was a key issue. However, the case never came to trial. During its course, the Assistant District Attorney became a judge and the chiropractor's attorney was elected District Attorney, creating conflicts of interest that could not be unraveled. The chiropractor stopped using the ads to which I had objected, and the number of chiropractors who openly espouse \"pinched nerve\" theories is now small. But the concept that spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\") undermine general health still looms on the Adjudication on Subtle Energy Therapy UK](https://quackwatch.org/cases/foreign/asa/2011-2/subtle_energy/) Subtle Energy Therapy UK Date: 1 June 2011 Media: Internet (on own site) Sector: Health and beauty Number of complaints: 2 Complaint Ref: 150538 Ad A website, selling Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS) and magnesium products, on 1 March 2011, stated \"...

The proof of the efficacy of this simple protocol was in successfully helping over 75,000 people in several African nations - including Uganda and Malawi - rid themselves, primarily of malaria, but also hepatitis, cancer, and AIDS ... If your health is not perfect ... you're habitually low on energy, have trouble keeping your weight down, or blood pressure in the normal range, or constantly dealing with inflammation or pain, then there's likely a toxin, heavy metal, virus, bacteria, or parasite issue in play. Traditional medicine will typically respond by loading you up with additional pollutants, many of which indiscriminately kill healthy tissue while going after 'the bad guys'. Not so with chlorine dioxide. It only acts on harmful presences ... You can produce chlorine dioxide with a single drop, when an 'activator' of vinegar, lemon juice, or a 10% solution of citric acid is added. The latter two activators are recommended for people with Lyme disease\". Issue A complainant challenged whether: 1. the efficacy claims for MMS; and 2. the efficacy claims for magnesium were misleading and could be substantiated. 3. The ASA challenged whether the ads were irresponsible and discouraged treatment for serious medical conditions. CAP Code (Edition 12) Response 1. Subtle Energy Therapy UK (Subtle Energy) agreed to remove some of the MMS claims and provided a document by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on the use of chlorine dioxide in water treatment. They said no one had ever died from consuming a small amount of chlorine dioxide and that most food in the United States was processed at some point using chlorine dioxide to make it edible. 2. Subtle Energy said magnesium was an important mineral that was needed by every cell in the human body. They said it was necessary to carry out various biochemical functions such as enzyme activity, and listed a number of problems that magnesium deficiency could cause such as psychotic behaviour, depression and seizures. 3. Subtle Energy said they did not attempt to persuade people to use MMS and that the website contained a disclaimer that stated \"The information on our website is presented for educational purposes only and is not intended to be construed as medical advice nor is it intended to lead anyone away from a qualified health practitioner. We make absolutely no claims to diagnose, cure, treat or prevent any disease. If you have a medical condition we urge you to be supervised by a qualified healthcare professional of your choice. All products, along with all protocols, recommendations and information have not been evaluated or approved by the FDA/MHRA\". Assessment 1. Upheld The ASA welcomed Subtle Energy's immediate withdrawal of some of the MMS claims. However, we noted that the evidence provided for the remaining MMS claims only related to the properties of chlorine dioxide, not to MMS and its ability to treat the diseases it claimed to in the ad. We therefore considered that we had not seen adequate substantiation the MMS efficacy claims, and concluded the claims were misleading. On this point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 12.1, 12.2 and 12.6 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld We noted Subtle Energy's statements but did not receive any evidence to substantiate the claims. We therefore considered the claims had not been substantiated and concluded they were misleading. On this point we investigated under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 12.1, 12.2 and 12.6 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 3. Upheld We noted the website contained a disclaimer for the information on the website. However, we also noted the disclaimer stated \"We make absolutely no claims to diagnose, cure, treat or prevent any disease ...\" but the main text on the website stated that MMS could cure diseases such as malaria, hepatitis, cancer, and AIDS. We considered that was contradictory, and concluded the ad was irresponsible and discouraged essential medical treatment. On this point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 12.1, 12.2 and 12.6 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). Action The ad must not appear in its current form again. This page was posted on July 02, 2015. [Hide Full Content](#seventeen-thousand-three) [Why Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis Is Worthless](https://quackwatch.org/acupuncture/reports/diagnosis/) Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on fanciful notions that ill health is caused by \"imbalances\" of the flow of \"vital energy\" (Chi or qi) through alleged pathways called \"meridians.\" The diagnoses made by its practitioners have very little to do with people's actual health problems. One study has found that acupuncture literature does not provide a consistent framework for evaluating patients, and at least seven studies have found that when multiple practitioners see the same patient, their TCM diagnoses vary considerably. This is not surprising because TCM concepts have little relationship to anatomy and physiology and the body processes that TCM postulates cannot be measured by scientific instruments.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on fanciful notions that ill health is caused by \"imbalances\" of the flow of \"vital energy\" (Chi or qi) through alleged pathways called \"meridians.\" The diagnoses made by its practitioners have very little to do with people's actual health problems. One study has found that acupuncture literature does not provide a consistent framework for evaluating patients, and at least seven studies have found that when multiple practitioners see the same patient, their TCM diagnoses vary considerably. This is not surprising because TCM concepts have little relationship to anatomy and physiology and the body processes that TCM postulates cannot be measured by scientific instruments. A Personal Anecdote In 1998, following a lecture I attended at a local college, an experienced TCM practitioner diagnosed me by taking my pulse and looking at my tongue. He stated that my pulse showed signs of \"stress\" and that my tongue indicated I was suffering from \"congestion of the blood.\" He was mistaken. I do not suffer from stress, and my blood circulates normally. A few minutes later, the acupuncturist told a woman that her pulse showed premature ventricular contractions (a disturbance of the heart's rhythm that could be harmless or significant, depending on whether the individual has underlying heart disease). He suggested that both of us undergo treatment with acupuncture and herbs\u2014which would have cost about $90 per visit. I took the woman's pulse and found that it was completely normal. Published Studies Researchers who examined 16 TCM acupuncture texts or treatment articles to determine the consistency of diagnosis and recommended treatment for chronic low-back pain. Although 24 diagnostic patterns were described by one or more texts, only 4 patterns were described by at least half of them. Most texts (12/16) described only 3 or 4 patterns. The patterns could be categorized into 3 broad types: - Cold, damp, wind, heat channel obstruction patterns - Kidney vacuity patterns (sometimes differentiated into yang and yin patterns) - blood (or blood and qi) stasis patterns. Several acupuncture points were recommended by most texts regardless of the diagnosis, whereas other acupoints were recommended for specific diagnostic patterns. There was, however, substantial variation between texts in recommended acupoints, with fewer than 20% of all acupoints recommended by half or more of the texts [1]. In a study published in 2001, a 40-year-old woman with chronic back pain who visited seven acupuncturists during a 2-week period was diagnosed with \"Qi stagnation\" by 6 of them, \"blood stagnation\" \"kidney Qi deficiency\" deficiency\" by 1, and \"liver Qi deficiency\" by 1. The proposed treatments varied even more. Among the six who recorded their recommendations, the practitioners planned to use between 7 and 26 needles inserted into 4 to 16 specific \"acupuncture points\" in the back, leg, hand, and foot. Of 28 acupuncture points selected, only 4 (14%) were prescribed by two or more acupuncturists. [2]. The study appears to have been designed to make the results as consistent as possible. All of the acupuncturists had been trained at a school of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Six other volunteers were excluded because they \"used highly atypical practices,\" and three were excluded because they had been in practice for less than three years. The study's authors stated that the diagnostic findings showed \"considerable consistency\" because nearly all of the practitioners found Qi or blood stagnation. However, the most likely explanation was that these are diagnosed in nearly everyone. In another study, six TCM acupuncturists evaluated the same six patients on the same day. Twenty diagnoses and 65 acupoints were used at least once. The diagnosis of \"Qi/Blood Stagnation with Kidney Deficiency\" and the acupoint UB23 were used for every patient by most acupuncturists. However, consistency across acupuncturists regarding diagnostic details and other acupoints was poor. No diagnoses, and only one acupoint, were used preferentially for a subgroup of patients. Some diagnoses and treatment recommendations were dependent more on the practitioner than on the patient. Fine-grained diagnoses and most acupoints were unrelated to either patient or practitioner. The researchers concluded that TCM diagnoses and treatment recommendations for specific patients with chronic low back pain vary widely from one practitioner to another [3]. Another study examined TCM diagnoses and treatments for patients with chronic low-back pain using two separate sets of treatment records. Information from more than 150 initial visits was available for analysis. A diagnosis of \"Qi and Blood Stagnation\" or \"Qi Stagnation\" was made for 85% of patients. A diagnosis of kidney deficiency (or one of its three subtypes) was made for 33%-51% of patients. Other specific diagnoses were made for less than 20% of the patients. An average of 12-13 needles was used in each treatment. Although more than 85 different acupoints were used in each data set, only 5 or 6 acupoints were used in more than 20 of the treatments in each data set. Only two of those acupoints (UB23, UB40) were the same for both sources of data. More than half of the patients received adjunctive treatments, including heat (36%-67%), and cupping (16%-21%). There was substantial variability in treatments among providers [4]. In a larger study published in 2004, three TCM practitioners examined the same 39 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients separately at the University of Maryland General Clinical Research Center. Each patient filled out a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination that included tongue and pulse diagnosis. Then each practitioner provided both a TCM diagnosis and a herbal prescription. Agreement on TCM diagnoses among the 3 pairs of TCM practitioners ranged from 25.6% to 33.3%. The degree to which the herbal prescriptions agreed with textbook recommended practice of each TCM diagnosis ranged from 87.2% to 100%. The study's authors concluded: The total agreement on TCM diagnosis on RA patients among 3 TCM practitioners was low. When less stringent, but theoretically justifiable, criteria were employed, greater consensus was obtained. . . . The correspondence between the TCM diagnosis and the herbal formula prescribed for that diagnosis was high, although there was little agreement among the 3 practitioners with respect to the herbal formulas prescribed for individual patients [5]. The University of Maryland researchers then repeated the above study using 40 RA patients and three practitioners who had had at least five years of experience. The results were nearly identical to the previous findings [6]. In another study, 37 participants with frequent headaches were independently evaluated by three licensed acupuncturists said to be highly trained in TCM. The acupuncturists identified the meridians and type of dysfunction they believed were contributing to the participants' symptoms. The acupuncturists also ascribed one or more TCM diagnoses to each participant and selected eight acupuncture points for needling. Some variation in TCM pattern diagnosis and point selection was observed for all subjects. \"Liver Yang\" and \"Qi dysfunction\" were diagnosed in more than two thirds of subjects. Acupuncture points Liver 3, Large Intestine 4, and Governing Vessel (DU) 20 were the most commonly selected points for treatment [7]. In a \"laboratory\" study of tongue diagnosis, 30 TCM practitioners were asked to examine 10 high quality images in each of two sessions. For each image, if at least 24 (80%) of the practitioners agreed on a diagnosis, the result was considered significant. This occurred only 17.3% in the first session and 19.1% in the second session when the practitioners were given two choices to pick from. But when the choices were more complex, they agreed among themselves less than 5%. The researchers concluded that \"TCM tongue inspection for specific characteristics examined was not a reliable diagnostic method, at least for the group of TCM practitioners involved in this study.\" [8] The Bottom Line TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses. Even if they could agree, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care. References - Birch S, Sherman K.

Definitional Problems The biggest problem in discussing this subject is that \"alternative\" has many possible meanings. The dictionary definition is a choice between mutually exclusive possibilities. Until the late 1980s, in standard medical usage, the word \"alternative\" referred to choices among effective treatments. In some cases they were equally effective (for example, the use of radiation or surgery for certain cancers); in others the expected outcome differed but there were reasonable tradeoffs between risks and benefits. During recent years, however, the term has been applied to hundreds of unsubstantiated methods that differ from standard (science-based) care. The best way to minimize confusion is to classify alternatives as genuine, experimental, or questionable. Genuine alternatives are comparable methods that have met science-based criteria for safety and effectiveness; experimental alternatives are unproven but have a plausible rationale and are undergoing responsible investigation; and questionable \"alternatives\" are groundless and lack a scientifically plausible rationale. Whether some approaches are valid depends not only on their methods but how they are used and what claims are made for them. Spinal manipulation, for example, can be useful in properly selected cases of low-back pain. But manipulating the spine once a month for \"preventive maintenance\" or to promote general health\u2014as many chiropractors recommend\u2014is senseless. Relaxation techniques have a limited but acceptable role in the treatment of anxiety states. But biofeedback for \"mind expansion\" or meditation for \"balancing life energy\" are another matter. Managed Care Implications Although patient demand is a factor, most managed-care coverage is determined by evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The program that Dean Ornish, M.D., developed for people with coronary heart disease illustrates how this selection process should work. Ornish's approach includes smoking cessation, stress-management techniques, daily exercise, and a 10%-fat vegetarian diet. This program is novel because its dietary fat level is half the lowest level the American Heart Association recommends for people unresponsive to less stringent cholesterol-control measures. Ornish has documented his findings in a scientific manner, using before-and-after measurements of coronary blood flow and publishing his results in peer-reviewed scientific journals. As a result, many insurance plans have embraced it. Coverage can also be dictated by state or federal laws. Most states have \"insurance equality laws\" requiring chiropractic coverage under various circumstances. A few require coverage for acupuncture, and the state of Washington has ordered inclusion of naturopathy and massage therapy as well. The impact of such laws depends on how much is covered, who provides it, and how the coverage is structured. Many insurance companies forced to cover chiropractic services have been displeased with the results. Chiropractic leaders misrepresent the significance of workers' compensation studies which found that patients treated by chiropractors were more satisfied and returned to work sooner than patients treated medically. These studies did not scientifically validate what the chiropractors did and were not designed for that purpose. Although most contain data appearing to favor chiropractic, their authors did not evaluate whether the patients had comparable problems. In addition, the duration and costs of disability and time lost from work are influenced by factors other than effectiveness. In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study comparing the cost of low-back pain treatment by family physicians, orthopedists, and chiropractors in North Carolina. The median total charges were $545 by urban chiropractors, $383 by orthopedists, $348 physicians, and $169 for urban primary-care physicians. Although chiropractors charged less per visit, their treatment was costlier because they saw their patients about five times as often [1]. Additional data were collected at the Group Health Cooperative, a staff model HMO in Madison, Wisconsin. Dan Futch, D.C., chief of chiropractic practice, found that the patients he saw require an average of three visits per episode, considerably fewer than the average reported for chiropractors in other settings. Futch was also executive director of the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine, a small group of medically oriented chiropractors who renounced chiropractic's unscientific dogma. Many chiropractors believe that after a painful condition resolves, patients should continue indefinitely for \"maintenance care.\" Many also believe that every spine should be examined and adjusted monthly or weekly throughout life. No evidence exists that either of these approaches benefits patients. Managed care can limit overutilization by excluding chiropractors who practice unscientifically and setting limits on the rest. Rather than raising their standards, chiropractors have file lawsuits and ask legislators to break down managed-care barriers. Can Oil and Water Mix? Dr. Futch's experience demonstrates that scientifically oriented chiropractors (a tiny minority of practitioners) can be integrated into managed care. What about acupuncturists, homeopaths, naturopaths, and unscientific chiropractors? [Acupuncture](acu.html) involves stimulation of the skin at designated points. Traditional practitioners claim to balance the body's \"life force\" by inserting needles (or using other modalities) where imaginary horizontal and vertical lines (\"meridians\") meet on the surface of the body. These points are said to represent various internal organs (some of which are nonexistent). Some practitioners reject the pseudoscientific trappings and postulate that pain relief occurs through mechanisms such as the production of endorphins. I do not believe that acupuncture is cost-effective for any purpose or influences the course of any organic disease. [Homeopathy](homeo.html) is based on the notion that symptoms can be cured by taking infinitesimal amounts of substances that, in larger amounts, can produce similar symptoms in healthy people. Homeopaths also claim that the more dilute the remedy, the more powerful it is. Some \"remedies\" are said to be so dilute that no molecule of the original substance remains, only an \"essence\" that cures by bolstering the body's \"vital force.\" I do not believe that practitioners who prescribe worthless products can fit into a science-based health-care team. [Naturopathy ](Naturopathy/naturopathy.html)is based on the notion that diseases are the body's effort to purify itself and that cures result from enhancing the body's ability to heal itself. Naturopathic treatments can include \"natural food\" diets, vitamins, herbs, tissue minerals, cell salts, manipulation, massage, exercise, diathermy, colonic enemas, acupuncture, and homeopathy. Like some chiropractors, many naturopaths believe that virtually all diseases are within the scope of their practice. I don't see how practitioners involved in so much nonsense can fit into a science-based health-care team. [Chiropractic](chiro.html) encompasses a broad spectrum of practices related to the false premise that spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\") are the cause, or underlying cause, of most ailments. Chiropractic's founder postulated that the body's \"vital force,\" which he termed \"Innate,\" expresses itself through the nervous system. Chiropractors who cling strictly to this notion allege that subluxations cause most illnesses by interfering with the flow of \"nerve energy\" to body organs. Most chiropractors acknowledge the importance of other factors in disease but tend to regard mechanical disturbances of the nervous system as an underlying cause. Many chiropractors engage in unscientific diagnostic procedures, prescribe inappropriate food supplements, and utilize homeopathic remedies. Small percentages denounce chiropractic's basic dogmas, spurn its unscientific practices, and confine their practice to musculoskeletal problems. Thus while virtually all chiropractors manipulate the spine as their primary method of treatment, their rationale and techniques vary considerably. Many homeopaths, naturopaths, and chiropractors are lukewarm or opposed to immunization. Key Questions Can unscientific practitioners be subjected to utilization review and other quality-control measures? Can practitioners immersed in \"vital forces,\" \"subluxations,\" and similar concepts provide high-quality care for their patients? Should practitioners who oppose proven preventive measures be permitted to practice within a managed-care setting? (Even worse, should they be permitted to be their own gatekeepers?) If treatments are ineffective, is there any evidence that allowing subscribers to use them will reduce the overall cost of their health care? My answer to each of these questions is no. Reference 1.

No address is given, another Web site gives its location as Iselin, New Jersey [2]. The site is registered to Yanick, doing business as Quantum Energy with an address in Highland, New York. Another Web site describes Yanick as \"an expert in the emerging field of Quantum Medicine, with over thirty years of extensive clinical experience . . . a board-certified naturopath, nutritional consultant and practitioner of Quantum Medicine.\" The \"CNC\" stands for \"Certified Nutritional Consultant,\" a questionable credential issued by the [American Association of Nutrition Consultants.](aanc.html) I assume that \"C.Q.M., means \"certified in quantum medicine.\" During the 1980s, Yanick did business as the executive director of the Hearing and Tinnitus Help Association (HTHA) and claimed to have helped thousands to overcome tinnitus and other forms of hearing and balance disorders through nutrition methods. Contributors to HTHA were eligible for a discount on the $200 price of \"The Comprehensive Nutrient and Lifestyle Program,\" which Yanick helped design. A flyer distributed by HTHA described this program as a computerized analysis that recommends nutrition supplements after analyzing information on dietary and exercise habits, \"tissue mineral analysis,\" tests on pH, urine, stool and saliva, and \"over 400 questions relating changes that take place in your body when a nutrient becomes deficient.\" [2] As far as I know, no nutrition-related strategy has any effect on tinnitus. AAQM Membership On June 26, 2002, the AAQM Web site listed 31 associate members and 5 corporate members. The corporate members include: [American Naturopathic Medical Association](http://www.anma.com/), a naturopathic group whose members hold an \"N.D.\" degree obtained through a nonaccredited correspondence school. [Quantum Energy Center](http://www.quantumenergy.com/), whose Quantum Energy Foods are said to \"provide the body with a synergistic array of thousands of known and unknown antioxidants, nutrients and powerful nutraceutical compounds that keep the body healthy against the ill effects of today's high levels of pollution and stress despite the widespread depletion of nutrients found in the Standard American Diet (SAD).\" - NutraSpectrum, a dietary supplement manufacturer whose \"quantum nutrition products\" products are said to \"integrate Oriental medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, European and native American herbology, naturopathic medicine, and the latest advances of quantum physics and nutritional biochemistry.\" The company further states that its products \"enable healing and reorganization of the human energy system to accelerate and deepen,\" \"propel nutrients, medicinal mushrooms and phytochemicals deeply into the cells to act against hidden viruses and deep rooted yeast and fungal infections,\" and \"help activate the body's innate healing abilities. Note: The domain formerly used by NutraSpectrum was acquired in 2007 by a different company that has no relationship to the previous company or its claims. [ELF Laboratory, Inc.](http://www.lightbeamgenerator.com/), which markets the LBG Light Beam Generator, which is claimed to \"restore proper functioning of the body's immune system\" by \"removing toxic materials that may be blocking the lymphatic system.\" The company claims that the device can prevent arthritis, breast cancer, build-up of calcified joints, carpal tunnel syndrome, cellulite, chronic injuries, clogged arteries, colitis, dental diseases and inflammation, edema, fibromyalgia, headaches, leg and back pain, lupus, mastodynia (pain in the breast), prostate cancer/enlargement, scars, sciatica, and varicose veins. The device is said to combine \"gaseous tube technology\" with \"sound efficiency and light photon therapy\" based on the work of Royal Raymond Rife. (The [Rife Generator](../../News/rife.html)is a quack device that allegedly used radio waves to shatter alleged cancer-causing bacteria.) The claims made for the LBG device are illegal.) What is \"Quantum Medicine\"? A description of Yanick's book, Quantum Medicine states that he \"has brought together multidisciplinary research with the insights of quantum physics to show that the human body is controlled and regulated by the human energy system.\" The most detailed explanation I have found is an article by Stephen Linsteadt, N.D, published in an ANMA newsletter, which states: The quantum level possesses the highest level of coherence within the human organism. Sick individuals with weak immune systems or cancer have poor and chaotic coherence with disturbed biophoton cellular communication. Therefore, disease can be seen as the result of disturbances on the cellular level that act to distort the cell's quantum perspective. This causes electrons to become misplaced in protein molecules and metabolic processes become derailed as a result. Once cellular metabolism is compromised the cell becomes isolated from the regulated process of natural growth control. The quantum naturopath recognizes that quantum coherence provides the fundamental resonance communication system of the body. All quantum naturopathic therapies must, therefore, be aimed at re-establishing cellular resonance. Quantum naturopaths are experts in bio-energetic nutrition with an emphasis on providing adequate defenses for free radical damage and re-establishing the body's bio-electric communication system by detoxifying the connective tissue matrix [4]. It appears to me that \"quantum medicine\" practitioners\u2014many of whom are not licensed as health professionals\u2014have concocted a nonexistent \"energy system\" to help peddle products and procedures to their clients. \"Quantum medicine\" uses scientific terminology, but it is nonsense. ELF Laboratory Responds On October 23, 2002, the research director of ELF Laboratory notified me that the writer that they had hired had made some misstatements and that they had \"changed the verbiage to better state the 'capabilities' of the technology\" and that the only claim they make is that the LBG is \"a method for facilitating lymph movement using electrophoresis.\" [5] It appears to me that the new wording is no more valid than the original.

In its December 2, 2002 issue, Newsweek published an ill-conceived special report on \"The Science of Alternative \"Editor's Desk\" column, Mark Whitaker wrote: \"We're proud to be working with Harvard Health Publications and its editor in chief, Dr. Anthony Komaroff, to bring you the best wisdom that our team of veteran health journalists and Harvard's experts have to offer.\" Unfortunately, the best wisdom they offer is packaged with propaganda promoting false notions about so-called complementary and alternative medicine (sCAM). Here are some of the problems with Newsweek's reporting. - The notion of \"the science of alternative medicine\" falsely implies that a meaningful category of healthcare called \"alternative medicine\" exists and is scientifically based. But in common usage, the term \"alternative medicine\" is a euphemism used by enthusiasts and profiteers to give the appearance of legitimacy to methods promoted with scientifically implausible, invalidated, or nonvalidated claims. - An introduction to the report includes the false generalization that \"'complementary' and 'alternative' therapies haven't been the subject of rigorous scientific testing-until now.\" However, many methods that have been promoted as being \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" have been tested rigorously and not been shown to add to health outcomes when combined with proven methods or substitute for proven methods. For example, in rigorous tests, megavitamin C and laetrile have failed as cancer treatments. - Geoffrey Cowley, one of Newsweek's reporters, refers to acupuncture as credible. But reviews of clinical studies of acupuncture do not support claims that acupuncture is effective for a wide variety of conditions. Beneficial effects have been reported for some types of acupuncture in treating symptoms such as pain and nausea. However, these effects may result from distraction, expectation, suggestion, conditioning, and characteristics of the client-practitioner relationship rather than anything special about acupuncture. Acupuncture has not been proven to alter the course of any disease. - Cowley refers to chiropractic as credible. But chiropractic has nonsensical central tenets about how the nervous system affects health, and has conflicting factions offering various dubious technique systems. Since 1895, when chiropractic was dreamt up by self-described grocer and \"magnetic healer\" D.D. Palmer, chiropractors have made no significant scientific contribution to healthcare and many of them have tried to undermine consumers' confidence in rational healthcare and public-health protections. - Cowley notes: \"So after dismissing CAM therapies as quackery for the better part of a century, the medical establishment now finds itself racing to evaluate them.\" The term \"medical establishment\" is an abstraction. Use of the term in this context makes an overgeneralization about interest in evaluating sCAM therapies. Many physicians and scientists do recognize that the promotion of nonvalidated or invalidated sCAM treatments for financial gain is quackery. They would prefer research dollars to be allocated according to scientific promise rather than political agendas. Although many hospitals and research institutions are carrying out research on sCAM treatments, much of this has to do with the money trail. Large amounts of funding became available when legislation spearheaded by nostrum enthusiast Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) forced the National Instutute's of Health to create an Office of Unconventional Medicine, which evolved into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). However, after spending more than $110 million on research, NCCAM has issued no recommendations for or against the use of any sCAM treatment. - Cowley cites the survey data published by Eisenberg and colleagues in 1993 as showing that 34% of U.S. adults had received at least one \"unconventional\" therapy in 1990. But critics note that the percentage was greatly inflated because the survey included use of self-help groups, exercise, prayer, and other activities that should not be considered \"CAM.\" [1] Publicity about the study raised interest by consumers in dubious herbal and other sCAM products (as reflected in a 1997 follow-up survey), which in turn was used to justify the NCCAM boondoggle. - Cowley quotes NCCAM head Dr. Stephen Straus: \"We want to test therapies that have a plausible basis and address some unmet need.\" Cowley fails to point out that many of the studies funded so far do not have a plausible basis. The biggest of these is a $30 million NCCAM/NHLBI allocation to support a trial of chelation therapy for heart disease. Chelation's avid following and the study are mentioned in a Newsweek sidebar without mentioning chelation's implausibility [2] for this purpose. - Cowley suggests that nation's insurers are biased against \"holistic\" care. But the real \"bias\" of nation's insurers is against losing money. Unfortunately, some insurers offer of dubious treatments that they think will attract subscribers. Many plans charge an extra fee or merely enable subscribers to obtain discounts from designated practitioners. And Cowley fails to recognize that good doctors have always considered patients as whole beings and that \"holistic\" is a dangerous banner under which practitioners of nonscientific methods rally. - Another reporter, Anne Underwood, wrote about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner Nan Lu examining her tongue and \"pulses\"\u2014one for each organ of her body\u2014to diagnose \"energy leak\" from her heart and then recommend acupuncture, qigong (described misleadingly as Chinese yoga), meditation, dietary modifications, and herbal remedies containing green orange peel, sour-date seed and licorice root along with dozens of exotic ingredients. She describes Lu's activities as sounding unscientific to \"the Western mind.\" She fails to acknowledge that Lu's activities also sound unscientific to real scientists in Asia. TCM tongue and pulse examination lack validity and a rational basis for making diagnoses and recommending treatments. The diagnosis of \"energy leak\" in TCM is subjective and has no scientific basis. Modern physics recognizes energy as a material entity, as signified by Einstein's famous equation E=mc2, and explained by quantum theory. Energy is not an immaterial spirit as suggested by promoters of TCM and many other sCAM practices. - Underwood suggests that acupuncture relieves pain by boosting the body's own opiates called endorphins. But some studies have shown that blocking endorphin receptors using an opiate antagonist does not reverse pain relief following acupuncture. Besides, it is not necessary to apply needles to specific points, as in acupuncture, to release endorphins. The release can be stimulated without needles. - Underwood cites one study presented at a conference in China suggesting that acupuncture with low-level electrical stimulation can reduce drug cravings and the relapse rate among heroin addicts. But she does not mention that reviews of studies of acupuncture treatment for addiction have not supported claims that acupuncture improves addiction treatment outcomes. And running electrical current through tissues isn't \"acupuncture.\" - Underwood claims that \"Chinese medications tend to have fewer side effects than Western pharmaceuticals\" and that \"Western medicine is riskier.\" She provides an unsound argument for this generalization. She writes that a 1996 survey of the most populous Australian states found one adverse event from both herbs and acupuncture for every eight to nine months of a doctor's full-time practice, or one problem per 633 consultations. She compares this survey data with the results of a study published in JAMA in 1998 that used a totally different methodology: a meta-analysis of prospective studies. The authors of the 1998 paper estimated (not \"found\" as Underwood writes) that more than 100,000 drug reactions occurred among patients in U.S. hospitals in a single year. It is not reasonable to draw conclusions about the relative risks of all prescription drug treatments versus all herbal treatments by comparing adverse event data from hospitalized patients (who are often in weakened and uncertain conditions) with data on patients who visit doctors. The authors of the meta-analysis caution that their \"results must be viewed with circumspection because of heterogeneity among studies [in their analyses] and small biases in the samples.\" Underwood's comparison is also faulty because it only considers adverse events following treatments and not benefits offered by the treatments. She does not consider what widespread adulteration of Chinese herbal treatments with synthetic drugs indicates about what developers of these products think their herbs have to offer in terms of benefits. (Other potential adulterants and contaminants of herbal products include botanicals, microorganisms, microbial toxins, pesticides, fumigation agents, and toxic metals.) And, as reported in the journal Science, \"According to a 1999 survey by the Hong Kong government, only 22% of outpatient medical consultations in the city were provided by Chinese medicine practitioners. Officials think the percentage is even lower, and they believe that safety concerns are driving people away from TCM.\" [3] Herbal products are prone to misbranding because of difficulties in correctly identifying plant species, chemical variations within plant species, lack of standardization, additions of chemicals, and intentional substitution of one plant for another. Some traditional Chinese herbs have been found to contain aristolochic acid which has been linked to kidney destruction and urinary tract cancers. In June 2002, Health Canada warned consumers not to take seven products marketed as traditional Chinese Medicines because they were found to contain undeclared prescription drugs. In January 2003, the Director-General of Health for New Zealand warned consumers to stop taking eleven traditional Chinese medicines sold as herbal remedies after investigation and testing revealed they contain prescription medicines and toxic substances. - Underwood discusses the increasing demand of Westerners for Chinese medicine services without mentioning the increasing demand of people in China for modern medicine [3]. Underwood offers a testimonial about a research scientist who said she had \"serious dizzy spells\" after suffering from West Nile virus. The scientist said treatment from \"Western specialists\" did not make her spells go away, but her dizziness, allergies, and chronic shoulder problem were \"gone\" after an acupuncturist diagnosed \"stagnant liver qi\" and administered acupuncture and herbal remedies. Underwood quotes the scientist as saying: \"This doesn't make sense, but there's something there.\" Underwood concludes: \"If Chinese medicine can help complications of West Nile virus, can it work for insomnia? The jury is out, but I'm optimistic.\" Underwood's unjustified conclusion about Chinese medicine and her failure to explain to readers why testimonials are unreliable as evidence of a treatment's efficacy is egregious journalism. - In her brief article about Ginkgo biloba-based treatments, Mary Carmichael suggests correctly that the verdict isn't in yet regarding whether it works to sustain memory abilities into old age. She also points out that \"mental exercise is still the best way to stay sharp.\" But then she recommends: \"So try a supplement, but remember: memorizing the names of all those chemicals [mixed with Ginkgo biloba in commercial formulas] may fortify your brain more than the chemicals themselves.\" It is imprudent for consumers to spend money on products of unknown benefit, but Carmichael encourages them to gamble on ginkgo anyway. Her advice defies the ethical principle of nonmaleficence, i.e., first, do no harm. She fails to mention that ginkgo taken orally occasionally causes headache, nausea, gastric symptoms, diarrhea, or allergic skin reactions and may be associated with seizures, cerebral hemorrhages, and other adverse reactions [4]. Her article included no mention of ConsumerLab.com's finding that nearly one quarter of thirty brands of Ginkgo biloba extract products tested did not appear to contain what the label promised. - David Noonan's article on various methods promoted as \"complementary and alternative medicine\" or \"CAM\" for children mentions a three-year NIH-funded study of acupuncture treatment of cerebral palsy in which some patients showed improvements in some areas of functioning and others did not. Although Noonan provides no description of the study design, including whether the study included a control group, he describes the investigator, Burris Duncan, as \"a member of a small but growing cadre of researchers who are subjecting pediatric CAM therapies to the rigors of traditional, randomized, controlled clinical trials.\" Rigorous studies should give clear answers, but Noonan quotes Duncan as saying: \"[The subjects] all changed in different ways so it's very difficult to know what to make of this.\" Noonan raises additional questions about the rigor of Duncan's work by writing: \"Determined not to raise false hopes, Duncan says the only thing he knows for certain is that more research is needed, and he plans to continue his work.\" Noonan also mentions that Duncan conducted the study because he was impressed with what he observed in China of acupuncture and other treatments of cerebral palsy. Although Noonan's article includes Duncan's subjective impressions, it does not address the superstitious basis for acupuncture treatment, the implausibility of acupuncture having special benefits for children with cerebral palsy, and the importance of focusing scientific resources on testing plausible rather than implausible treatments. - Noonan is mistaken when he describes studies underway to determine the effectiveness of treatments as osteopathic manipulation in preventing ear infections as \"serious science.\" It's implausible that osteopathic manipulation prevents ear infections. NIH's funding of implausible treatments reflects serious politics, not serious science. - Noonan's placement of the word \"But\" in the following passage misleads readers by making an anecdote seem more informative than the evidence from well-designed studies: \"While some research suggests an association between dairy and wheezing in children, more studies are needed. But the regimen worked for Grant Janz, who has now gone more than two months without wheezing.\" Of course, if Grant stopped wheezing for two months, it does not mean that his regimen [of no dairy] \"worked.\" - A sidebar to Noonan's article recommends the book Healthy Child, Whole Child by Stuart Ditchek, MD, Russell Greenfield, MD, and Lynn Murray Willeford. The authors are all disciples of \"integrative medicine\" guru Andrew Weil, MD, who wrote the book's foreword. As Weil has done previously, the authors mischaracterize regular medicine as \"conventional\" or \"allopathic\" and then suggest that (a) its \"don't just stand there, do something attitude\" makes it excellent for medical and surgical emergencies; (b) it may be less useful for chronic conditions and (c) it may be unnecessarily aggressive in situations where time or a more gentle approach may be equally effective. [p. 5] It doesn't appear that the authors actually believe in this characterization of medicine; otherwise, why would they prudently recommend childhood vaccinations? And, apparently, the authors themselves have that \"don't just stand there, do something attitude,\" especially in treating self-limited conditions. They write: \"In most cases, the therapies we recommend have at least some supportive research evidence and always have anecdotal evidence of efficacy.\" But it's easy to come up with cheery anecdotes for just about any nostrum. And it's easy to meet the lenient standard of \"at least some supportive research evidence\" by citing poorly designed, mostly irrelevant, or anomalous research studies providing far less than extraordinary evidence for extraordinary hypotheses. A molehill of supportive evidence would meet the authors' standard even when a mountain of conflicting scientific evidence and knowledge is available. Based on preliminary findings and/or anecdotes, the authors are quick to jump to conclusions that treatments work: \"If a potentially effective therapy is safe and relatively inexpensive, we don't feel a need to wait for further research to explain how it works\u2014it's enough for us to know that it works.\" [p. 167]. Thus, they recommend various dubious treatments including: (a) cranial osteopathy for ear infections, headaches, sinus or respiratory problems, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder; (b) homeopathic products to treat sore throats, colds, and other self-limiting conditions; and (c) acupuncture for acute sinusitis. The title of their chapter on traditional Chinese medicine is an example of the \"everybody says so\" fallacy: \"A Billion People Can't Be Wrong.\" If a billion people rely on anecdotes to conclude that a treatment has therapeutic value, then they can be just as wrong as Ditchek, Greenfield, and Willeford. Regarding so-called \"energy medicine\" methods, they write: \"We have seen promising anecdotal or research evidence for some of them and others are simply too wacky for us to consider.\" [p. 250] Among the \"energy medicine\" methods that are not too wacky for them to consider are \"therapeutic touch\" and \"external qi gong.\" The authors fail to mention published critiques of these methods. The closest the authors come to addressing the irrationality of \"energy medicine\" is: \"We're on somewhat shaky ground scientifically when we talk about energy medicine because we are talking about subtle energies that cannot be measured by currently available scientific instruments.\" [p. 248-249] But even this statement is misleading. The qualifiers \"somewhat\" and \"currently available\" don't belong in the sentence. And it's simply wrong to describe imaginary energies as \"subtle.\" - The sidebar includes Ditchek and Greenfield's recommendation to give echinacea along with vitamin C to children with colds. It is true that Echinacea purpurea extracts have been demonstrated to have significant immune system actions. However, it is not clear that taking such extracts provides relief for people with colds [5]. And retail echinacea products are often misbranded [6]. Vitamin C supplementation has been found to reduce the severity and duration of colds slightly, at best. Spending on such remedies reflects the \"don't just stand there, do something attitude\" that Ditchek and Greenfield criticize. - Another book the sidebar recommends is The Holistic Pediatrician by Kathi J. Kemper, MD, MPH. Kemper's book is, for the most part, a useful resource for parents. The vast majority of healthcare methods recommended in the book are rational and fit right in the medical mainstream. The book also provides prudent warnings to consumers about herbal products available to consumers in the United States. And Kemper does not rely on anecdotes as evidence. The main problem with the book is that Kemper embraces studies finding various \"CAM\" treatments as effective without considering whether the results make sense, are clinically significant, or are attributable to research design problems. For example, she cites a paper by Jennifer Jacobs and her colleagues in support of her suggestion to consider seeing a homeopathic practitioner to administer homeopathic remedies (which probably contain none of the supposedly active ingredients) for childhood diarrhea. But, as pointed out in a published critique, the study showed no clinically significant benefits of homeopathic treatment, no benefits were demonstrated for most measured outcome variables, different homeopathic products were used on different subjects, and the subjects did not have diarrhea severe enough for treatment, rather than monitoring, to be indicated. Based on similarly shaky evidence, Kemper, suggests trying: (a) \"therapeutic touch\" for burns or fever; (b) visiting a TCM practitioner who can recommend an herbal tea for eczema treatment; (c) homeopathic remedies containing \"pulsatilla\" to treat ear infections (followed, if the infections don't clear up in 24 hours, by seeing a physician); and (d) acupuncture treatment for allergies, asthma, bedwetting, headache prevention, and nausea/vomiting. According to a description of Kemper in the second edition of the book, she was recruited in 1998 by Harvard Medical School to become the first director of the Center for Holistic Pediatric Education and Research. In his foreword to the second edition of Kemper's book, her colleague Herbert Benson, MD, President of the Mind-Body Medical Institute wrote: \"On the other hand, hucksterism and quackery are alive and well. Con men manipulate millions via mass media and the Internet; and it takes a physician experienced in both traditional and alternative medicine to keep perspective in the face of sales tactics appealing to nature, forgotten mysteries, and forbidden fruits.\" [p. xi] Benson is mistaken. \"Alternative medicine\" is a mere marketing label promoted as if it were a medical speciality. Consumers need the perspectives of experts in healthy skepticism. - In a mostly balanced and reasonable accompanying article about the placebo effect, Harvard Medical School faculty members Ted Kaptchuk, David Eisenberg, and Anthony Komaroff seem to falsely imply that skeptics have little reason to doubt therapeutic claims made for methods promoted as CAM. After describing the placebo effect as \"the healing that occurs not because of a particular drug or treatment but because of the expectations, beliefs or hopes embedded in the encounter between a patient and a clinician,\" they state: \"Skeptics often dismiss responses to complementary and alternative therapies as 'mere' placebo effects. And, until recently, experts have paid the placebo effect only grudging respect, some insisting that people who experience it must have simply misperceived either their illness or their recovery.\" However, careful skeptics do not quickly turn to the placebo effect as an explanation for apparent positive changes following so-called complementary and alternative medicine (sCAM) treatment. And they don't jump to the conclusion that such changes are \"responses\" to sCAM. Moreover, unlike Kaptchuk and his colleagues, they recognize that it is reasonable to not minimize either the plausibility or prevalence of patients misperceiving their health status. People who recover from serious illnesses after using sCAM methods in combination with science-based methods often jump to the conclusion that the seemingly more exotic and passionately promoted sCAM methods deserve most of the credit. Patients and caregivers misperceive illnesses and recovery due to a variety of other factors including misdiagnoses, unduly pessimistic prognoses, failure to recognize variations in the natural course of diseases, psychological needs, and the presence of euphoria-inducing chemicals in some sCAM treatments. Unlike many sCAM practitioners, skeptics also appreciate how easy it is to misperceive potentially dangerous treatments as safe, particularly when effects develop over time, occur infrequently, or might be confused with complications of disease. As noted in a recent review article: \"If an herb caused an adverse reaction in 1 in 1000 users, a traditional healer would have to treat 4800 patients with that herb (i.e., 1 new patient every single working day for more than 18 years) to have a 95 percent chance of observing the reaction in more than 1 user.\" [4] The word \"alternative\" may suggest \"adequacy for some purpose\" and/or \"compulsion to choose.\" [7] But irrational and dubious methods are not adequate for their intended purpose, and consumers should not feel compelled to choose them. Instead of attempting a special report on \"The Science of Alternative Medicine,\" Newsweek should have served its readers well by providing an expos\u00e9 of \"Pseudoscience Promoted as Alternative Medicine.\" As Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome Kassirer noted in a 1998 editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine: \"There cannot be two kinds of medicine\u2014conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.\" [8] References - Gorski T.

In 1975, I filed a criminal charge against a Pennsylvania chiropractor who, among other things, had faslely advertised that: When a spinal segment is not in its normal position, it partly closes nerve openings between the vertebrae, which in turn causes the nerves to be pinched. This will cause a reduction in the flow of nerve energy to some part of the body. When this occurs the organs and tissues which the pinched nerve supplies cannot function properly . . . pain and susceptibility to disease will result.

Many chiropractors have claimed that spinal misalignments cause or contribute to disease by choking off \"nerve energy\" to body tissues. In 1975, I filed a criminal charge against a Pennsylvania chiropractor who, among other things, had faslely advertised that: When a spinal segment is not in its normal position, it partly closes nerve openings between the vertebrae, which in turn causes the nerves to be pinched. This will cause a reduction in the flow of nerve energy to some part of the body. When this occurs the organs and tissues which the pinched nerve supplies cannot function properly . . . pain and susceptibility to disease will result. That is why the chiropractic profession has always stated that to maintain good health and freedom from disease, all spinal misalignments should be promptly checked and corrected. Edmund S. Crelin, Ph.D., Professor of Anatomy at the Yale University School of Medicine, served as an expert witness in the case and supplied detailed analyses of various claims. With respect to the above, he stated: Nerves do not give off a flow of nerve energy. Nerves are gland cells. They produce and release a hormone that causes the inhibition or the contraction of muscle cells and the inhibition or enhancement of secretion by a gland cell that includes another nerve cell. That is all they do, no more, no less. They do not actually conduct electricity or any other form of energy. When a nerve cell undergoes its function of secreting a hormone, changes occur in its outer cell membrane that allow electrically-charged ions to move in and out of the cell in a step-wise fashion along the full extent of the nerve. This is what really occurs when a nerve is described as \"conducting an impulse\" or \"firing.\" A spinal nerve at the intervertebral opening is actually a thin tube of connective tissue containing the extensions of millions of nerve cells. These extensions are the axons that are also described as \"fibers.\" This latter term is misleading because it connotes a certain firmness such as fine wires would have. Nothing could be more incorrect. The axons are delicate, flimsy structures. Since they are merely elongated or drawn out parts of cells they need nourishment along with the cells that make up their sheaths. Therefore, delicate blood vessels are contained in what is called a nerve at the visible level. If compression of a nerve does not directly kill the axons, the axons may die because the compression cuts off the flow of blood in the vessels of the nerve. Compression of a nerve cell anywhere along its extent can cause it to secrete its hormone. If it is a sensory nerve cell, it can cause the brain to experience pain. If it is a motor nerve cell, the hormone can cause a muscle cell to contract. If the motor nerve cells to a skeletal (voluntary) muscle die, the muscle will be paralyzed and also die. This is because the motor nerve cells continuously supply skeletal muscle cells with substances needed for their survival, above and beyond the hormone the nerve cells secrete to make the muscle contract. This is not the case with the motor nerve cells to glands, heart muscle, or smooth (involuntary) muscle. Complete severance of the motor nerves from the spinal nerves to the heart, glands (salivary, thyroid, liver, pancreas, etc.), and smooth muscle of the lungs, esophagus, stomach, gall bladder, intestines, etc., has only transient effects. The gland cells and smooth and cardiac muscle cells not only survive, but function normally. They surely do not become diseased. The 1975 court case could have been very important, because the validity of chiropractic theory was a key issue. However, the case never came to trial. During its course, the Assistant District Attorney became a judge and the chiropractor's attorney was elected District Attorney, creating conflicts of interest that could not be unraveled. The chiropractor stopped using the ads to which I had objected, and the number of chiropractors who openly espouse \"pinched nerve\" theories is now small. But the concept that spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\") undermine general health still looms on the chiropracic landscape. This article was posted on September 7, 2006.

NCAHF News Release, January 12, 2005 An outside committee dominated by \"CAM\" advocates with personal interests in promoting so-called \"complementary and alternative medicine\" has issued a report under the banner of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The committee was charged to report on \"CAM\" use, but instead chose to use this forum to reissue a thinly-veiled version of the report of the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy](https://www.ncahf.org/whc/00.html), which died two years ago on the desk of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. No one elected to the prestigious IOM practices \"CAM\" or has been recognized for \"CAM\" research. Neither the IOM nor its parent organization, the National Academy of Sciences, has endorsed the report. So-called \"complementary and alternative medicine\" is not medicine at all and is not evidence-based. It consists of everything from iridology (defining illness by the spots on the iris of the eye) to distant prayer therapy and dangerous chiropractic neck manipulations that allegedly realign \"energy flows\" that have never been seen or measured. Like the White House Commission before it, the IOM committee was composed of advocates and lacked skeptics. Predictably, the report tries to inflate the hodge-podge of bogus and disproven methods that ride under the marketing term \"CAM\" into an alleged body of health care. The report makes broad, sweeping generalizations and attempts to set an agenda for widespread adoption of study and teaching of \"CAM.\" Neither is justified. Despite spending more than $500 million over more than a decade on such research, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has not produced one study that validates any \"CAM\" practice as safe or meaningfully effective for treating any illness or condition. A typical example of the lack of rigor of the committee is its failure to condemn practices that are dangerous and deceptive. During the past four years, the IOM has produced several in-depth studies on vaccine safety and concluded that allegations about a metal-containing preservative causing health effects are unfounded. Yet, a vocal group of \"CAM\" practitioners continue to use \"chelation therapy\" to treat conditions as disparate as autism and atherosclerosis that they falsely attribute to heavy metal poisoning. Nothing in the report even mentions this invalid practice even though it was discredited by IOM member scientists. The report takes an undefined collection of unscientific practices and seeks to wrap them with the banner of the Institute, recommending unjustified expenditures of financial and human resources for study and integration into the health care delivery system. The Institute of Medicine is generally recognized for its rigor and science. The \"CAM\" report is not up to these standards and should be dutifully ignored.

In addition, Dr. Pittman waited until Patient A's fifth treatment, eight days after her first treatment, before ordering an H&H test, and Whereas although Dr. Pittman and his nurse explained to Patient A that a possible risk of this therapy was anemia, Dr. Pittman and Patient A disagree on whether he advised her that if she became severely anemic a blood transfusion would be the treatment of first choice to save her life; in any event, Dr. Pittman's informed consent form and his record of Patient A's care make no mention whatsoever that he advised her that this therapy could lead to the need for a blood transfusion, and Whereas Patient A had indicated on her intake sheet that she was a Jehovah's Witness and, therefore, Dr. Pittman should have known that there was a good chance she would not accept a transfusion, making the need for a discussion of this issue, and documentation thereof, and for close monitoring of her hemoglobin and hematocrit important, and Whereas, the day of her fifth treatment Patient A's hemoglobin had dropped to 5.8, less than half the normal value. The following day, Patient A became very weak and incoherent and her husband took her to the hospital. Her hemoglobin at that point had dropped to 4.5, and during the course of her hospitalization, after the administration of over 1300 cc of IV fluids, fell further to as low as 3.8. Patient a remained in the hospital for six days until her hemoglobin had returned to a safe level, and Whereas by instituting IV ozone and hydrogen peroxide treatment on a patient who indicated on her initial intake form she was a member of Jehovah's Witnesses without being more attentive to her hemoglobin and hematocrit, the possibility that she might require a blood transfusion but might refuse it, and documentation of these matters, Dr. Pittman departed from, or failed conform to, the standards of acceptable and prevailing medical practice, within the meaning of 90-14(a) (6) which is grounds under that section of the North Carolina General Statutes for the board to annul, suspend, revoke, condition, or limit Dr. Pittman's license to practice medicine and surgery issued by the Board, and Whereas Dr. Pittman would like to resolve this case without the need for a hearing, and Whereas Dr. Pittman acknowledges and agrees that the Board is a body duly organized under the laws of North Carolina and is the proper party to have brought this proceeding under the authority granted it in Article I of Chapter 90 of the North Carolina General Statutes, and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, and that the Board has jurisdiction over him and over the subject setter of this case, and Whereas the Board is authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7150B-41(c) to resolve this enter by Consent Order, and Whereas Dr. Pittman knowingly waives his right to any hearing on the charges brought in the Notice of Charges and Allegations dated May 15, 2002, and to any judicial review or appeal in this case, and Whereas Dr. Pittman acknowledges he has read and understands this Consent Order and enters into it voluntarily, and Whereas Dr. Pittman acknowledges that he is aware of his right to employ counsel in this matter and has retained Jean Boyles and James A. Wilson to represent his in this matter, and Whereas Dr. Pittman understands that this Consent Order is subject to the approval of the board and Dr. Pittman agrees that he will not raise any objection or advance any argument that the Board or any of its members are disqualified from further participation in this case by reason of the review and consideration of this Consent Order, and Whereas the Board determined it to be in the public interest to resolve this matter as set forth below; Now, therefore, in full resolution of the Notice of Charges and Allegations and With Dr. Pittman's consent, it is ORDERED that: 1. Dr. Pittman's license to practice medicine and surgery is hereby INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED. All but sixty (60) days of that suspension is immediately STAYED on the condition that Dr. Pittman comply with the texts of this consent order. 2. Dr. Pittman will not use IV ozone or hydrogen peroxide therapy in his practice until the Board explicitly orders otherwise. 3. Dr, Pittman will use procedures in his practice to prominently identify patients who refuse blood transfusions or blood products, 4. Dr. Pittman may not, either as a primary or back-up supervising physician, supervise physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical pharmacist practitioners. 5. Dr. Pittman shall obey all laws, Likewise, he shall obey all rules or regulations involving the practice of medicine. 6. Dr. Pittman shall notify the Board in writing of any change in his residence or practice addresses within ten (10) days of the change. 7. If Dr. Pittman fails to comply with any of the terms of this consent Order, that failure shall Constitute unprofessional conduct within the meaning of S.C. Gen. Stat, 9 90-14(a) (6) and shall be grounds, after required notice and hearing, for the Board to annul, suspend, or revoke his license to practice, medicine end surgery and to deny any application he might make in the future or then have pending for a license. 8. This Consent Order shall take effect three weeks from the date of execution by both Dr. Pittman and the Board and it shall continue in effect until specifically ordered otherwise by the board. 9.

Response to a Letter in the Washington Post by WHCCAMP Chair James S. Gordon, MDJanice Lyons, RN, MAEd WHCCAMP Chair James S. Gordon, MD, is upset that his 2-year pet project is under attack. On March 26, 2002, the Washington Post printed a letter in which he defended his irresponsible behavior. This letter is a response. To the Editor: Chairman Dr. James Gordon recently protested the criticism of his White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (Tuesday, March 26, 2002; Page HE02). The Post's \"uncritical\" acceptance of the so-called accusations dismayed him. What dismays a lot more people who examine the report and the credentials of the commission is the completely uncritical acceptance of some vague entity called \"CAM,\" and more requests for money than Carter has little liver pills. (CAM, an eclectic mash of everything from esoteric spirituality to megadoses of vitamins, apparently is like pornography - beyond definition. You know it when you see it.) Dr. Gordon claims the commission was only doing its job. After all, it was a \"presidential mandate\" (Clinton Executive Order # 13147) to make recommendations about how to implement the vague entity of CAM thoroughly into every biopsychosocial aspect of America. There is, however, no \"bipartisan congressional\" mandate on record. It is worthy to point out that this may be much ado about nothing. After all, if CAM is real medicine, it does not need special treatment. It will be absorbed for its science, without politically motivated executive orders or policy. But perhaps this commission which Dr. Gordon defends vigorously (as well as himself) is about something more than science and health. According to the Gordon Commission report, throwing several hundred million dollars at folks who will help the public be able to access this unnamed, undefined CAM and to fund others (friends and fellow travelers) to research subtle psychic energy fields, distant AIDS healing (as in telepathy or prayer, take your pick) and coffee enemas, will require a new agency in addition to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The NCCAM has an increasing budget now well over $100 million annually and has yet to educate the American public on the uselessness of alternative practices like iridology, \"muscle response testing\" and Bach flower remedies. Duplication of services is hardly cost effective, duplication of non-services less so. In a \"cart before the horse\" move this commission \u2014 composed of alternative medicine advocates \u2014 was told to decide where and how to propagate and promote practices without having to turn the light of critical judgment on their own beliefs first. Their recommendation for well done scientific examination of CAM practices is disingenuous and could be seen as hypocritical in light of some of the practices the commissioners promote. If science really is a critical factor, for starters that should have eliminated Effie Poy Chow for her telephone qigong healing (do long distance charges apply?), Don Warren for his \"diagnostic\" muscle testing nonsense, and Veronica Gutierrez for her anti- childhood immunization stance based on the claim that scientific research, as well as \"overwhelming clinical reports,\" have indicated that the effectiveness of \"many\" vaccines for childhood diseases \"has not been adequately proven.\" How was it that these folks were given the task of telling the government how to implement CAM into policy? Apparently a couple commissioners had similar questions. Dr. Gordon wrote, \"The 'dissent' on the commission referred to in the article was not, in fact, a dissent.\" Really? I found the \"dissent\" at the very end of the report labeled as \"Statement from Commissioners.\" It is, in fact, a dissent. That Dr. Gordon can't acknowledge this is curious. That he claims that \"the other points of view\" were repeatedly heard makes the point that they were repeatedly ignored in the final report all the more intriguing. As for Dr. Gordon's protest that Drs. Low Dog and Fins' did, indeed, publicly assent to \"all\" of the findings, he seems to be trying to marginalize them by discrediting the concerns they expressed quite clearly in their letter to Secretary Tommy Thompson. Perhaps this is why the commission hired the public relations firm of Fenton Communications? (Question: Why does a commission charged with reporting to the President and DHHS need a PR firm? Is this about marketing or medicine?) In Dr. Gordon's response to the Post's article he tries to distance himself from Bhagwan Rajneesh (the unnamed \"religious cult leader\") and claims to uphold his professional oaths. As others have pointed out Gordon was closely involved with Rajneesh in the US and in India. Surely going through a \"rebirthing\" experience at the guru's ashram in India indicates a more than passing clinical curiosity. At the least, referring homeless men to the local branch of the group and gathering others to live in the Hindu guru's community which was involved in the bioterrorism might represent a lack of good judgment or ethical conflict with regard to a group he was \"researching.\" WHCCAMP is a politically conceived end run around good science which seeks to fund its own industry using tax dollars with the consequence of pressuring the private sector. Spending precious health care dollars on researching implausible theories or providing ineffective CAM will harm and delay the ongoing process of finding better ways to improve health and treat illnesses. The $860,000 \"Creative Wellness\" program offered through HUD which was terminated last year as reported in the Washington Post (June 1, 2001; A29) needs to be revisited as a cautionary tale about integrating CAM. To remind the readers, there health and wellness was to be imparted through incense burning, color coded wardrobes and home decor and decision making based on esoteric personality readings based on New Age spirituality. A number of the recommendations of the commission are in inherent conflict. Dialogue works if you speak the same language. Science and psychic energy haven't got much common ground. Plugging in buzzwords (\"wellness,\" \"chronic illness\") and anointing CAM as the answer is just plain presumptuous. The healthcare issues we face as a nation are not going to be fixed by meditation, burning incense, embracing spirit guides and talking out of both sides of our mouths. Abandoning reason and accountability while claiming to corner compassion and trying to reinvent science is not a formula for successful health and wellness policy. Nor is it fiscally responsible. That CAM believers are a passionate and committed lot is not a question. But the uncritical endorsement and implementation of practices and policies without sensible, evidence based data and strong ethical guidelines is irresponsible and inappropriate. The real story is why only two of the WHCCAMP commissioners could figure that out. Janice A.

Gordon, MD, Chairman of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, is a clinical professor of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine. He is also associate clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. He is a Phi Beta Kappa Harvard graduate (1962) who also graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School (1967) [1]. He is a fellow of the [Fetzer Institute](http://www.fetzer.org/), the foundation that funded the 1991 study by David Eisenberg, MD, that exaggerated the usage of alternative medicine by Americans. The Fetzer Institute funds a large array of alternative medicine initiatives and has even sponsored forums for advocates of psychedelic experience and spirituality. Dr. Gordon is best known for running The [Center for Mind-Body Medicine](http://www.cmbm.org/) in Washington, D.C., which sponsors conferences on aberrant and implausible cancer remedies [2]. Immediately upon his 1967 graduation from medical school, during the 1960s counterculture, Dr. Gordon volunteered for one year at the Haight-Asbury Free Clinic in San Francisco, helping to ease young \"seekers\" through their experimentation with drugs. He became enamored with the \"Insanity is Sanity\" philosophy of British psychiatrist R. D. Laing. He studied with Laing in London in the winter of 1969-70 [3] during the period when Laing was deteriorating under the effects of years of his own personal LSD experimentation [4]. Then, during his psychiatric residency at New York City's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. Gordon attempted to implement Laing's concept of a \"therapeutic community.\" There, according to Dr. Gordon, psychotics could simply \"come and go through their psychosis.\" He came to believe that serious psychological illnesses like schizophrenia \"seemed instead like different ways of being.\" [5] Dr. Gordon then went on to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), having a number of research positions relating to adolescent and community psychiatry. During this time, he also became increasingly involved with aspects of \"holistic medicine.\" By the late 1970s, Gordon was well placed in NIH and was appointed director of a study of alternative mental health services for The President's Commission on Mental Health under the Carter Administration. \"Alternative Services A Special Study,\" [6] Dr. Gordon's short appendix in the 1978 commission report, included sections praising holistic medicine and the midwifery philosophy of a counterculture commune, \"the Farm,\" which was founded by psychedelic advocate Stephen Gaskin. An entire section of Gordon's report concerns \"Alternative Treatments for Psychotic Adults.\" It supports the \"creative insanity\" philosophy of Carl Jung and R. D. Laing as an \"alternative treatment for psychotic adults.\" R. D. Laing is quoted as referring to schizophrenia as \"a voyage into self of a potentially revolutionary nature.\" While he was directing this presidentially commissioned study, Gordon was a supporter of the movement of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the authoritarian Indian guru who was deported from the United States in 1986 after being accused of poisoning local townspeople who opposed his commune in Antelope, Oregon [7]. Dr. Gordon was introduced to the ideas of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh by his acupuncture teacher. He became a practitioner of the Bhagwan's wild Sufi dancing technique called Dynamic Meditation, which he also offered as a therapy in his psychiatric practice. This consists of a \"mind expanding\" technique of whirling and spinning to dizziness and sometimes hallucination. A recent interview with Gordon's acupuncture teacher, Shyam Singha D.O., D.Ac., who introduced him to the Bhagwan, is available online [8]. Singha claims the education of Gordon to be one of his two greatest successes: \"His students have included Dr. J.R. Worsley, the renowned English acupuncturist and educator, and Dr. James Gordon, the holistic physician and author from Washington, D.C. who serves on the faculty of the Georgetown University School of Medicine.\" By the mid-70s, while a follower/disciple, Dr. Gordon attempted to get an NIMH grant to \"study\" Rajneesh at his commune in Poona, India. The State Department intervened, quashing the NIMH grant because Rajneesh was considered a cult figure. Undeterred, Gordon traveled to India at his own expense to study with Rajneesh. He was impressed with how the commune combined Western human potential therapies (rebirthing, attack, primal, orgone therapy, etc) with Eastern mysticism in Rajneesh's attempt to construct a \"New Man.\" He was also impressed with the wide variety of \"alternative\" medicine offered at the commune. His close involvement continued after the wealthy Rajneesh, under investigation from Indian tax authorities, moved his commune to the United States \u2014 eventually taking over the town of Antelope, Oregon. A very sizable percentage of Rajneesh's followers were psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers. A number of the commune's therapeutic group leaders were associated with the San Francisco's Esalen Institute \u2014 a northern California nursery of the New Age movement. Gordon's 1988 book \" [The Golden Guru](https://www.ncahf.org/whc/gordon3.html)\" purports to be a psychological study of Rajneesh's movement as it turned from a world transforming force to an authoritarian controlling group. However, the book is filled with elaborate apologies both for the Rajneesh and for Gordon's own involvement with the cult. In this book, he describes his own \"rebirthing\" experience at Rajneesh's Indian commune [10], defends the commune's use of violent psychotherapies [11], justifies Rajneesh's accumulation of 93 Rolls Royces as a spiritual lesson showing \"contempt\" for wealth [12], and partially blames the Oregon commune's deterioration on the intolerance of local Oregonians. Gordon appears to have been an enthusiastic supporter of the Rajneesh from the early 1970s through the time of Rajneesh's expulsion from the United States in 1985 under threat of prosecution for conspiring to poison Oregon townspeople and commune members. (In 1984, more than 700 people had salmonella poisoning after Rajneesh and his followers inoculated area restaurant foods with fecal bacteria in attempt to keep local residents away from the polls.) Dr. Gordon to this date continues to sell Audio CDs of the Rajneesh's \"Dynamic Meditation\" and \"Kundalini Meditation\" at his own Center for Mind-Body Medicine's Online Bookstore. The tapes are sold under the deceased Rajneesh's pseudonym of \"OSHO.\" [13] During the 1980s Gordon continued to gain influence within alternative mental health and holistic medicine circles. When the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) was founded in 1992, he was one of three co-directors of the OAM's Mind-Body Panel, along with Dr. Larry Dossey and Jungian transpersonal psychologist Jeanne Achterberg. Their seminal Mind-Body Intervention report laid the basis for the mystical, parapsychologically-oriented direction of OAM's and NCCAM's Mind-Body research [14]. Dr. Gordon was appointed the very first chairman of the OAM's Program Advisory Council. Through his Center for Mind-Body Medicine, Gordon has also organized a series of Comprehensive Cancer Care Conferences that have gathered together practitioners of aberrant methods with officials of the NIH and the American Cancer Society. Both latter organizations appear to want to cooperate with advocates of the New Age medicine [15]. Gordon's book based on these conferences, \"Comprehensive Cancer Care,\" is included on the Quackwatch web site's list of non-recommended cancer books [16]. Another of Gordon's books, \"Manifesto for a New Medicine,\" supports almost all aberrant alternative practices.. Dr. Gordon continues to embrace many ideas outside of medicine, sitting on the Scientific Advisory Board of Harvard psychiatrist Dr..John Mack's [Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER)](http://www.centerchange.org/projects/project.asp?id=14). Dr. Mack believes that hundreds of thousands of Americans may have at one time been abducted by aliens and uses \"alien-abduction therapy,\" which assumes the experiences are real [17]. Dr. Gordon was a speaker at a 1997 conference of followers of \"orgone energy\" theorist [Wilhelm Reich](https://www.ncahf.org/whc/reich.html) [18]. Gordon challenged the undertake clinical trials of Reich's \"orgone accumulator.\" [19] Speakers at this conference also led discussions of UFOs. Dr. Gordon also has a special interest in UFOs, having written a 1991 article on \"The UFO Experience' for the Atlantic Monthly. Dr. Gordon apparently supports Jungian \"transpersonal\" mystics, as at the Life After Death conference in 1999 [20]. Dr. Gordon interjected himself into the Oklahoma Bombing case. He sent a statement to the court in the trial of Terry Nichols, claiming that based on his reading of Nichol's letters that Nichols was not violent and should not receive a long prison term [21]. Dr. Gordon's views of the importance of his activities with the White House commission can be gleaned from the following description and quotations from one of his talks. Though not explicit here, the changes he predicts would revolutionize medicine along the lines expressed in his Manifesto for a New Medicine, and also revolutionize all of biology. Dr. Gordon was quite enthusiastic when he discussed the importance of the commission; he believes that the commission will have nothing less than a revolutionary effect on the future of medicine: I believe that the report we are going to provide the president in two years has the potential to be, for medicine in the 21st century, as important as the Flexner report was to medicine in the 20th century. The Flexner report was the result of a committee created at the beginning of the 20th century to develop policies and standards for medical education. The report of the Flexner commission had a profound effect in establishing standards for scientific medical education that helped bring American medicine into modern times. I believe our commission can have an equally significant effect in this century. I don't perceive our goal as limited to discussing research approaches to CAM practices; I see it far more expansive. I believe this commission has an opportunity to look at medicine and health care from a different perspective that can lead to a new model of medicine and even a new model of human biology [22]. WHCCAMP is expected to recommend to President Bush that nonsensical medicine be afforded equal status with standard scientific medicine. Its November 2001 draft report recommends across-the-board \"integration\" of CAM into government health agencies and the nation's medical, medical education, and insurance systems. This effort would be overseen by a coordinating office \"at the highest possible level,\" which would coordinate with a national policy advisory board established by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. These recommendations are an affront to medical science and an assault on consumer protection. For Additional Information Footnotes - James S.
