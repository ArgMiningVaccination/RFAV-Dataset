Computational analyses are required to study their properties and gain insights into rational design strategies. Both natural and modified peptides containing non-natural amino acids require customized tools to run sequence and structure-based studies. PepFun 2.0 is a new version of the python package for the study of natural and modified peptides using a set of modules to analyze the sequence and structure of the molecules. PepFun 2.0 comprises five main modules for different tasks such as sequence alignments, prediction of properties, generation of conformers, modification of structures, detection of protein-peptide interactions, and extra functions to include peptides containing non-natural amino acids.
