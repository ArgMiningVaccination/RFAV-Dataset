Apothecary along with the book Alchemy of Herbs has literally changed my life. It inspired confidence in my ability to safely add herbs to my life. It has helped me understand the difference and how to make a wide range of herbal media ranging from salve, teas, oxymels, syrups, tinctures, and a lot more. I have since applied those techniques to make herbal remedies other than those in the series. The Apothecary series has been a tremendous bonus on getting started with using this awesome book for my beginning herbal journey. So much information and it's been distilled down to easy-to-follow steps so that you don't become overwhelmed. And may I just say that their customer service has been above and beyond stellar. Very happy with my purchase of the book and the Apothecary series. You can find out about herbs in books and online, but what I like about Apothecary is that the information is given in an informal and easily digested way. When I watch the videos, I feel like I'm in a friend's kitchen sharing an herbal experience. Their presentation allows learning new ideas in a relaxed and yet fully knowledgeable way. Thank you! I really appreciate the amount of teaching that you share that doesn't cost a great amount of money. You have shared many recipes that I have been able to use and a lot of teaching on the many different herbs for medicinal use that I have applied. I am on a very low income, but I have been ably to purchase a couple of your learning bundles that aren't out of reach for me to buy. You have been a blessing to me! Thanks. The book, Alchemy of Herbs, the Apothecary website, and LearningHerbs' website \u2014 it's a valuable package of information. I am looking forward to years of quality support and exploration. I came across LearningHerbs in an effort to find information that would help me rekindle my health and stumbled onto a path of learning that is opening up a new world for myself and everyone I love. This is where you want to be; this is a place you can trust. I'm fairly experienced with making herbal remedies, so I was a little skeptical about purchasing Apothecary. Surprise, surprise, my old skills were reinforced, and I learned a bunch of new things, too! Best of all, I have an amazing video library that I can refer to again and again. The PERFECT complement to the book Alchemy Of Herbs. Over the years I have collected many herb books, gone to seminars, and viewed so many videos. Some are good and some just want your money. What I love about John and Rosalee and I am sure many more that make Apothecary happen is the passion, honesty, and comfort in coming into your home to share and teach. I feel they both really care about giving this amazing information to us so we can stand in this world informed, healthy, and ready to share this healing work through herbs that will make a difference in lives. Thank you so for your giving, knowledge, and time! I have been learning about herbs for a while now, but this is the series that got me DOING. I have had such fun, learned so much, and feel like I am now moving into real knowing. Thanks, Apothecary team. You have created a fantastic and inspiring series. Teamed with 'Alchemy of Herbs' it has to be one of the best value for money resources ever created. Highly, highly recommended.
