One way to think of a vaccine is as a medicine that stimulates an immune response with a \"memory.\" The first vaccines were ones that prevented infectious diseases, such as polio and measles. Newer vaccines are ones that are intended to retrain the immune system to eliminate a person's own non-infected, but somehow abnormally functioning, cells or abnormal proteins. Training the immune system to recognize pathogens Vaccines against some pathogens have been so successful that people no longer need to be vaccinated against those diseases in some parts of the world. Smallpox, which is caused by variola virus, is an example of a disease eliminated through effective vaccination. Another is polio, which has been eliminated from many countries. Vaccines against pathogens use either the entire pathogen in an impaired form that could not cause disease or used a part of the pathogen to train the immune system to remember the pathogen and quickly mount an immune response to prevent later exposure to the pathogen from causing disease. How vaccines train the immune system The human immune system has an adaptive part and an innate part. Both parts are important to the response to a vaccine. The adaptive part of the immune system recognizes molecules called antigens. All vaccines contain molecules that function as antigens, and some vaccines also contain molecules that function as irritants to help the innate part of the immune system enhance the adaptive part of the response. Antigens are molecules that stimulate a response from the adaptive part of the immune system and trigger the production of antibodies by B cells and cell-killing responses mediated by T cells called effector or cytotoxic T cells. Both T cells and B cells eventually produce memory cells that can be rapidly reactivated if the antigen is encountered again. "}
