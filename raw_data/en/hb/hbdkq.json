The center, which is on Level 3 of the Med Inn Building, houses the Psych-Oncology Clinic, the Skills Lab and a new Symptom Management & Palliative Care Program. The program was launched this spring to provide additional assistance for patients with difficult side effects or end-of-life concerns. \"The goal is to provide a one-stop, multidisciplinary approach for handling the supportive needs of our cancer patients,\" said Karen Hammelef, director of Patient & Family Support Services. \"People often think of supportive care as a nice thing to do, but not essential. Research has shown us, though, that supportive care is just as important as treating the disease. Our patients expect to maintain quality of life, and that's what our center aims to do.\" The Symptom Management & Palliative Care Program works in concert with patients' oncology teams to develop a plan to address medication management for symptom control, anemia, wound manage-ment, pain services, physical or occupational therapy, cancer nutrition, the psychological impact of cancer and integrative medicine. The Supportive Care Center also houses the Skills Lab, a clinic dedicated to helping educate patients about chemotherapy and home health-care needs. The PsychOncol-ogy Clinic will also continue to provide counseling services to cancer patients in this suite of the Med Inn Building. \"This new center provides the platform for a whole new array of services through the Symptom Management & Palliative Care Program,\" Hammelef said. \"We believe in a holistic approach to cancer care, grounded in research. This center is the embodiment of that philosophy.\" Caring for the whole patient Supportive Care Center opens in Med Inn Building Watch this space The fall issue of Thrive will be dedicated to symptom management and palliative care.

And yet nationwide, only 3 percent to 5 percent of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials. Clinical trials are essential to the discovery of new cancer treatments. So why do so few patients participate? We talked with Maha Hussain, M.D., associate director of clinical research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, to learn more. Who should consider a clinical trial? The best time to consider a clinical trial is when you are newly diagnosed or when there's a change in your cancer\u2014for ex-ample, if it has spread or recurred. each trial has strict eligibility criteria. Talk with your doctor to find out whether any stud-ies are available to you or call the Cancer AnswerLine at 800-865-1125 .We, as doctors, take our responsibility for patients' safety very seriously. \u2014Maha Hussain, M.D., associate director of clinical research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center,, forum | Help wantedsummer 2010 5Q: CAn you expLAin whAT A CLiniCAL TriAL is? a: A clinical trial is a research study in which patients partner with physicians to find better ways to improve cancer treat-ment or outcomes. Each trial attempts to answer a scientific question relevant to the care of the patient. Broadly speaking, stud- ies seek better ways to prevent cancer, to diagnose cancer early, to treat it better, or to improve quality of life by reducing pain and other cancer-related symptoms. Q: why shouLd A pATienT pArTiCipATe in A CLiniCAL TriAL? a: There are many situations where there is no standard treatment available or it doesn't work well. Unless there's a part-nership between doctors and patients, the status quo of poor outcomes will continue forever. Curing testicular cancer in younger men is now possible because patients were part of early phase clinical trials that showed certain drugs worked well. This is also true for breast cancer and several other adult and childhood malignancies. Unless we investigate new treatments in clinical trials, there will not be better treatment. Q: why don'T more pATienTs pArTiCipATe? a: There are several factors, including the availability of clinical trials where patients are getting their cancer care as well as the willingness of a patient's physician to offer a clinical trial as part of the overall care. Patients may have concerns about the tox- icity or cost of participating in a research study. Also, some people are worried that they may be used as guinea pigs. That is certainly not the case. Patients are equal partners in the whole process. Q: whAT AbouT pATienT sAfeTy? a: All clinical trials are reviewed\u2014from start to finish\u2014by the Institutional Review Board. That's a group of doctors, health-care professionals and community members who review every clinical trial to ensure that it is safe for patients, well-designed, legal and ethical. The treating physician will offer patients the option to participate in a study if an early assessment shows that he or she is likely to be eligible. The patient is then pro-vided with an informed-consent form, which is a document that explains everything that can possibly happen during the trial. This is discussed very carefully with the patient and he or she is advised to read it carefully, take it home, think about it some more and discuss it with family. Patients do not have to make a decision on the spot about partici-pating in a research study. Patients who par - ticipate in studies are carefully monitored by their physicians. If any issues arise, patients are encouraged to call their health-care team\u2014day or night. Additional care as part of the study is based on how well patients are tolerating the intervention. If a study drug proved to be too toxic, it would be halted or changed to ensure patient safety. We, as doctors, take our responsibility for patients' safety very seriously. Q: CAn A pATienT QuiT A sTudy? a: Absolutely. If a patient at some point feels uncomfortable about continuing for any reason, they have the right to withdraw with no questions asked. Furthermore, even if a patient wants to stay in a study, if his or her doctor determines that it isn't safe, the doctor can remove them from the trial. Q: Are pLACebos, or suGAr piLLs, used in CAnCer CLiniCAL TriALs? a: First, let me debunk a myth: We never deny patients treatment for their cancer. All of our clinical trials are grounded in science that leads us to believe that the experimental therapies we are testing in clinical trials may work. In the vast majority of trials, place- bos would not be used alone in a situation where we already have a treatment that is proven to help a patient. A placebo may be used if doctors are evaluating whether adding a new drug to a standard treatment would work better that the standard treat-ment alone. Sometimes patients who receive placebos may be offered the study drug later in the trial if it appears that the drug is helpful. In any case, doctors must inform patients about available treatments and will not delay treatment. Ultimately, it's up to the patient to decide whether participating in a research study is right for her or him. Q: wiLL heALTh insurAnCe Cover The CosTs of CLiniCAL TriALs? a: The costs of procedures that are part of standard cancer care are generally cov-ered by insurance. Procedures that are for research only\u2014for example, a blood test to assess the effects of an experimental drug\u2014 may not be covered. Often, researchers can find funds to cover these costs for patients. The informed-consent form will fully out-line what types of costs patients may have to bear if they participate. Q: wiLL A pATienT enroLLed in A CLiniCAL TriAL GeT beTTer CAre ThAn someone who isn'T enroLLed? a: Although there are not specific studies for every situation, we all agree as physi-cians that in diseases where there are no effective treatments or cures, clinical trials offer hope. In my opinion\u2014and many experts share my assessment\u2014patients will get better care on a clinical trial. Q: how do you bALAnCe hope whiLe providinG pATienTs wiTh reALisTiC expeCTATions? a: Clinical trials are well thought out. There's always a fair amount of science behind a clinical trial that suggests that the question being studied is legitimate and that there is a reasonable chance that something valuable will come out of it. We don't do anything without a burden of information that gives us confidence. Obviously, there is no guarantee of benefit. But it's like playing the lottery: You don't win if you don't buy a ticket.

The vocabulary of cancer is also full of big, intimidating words that rarely crop up in everyday language. But the potential rewards of learning\u2014and understanding\u2014these words are much greater for people who are seeking the best treatment for their cancer. The most recent National Assessment of Adult Literacy found that only 12 percent of Americans could be considered proficient in understanding health information. So we put together a highly abbreviated glossary of common cancer terms.

You've sorted your toiletries and zipped them into plastic bags, just like airport security requires. You've packed a swimsuit\u2014and a sweater, for those chilly summer nights. You even remembered the camera this time. But if you or a loved one has cancer, you should consider adding a few items to your travel checklist. We talked with experts at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014health-care professionals and patients alike\u2014to get their tips for traveling after a cancer diagnosis. Here's what they had to say. Talk to your doctor before you plan your trip. If you're going through treatment, your doctor can help you determine whether you'll be in good enough shape for the trip you have in mind, said Thecla Jackson, a Cancer Center nurse. If you're a snowbird who's planning to be away for an extended period, tell your doctor's office how to reach you. Pack your medical records. Heather Kornick, a 23-year- old camp counselor who has adrenal cancer, said she carries a binder with photocopies of her medical records when she travels. She also tells friends traveling with her about the binder so they know to bring it to the hospital if an emergency arises. Check your health insurance. Find out what coverage you have in case you need to visit a doctor while you are away. Be sure to bring your proof of insurance, too. Do you need shots? Certain countries require special vaccines before traveling there. Ask your doctor whether they are appropriate for you.Get a doctor's note. Tighter airline security may require you to carry a letter from your doctor if you have metal in your body as a result of surgery or if you need to take certain medical sup- plies, such as syringes, on board. Call your clinic well in advance to get a letter from your doctor. Don't put medications in checked bags. Be sure to keep medications with you at all times. If your luggage gets lost, you don't want to lose your medicine, too. Security regulations allow prescription and over-the-counter medications to exceed the 3.4 ounce limit required for other liquids, gels and aerosols in carry-ons. Request an airport wheelchair. Airports are big, exhaust- ing places. Save your energy for your destination. Kornick says she always requests a wheelchair. Even though she can walk, it can be draining to stand in lines or make long treks to gates\u2014 particularly considering that gates often change.21 3 45 6 7Practice good airplane health. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Get up and stretch during long flights to prevent blood clots. If you have had surgery that affected lymph nodes, consider a compression garment to reduce the risk of lymphedema, chronic swelling that can occur as a result of damage to lymph nodes. Find a local health-care provider. If you're planning to be away for several weeks, find a local doctor who can help coordinate your care. That way, if there's a problem, your U-M doctors can communicate with the local physician and possibly resolve issues more easily. Otherwise, Jackson said, your U-M doctor will prob-ably advise you to go to the closest emergency room or urgent care center. Find out where it is when you get to town, just in case. Save adventure travel for another time. If your immune system is weakened by treatment, be a little more cautious than you normally would during your trip. Skip roadside food carts for better established restaurants. Drink bottled water. Carry hand sanitizer and wash your hands frequently.For more travel resources, visit mcancer.org/thrive . When she travels, Heather Kornick always packs copies of her medical records\u2014just in case. Take your time getting there. Kornick travels frequently from her home in Elk Grove, Ill., to Ann Arbor for treatment for adrenal cancer. She and her family have learned to schedule plenty of extra time for the five-hour drive so they can take breaks and trade off driving. If Kornick is traveling by air, she also allows extra time to keep stress levels low. \"I know I need more time to do things now than other people,\" she says. 8 9 1011 Photos by Robert Neumannea t well | Pleasures from the farm leasures from the farm explore farmers' markets for healthy, delicious eating WHAT'S In SEASOn nOW?

But a new University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center study has found that it's much less frequent after mastectomy, even among women for whom it would have a clear lifesaving benefit. The study looked at 2,260 women treated for breast cancer and assessed whether they would be strong candi- dates for radiation therapy. Radiation after mastectomy is generally recommended for women who have particularly large tumors, or cancer in four or more of their nearby lymph nodes. The study found that among patients who should receive radiation therapy according to medical guide- lines, 95 percent of those who had lumpectomy went on to receive radiation, but only 78 percent of those who had mastectomy received radiation. Among women for whom radiation is less clearly beneficial, 80 percent of lumpectomy patients had radiation while only 46 percent of mastectomy patients did. \"A substantial number of breast cancer patients are being under-treated. One in five women with strong indications for radiation after mastectomy failed to receive it. Radiation can be a life- saving treatment,\" said study author Reshma Jagsi, M.D., D.Phil., assistant professor of radiation oncology at the U-M Medical School. Results of the study appear in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study also found that patients who reported their surgeon was involved in the decision to receive radiation were more likely to receive radiation than patients whose doctor was less involved. \"Even patients who wanted to avoid radiation therapy were very likely to receive it if their surgeons were highly involved in the decision process. We need to do a better job of educating both patients and physicians regard- ing the benefits of radiation after mastectomy in certain circumstances, and we need to encourage physicians to help their patients as they make these important deci- sions,\" Jagsi says. In patients with strong indications for radiation after mastectomy, their risk of the cancer coming back in the chest wall or surrounding areas can exceed 30 percent. This is reduced by two-thirds if the patient undergoes radiation treatments, and overall survival is improved. Gene te St SHoWS WHo CoUld Benef It fro M StAtInS to red UCe Colon CAnCer r ISk A University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center study found that a genetic test can determine which patients might benefit from receiving cholesterol- lowering statin drugs to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The researchers had previ- ously shown that statins\u2014 which 25 million people worldwide take each day to reduce their risk of cardiovas- cular disease\u2014can cut the risk of colorectal cancer by 50 percent. But statins do not appear to work equally well for everyone in reducing either colorectal cancer or cardiovascular disease risk. The new study, which appeared in a recent issue of Cancer Prevention Research, found a genetic variant affects how statins control both colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. \"Our research is the first step toward personalized prevention. now we have identified a genetic test that can show who's likely to benefit most from this drug,\" said senior study author Stephen Gruber, M.D., Ph.D., M.P .H., associate director of cancer prevention and control at the U-M Comprehensive Cancer Center. The study looked at 2,138 people in northern Israel who were diagnosed with colon cancer and 2,049 similar people without colon cancer. All participants were asked about statin use for controlling cholesterol. Statins are not currently used to prevent colorectal cancer. In addition, the researchers took blood samples from all study participants and analyzed the genes. They found that the gene targeted by statins, HMGCR, is the same gene that predicts the drug's benefit for prevent- ing colorectal cancer. Further, there are two versions of HMGCR\u2014a long version and a short version. The researchers found that statins have more benefit for reducing both colorectal cancer risk and cholesterol in people with the gene's long version. \"The gene test by itself doesn't predict whether you're at an increased risk of colon cancer; it predicts only how well statins lower the risk,\" Gruber said. The researchers point out that it's easy to know if statins are successfully lowering cholesterol, but their effect on colorectal cancer prevention is not as apparent. That's where a gene test would come in.Stephen Gruber, M.D., Ph.D., M.P .H. summer 2010 15 Photos by U-M Photo Servicessummer 2010 16onlineUMI-084michigan recently banned smoking in res- taurants and bars. w e asked one of our experts about second-hand smoke. is it really all that dangerous?
