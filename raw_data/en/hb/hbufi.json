Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the US EPA's implementing regulations direct each State to id entify and list waters, known as water quality limited segments (WQLSs), in which current re quired controls of a specified substance are inadequate to achieve water quality standards (WQSs). For each WQLS, the State is to either establish a TMDL of the specifi ed substance that the waterbo dy can receive without violating WQSs, or demonstrate that WQSs are being met (CFR 2010b). Maryland (MD) WQSs state that all surface waters of the State shall be protected for water contact recreation, fishing, and protection of aquatic life and wildlife (C OMAR 2010a). All waters of the nontidal Anacostia Rive r have been designated as Use I - Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Non tidal Warmwater Aquatic Life . Additionally, Paint Branch and its tributaries upstream of the Capital Beltway have been designated as Use III - Nontidal Cold Water, and the Northwest Branch and its tribut aries upstream of Route 410 as Use IV - Recreational Trout Waters (COMAR 2010b, c, d). The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has identified various portions of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed on the State' s 2008 Integrated Report as impaired by the following (listing years in parentheses): nutrients (1996), sediments (1996), fecal bacteria (2002), trash/debris (2006), impacts to biological communities (200 2), PCBs (2002), and heptachlor epoxide (2002) (MDE 2008). The 2002 PCB listing fo r the nontidal Anacostia River watershed refer solely to the NEB and NWB, where the wa ter column samples were collected. Similarly, the 2002 heptachlor epoxide listing refers solely to the NWB. The TMDL established herein by MDE will address the 2002 PCB listing for the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed, for which a data solicitation was conducted, and all readily available data from the past five y ears have been considered. Fecal bacteria and trash/debris TMDLs for the nontid al and tidal waters of the An acostia River watershed were submitted to the US EPA in 2006 and 2010, respectively, and subsequently approved. Inter-jurisdictional TMDLs addressing sedi ment and nutrient listings in the nontidal and tidal waters of both the Maryland (MD) and Di strict of Columbia (DC) por tions of the watershed were submitted to the US EPA in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and subsequently approved. The remaining listings for the nontidal Anacostia Rive r watershed will be addressed at a future date. Additionally, an inter-jurisdic tional TMDL addressing a tidal Anacostia PCB listing, first identified on the Integrated Report as impair ed in 2006, along with tidal Potomac PCB listings was submitted to and approved by the US EPA in 2007. The Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL report (MDE 2007) charac terizes and provides allocations for point and nonpoint sources from the direct draina ge portion of the watershed (as defined within the Chesapeake Bay Program Phas e 5 (CBP P5) Watershed Model, i.e., including Lower Beaverdam and Watts Branch watersheds within the Anacostia River MD 8-digit watershed), while the nontidal NEB and NWB P CB loads are represented as upstream tributary FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 viiloads without any further charact erization of these loads with respect to point and nonpoint sources. The objective of this report is to establish NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs supportive of the \"fishing\" designated use, whic h is protective of human health related to consumption of fish caught in these tributaries. A nd thus, NEB and NWB Tributary TMDL Allocations provided in the Tidal PCB TMDL report were reevaluated from the point of vi ew of water qua lity standards in the NEB and NWB and were deemed protectiv e of the \"fishing\" designated use in these tributaries (see Section 3). Cons equently, these allocations serve as the bases for the NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs. Point sources have been identified only in the Maryland portion of th e NEB and NWB tributary drainage basins. These include two waste wa ter treatment plants (WWTPs) and Maryland National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Syst em (NPDES) regulated stormwater. Nonpoint sources include identified contaminated site s in the Maryland portion of the watershed, unregulated watershed runoff in the Maryland portion of the basin, and the DC upstream watershed. All TMDLs need to be presented as a sum of waste load allocations (WLAs) for the identified point sources and load allocations (LAs) fo r nonpoint source loads generated within the assessment unit, and where applicable LAs fo r natural background, tributary, and adjacent segment loads. Furthermore, all TMDLs must incl ude a margin of safety (MOS) to account for the lack of knowledge and the many uncertainties in the understanding and simulation of water quality parameters in natural systems (i.e., the relationship be tween modeled loads and water quality). The MOS is intended to account for such uncertainties in a manner that is conservative from the standpoint of environmental protection. In the methods used to establish the NEB and NWB Tributary PCB TMDLs, which are the bases of the TMDLs presented in this report, in addition to an implicit MOS incorporated thr ough the use of conservative assumptions, an explicit MOS equal to 5% of the TMDL was reserv ed for loadings from tributary sources (MDE 2007). This becomes the MOS for the NEB and NWB TMDLs. The NEB and NWB PCB Total Baseline (i.e., 2 005) Loads are 429 and 298 grams/year (g/yr), respectively. These loads are further subdivide d into Nonpoint Source Ba seline Loads and Point Source Baseline Loads (see Equation ES-1). TMDL w = WLA WWTP + WLA SW + LA CS + LA MD + LA DC + MOS Where: TMDL w = Watershed TMDL (presented separately WLA WLA (presented separately for Montgomery and Prince George's County) LA CS = Contaminated Site LA LA MD = MD Unregulated Watershed Runoff LA LA DC = DC Upstream Watershed LA MOS = Margin of Safety Equation ES-1 FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 viiiThe NWB PCB TMDLs are 8.57 and 5.96 g/yr, respectively (these va lues include a 5% MOS), with an overall reduction of 98% from the Total Baseline Loads (see Table ES-1). This TMDL when implemented will ensure that the P CB loads are at a level expected to support the \"fishing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB of the Anacostia River watershed.

NPDES Regulated Stormwater - refers to all known NPDES stormwater dischargers within Prince George's County NEB and NWB drainage basin, which are identified in Appendix C. 3 Point sources in the Washington, DC portion of the watershed have not been characterized. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 ix Federal regulations require that TMDL analysis take into account th e impact of critical conditions and seasonality on water quality (CFR 2010b). The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the water quality is protected during the most vulnerable times. The TMDLs presented in this document implicitly account for seasonal variations as well as critical conditions. Given that at the obs erved concentrations acute c onditions are not a concern and since PCB levels in fish become elevated due to long-term e xposure, rather than temporary spikes in water column PCB concentration, it ha s been determined that the selection of the average PCB concentration as representing the baseline conditions adeq uately considers the impact of seasonal variations a nd critical conditions on the \"fishi ng\" designated use in the NEB and NWB. Furthermore, in order to meet downs tream water quality standards (i.e., in Tidal Anacostia and Potomac Rivers), the proposed NEB and NWB TMDLs are lower (i.e., more protective) than would otherwise be required to meet water column concentrations protective of the \"fishing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB. Once the US EPA has approved these TMDLs, MDE will begin an iterative process of implementation, focusing first on those sources w ith the largest impact on water quality while giving consideration to the relative cost and eas e of implementation. The implementation efforts will be periodically evaluated, and if necessar y, improved, in order to further progress toward achieving the water quality goals. Given that a number of cont aminated sites have already undergone remediation and their baseline loads cons titute a relatively sma ll percentage of the Total Baseline Load (i.e., 0.38%), these sites ar e not intended to be targ eted during the initial stages of implementation and thus at this point were not subjected to any reductions. However, if in the future it becomes clear that the TMDL goals cannot be achieved without load reductions from these sites, additional reduction measures might need to be considered. As part of Maryland's Watershed Cycling Strategy, follow-up monitoring and assessment will be routinely conducted to evaluate the implementation status in the NEB and NWB. MDE also monitors and evaluates concentrations of c ontaminants in recreationally ca ught fish, shellfish, and crabs throughout Maryland. MDE will use these monitori ng programs to evaluate progress towards meeting the \"fishing\" designated use in NEB and NWB. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 11. INTRODUCTION This document upon approval by the U. S. Environmental Protection Ag ency (US EPA), establishes a Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in the Northeast Branch (NEB) and Northwest Branch (NWB) of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed (basin number 02140205; 2008 Integrated Report Assessment Unit ID : MD-02140205). Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the US EPA' s implementing regulations direct each State to identify and list waters, known as water quality limited segments (WQLSs), in which current required controls of a specified substance are inad equate to achieve water quality standards (WQSs). For each WQLS, the State is to either establis h a TMDL of the specif ied substance that the waterbody can receive without viol ating WQSs, or demonstrate th at WQSs are being met (CFR 2010b). A WQS is the combination of a designated use fo r a particular body of wa ter and the water quality criteria designed to protect that use. Designated uses include ac tivities such as swimming, drinking water supply, protection of aquatic life, and fish a nd shellfish propagation and harvest, etc. Water quality criteria consist of narrative statements and numeric values designed to protect the designated uses. Criteria may differ among wate rs with different designated uses. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE ) has identified various portions of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed on the State's 2008 In tegrated Report as impaired by the following (listing years in parentheses): nu trients (1996), sediments (1996), fecal bacteria (2002), trash/debris (2006), impacts to biological communities (2002), PCBs (2002), and heptachlor epoxide (2002) (MDE 2008). The 2002 PCB listing for the nontidal Anaco stia River watershed refer solely to the NEB and NWB, where the water column sample s were collected. Similarly, the 2002 heptachlor epoxide listing refers solely to the NWB. The TMDL established herein by MDE will address the 2002 PCB listing for the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed, for which a data solicitation was conducted, and all readily available data from the past five years have been considered. Fecal bacteria and trash/debris TMDLs for the nontidal and tidal waters of the Anacostia River watershed were submitted to the US EPA in 2006 and 2010, respectively, and subsequently appr oved. Inter-jurisdictional TMDLs addressing sediment and nutrient listings in the nontidal and tidal waters of bot h the Maryland (MD) and District of Columbia (DC) portions of the wa tershed were submitted to the US EPA in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and subsequently approved. The remaining listings for the nontidal Anacostia River watershed will be addressed at a future date. Additionally, an inter-jurisdictional TMDL addressing a tidal Anacostia PCB listing, first identified on the Inte grated Report as impaired in 2006, along with tidal Potomac PCB listings was su bmitted to and approved by the US EPA in 2007. PCBs are a class of man-made compounds that were manufactured and used for a variety of industrial applications. They c onsist of 209 related chemical compounds (congeners) that were manufactured and sold as mixtures under various trade names (QEA 1999). Each of the 209 possible PCB compounds consists of two phenyl groups and one or more chlorine atoms. The congeners differ in the number and position of the chlori ne atoms along the phenyl group. From the 1940s to the 1970s, they were extensively used as heat tran sfer fluids, flame retard ants, hydraulic fluids, and dielectric fluids because of their dielectric and fl ame resistant properties. They have been identified as a pollutant of concern due to the following: FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 2 1. They are bioaccumulative and can cause both acute and chronic toxic effects; 2. They have carcinogenic properties; 3. They are persistent organi c pollutants that do not readily breakdown in the environment. In the late 1970s, concerns regarding potential human health effects led the United States government take action to cease PCB production, rest rict PCB use, and regulate the storage and disposal of PCBs. Despite these actions, PCBs are still being released into the environment through fires or leaks from old PCB containing equipment, accidental spills, burning of PCB containing oils, leaks from hazardous waste sites, etc. As PCBs tend to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms including fish, people who ingest fish may become exposed to PCBs . In fact, elevated levels of PCBs in fish are one of the leading causes of fi sh consumption advisories in the United States. The NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River ha ve been identified as impaired by PCBs on the State's 2008 Integrated Report based on tota l PCB (tPCB) water colu mn data from MDE's monitoring program that exceeded the Mary land human health tPCB criterion of 0.64 nanograms/liter (ng/L, ppt) (COMAR 2010e; waterbodies on the State's Integrat ed Report, MDE also issues st atewide and site-specific fish consumption advisories (ranging from 0 to 4 meal s per month) and recommendations (ranging from 4 to 8 meals per month). Current recreational fi sh consumption advisories suggest limiting the consumption of the following fish species caught in the Anacostia River: American eel, brown bullhead, channel catfish, and sunfish 2009b). FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 32. SETTING AND WATER QUALITY DESCRIPTION 2.1. General Setting The NEB and NWB are tributaries of the Anacostia River, which in turn flows into the Potomac River, a tributary of the Chesap eake Bay. Approximately 70% of th e Anacostia River watershed is drained by the NWB and the NEB. The Anacostia Ri ver watershed is located in two physiographic provinces, the Piedmont Plateau an d the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and drains about 176 square miles of land from Washington, DC (30.2 miles, 17.2%), M ontgomery County, MD (60.8 miles, 34.4%), and Prince George's County, MD (85.2 miles, 48.4%). The NEB and NWB watersheds combined are approximately 127 square miles and are home to approximately 519,000 re sidents (MWCOG 2008; US Census Bureau 2000). The location of the Anaco stia River watershed as well as the NEB and NWB TMDL study areas are displayed in Figure 1. The main channel of the Anacostia River is 8.4 m iles (13.5 kilometers) in le ngth, extending from the confluence of the NWB and the NEB, in Bladensburg, MD, to its confluence with the Potomac River. The main channel of the Anacostia River is an estuary with a varia tion in water level of approximately three feet over a tida l cycle. Tidal influence extends a pproximately to the locations of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station 01649500 on the NEB and the U.S. Route 1 (Rhode Island Avenue) bridge on the NWB. According to the 2006 land cover data (USGS 2009), land use in the NEB and NWB watersheds can be classified as predominantly urban. Urban land occupies approximately 62.3% of these watersheds, while 24.4% is forested and 6.6% is agricultural. The remaining 6.7% is classified as barren, unconsolidated shore, grassland, herbaceous, scrub, shrub, water, or wetland. A summary of the land cover distribution is provided in Table 1. The A nderson level I urban classi fication includes level II developed open space as well as low, medium, and high intensity urban classifications. The Anderson level I agricultural classification in cludes level II pasture and cultivated land classifications (see Figure 2, Figure 3, and Table 1).

A PCB TMDL outlining specific point a nd nonpoint source allocations for the direct drainage area of the Anacostia River watershe d (as defined within the Chesapeake Bay Program Phase 5 Watershed Model (CBP P5), i.e., including nontidal portions of the watershed such as the Lower Beaverdam and Watts Branch watersheds) ha s already been approved by EPA as part of the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDLs (MDE 2007). As part of this effort, NEB and NWB tributary PCB loads and TMDL a llocations protective of the downs tream water quality have already been characterized. 2.2. Water Quality Characterization and Impairment Maryland WQSs state that all surface waters of the State shall be protected for water contact recreation, fishing, and protection of aquatic life and wildlife (COM AR 2010a). All waters of the nontidal Anacostia River have been designated as Use I - Water Contact Recr eation, and Protection of Nontidal Warmwater Aquatic Life . Additionally, Paint Branch and it s tributaries upstream of the Capital Beltway have been designated as Use III - Nontidal Cold Water, and the Northwest Branch and its tributaries upstream of Route 410 as Use IV - Recreational Trout Waters (COMAR 2010b, c, d). Additionally, two stream reaches of the Uppe r Beaverdam Creek, in the NEB watershed, are designated as \"high quality\", or Tier II, stream se gments (i.e., Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity and Fish Index of Biotic Integrity aquatic life assessment scores > 4 (scale 1 to 5)) requiring the implementation of Maryland's antidegr adation policy (COM AR 2010f; and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 7 The State of Maryland adopted thre e separate water column tPCB crite ria: criterion for protection of human health associated with cons umption of PCB contaminated fish, as well as fresh and salt water chronic tPCB criteria for the prot ection of aquatic life (see Table 2). The Maryland human health tPCB criterion is set at 0.64 ng/ L, ppt) (COMAR 2010e; US EPA 2006) . This criterion is based on a cancer slope factor of 2 (milligrams/kilogram-day)-1, a bioconcentration factor of 31,200 L/kg, a risk level of 10-5, a lifetime exposure duration of 70 years, and a fish intake of 17.5 grams/day (g/day). A cancer risk level provides an estimate of the addi tional incidence of cancer th at may be expected in an exposed population; a risk level of 10-5 indicates a probability of one additional case of cancer for every 100,000 people exposed. The Maryland fresh and salt water chronic aqua tic life tPCB criteria are set at 14 ng/L and 30 ng/L, respectively (COMAR 2010e; US EPA 2006). A sediment tPCB criterion has not been established in Maryland. Table 2: Summary of Maryland Water Column tPCB Criteria, ng/L MD Criteria tPCB Water Column Human Health 0.64 Fresh Water Chronic Aquatic Life 14 Salt Water Chronic Aquatic Life 30 In addition to the water column cr iteria described above, fish tissue monitoring data can serve as an indicator of PCB water quality conditions. The Maryla nd fish tissue monitoring da ta is used to issue fish consumption advisories/recommendations an d determine whether Maryland waterbodies are meeting the \"fishing\" designated use. Currently Maryland applies 39 ng/g as the tPCB fish tissue listing threshold (MDE 2008). In 2002, MDE identified both the NEB and NWB as impaired by PCBs based on the exceedance of the tPCB water column criterion (Maryland hum an health tPCB criterion in 2002 was 1.7 ng/L). Additionally, water quality data collected between 2004 and 2005 in the NEB (station geographic coordinates: 38.96025, -76.92597) and NWB (stati on geographic coordinates: 38.95233, indicate that while the average particulate plus dissolved tPCB c oncentrations do not exceed the 14 ng/L Maryland fresh water chronic aquatic life tPCB criterion, the 0.64 ng/L Maryland water column human health tPCB criterion is exceeded (see Table 3). Detailed tPCB results for each measurement are presented in Appendix A. Table 3: Average Water Column tPCB Concen NEB NEB 3.35 NWB 4.30 The water quality data summarized in Table 3 we re collected and analyzed by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at George Mason University (GMU). PCB congeners were identified and quantified by high resolution gas chromatogra phy with electron capture detection. GMU uses a slightly modified version of th e PCB congener specific method descri bed in Foster et al. (2000), in which the identities and concentrations of each congener in a mixed Aroc lor standard (25:18:18 FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Version: are determ ined based on their chromatographic retention times relative to the internal standards (PCB 30 and PCB 204). Based on this method, 72 chromatographic peaks can be quantified (see Ap pendix E). Some of the peaks contain one PCB congener, while others are comprised of two or more co-eluting congeners. The PCB analysis presented in this document is based on tPCB concen trations that are calcula ted as the sum of the detected PCB congeners/congener groups represen ting the most common congeners that were historically used in the Ar oclor commercial mixtures. 2.3. Source Assessment PCBs do not occur naturally in the environment. Therefore, unless existing or historical anthropogenic sources are present, their natural background levels ar e expected to be zero. Although no longer manufactured in the United States, PCBs are still being released to the environment via accidental fires, leaks, or spills from olde r PCB-containing equipment; potential leaks from hazardous waste sites that contain PCBs; illega l or improper dumping; and disposal of PCB- containing products (e.g., transfor mers, old fluorescent lighting fixt ures, electrical devices, or appliances containing PCB capacitors, old microscope oil, and old hydraulic o il) into landfills that are not designed to handle hazardous waste. Once in the environment, PCBs do not readily break down and tend to cycle between various environmen tal media such as air, water, and soil. PCBs exhibit low water solubility, are moderate ly volatile, strongly adsorb to organics, and preferentially partition to upland an d instream sediment. The major fate process for PCBs in water is adsorption to sediment or other organic matter. Adsorption and subseque nt sedimentation may immobilize PCBs for relatively l ong periods of time. However, desorption into the water column may also occur; PCBs contained in layers near the sediment surface may be slowly released over time, while concentrations present in the lowe r layers may be effectively sequestered from environmental distribution (RETEC 2002). The linkage between the \"fishing\" designated use and PCB concentrations in the water column is via the uptake and bioaccumulation of PCBs by aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation occurs when the combined uptake rate of a given chemical from f ood, water, and/or sediment by an organism exceeds the organisms' ability to remove the chemical th rough metabolic functions, dilution, or excretion, resulting in excess concentrations of the chemical being stored in the body of the organism. Humans can be exposed to PCBs via consumption of aquatic organisms, which over time have bioaccumulated PCBs. Depending on the life cycle and feeding patterns, aquatic organisms can bioaccumulate PCBs via exposure to concentrations present in the water column (in dissolved and/or particulate form) and sediments, as well as from consumption of other organisms resulting in the biomagnification of PCBs within the food chain (RETEC 2002). A simplified conceptual model of PCB fate and transport in the NEB and NWB is diagramed in Figure 4. PCB sources, resulting primarily from hi storical uses of these compounds and potential releases to the environment as described above , include point and nonpoint sources as well as upstream loads. The primary mechanism for the re moval of PCBs from the aquatic system is by adsorption to sediments and downstream flushing to the tidal Anacostia River. Volatilization (i.e., escape into the atmosphere) and degrad ation are other removal mechanisms.

FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 11NEB and NWB PCB baseline loads are further s ubdivided into loads fr om point and nonpoint sources. Point sources in the NEB and NWB drainage basi ns include two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the NEB drai nage basin and Maryland's stor mwater discharges that are regulated under Phase I or Phase II of the National Pollutant Disc harge Elimination System (NPDES) storm water program (US EPA 2002). Phase I and II permits can include the following types of discharges: Small, medium, and large Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s) - these can be owned by local jurisdictions, municipaliti es, and state and federal entities (e.g., departments of trans portation, hospitals, military bases); Industrial facilities permitted for stormwat er discharges; and Small and large construction sites. A list of all the NPDES regulated stormwater pe rmits within Maryland's portion of the NEB and NWB drainage basins that could potentially convey PCB loads has been presented in Appendix C. Besides the two WWTPs and NPDES regulated st ormwater entities, no other NPDES regulated facilities in the NEB and NWB drainage basins have been identified as potential sources of PCBs. Nonpoint sources include runoff from identified contaminated sites and other unregulated watershed areas as well as from the DC upstream watershed. 2.3.1. Contaminated Site Baseline Loads The term contaminated site used throughout th is report refers to areas with known PCB soil contamination, as documented by state or federal hazardous waste cleanup pr ograms (i.e., state or federal Superfund programs). When compared against the human hea lth screening criteria for soil and groundwater exposure pathways, PCBs are not n ecessarily a contaminant of concern at these sites, but have been screened for, reported, and de tected during formal site investigations. Initially, three contaminated sites (comprised of multiple s ub-sites) located in the NEB drainage basin were identified as part of the Tidal Potomac and An acostia PCB TMDL effort (MDE 2007), and the edge- of-field (EOF) PCB baseline loads fo r these sites were estimated. As part of the NEB and NWB Tributary PCB TM DL effort summarized in this report, the 2007 contaminated site list and the associated loadings have been refined (see Appendix D). The list of sites has been updated based on information gath ered from the US EPA's Superfund and MDE's Land Restoration Program Geospatial Database (LRP-MAP) (US EPA 2010b; MDE 2010). A total of 15 sub-sites (see Table 4) have been identified with PCB soil concentra tions at or above method detection levels, as determined via soil sample results contained within MDE Land Management Administration's (LMA) contaminated site survey and investigation records. All of the sites are located within the NEB watershed. PCB EOF load s from these sites have been calculated and subsequently converted to edge-of-stream (EOS) loads (see Table 4) using methods applied within Maryland's nontidal sediment TMDL s, thirteen of which have been approved by the EPA since 2006. Given that not all of the contaminated site PCB lo ads are expected to reach the nearby streams, EOS loads are thought to be a more accurate representa tion of actual PCB loads fr om these sites in terms of their impact on downstream water quality. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 12The Contaminated Site PCB Baseline Load from the identified sites in the NEB and NWB is estimated to be 1.61 g/yr. This load is the sum of individual PCB loads from 15 contaminated sites within the NEB drainage basin, a number of wh ich have undergone remediation. The average PCB concentrations at the non-remediated sites are below levels detected at the al ready remediated sites. No contaminated sites have been identified in the NWB drainage basin. A more detailed methodology used to refine the 2007 contaminated site loadings is presented in Appendix D.

Waste Water Treatment Plant Baseline Loads Two WWTPs, Beltsville United States Department of Agriculture (U SDA) East and West (NPDES: MD0020842 and MD0020851), are located in the TMDL study area (Figure 6). Loads from these facilities have been estimate in the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL based on data collected from other facilities in the direct drainage area of the Potomac River basin (MDE 2007). In order to refine these load estimates, MDE colle cted two 24-hour-composite samples from these facilities on February 25, 2010 and March 30, 2010. After adjusting the data based on levels detected in the blank samples and by excluding values for congeners with possible in terferences (i.e., cong. 1, 3, and on one occasion cong. 40), MDE used these results along with the 2005 average monitored flow to calculate WWTP PCB Baseline Loads (Table 5). Data results and the analytical methods used are summarized in Appendix A and Appendix E, respectively. Recently, the NPDES permit for Beltsville USDA East facility was renewed, and it now requires the collection of quarterly PCB grab samples. Similar requirements are expected to be part of the Beltsville USDA West permit once it comes up for re newal. This information will help to better FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 13characterize the actual loadings from these facilities and ensure that they are not contributing to the exceedance of the Maryland wate r column tPCB criteria. Congener specific analytical methods should be used when collecting any future samples. Ideally, the most current version of EPA Method 1668 should be used, or other equivalent methods capable of providing low-detection level, congener specific results. Othe r methods deemed appropriate, and approved in advance by the permitting authority, coul d also be used. In establishing the necessity and extent of data collection, MDE will take into account data that is already available as well as the proper characterization of intake (or pass through) conditions, c onsistent with NPDES program \"reasonable potential\" determinations and the appli cable provisions of the Environment Article and the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) for permitted facilities, including regulated stormwater.

Maryland NPDES Regulated Stormwater, Maryland Unregulated Watershed Runoff, and DC Upstream Baseline Loads The remaining loads (i.e., NEB a nd NWB Tributary Baseline Load minus Contaminates Site and WWTP Baseline Loads) can be attributed to the following source categories: Maryland NPDES Regulated Stormwater (SW), Maryland Unregulat ed Watershed Runoff (NPS), or DC Upstream Watershed (DC). Proportional contributions from each of these source categories in the NEB and NWB tributary drainage basins have been calculate d with the use of a wei ghted approach based on tPCB clam concentrations deployed in each char acterized sub-watershed (see Figure 7 and the associated discussion below), the land cover (L C) area making up each source category (Equation 1), and a runoff coefficient for each land cover category (Equation 2).

Areas regulated by the Mary land NPDES stormwater permits are represented in this analys is by the following 2006 land cover classifications: developed open space and low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity urban (USGS 2009). The remaining land cover classifications in the Maryland portion of these watersheds are included in the Maryland Unregulated Watershed Runoff Base line Loads. DC PCB baseline load s are not presented in terms of regulated and unregulated loads, but instead they are presented as a single DC Upstream Watershed Baseline Load (see Table 6).

The rationale for using a bivalve exposure study, as opposed to ambient water quality or extensive sediment studies, was that the results focus on those PCB congeners that are bi oavailable to aquatic organisms (i.e., a fraction of tPCB that enter the food web) . Also, because clams filter-feed over an extended period of time, the results are more representa tive of the average long-term conditions when compared with ambient water column grab samples.

For the purpose of the NEB and NW B PCB TMDL analysis clam data from the most adjacent station were used instead. Figure 7: Location of Clam Stations in the NEB and NWB Tributary Drainage Basins FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 17The study was conducted in a similar manner as described in MDE's 2005 clam study report (MDE 2009c). MDE personnel carried out all of the activities asso ciated with clam collection, deployment, and retrieval. Staff biologists collected Asiatic Clams, Corbicula fluminea, from a relatively uncontaminated population in the U pper Choptank River at Red Bridge s (i.e., reference site). Caged clams were then deployed throughout the NEB and NWB tributaries (see Figure 7). Samples were retrieved, depurated, frozen, and stored for tissue removal and PCB analysis after either 14 or 28 days of deployment. PCB analyti cal services were provided by th e University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) (see Appendix E fo r the description of the analytical methods). With a few exceptions, clams which were deployed ove r 28 days have been used in this analysis. In general, clam concentrations from all but one st ation (Station 20: 1.72 ng/g wet weight) were higher than the average reference concen tration (2.21 ng/g wet weight, n= 9), indicating that there are existing sources of PCBs located throughout most of the NEB and NWB drainage areas. The highest and the lowest concentrations were observed in di fferent portions of Paint Branch, a tributary of the NEB. Clam concentrations were initially intended to be used to quantify PCB baseline loads in the specific sub-watersheds via a simple mass-balance approach. However, this was not feasible in certain areas of the watershed, where downstream concentrations were lower than upstream concentrations. This loss of mass could not be accounted for in the calculation. Consequentl y, after accounting for WWTP and Contaminated Site PCB Baseline Loads, a weighted approach was used (see Equation 1) to distribute the remaining NEB and NWB Tr ibutary PCB Baseline Loads between Maryland NPDES Regulated Stormwater, Maryland Unregul ated Watershed Runoff, and DC Upstream Watershed source categories. This ap proach incorporates the best av ailable information pertaining to PCB loadings from the sub-watersheds making up th e NEB and NWB drainage basins, as well as the associated land cover categories a nd runoff coefficients, attributing the highest loads to areas with the highest clam tPCB concentrations and the highest runoff coefficients. The majority of the loads are attributed to the Maryland NPDES Regulated Stormwater source category (see Table 7), which is consistent with information provided in a journal article by Hwang and Foster (2008), where urban stor mwater is identified as a likel y major source of PCBs to the Anacostia River. Also, the San Francisco Bay P CB TMDL (2008) points out that \"contribution to the total load from non-urban runoff [in the San Fran cisco Bay watershed] is much smaller than that from urban runoff since the mean sediment concentration in open spaces is about 2 g/kg, whereas it is about 500 g/kg in urban spaces\" (SFBRWQCB 2009). 2.3.4. Summary In summary, areas of the watershed served by Maryland NPDES Regulated Stormwater followed by the DC Upstream Watershed and Maryland Unregulated Watershed Runoff constitute the major PCB sources in the NEB and NWB drainage basins. The remaining sources (particularly the identified Contaminated Sites and WWTP) comprise a relativ ely smaller portion of the Total Baseline Load (0.38% and 0.19%, respectively).

TMDL ENDPOINTS The objective of this report is to establish NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs supportive of the \"fishing\" designated use, which is protective of human health related to consumption of fish caught in these tributaries. Additionally, given that the downstream tidal waters are also impaired for PCBs in fish tissue and an already approved Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL report calls for 98% reductions of the NEB and NWB Tributary Baseli ne Loads in order to meet downstream TMDL targets (MDE 2007), the PCB TMDLs developed for th e NEB and NWB will need to be at least as protective as the tributary allocations proposed in the Tidal PCB TMDL. As described in Section 2.2, MDE evaluates PCB wate r quality conditions with the use of either the Maryland water column human health tPCB criteri on (0.64 ng/L, ppt) or the tPCB fish tissue listing threshold (currently 39 ng/g, ppb). For the purpose of addressing the NEB and NWB PCB listings, the 0.64 ng/L water column criteria is used as the TMDL endpoint.

Since the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL tributary allocations requir e higher PCB load reductions than would be necessary to meet WQS in the NEB and NWB tr ibutaries (see Table 9) , the Tidal PCB TMDL allocations have been adopted as the NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs.

TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LO ADS AND LOAD ALLOCATIONS 4.1. Overview A TMDL is the total amount of an impairing substa nce that a waterbody can receive and still meet WQSs. The TMDL may be expressed as a mass per uni t time, toxicity, or other appropriate measure and should be presented in terms of wasteload al locations (WLAs), load allocations (LAs), and either implicitly or explicitly marg in of safety (MOS) (CFR 2010a): TMDL = WLAs + LAs + MOS Equation 3 This section describes how the PCB TMDL a nd the corresponding LAs and WLAs have been developed for the NEB and NWB watersheds. The an alysis framework is described in Section 4.2, Section 4.3 addresses critical conditions and seasonality, while S ection 4.4 presents the allocation of loads between point and nonpoint sources. The MOS is discussed in Section 4.5. Finally, the TMDL is summarized in Section 4.6. 4.2. Analysis Framework Given that the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDLs already dictate reductions from the NEB and NWB that are required in or der to meet WQSs in the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia Rivers and that these reductions were deemed protective of the \"fishing\" de signated use in the NEB and NWB (see Section 3), no additional modeling was necessa ry in order to establish NEB and NWB TMDL values. Instead, the main purpose of the NEB and NW B TMDL effort summarized in this report was to further characterize NEB and NWB Tributar y Baseline Loads in terms of specific source categories (see Section 2.3 and Equation 4) and pr ovide each source category with appropriate baseline and TMDL allocations. 4.3. Critical Conditions and Seasonality Federal regulations require that TM DL analysis take into account th e impact of critical conditions and seasonality on water quality (C FR 2010b). The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the water quality is protected during th e most vulnerable times. The TMDLs presented in this document implicitly account for seasonal variat ions as well as critical cond itions. Given that at the observed concentrations acute conditions are not a concern a nd since PCB levels in fish become elevated due to long-term exposure, rather than temporary spik es in water column PCB concentration, it has been determined that the selection of the average PCB concentration as representing the baseline conditions adequately considers the impact of s easonal variations and critical conditions on the \"fishing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB. Fu rthermore, in order to meet downstream water quality standards (i.e., in Tidal Anacostia a nd Potomac Rivers), the proposed NEB and NWB TMDLs are lower (i.e., more protective) than woul d otherwise be required to meet water column concentrations protective of the \"fishing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB. 4.4. TMDL Allocations All TMDLs need to be presented in terms of WL As for point sources and LAs for nonpoint source loads generated within the assessment unit, and if applic able LAs for the natural background, tributary, and adjacent segment loads (CFR 2010a). As part of the TMDL analysis presented in this report, point sources have been identified th roughout the Maryland portio n of the NEB and NWB FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 21tributary drainage a include two WWTPs and Maryla nd NPDES Regulated Stormwater discharges (presented separately for Montgomer y and Prince George's County). Nonpoint sources include identified contaminated sites in the Maryland portion of the watershed, unregulated watershed runoff within the Mary land portion of these watershe ds, and DC upstream watershed sources (see Equation 4). TMDL w = WLA WWTP + WLA SW + LA CS + LA MD + LA DC + MOS Where: TMDL w = Watershed TMDL (presented separately WLA WLA (presented separately for Montgomery and Prince George's County) LA CS = Contaminated Site LA LA MD = MD Unregulated Watershed Runoff LA LA DC = DC Upstream Watershed LA MOS = Margin of Safety Equation 4 This section summarizes the NEB and NWB of th e Anacostia River PCB TMDL allocations. The State reserves the right to revise these allocations among different sources as long as they remain protective of the \"fishing\" designa ted use in the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River. 4.4.1. Point Sources Waste Water Treatment Plant WWTP WLAs were calculated as the facilities' design flow times the Maryland water column human health tPCB criterion. The estimated WWTP PCB WLA is 0.725 g/yr (see Table 10), which constitutes an overall reduction of 8.83% from the estimated Baseline Load. Given that the WWTP Baseline Loads are based on very limited water quality data, the actual loads might be slightly different. Thus, this characterization of WWTP Base line Loads will need to be evaluated during the initial stages of the implementation process. This information will help to better characterize the actual loadings from these faciliti es and ensure that they are not contributing to the exceedance of the Maryland water column tPCB criteria.

US EPA recognizes that av ailable data and information are usually not detailed enough to determine WLAs for NPDES re gulated stormwater disc harges on an outfall- specific basis (US EPA 2002). Theref ore, NPDES regulated stormwater allocations to the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed w ill be expressed as a single WLA for each County. Upon approval of the TMDLs, \"NPDES-regulated municipal stormwater and small construction storm water discharges effluent limits should be e xpressed as BMPs or other similar requirements, rather than as numeric effluent limits\" (US EPA 2002). The NPDES Regulated Stormwater WLAs were established by reducing NPDES Regulated Stormwater Baseline Loads by 98.64% and 98.10% in NE B and NWB, respectively (see Table 11). For more information on methods used to calcula te the NPDES Regulated Stormwater PCB Baseline Loads, please see Section 2.3.3. The NPDES Regulated Stormwater WLAs may include any or all of the NPDES stormwater discharges listed in Se ction 2.3; see Appendix C for a list of specific stormwater permits within the watershed. As stormwater assessment and/or other program monitoring efforts result in a more refined source assessment, MDE reserves the right to revise the current NPDES Regulated Stormwat er WLA provided the revisions are protective of the \"fishing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anacostia River watershed. 4.4.2. Nonpoint Sources Load allocations have assigned to the fo llowing nonpoint sources: cont aminated sites within the the wate rshed, unregulated watershed runo ff within the Maryland portion of the watershed, and DC upstream watershed. Given th at a number of contaminated sites have already undergone remediation and their baseline loads constitu te a relatively small pe rcentage of the Total Baseline Load (i.e., 0.38%), these s ites are not intended to be target ed during the init ial stages of implementation and thus at this point were not subj ected to any reductions. However, if in the future it becomes clear that the TMDL goa ls cannot be achieved without load reductions from these sites, additional reduction measures might need to be c onsidered. As for the remaining nonpoint sources, LAs to the Unregulated Watershe d Runoff within the Maryland por tion of the watershed and DC Upstream Watershed were established by reducin g the Baseline Loads from each source category by 98.64% and 98.10% in the NEB and NWB, respectively (see Table 11). 4.5. Margin of Safety All TMDLs must include a margin of safety to account for the lack of knowledge and the many uncertainties in the understanding and simulation of water quality parameters in natural systems (i.e., the relationship between modeled loads and water qua lity). The MOS is intended to account for such uncertainties in a manner that is conservative from the standpoint of environmental protection. In the methods used to establish the NEB and NWB Tri butary PCB TMDLs, which are the bases of the TMDLs presented in this report, in addition to an implicit MOS incorporat ed through the use of conservative assumptions, an explicit MOS equal to 5% of the TMDL was reserved for loadings from tributary sources (MDE 2007). This beco mes the MOS for the NEB and NWB TMDLs (see Table 11). FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 234.6.

FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 24 5. ASSURANCE OF IMPLEMENTATION The TMDLs presented in this report call for subs tantial reductions in PCB loads from diffuse sources present throughout the tw o highly urbanized watersheds. Given that PCBs are no longer manufactured and their use has been substantially restricted, it is re asonable to expect that with time PCB concentrations in the aquatic environment will decline due to natural attenuation, such as burial of contaminated sediments with newer, less cont aminated materials, flushing of sediments during periods of high stream flow, and biodegradation. Data from other parts of the state indicate that PCB levels in ambient water are dec lining (MDE 2009d). However, PCBs ar e still being released to the environment via accidental fires, leaks, or spi lls from older PCB-containing equipment; potential leaks from hazardous waste sites th at contain PCBs; illegal or improper dumping; and disposal of PCB containing products (e.g., transformers, old fluor escent lighting fixtures, electrical devices, or appliances containing PCB capacitors, old microscope oil, and old hydraulic o il) into landfills that are not designed to handle hazardous waste. Therefor e, natural attenuation al one is not expected to completely eliminate the PCB impairment in the NEB and NWB. Due to the potential existence of unidentified sources of PCB cont amination through the watershed and the significant load reductions required to meet the PCB water column criteria, achievement of the NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs may not be feasible by solely enforcing effluent limitations on known point sources and implementing best mana gement practices (BMPs) on nonpoint sources. Therefore, an adaptive approach of implementati on is anticipated, with subsequent monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the ongoing implementation efforts to ma nage potential risks to both recreational and subsistence fish consumers. The success of the implementation process will depend in large part on the feasibility of locating and evaluating opportunities to control on-land PCB sources, such as unidentified contaminated sites, leaky equipment, and contaminated soil or sedi ment. A collaborative approach involving MDE and the identified NPDES permit hol ders as well as those res ponsible for nonpoint PCB runoff throughout the watersheds will be used to work toward attaining the WLAs and LAs presented in this report. The reductions will be implemented in an adaptive and iterative process, focusing first on sources with the largest impact on water quality while giving consideration to the relative cost and ease of implementation. The implementation efforts wi ll be periodically eval uated, and if necessary, improved, in order to further progress toward achie ving the water quality goals. The implementation actions will focus first on the sub-watersheds with the highest clam tPCB concentrations (see Figure 7), since the discovery and elimin ation of ongoing PCB sources in thes e sub-watersheds is expected to produce the most beneficial results. Any future monitoring should include congener specifi c analytical methods. Ideally, the most current version of EPA Method 1668 should be used, or other equivalent me thods capable of providing low- detection level, congener specific re sults. In establishing the necessity and extent of data collection, MDE will collaborate with the affected stakeholders , and take into account data that is already available as well as the proper ch aracterization of intake (or pa ss through) conditions, consistent with NPDES program \"reasonable potential\" determ inations and the applicable provisions of the Environment Article and the Code of Maryland Regulations for permitted facilities. Under certain conditions, EPA's NPDES regulati ons allow the use of non-numeric, BMP water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs). BMP WQ BELs can be used where \"numeric effluent FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 25limitations are infeasible; or the practices are r easonably necessary to achie ve effluent limitations and standards or to carry out th e purposes and intent of the CWA\" (CFR 2010c). For example, MDE's Phase I MS4 permits require restoration targ ets for impervious surface s (i.e., restore 10% or 20% of a jurisdiction's total impervious cover with no stormwater management/BMPs), and these restoration efforts have known T SS reduction efficiencies. Since PCBs are known to adsorb to sediments and their concentrations correlate with TSS concentrations, th e significant restoration requirements in the MS4 permits, which will lead to a reduction in sediment loads entering the NEB and NWB stream network, will also contribute toward PCB load reductions and meeting PCB water quality goals. Other BMPs that focus on PCB sour ce tracking and elimination at the source rather than end-of-pipe controls are also warranted. Du e to this known relations hip between TSS and PCB concentrations, implementation of the existing TMDL s for sediments and nutrients in the Anacostia River watershed will further progress towards ach ieving the NPDES Regulat ed Stormwater WLAs, and additionally the non point source LAs. Where necessary, the source characterization effort s will be followed with pollution minimization and reduction measures that will include BMPs fo r reducing runoff from ur ban areas, identification and termination of ongoing sources (e.g., industrial uses of equipment that contain PCBs), etc. The identified NPDES regulated WWTP and stormwater c ontrol agency permits will be expected to be consistent with the WLAs presented in this repor t. Both WWTPs in the watersheds are owned and operated by the United States Department of Agri culture. Numerous stor mwater dischargers are located in the NEB and NWB of the nontidal Anaco stia River watershed including two Municipal Phase I MS4s (Montgomery and Prince George's c ounties), the State Highway Administration Phase I MS4, 40 industrial facilities, 14 Phase II Munici pal MS4s, State and Federal Phase II MS4s, and any construction activities on area greater than 1 ac re (see Appendix C of this document to view the current list of known NPDES stor mwater dischargers). The curre nt Montgomery County Phase I MS4 permit already requires that the jurisdiction develops an implementation plan to meet its assigned NPDES Regulated Stormwater WLAs. Similar requirements are expected to be put in place in the future Prince George's County and Mary land State Highway Administration Phase I MS4 permits. Additionally, the appropriate Washington, DC agencies will also need to investigate and eliminate possible sources of PCBs in the DC portion of the NWB draina ge basin due to their influence on PCB conditions in NWB and tidal Anacostia River. Private, public, and governmental properties known by the state to be contaminated or have the potential for contamination are identified on the St ate Master List, otherwis e known as the list of State Superfund sites. Newly identified sites can be added to the State Mast er List via the federal Superfund cleanup process, which begins with site discovery or notification to EPA of possible releases of hazardous substances. Sites can be di scovered by various parties including citizens, state agencies, and EPA Regional offices. Once discovere d, sites are entered into EPA's computerized inventory of potential hazardous substance release sites [i.e ., Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Informati on System (CERCLIS)], wh ich are then evaluated by EPA through the Superfund cleanup process (US EP A 2010a). The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund administered by MDE pr ovides low interest loans for cl eanup costs to complete approved cleanup plans for sites on the State Master List or in the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP), where water quality is an issue. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 26Given that a number of contamin ated sites have already undergone remediation and their baseline loads constitute a relatively small percentage of the Total Baseline Load (i.e., 0.38%), these sites are not intended to be targeted during th e initial stages of implementation and thus at this point were not subjected to any reductions. However, if in the fu ture it becomes clear that the TMDL goals cannot be achieved without load reductions from these sites, additional reduc tion measures might need to be considered. Given the persistent nature of P CBs, the difficulty in removing them from the environment, and the significant reductions necessary in order to achieve water quality goals in the NEB and NWB, effectiveness of the implementation effort will n eed to be reevaluated throughout the process to ensure progress is being made towards reaching the TMDLs. As part of Maryland's Watershed Cycling Strategy, follow-up monitoring and assessment will be routinely conduc ted to evaluate the implementation status in the NEB and NWB. MD E also periodically monitors and evaluates concentrations of contaminants in recreationally caught fis h, shellfish, and crabs throughout Maryland. MDE will use these monitoring programs to evaluate progress towards meeting the \"fishing\" designated use in NEB and NWB.

Technical Approach Used to Generate Maximum Daily Load Summary This appendix documents the technical approach used to define the MDLs of tPCBs consistent with the average annual TMDLs, which are protective of the \"fis hing\" designated use in the NEB and NWB of the Anacostia River watershed. Th e approach builds upon th e analysis that was conducted to determine the average annual NEB and NWB PCB TMDLs and can be summarized as follows: The approach defines an MDL for each of the source categories; The approach builds upon the TMDL analysis that was conducted to ensure that the average annual TMDL results in compliance with water quality standards; The approach considers a daily load level of a resolution based on the specific data that exists for each source category. Introduction This appendix documents the deve lopment and application of the approach used to present the average annual PCB TMDL allocations in terms of daily loads. It is divided into sections discussing: Basis for approach; Options considered; Selected approach; Results of approach. Basis for Approach The overall approach for the development of da ily loads was based upon the following factors: Average Annual TMDL: The basis of the average annual PCB TMDL is that the NEB and NWB Baseline Loads result in water co lumn concentrations that exceed the tPCB criterion protective of the \"f ishing\" designated use. Thus, the average annual PCB TMDL was calculated to be protective of this designated use. Draft US EPA guidance document entitled Options for the Expression of Daily Loads in TMDLs (US EPA 2007). The rationale for developing TMDLs expressed as daily loads was to accept the existing average annual TMDLs, but then develop a method for converting these numbers to their corresponding MDLs - in a manner consistent with US EPA guidance and available information. Options Considered The draft US EPA guidance document for deve loping daily loads does not specify a single approach that must be adhered to, but rather it contains a range of acceptable options (US EPA 2007). The selection of a specific method for translat ing a time-series of allowable loads into the expression of an MDL requires decisions regardin g both the level of reso lution (e.g., single daily FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 B2load for all conditions vs. loads that vary with environmental conditions) and level of probability associated with the exceedance of the TMDL. Th is section describes th e options that were considered when developing methods to calculate the NEB and NWB MDLs. Level of Resolution The level of resolution pertains to the amount of detail used in specifying the MDL. The draft US EPA guidance on daily loads (US EPA 2007) provide s three categories of options for level of resolution, all of which are potentially applicable to the NEB and NWB: 1. Representative daily load: In this option, a single daily load (or multiple representative daily loads) is specified that covers al l time periods and environmental conditions. 2. Flow-variable daily load: This option allows the MDL to vary based upon the observed flow conditions. 3. Temporally-variable daily load: This option allows the MDL to vary based upon seasons or times of varying source or water body behavior (US EPA 2007). Probability Level All TMDLs have some probability of being ex ceeded, with the specific probability being explicitly specified or implicitly assumed. This leve l of probability directly or indirectly reflects two separate phenomena: 1. Water quality criteria consist of compone nts describing acceptable magnitude, duration, and frequency. The frequency component addr esses how often conditions can allowably surpass the combined magnitude and duration components. 2. Pollutant loads, especially from wet weathe r sources, typically exhibit a large degree of variability over time. It is rarely practical to specify a \"never to be exceeded value\" for a daily load, as essentially any loading value has some finite probability of being exceeded. The draft daily load guidance doc ument states that the probabili ty component of the MDL should be \"based on a representative st atistical measure\" that is depe ndent upon the specific TMDL and best professional judgment of the developers (U S EPA 2007). This statistical measure represents how often the MDL is expected/all owed to be exceeded. The prim ary options for selecting this level of protection would be: 1. The MDL reflects some central tendency: In this option, the MDL is based upon the mean or median value of the range of loads expected to occur. The variability in the actual loads is not addressed. 2. The MDL reflects a level of protection impl icitly provided by the selection of some \"critical\" period : In this option, the MDL is base d upon the allowable load that is predicted to occur during some critical period examined during the analysis. The developer does not explicitly specify the probability of occurrence. 3. The MDL is a value that will be exceeded with a pre-defined probability: In this option, a \"reasonable\" upper bound percentil e is selected for the MDL based upon a characterization of the variab ility of daily loads. For ex ample, selection of the 95th percentile value would result in an MDL that would be exceeded 5% of the time. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 B3Selected Approach The level of resolution selected for the NEB and NWB MDLs was a representative daily load, expressed as a single daily load for each loading source category. This approach was chosen due to the nature of PCBs and the TM DL endpoint that is protective of the \"fishing\" designated use. Occasional daily load exeedances are not expe cted to affect the long-term fish PCB bioaccumulation rate. An allocation at these levels of resolution is thus unwarranted. However, EPA recommends that all future TMDLs and associ ated LAs and WLAs be expressed in terms of daily time increments. The approach selected for defining NEB and NWB MDLs was based upon the specific data that exists for each source category. The approach co nsists of unique methods for each of the following categories of sources: Approach for Nonpoint Sources and NPDES Regulated Stormw ater Point Sources within the NEB and NWB watersheds; Approach for NPDES permitted WWTP Point Sources within the NEB watershed; and Approach for Upstream Sources. Approach for Nonpoint Sources and NPDES Re gulated Stormwater Point Sources within the NEB and Watersheds The Nonpoint Source and NPDES Regulated Stor mwater Point Source MDLs were estimated based on three factors: a specified probability level, the average annual PCB TMDL allocations, and the coefficient of variati on (CV) of the baseline conditio ns for ambient water column concentrations in the NEB and NWB. The probability level (or exceedance frequency) is based upon guidance from US EPA (1991) where examples suggest that when converting from a long- term average to a daily value, the z-score corresponding to the 99 th percentile of the log-normal probability distribution should be used. The CVs of 0.985 and 0.945 were calculated for the NEB and NWB, re spectively using the arithmetic mean and standard de viation of the baseline ambient wa ter column concentrations in these watersheds (see Equation B1). CV (Equation B1) Where: CV = coefficient of variation = mean (arithmetic) = standard deviation (arithmetic) The MDL for each contributing source is estimat ed as the appropriate average annual load allocation for that source category multiplied by a conversion factor that accounts for expected variability of daily loading valu es. The equation is as follows: FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 2011 B4)5.0 (2*ze LTA MDL (Equation B2) Where: MDL = Maximum daily load LTA = Long-term average (avera ge annual load allocation) Z = z-score associated with target probability level 2 = ln(CV2+1) CV = Coefficient of variation based on ar ithmetic mean and standard deviation Using a z-score of 2.326 associated with the 99 th percentile probability, CVs of 0.985 (NEB) and 0.945 (NWB), and an appropriate unit conversion (i.e ., from long-term average load (g/yr) to an MDL (mg/day)) results in a conversion factor of 13.253 and 12.764 for NEB and NWB Nonpoint Sources and NPDES Regulated Stormw ater Point Source average annual loads, respectively. Approach for WWTP Point Sources within the NEB Watershed The TMDL also considers cont ributions from NPDES permitted WWTP point sources that discharge quantifiable concentrations of PCBs in the NEB watershed. The MDL was calculated based on the guidance provided in the Technica l Support Document (TSD) for Water Quality- based Toxics Control (US EPA 1991). The aver age annual TMDL allocation was converted to maximum daily limits using Table 5-2 of the TSD assuming a CV of 0.6, a z-score of 2.326 associated with the 99th percentile probability, and an appr opriate unit conversion (i.e., from long-term average load (g/yr) to an MDL (mg/day )). This results in a co nversion factor of 8.533. Approach for Upstream Sources For the purpose of this analysis, only the Washington, DC portion of the NWB watershed is classified as an Upstream Source. The DC Upstream Watershed MDL was calculated based on the same approach as was used for nonpoint sources and NPDES regulated stormwater point sources within the NWB watershed (see above). Results of Approach This section lists the results of the selected approaches to define the NEB and NWB MDLs.

FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 D1Appendix D. Contaminated Site Load Calculation Methodology The term contaminated site used throughout th is report refers to areas with known PCB soil contamination, as documented by state or federa l hazardous waste clean up programs (i.e., state or federal Superfund programs). When compared ag ainst the human health screening criteria for soil and groundwater exposure path ways, PCBs are not necessarily a contaminant of concern at these sites, but have been screen ed for, reported, and detected dur ing formal site investigations. Initially, three contaminated sites (comprised of multiple sub-sites) located in the NEB drainage basin were identified as part of the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL effort (MDE 2007), and the EOF PCB baseline loads for these sites were estimated (see Table D-1). Table D-1: Summary of Contaminat ed Sites Included in the Tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL Tributary Load Characterization Facility Location EOF PCB Loads (g/yr) United Rigging and Hauling NEB 0.05 White Oak NEB 3.05 Beltsville Agricultural Research Center NEB 3.41 Data Source: MDE 2007 As part of the NEB and NWB Tributary PCB TM DL effort summarized in this report, the 2007 contaminated site list and the associated loadings have been refined. The list of sites has been updated based on information gathered from the US EPA's Superfund and MDE's LRP-MAP databases (US EPA 2010; MDE 2010). A total of 15 sub-sites (see Table D-2) have been identified with PCB soil concentrations at or above method detection levels, as determined via soil sample results contained within MDE LMA' s records of contaminated site surveys and investigations. All of the sites are located with in the NEB watershed. PCB EOF loads from these sites have been calculated and subsequently converted to EOS loads using methods applied within Maryland's nontidal sediment TMDLs, thir teen of which have been approved by the EPA since 2006. Given that not all of the contaminated site PCB loads are expected to reach the nearby streams, EOS loads are thought to be a more accurate representa tion of actual PCB loads from these sites in terms of their impact on downstream water quality. The purpose of this appendix is to describe the detailed procedures used to calculate the Contaminated Site PCB Baseline Loads. I. PCB Soil Concentration Data Processing The Contaminated Site PCB Baseline Loads were only characterized for those sites and samples where PCB concentrations were found to be at or above method detection limits. When a sample was analyzed for multiple PCB congener mixe s and more than one PCB congener mix was detected (e.g., 1242 or 1260), the results were adde d together to represent tPCB concentrations. Next, the median value of the tPCB concentrations from each sub-site was calculated (see Table D-2).

II. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version II Soil Loss Calculation Procedures The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version II (RUSLE2)1 was run for each site with the use of the Maryland state climate database, c ounty soil databases, and management databases that can be downloaded from the following website: http://fargo.nserl.pu rdue.edu/rusle2_dataweb/RUSLE2_Index.htm . The site characteristics (i.e., soil types, land cover, slope, etc.) were selected from drop down menus provided in the RUSLE2 worksheet. Input parameters were sel ected via the following decision rules: 1. Location: The appropriate county name was sele cted from the Maryland state climate database in the RUSLE2 location field. This resulted in an automatic selection of the appropriate climatic factors. 1 RUSLE2 is an advanced, user-friendly software model developed by the University of Tennessee Biosystems Engineering & Soil Science Department, in cooperation w ith USDA - Agricultural Res earch Service (ARS), the National Sedimentation Laboratory, the USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Bureau of Land Management. FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 D3 2. Soil: Soil type, which was identified from either LMA's site survey and investigation records or via Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis, was selected from the appropriate county's soils data base in the RUSLE2 worksheet . Soil type determined from the site investigations and surveys was specifi cally pulled from site descriptions and soil maps. If subsurface slope was not specified for a particular soil type in the site survey and investigation records, the lowest subsurface slope for the given soil type in the RUSLE2 database was used. Additionally, soil type for some sites was identified via GIS analysis using a digitized site area and soils data acquired from the USDA-NRCS. For sites with multiple soil types, soil loss was first calcu lated for each soil type based on the site's parameters (e.g. slope and slope length). Then, the soil loss values for each soil type were weighted based on the percentage of the site th at the given soil type occupied. Finally, the summation of the weighted soil loss values was calculated to produce a total soil loss for the entire site. 3. Slope Length: Slope length (length of the site), which was identified from either LMA's site survey and investigation records or via GIS analysis, wa s manually inserted into the slope length field. Slope length from the site in vestigation and survey records was calculated based on site descri ptions, topographic maps, or other available information. Slope length was also calculated for some sites via GIS analysis using flow direction grids generated from Digital Elevation Models, acquired from the USGS, and/or digital USGS quadrangles (i.e., topographic maps). The maximum slope length permitted by the soil loss equation was 2000 feet. For sites wi th length greater th an 2000 feet, 2000 feet was used. 4. Percent Slope: Percent slope, or slope steepness, (the difference between maximum and minimum site elevations/slope length), whic h was identified from either LMA's site survey and investigation records or via GIS analysis, was manually inserted into the percent slope field. Percent slope was calculated via site surveys and i nvestigations from site descriptions and site topographic maps. When informa tion regarding average slope was not provided in the site description a nd a precise topographic map was not available for the site, slope was calculated based on the sl ope of the area where the site was located. For the original sites identified as part of the tidal Potomac and Anacostia PCB TMDL effort, if a topographic map of the larger region was not available, or if slope could not be determined because of the flat nature of the site, a minimal slope of 1% was assumed. Also, slope steepness for some sites was cal culated via a combination of maximum and minimum site elevations from the site inve stigations and surveys and the GIS estimated slope length. 5. Management: The management option field was used to represent a site's land cover (i.e., forest, grass, barren, etc.), which was identified from either LMA's site survey and investigation records or via GIS analysis (i.e ., agricultural management options were used to approximate the soil loss characteristics of the land covers present at these non- agricultural sites). For example, for sites c overed by grass, the warm season grass - not harvested management option was selected; fo r wooded sites, the established orchard - full cover option was selected; and for sites w ith bare soil, the bare ground management FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 D4option was selected. Land cover estimates dete rmined from site investigation and survey records were taken from site descriptions a nd any applicable maps. For other sites, land cover areas were estimated using GIS analys is; specifically, cover areas were digitized using the State of Maryland's 2006 6-in ch resolution aerial photography. III. Calculating EOF PCB loads The RUSLE2 generated soil loss va lues, reported in tons/acre/year per soil type, were used in conjunction with adjusted pervious area estimat es and median tPCB soil concentrations to determine the EOF contaminated site PCB loads. Pervious area estimates were adjusted for each site based on the percent of PCB samples that were above the method detection limit (e.g., if only 25% of the samples had PCB concentrations above method detection limit, only 25% of the previous area of the site was us ed in the calculations). To be consistent with the RUSLE2 soil loss units, the median tPCB soil concentrations were converted to pounds of tPCBs per pound of soil (lbs/lb). The EOF contaminated site PCB lo ads are reported here as g/yr (Table D-3).

Calculating EOS PCB loads Given that not all of the EOF contaminated site PCB loads ar e expected to reach the nearby streams, EOS loads are thought to be a more accurate representation of the actual PCB loads from these sites in terms of their impact on downstream water quality. EOS values were FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 D5calculated using methods applied within Maryla nd's nontidal sediment TMDLs, thirteen of which have been approved by the EPA sin ce 2006.

FINAL NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 D6V. Contaminated Site Baseline Load Summary The Contaminated Site PCB Baseline Load from the identified sites in the NEB and NWB is estimated to be 1.61 g/yr. This load is the su m of individual PCB loads from 15 contaminated sites within the NEB drainage basin, a numbe r of which have undergone remediation. The average PCB concentrations at the non-remediated sites are below levels detected at the already remediated sites. No contaminated sites have been identified in the NWB drainage basin. NEB and NWB PCB TMDL Document Version: September 30, 2011 E1 Appendix E. List of Analyzed PCB Congeners Water column data were collected and an alyzed by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at GMU. PCB congeners were id entified and quantified by high resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. GM U uses a slightly modified version of the PCB congener specific method described in Foster et al. (2000), in wh ich the identities and concentrations of each congener in a mixed Aroclor standard (25: 18:18 mixture of Aroclors 1232, 1248, and 1262) are determined based on their chromatographic retention times relative to the internal standards (PCB 30 and PCB 204). Based on this method, 72 chromatographic peaks can be quantified (see Table E-1). Some of the peak s contain one PCB congener, while others are comprised of two or more co-eluting congeners.
