Not refunded - Free price - Pfizer Family Health Laboratory | p caps | | Ibuprofen || 200mg | | Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride || 30 mg | | Soy lecithin || + | This medication contains ibuprofen, ( and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant [vasoconstrictor] that reduces the feeling of stuffy nose. It is used to relieve cold symptoms: stuffy nose, runny nose, headache and / or fever. This medicine should not be used in the following cases: Any prolonged treatment or [overdose] of [NSAIDs can lead] to serious side effects. Although sold over the counter, this medicine contains a [vasoconstrictor] that can cause potentially serious cardiac or neurological adverse reactions. Its use requires certain precautions, especially the respect of doses and contraindications. Make sure you do not combine it with any other drug containing a decongestant [vasoconstrictor] , especially [tachycardia] ) and cause [palpitations] and nausea. If these side effects are too severe, treatment should be discontinued. They can also be responsible for rare neurological complications ( [convulsions] , hallucinations, abnormal agitation), especially in case of excessive [dosage] . Respect the recommended dose. It is recommended to take medical advice in case of [arterial hypertension] , heart disease, nervous disorders, [history] of stomach [duodenum] or Certain must lead to continue treatment only after medical advice: - severe heartburn or black, foul-smelling stools that may indicate irritation or bleeding from the digestive tract; - [rash] without obvious cause; - [asthma attack] ; - Unusual and intense fatigue, or abrupt and significant decrease in the volume of urine in a person suffering from [heart failure] , dehydration or [diuretic therapy] . Taking this medicine can cause acute [glaucoma] in susceptible individuals: red, hard and sore eyes with blurred vision. An emergency consultation with an ophthalmologist is necessary. NSAIDs have an inhibitory effect on ovulation and are likely to decrease fertility in women. This effect is reversible when the treatment is stopped. Some doctors consider that anti-inflammatory drugs can decrease the effectiveness of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and expose them to a risk of unwanted pregnancy. This risk is very controversial. Driver: This medication may be responsible in rare cases for vertigo or visual disturbances. Sports: This medicine contains a substance considered stimulant (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine or synephrine) which is included in the 2004 surveillance program of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. It can be sought in the urine of athletes to detect a possible misuse. This drug should not be associated with: - a nonselective [MAOI] [antidepressant] ( MARSILID ): a delay of at least 15 days must be respected between taking these 2 drugs; - another oral MAOI selective A (moclobemide). It may also interact with other drugs, including aspirin, other [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory] drugs, [anticoagulants] , [platelet aggregation] inhibitors, and drugs containing lithium or methotrexate. Also, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking an [antihypertensive] drug, a [diuretic,] or a medicine containing guanethidine. Pregnancy : Adverse effects for the unborn child have been demonstrated when [NSAIDs] are used during the last 4 months of pregnancy; the risk exists even with a single dose and even if the pregnancy is complete. Use of this medication is contraindicated during this time. During the first 5 months, the effect of this medicine is poorly known: only your doctor can evaluate the possible risk of its use in your case. Breastfeeding: This medicine passes into breast milk. It is contraindicated during breastfeeding. The capsules are swallowed with a glass of water, preferably during meals. Usual dosage: - Adult and child over 15 years: 1 or 2 capsules, to renew if necessary every 6 hours, without exceeding 6 capsules per day. The duration of treatment should not exceed 5 days. This medicine has no anti-infective effect. If the symptoms persist for more than a few days, consult your doctor. Related to ibuprofen: Nausea, vomiting, [gastritis] . Rarely: - [ulcer] or [duodenum] , [haemorrhage] of the digestive tract (bloody vomiting, black stools, or most often imperceptible blood loss, responsible for the gradual onset of [anemia] ) most often during long-term treatment duration or high pressure; - [dizziness] , headache; - vision count] urinary retention. Nausea, vomiting. [Palpitations] , heart acceleration, insomnia, anxiety, headache, sweating. More rarely: hallucinations, agitation. [prostate adenoma ] Increase in the volume of the prostate gland located under the bladder of the man. This increase in volume is benign, has nothing to do with cancer, but may hinder the passage of urine in the canal (urethra) that passes through the gland. The symptoms that suggest the presence of a prostate adenoma are: - Difficulty urinating (slow, weak jet) - the need to get up several times a night to urinate; - urges to urinate imperious and difficult to control. Some drugs, especially atropine, may have the undesirable effect of aggravating the discomfort and may lead to a complete blockage of the evacuation of the bladder. They are therefore contraindicated or should be used with caution in men with the symptoms described above. [NSAIDs ] Abbreviation for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Family of anti-inflammatory drugs that are not derived from cortisone (steroids), and the best known is aspirin. [allergy ] Skin reaction (itching, pimples, swelling) or general discomfort occurring after contact with a particular substance, use of a medication or ingestion of a food. The main forms of allergy are eczema, urticaria, asthma, angioedema and allergic shock (anaphylactic shock). Food allergy can also result in digestive disorders. [anemia ] Decreased hemoglobin level in the blood, which most often results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Iron is essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency during pregnancy, vegetarian diet, heavy or repeated bleeding (menstruation) is a common cause of anemia. Other, rarer causes are related to vitamin B deficiencies. [analgesic ] Drug that acts against pain. Analgesics act either directly on the centers of pain located in the brain, or by blocking the transmission of pain to the brain. Synonym: analgesic. [antecedent ] Affection healed or still evolving. The antecedent can be personal or family. The antecedents are the story of a person's health. [antiplatelet agents ] Drug that prevents platelets from clumping together and clots from forming. The oldest platelet antiaggregant is aspirin taken in small doses. Antiaggregants should not be confused with anticoagulants with different mechanisms of action. [anti coagulants ] A drug that prevents blood from clotting and prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also help prevent clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of artificial heart valves. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: the INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants, derived from heparin, the effectiveness of which can be controlled by the blood determination of the anti-Xa activity, the Howell's Time (TH) or the Kaolin Cephalin Time (TCK) according to the products used. Regular dosing of blood platelets is necessary throughout the duration of use of a heparin derivative. [antidepressant ] Drug that acts against depression. Some antidepressants are also used to combat obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety, some rebel pain, enuresis, etc. Depending on their mode of action and their adverse effects, antidepressants are divided into different families: imipramine antidepressants, MAOIs (selective or non-selective). Finally, other antidepressants do not belong to any of these families because they possess original properties. The mode of action of antidepressants has two main aspects: the relief of the moral suffering and the fight against the inhibition which removes any will of action to the depressed. Sometimes there is a discrepancy between these two effects: the moral suffering can persist, while the capacity for action reappears. During this short period, the suicidal risk present in some depressed may be increased. The doctor takes this into account when prescribing (possible association with a tranquilizer) and this must be strictly observed. [antihypertensive ] Drug that fights against excess blood pressure. The main ones are beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors and vasodilators. [anti-inflammatory ] Drug that fights inflammation. It can be either derived from cortisone (steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), or not derived from cortisone (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID). [antipyretic ] Medication used to lower body temperature during fever attacks. [asthma ] Disease characterized by difficulty breathing, often resulting in whistling. Asthma, permanent or occurring by crisis, is due to narrowing and bronchial inflammation. [convulsions ] Involuntary contractions limited to a few muscles or generalized to the whole body. They are due to suffering or excessive stimulation of the brain: fever, intoxication, lack of oxygen, brain damage. Seizures may be due to an epileptic seizure or high fever in young children. [Crohn ] Inflammation disease of the intestine, which can cause ulcers and narrowing. It often becomes chronic and can be accompanied by persistent diarrhea and malnutrition. [diabetes ] General term for diseases resulting in the emission of abundant urine and intense thirst. Employed alone, the word diabetes generally concerns diabetes mellitus, which corresponds to a disruption of the body's sugar regulation by insulin. It results in the increase of sugar (glucose) in the blood and by its possible presence in the urine. There are two types of diabetes mellitus: type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, which requires treatment with insulin injection, and type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which may initially be treated with oral antidiabetic drugs. [diuretic ] Drug allowing an increased elimination of water by the kidneys. Most often, this loss of water follows the loss of salts caused by the drug (salidiuretic). Diuretics are mainly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, while their mechanism of action in this disease is poorly understood. They are also prescribed in acute or chronic heart failure, edema and other more rare conditions. These drugs cause a loss of sodium and potassium (except for some of them called \"potassium sparing\"). Their prolonged intake therefore requires regular control of blood potassium, to avoid the cardiac disorders that could result from hypokalemia (lack of potassium in the blood). Lack of sodium is another possible consequence, but rarer at usual dosages, from prolonged use of diuretics; it is also detected by a blood test. [duodenum ] Part of the intestine into which food from the stomach enters. [skin rash ] Appearance of pimples or plaques on the skin. These lesions can be due to a food, to a drug, and to translate an allergy or a toxic effect. Many viruses can also cause pimple eruptions: rubella, roseola and measles are the most common. [gastritis ] Inflammation of the stomach favored by stress, tobacco, alcohol and certain drugs such as aspirin or anti-inflammatories. [glaucoma ] Disease characterized by the increase of the pressure of the liquids contained in the eye (intraocular hypertension). This general term covers two completely different affections: - Open-angle glaucoma or chronic glaucoma is the most common; it is usually symptom free, detected by measurement of intraocular pressure in the ophthalmologist. It does not cause an acute attack, and the treatment is essentially based on beta-blocker eye drops. People with open-angle glaucoma should not use cortisone derivatives without prior ophthalmic advice. - Angle-closure glaucoma or acute glaucoma is more rare. Between seizures, intraocular tension is normal. But the inadvertent use of atropine drugs (especially eye drops) causes an acute attack of intraocular hypertension that can permanently damage the retina in a few hours. It is an ophthalmological emergency that can be recognized by a brutally red eye, horribly painful, hard as a glass ball, and whose vision becomes blurred. The angle referred to in these two affections is the iridocorneal angle. It is indeed between the iris and the cornea that the liquid evacuation system of the eye is located. A slightly open angle (closed) exposes to a total obstruction of the evacuation system. This obstruction can occur when the iris is open to the maximum (mydriasis) under the effect of an atropine drug: the iris then sticks to the cornea. The contraindications for atropine medications only apply to people who have had an angle-closure glaucoma attack, or for whom an ophthalmologist has detected this risk. Those with chronic open angle glaucoma are not affected by these contraindications. [haemorrhage ] Loss of blood from an artery or vein. Hemorrhage can be external, but also internal and go unnoticed. [high blood pressure ] Excess pressure (tension) of the blood in the arteries. This pressure is provided by the heart and is expressed by two numbers. It is maximal during the contraction of the heart, or systole (first digit), and minimum during the cardiac rest, or diastole (second digit). Hypertension is characterized by a maximal (systolic) pressure greater than or equal to 16, or a minimum (diastolic) pressure greater than or equal to 9.5. Treatment is initiated when these numbers are exceeded or for lower voltages in some people with cardiovascular risk factors: heredity, smoking, diabetes, excess cholesterol. Permanent antihypertensive therapy can reduce the damage to the heart and blood vessels caused by high blood pressure. [hyperthyroidism ] Excess thyroid hormones including heart acceleration, poor heat tolerance, weight loss and chronic fatigue. [MAOIs ] Abbreviation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Family of drugs used in psychiatry and neurology (depression, Parkinson's disease). These drugs are divided into two types: non-selective MAOIs, which are incompatible with many drugs and even certain foods, and selective MAOIs (A or B), for which these drawbacks are absent or limited. [heart failure ] Inability of the heart to fulfill its pump function. The main symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and shortness of breath during exercise. [coronary insufficiency ] Partial inability of the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) to irrigate the heart muscle. Angina attacks can occur, most often during an effort. [Hepatic insufficiency ] Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of certain wastes, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [renal failure ] Inability of the kidneys to dispose of waste or drugs. Advanced renal failure does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine eliminated. Only a blood test and the determination of creatinine can reveal this disease. [lupus erythematosus ] Skin disease causing redness of the central part of the face. There are two main forms: discoid lupus (cutaneous only) and disseminated lupus (associated with deep organ lesions). [blood count ] The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white water or lymph causing localized swelling. [palpitations ] Abnormal perception of irregular heartbeat. [Parkinson ] Chronic disorder of the nervous system related to the alteration of certain brain cells and resulting in mobility disorders and sometimes tremors. [pheochromocytoma ] Very rare tumor of the adrenal glands, manifested mainly by attacks of arterial hypertension. [dosage ] Quantity and distribution of the dose of a drug according to the age, weight and general condition of the patient. [allergic reaction ] Reaction due to the hypersensitivity of the body to a drug. Allergic reactions can be very varied: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, rash of measles-like pimples, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort by sudden drop in blood pressure. [ulcerative colitis ] Inflammatory disease of the rectum and colon, which evolves by outbreaks. Each thrust is accompanied by fever, glairy and bloody stools. [overdose ] Excessive intake of a drug may lead to an increase in the intensity of the adverse effects, or even to the occurrence of particular adverse effects. This overdose can result from an accidental intoxication, or voluntary for the purpose of suicide: it is then advisable to consult the poison control center of your region (list in appendix of the work). But most often, the overdose is the consequence of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase of the effectiveness by a surpassing the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication can lead to the excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly exposed to this risk, because they are considered (wrongly) as harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake can eliminate the problems associated with overdose. [tachycardia ] Acceleration of the rhythm of the heartbeat. It may be due to fever, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, the action of certain drugs, etc. [transaminases ] Enzymes dosed in the blood, the rate of which rises during certain hepatitis. They appear in blood tests under the name of SGOT and SGPT or ASAT and ALAT. [ulcer ] Intense lesion of the skin, mucous membranes or cornea. - Leg ulcer: chronic wound due to poor circulation of blood. - Peptic ulcer: localized wound of the mucosa of the stomach or duodenum, due to an excess of acidity and very often to the presence of a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori). The ulcer is favored by stress, alcohol, smoking and certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, etc.). [vasoconstrictor ] Drug that causes a contraction of the blood vessels, as opposed to vasodilator. [dizziness ] Symptom that may indicate a sense of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a feeling of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense).
