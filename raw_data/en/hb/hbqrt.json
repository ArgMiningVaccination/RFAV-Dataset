Incomplete or unsigned forms will be classified as non-Florida residents. The Office of Graduate Admissions will classify applicants as Florida residents if they have provided documentation that verifies they began living in Florida at least twelve months prior to the first day of classes of their admitted term of entry. Additional documentation other than what is required may be requested in some cases. All documentation is USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 69 subject to verification. The student is responsible for checking their residency cl assification when admitted to the University of South Florida. The residency classification is noted on the official acceptance letter. If the student feels that their initial classification is in error, they have until the last day of the term to contact the appropriate admissions office and request a re-evaluation. After the student has completed their first semester of study they may seek to have their residency reconsidered. They may submit a Request for Reclas sification Form with the Office of the Registrar. This must be filed by the 5th day of classes for the term being requested. Independent Student: A student who meets any one of the following criteria shall be classified as an independent student for the determination of residency for tuition purposes: 1. The student is 24 years of age or older by the first day of classes of the term for which residency status is sought at a Florida institution; 2. The student is married; 3. The student has children who receive more than half of their support from the student; 4. The student has other dependents who live with and receive more than half of their support from the student; 5. The student is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces or is currently serving on active duty in the United States Armed Forces for purposes other than training; 6. Both of the student's parents are deceased or the student is or was (until age 18) a ward/dependent of the court; 7. The student is working on a master's or doctoral degree during the term for which residency status is sought at a Florida institution; or 8. The student is classified as an independent by the financial aid office at the institution. Evidence that the student m eets one of these criteria will be requested by the higher education institution. Florida residency statutes require at least two documents, dated 12 months prior to the first day of class for the entry term sought, to validate a claim for Florida residency for tuition purposes. Documents are classified in two tiers - at least one of the required documents must be from the First Tier. FIRST TIER DOCUMENTATION ( at least one of the two documents submitted must be from this list) 1. Florida Driver's License (driver's licenses from others states must be relinquished) or a State of Florida ID card (if there is no evidence of ties to another state) 2. Florida Voter's Registration card 3. Florida Vehicle Registration (proof of previous registration can be obtained from the local tag office) 4. Declaration of Domicile in Florida (12 months from the date the document was sworn and subscribed as noted by the Clerk of the Circuit Court) 5. Proof of purchase of a permanent home in Florida that is occupied as a primary residence of the claimant 6.

The Office of Graduate Admissions applicant file is not to be released to the applicant or other third parties. Requests, subpoenas, or court orders are to be forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel after review by the Assistant Director of Graduate Admissions. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 70 Applicants once admitted and enrolled during the term of admission may reque st access to their student file at the Office of the Registrar. Letters of Recommendation that the ap plicant has waived the right to view (indi cated on Request for Recommendation Form) are not to be given, copied or viewed by the applicant or third parties. Requests for degree/enrollment verification information are referred to the Office of the Registrar. The Office of Graduate Admissions graduate application files may be copied and released to USF staff conducting legitimate University business. Additional Requirements of Programs (If applicable) Many programs require additional application materials such as resumes, writing samples, or letters of recommendation. These items may be sent as part of the overall graduate application packet or directly to the appropriate department/program. These materials will be forwarded to the appropriate program if sent with the application packet but DO NOT become part of the applicant's permanent file; therefore, the Office of Graduate Admissions does not track them. Final Admission Criteria Applicants accepted for ad missions whose official documents (transcripts and/or test scores) have been received by the Office of Graduate Admissions are admitted as \"Final.\" The admission file is complete. Provisional Admission Criteria Applicants accepted for admission whose official documents (transcripts and/or test scores) have not been received by the Office of Graduate Admissions are admitted provisionally pending receipt of these missing items. The required transcripts and/or test scores must be received before a third semester registration is permitted. If the missing documents are not provided by the end of the second semester of attendance, the Office of Graduate Admissions will place a registration hold on the student's file. Exception Admission Criteria The University may admit up to 10% of new enrollees as exceptions to the Board of Trustees minimum requirements. To be considered for an exception, a student should present evidence that their academic preparation was such that it might account for less than the mi nimal University and/or program requirements, and evidence of potential for academic success such as excellent letters of recommendation from trusted academicians, performance in graduate courses taken as a post-bachelor's student, professi onal experience in his/her discipline for a period of ti me, etc. Each request for a 10% exception must include a statement describing the special circumstances of the applicant. It is the discretion of the program and college to accept exception application requests. Conditional Admission Criteria A program and/or college may admit students conditionally upon satisfaction of requirements separate from University minimum requirements. These conditions may include attendance in specific core or remedial courses and/or required earned GPA of 3.0 for those courses. Failure to satisfy those conditions by the deadline established by the program will result in academic dismissal from the program. Deferment of Admission Request A student's acceptance is granted for that semester and the particular program specified in the official acceptance notification. The student must validate that acceptance by enrolling for that semester. Students who fail to validate their admission may contact the Graduate Program Director and request a Deferment of Admission. This request must be made in writing within 12 months of the initial requested entry date. If a request for Deferment of Admission is not received in the specified time, a new application and fee must be submitted. Deferment requests must also be received no later than the program or University application deadline for the semester desired, whichever is earlier. Students who were admitted provisionally upon receipt of official test scores and/or transcripts must supply those missing items prior to having their deferment decision processed by the Office of Graduate Admissions. International students must also provide a new financial statement dated no earlier than 6 months before the requested date of entry. Update of Admission Request If admission has not been granted because of a late application or missing credentials, the student must request that the Office of Graduate Admissions update the application for a future semester and specify the new enrollment date. This request must be made in writing within 12 months of the initial requested entry date and must be received no later than the program or University application deadline for the semester desired, whichever is earlier. Applications are held for only 12 months. If a request for change in entry date is not received in the USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 71 specified time, a new application and fee must be submitted. The Office of Graduate Admissions will not process any update requests without first receiving all official test sc ores and/or transcripts. Denial of Admission / Appeal for Reconsideration Criteria Applicants denied admission will be given timely notice by email or in writing. Denied applicants who meet the minimum standards may write the Graduate Program Director of the program to which they applied within 30 days of the date of denial to request reconsideration. The request should present additional evidence of pote ntial for academic success at USF and contain reasons why reconsideration is warranted. Applicants denied admission to a degree- seeking program are eligible to enroll as special (non- degree seeking) students. Non-degree seeking applications must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar. Reinstatement of Admission Request A graduate student who has not been in attendance for at least one semester during the past 12 months must apply for Reinstatement of Admissions by contacting the Graduate Program Director of his/her degree-seeking program. Students may obtain the form at www.grad.usf.edu (Click on Graduate School Forms.) Requests for reinstatement must be received no later than the program's admissions deadline date. Students requesting reinstatement must submit a completed Reinstatement of Admission Request Form and Residency Form directly to the program to which reinstatement is sought. An application and an application fee are NOT required when seeking a reinstatement. The reinstatement policy does NOT apply to inactive students wishing to enroll in a program other than the original admitting program. These students must submit an application for the new program of interest. Transcripts of any work completed while not attending USF may be required. Change of Program Request Change of Program Request will NOT be considered for graduate students in their first semester of study. Only a continuing graduate student enrolled for study in a particular program who wishes to change to another program at the same or lower level must complete the Change of Program Request Form #USF 2085. It is up to the discretion of the student's original program to determine if a Change of Program is appropriate and will be granted. Students may obtain the form at www.grad.usf.edu (Click on Graduate School Forms.) This form must be signed both by the current program and the new program, after which it must be submitted to the Graduate School for approval. If approved by the Graduate School, the change of program form is then sent to the Registrar for processing. NOTE: Some programs may require another application to be submitted because the Change of Program Request Form does not contain sufficient information for them to make a decision. You should check with the new program before completing any paperwork. Students with Disabilities Policy Students with disabilities apply for admission under the same guidelines as other students. Applicants believing that a disability has had an impact on grades, course choice, or standardized admission test scores, should request consideration of this during the admissions process. Students requesting substitution of departmental guidelines will need to contact the appropriate department ch airperson. Please submit supporting documentation when requesting a disability exception. Students bear the responsibility for providing documentation of their disabilities. The University reviews documentation and determines if students are eligible for services and accommodations because of disabilities. The Office of Student Disability Services is charged with the task of determining eligibility. Accommodations and services are not provided on a retroactive basis. Approval must be given prio r to receiving services or accommodations. The process begins when students provide documentation of disability and meet with a coordinator in the Office of Student Disability Services to request in writing services and accommodations. Any faculty members or students who have questions about this process are encouraged to contact the Office of Student Disability Services at (813) 974-4309 or visit the website at http://www.sa.usf.edu/sds USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 5 Registration and General Information 72 Section 5 Registration and General Information Office of the the Registra r maintains the official academic records for all students and course registrations for currently enrolled students.

Student Responsibilities The University, the Co lleges, and the degree programs have established certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. While advisors, directors, department chairpersons, and deans are available to assist the student meet these requirements, it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. The information presented here represents the University Academic Policies. Colleges and departments may have additional requirements. Check with your College Graduate Coordinator or your Department Program Director for more information. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the Catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the Board of Trustees. For a list of curr ent course descriptions, refer to the Search-A-Bull database online at http://www.ugs.usf.edu/sab/sabs.cfm . Student Conduct Members of the University community support high standards of individual conduct and human relations. Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrary to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the University community. Disciplinary procedures are followed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in the Student Conduct Code. These are described in detail on the Student Affairs website: : http://www.sa.usf.edu/handbook/rights/StudentCodeo fConduct.htm Academic Dishonesty and Disruption of Academic Process Refer to http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/policies.asp Examples of Proper Citation and of Plagiarism In addition to the examples below, information on plagiarism may be found on the Center for Teaching Excellence website at: http://www.cte.usf.edu/plagiarism/index.html , and in the Student Affairs Student Handbook at: http://www.sa.usf.edu/handbook/USF_Student_Hand book.pdf Proper Citation Examples of proper citation (footnote format) are as follows [Footnoting/citation styles will depend upon those used by different academic disciplines.

Students are responsible for being aware of and complying with University Regulations and Policies and must conduct themselves accordingly. Per the USF Regulation 3-0015 on Academic Dishonesty, available online at: http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg. htm, students who committee Academic Dishonesty may receive an \"F\" on the a ssignment, an \"F\" in the course, or an \"FF\" in the course. Refer to the regulation for the exact requirement. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. Procedur es for filing an academic dismissal are available on the Graduate School Website at www.grad.usf.edu USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 81 University Academic Grievance Procedures To assure students the right to redress of academic grievances, any student may file a question or complaint in the Graduate School . May 7, 2004; Revised and approved by UGC on Oct. 11, 2004; Revised and approved by GC in Nov. 2004. Approved by Faculty Senate on November 17, 2004. USF Policy: http://usfweb2.usf .edu/usfgc/gc_pp/acadaf/gc10- 002.htm University Academic Grievance Procedures I. Purpose- The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of So uth Florida an opportunity for objective review of fact s and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. Such review will be accomplished in a collegial, non-judicial atmosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to participate. All parties will be expected to act in a professional and civil manner. The procedures that follow are designed to ensure objective and fair treatment of both students and instructors. These guidelines are meant to govern all Colleges (exclusive of the College of Medicine which maintains its own procedures); however, as individual Colleges or campuses may have different levels of authority or titles, each student must obtain the specific designations used by each college or campus for levels of authority and titles in the process. In the case of grade appeals, the University reserves the right to change a student's grade if it is determined at the conclusion of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. In such circumstances the Dean or Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Vice President for Health Sciences Center may file an administrative grade change. The term \"incorrect\" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in the course, or that the assignment of the grade was not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as described in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In the case of all other academic grievances the University reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. II. Terms and Guidelines An \" academic grievance \" is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects that student's academic record or status has violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Grievances may relate to such decisions as the assignment of a grade seen by the student as incorrect or the dismissal or failure of a student for his or her action(s). Academic grievances will not deal with general student complaints. \"Instructor \" shall mean any cl assroom instructor, thesis/dissertation/directed study supervisor, committee member or chair, or counselor/advisor who interacts with the student in an academic environment. \"Department Chair/Director \" shall mean the academic head of a college department or the director of a program\u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean, the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, or the Dean of the Graduate School, as indicated\u2014or in all cases a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time \" shall mean \" academic time ,\" that is, periods when university classes are in session. The person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any extensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this policy, each step shall be afforded three (3) weeks as a standa rd time limit. When a department considers a grievance according to published departmental procedures approved by the College Dean and Provost, the time line specified in this academic unit's proc edures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication \" shall mean communication by hard copy to the recipient's address of record. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 82 The \" burden of proof \" shall be upon the student such that the student challengi ng the decision, action or grade assigned has the burden of supplying evidence that proves that the in structor's decision was incorrect. In considering grievances, decisions will be based on the preponderance of the evidence. Neither party shall be entitled to bring \"legal representation\" to any actual grievance proceeding as this is an internal review of an academic decision. As some Colleges may not have departments or some campuses may use different titles, the next level that applies to that College shall be substituted. If the incident giving rise to a grievance occurs on the St. Petersburg campus , the approved policy on that campus shall govern. III. Resolution at the Department Level A. The student shall first ma ke a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instructor concerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e., the issuance of a grade; the receipt of an assignment), and the instructor shall accommodate a reasonable request to discuss and attempt to resolve this issue. B. If the situation cannot be resolved or the instructor is not available, the student shall file a notification letter within three weeks of the triggering incident to the department Chairperson/Director. This shall be a concise written statement of particulars and must include information pertaining to how, in the student's opinion, University policies or procedures were violated. The department Chairperson/Director shall provide a copy of this statement to the instructor. C. The department Chairperson/Director shall discuss the statement jointly or individually with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be resolved. If the department maintains its own grievance procedure, 2 it should 2 Departments may de velop their own formal procedures for considering grievances. Such procedures must be considered and approved by the College Dean and the Provost, and published on the Department's web site. When such procedures exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental pro cess upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/ Director shall provide a statement to that effect to the student and the instructor with a copy to the College Dean. D. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the department Chair/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written request within three weeks to advance the grievance to the College Level. The instructor may file a written response to the grievance petition. Upon receipt of the student's request to move the process to the College Level and the instructor's response to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/Director sh all immediately notify the College Dean of the grievance, providing copies of the student's initiating grievance statement, any instructor's written response to the grievance, and the wr itten request from the student to have the process advanced to the College Level (which may include additional responsive or final statements by the student). Should the student not file a written request to move the grievance to the College Level within the prescribed time, the grievance will end. If the grievance concerns th e Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, the student has a right to bypass the departmental process and proceed directly to the College Level. IV. Resolution at the College Level A. Upon receipt of the grie vance, the College Dean shall either determine that the matter is not an academic grievance and dismiss it or within three weeks shall establish an Academic Grievance Committee. The membersh ip of the Committee shall be constituted as follows: 1. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (undergraduate or graduate as appropriate to the case) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. 2. Wherever practical, the Committee shall include neither members of the faculty College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the Coll ege Level review as outlined in these university procedures. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 83 nor students of the department directly involved with the grievance, nor faculty nor students of the student's major department. However, if requested by the committee, faculty or students from the department involved with the grievance or from the student's major department may provide expert or other relevant testimony in the proceedings. A. The Committee will operate in the following manner: 1. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College Dean from among the three faculty members appointed to the Committee. 2. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for scheduling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consideration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decisions only when required to break a tie. 3. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by all members of the Committee and those involved in the proceedings. The recommendation of the Committee shall be based on the factual evidence presented to it. 4. Within three weeks of the Committee appointment, the Co mmittee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the student, instructor, department Chairperson/Director or Program Director, and College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. 5. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the College Dean shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 6. The student or the instructor may appeal the decision of the College Dean to the University Level only if the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committee or if there is a procedural violation of these Student Academic Grievance Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies or the Dean of the Graduate School (as appropriate) within three weeks of receipt of the decision from th e College Dean. Otherwise, the College Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. V. Resolution at the University Level The Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Vice President for the He alth Sciences Center has delegated authority to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to act in place of the Provost/Vice President in all academic grieva nce appeals involving undergraduate students unless the grievance occurred in a program within Undergraduate Studies, wherein it will go back to the Provost to redelegate. The Dean of the Graduate School will act in place of the Provost/Vice President in all academic grievance appeals involving graduate students. A. The student or the instru ctor may appeal at the University Level within three weeks of the receipt of a decision made at the College Level, when the decision by a College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of a college Grievance Committee, or there is cause to think a procedural violation of these University Academic Grievance Procedures has been made. Within three weeks of receipt of the appeal to the decision, the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean in consultation with the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate, shall appoint an Appeals Committee consisting of three faculty members drawn from the university Undergraduate Council or Graduate Council (as appropriate), and two students, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate). B. The structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the same as those of the College Committee (i.e., chaired by one of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's respective departments, developing a recommendation to the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean, etc.). C. Within three weeks of the appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean a report of USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 84 the findings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. D. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the U ndergraduate/Graduate Dean shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. E. If the Undergraduate/Gra duate Dean's decision is that a grade change is merited, the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean shall initiate the grade change on the authority of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Undergraduate/Graduate Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. These procedures shall take effect commencing Fall Semester, 2005, and shall supersede all other academic grievance procedur es currently in effect, with the exception of the procedures of the College of Medicine. Graduate Catalog The USF Graduate Catalog, including college and program requirements, and program and course descriptions, is available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. Also see USF Regulation USF1-009, http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg.htm Student's Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USF Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to program requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all students must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USF Catalog published prior to admission (or readmission if reinstated) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a student is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, the student's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF Catalog in effect at the time of reinstatement/readmission or any one Catalog published during their continuous re-enrollment. If state law or certifi cation requirements change, the student must comply with the most current standard or criteria. If the College or Department makes fundamental changes to the program that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Graduate School. USF policies and procedures not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. USF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this Catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 85 time of admission into the graduate program, outlining the requirements for the degree sought. In the event state mandates, accreditation requirements, etc., make changes to the degree requirements necessary, it is recommended that the program provide an addendum to the program of study outlining what is required for degree completion. Enrollment Requirements Students receiving Veterans ' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. Minimum University Regulations USF Full-Time Student Definition Students taking nine (9) or more hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking six (6) or more hours in the summer semester, will be classified as Full-Time students for academic purposes. For financial aid requirements, contact the Office of Financial Aid. Continuous Enrollment for All Graduate Students All graduate degree-seeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of graduate credit every three continuous semesters (i.e. two (2) hours Spring/ two (2) Summer/ two (2) Fall; OR, three (3) Fall/ zero (0) spring/ three (3) Summer; OR six (6) Fall/ zero (0) Spring/ zero (0) Summer; etc.). Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students on an approved leave of ab sence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. See also the Time Limitations Policy. Reinstatement Following Non-enrollment Degree-seeking graduate students who have not been continuously enrolled are automatically dropped from the system and changed to a non-degree seeking status. These students must apply for reinstatement of admission and may be subject to the admission criteria in effect at the time of reinstatement. Procedures for reinstatement are available on the Graduate Admissions Website at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/admissions/reinstate ments.asp Students, who were doctoral candidates at the time they were dropped from the system, and are approved for reinstatement, shall have the original date of candidacy, with the time limit for degree completion calculated from that original date. Students reinstated to the program may be subject to the catalog criteria, including program degree requirements, in effect at th e time of reinstatement. Reinstated students must enroll in the requested term of re-entry. Students may be required to complete the minimum hours for continuous enrollment that were not previously met. Enrollment during Comp rehensive Exams and Admission to Candidacy During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between seme sters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Students must also be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate work in the semester of admission to doctoral candidacy. Dissertation Hours Students working on a dissertation must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of dissertation every semester, starting with the semester following Admission to Doctoral Candidacy, up to and including the semester the dissertation is submitted to and approved by the Graduate School. Dissertation hours may apply to the Continuous Enrollment Requirement. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Enrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitted and approved by the Graduate School, usually the semester of graduation. Students not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not have the thesis/dissertation ap proved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. Enrollment during Semester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. Enrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be full-time students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Dean of the Graduate School. Leaves of Absence (LOA) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 86 requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) consecutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete the form available from the Graduate School website. The LOA must be approved by the Major Professor, the Program, the College, and the Graduate School, and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. Students returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by contacting the Graduate School for procedures. Doct oral candidates returning from a LOA must also have their candidacy status reactivated. Academic Standards and Grades Minimum University Requirements In Good Standing To be considered a student in good standing, graduate students must Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken in each of the student's degree-seeking programs. No grade of C- or below will be accepted toward a graduate degree. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. A student will not be certified to graduate if an IF or MF is on the transcript, unless the student requests to \"accept\" the IF or MF grade and the request is signed and approved by the studen t, program, college and Graduate School. IF or MF grades that are \"accepted\" will never be changed. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded ( A-F) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, Q and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course level, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as non-degree-seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degree program will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a non-degree-seeking student at USF and meets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Credit/Transfer of Credit section). Graduate Grading System Plus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and undergraduate grades will be assigned quality points in the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading system. The +/- designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. The use of the +/- grading system is at the discretion of the instructor. The syllabus policy is available in the office of the Provost. Letter grade = number of grade points A+ 4.00 A 4.00 A- 3.67 3.33 D- .67 F 0.00 FF Failure due to academic dishonesty 3 3 Graduate Students who receive an FF will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. See USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 87 I Incomplete, grade points not applicable M Missing grade/no grade reported by instructor, grade points not applicable MF Missing grade changed to F, 0.00 grade points MU Missing grade changed to U, grade points not applicable N Audit, grade points not applicable S/U Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grade points not applicable W Withdrawal or drop from course without penalty, grade points not applicable Z Continuing registration in multi-semester internship or Thesis/Dissertation courses, grade points not applicable Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. Students may take courses outside of the major on a S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major prof essor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the student is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are design ated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student begins work under Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. Incomplete (I) An I grade indicates incomplete coursework and may be awarded to graduate students at the discretion of the instructor, only when a small portion of the student's work is incomplete and only when the student is otherwise earning a passing grade. The course instructor and student must draft and sign a contract that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade earned including the zero for the incomplete portion. The instructor must file a copy of the contract in the department before the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re -register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the I grade. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot re-take the course for credit until the I grade is cleared. section on Academic Dishonesty and Graduate School Policy on Academic Integrity for more information. An I grade not cleared within the next two successive academic semesters (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. I grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automated Academic Probation Procedur es for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an I grade. Missing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any grade for a graduate student (undergraduate rules apply to undergraduate and non-degree-seeking students). Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. An M grade which is not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will be converted to MF or MU, whichever is appropriate . MF grades are calculated in the GPA and if applicable, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismissed. To resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must contact their instructor. If the instructor is not available, the student must contact the instructor's department chair. Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an M grade. Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi-semester internship or thesis/dissertation courses wh ere the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi-semester internship or thesis/dissertation, the final grade assigned will be an S. The Graduate School submits the change of grade for the last registration of thesis/dissertation courses once the thesis/dissertation has been accepted for publication. Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactor ily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitio ns are processed through the Graduate School. Probation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be consider ed on probation as of the following semester. The college or program may USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 88 also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or program. Notification of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the department, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each proba tionary semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued probation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Dean of the Graduate School in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. For information on the Automated Probation Process go to http://download.grad.usf.edu/Automated_Academic_ Probation.pdf Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the university without grade penalty by the University deadline. Information on the different types of withdrawal (i.e., withdrawing from a single class - see the Drop section, an entire semester, or from the degree program itself) can be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Appropriate alternative calendar dates may apply. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 89 Institution Based Credit USF has two degree-granting institutions: USF-Tampa (w hich includes Lakeland and Sarasota) and USF-St. Petersburg. Students may, with the approval of their graduate program, take credits at any of the USF campuses. However, the majority of credits needed for a degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution granting the degree.

USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 7 Academic Policies 91 Change of Graduate Degree Program Students who wish to change from one degree program to another (at the same level) must obtain a Graduate Change of Program Application from the Office of the Registrar or their college advising office. The new department will consider the Change of Program request as a new application. The Deans of the Colleges involved and the Dean of the Graduate School must approve the Change of Degree. The new department may elect to accept all, some, or none of the graduate courses previously taken by the student and only those courses accepted will be computed in the GPA. Students desiring to change program levels (e.g. from a Master's program to Doctoral program) must submit a new application for admission. Accelerated Program Guidelines Programs who desire to offer Accelerated Degree Programs must establish guidelines that define the following. The guidelines must then be submitted and approved by the Policy Committee of the Graduate Council In clearly defined written policy, programs will: Define the number of shared credits: No more than \u00bd of the required graduate program credits can be completed while in undergraduate status. Develop a program of study in which shared coursework and the degree requirements for both degrees are clearly stated. Define when the student will receive the bachelor's degree: either at the completion of 120 credits earned or at the completion of the 5 year program. Formally admit students into accelerated 5 year programs through a defined admission process. Students should be admitted into a 5 year program at the beginning of the senior year. Advise students about the financial aid implications of the 5 year program and will refer students to the Office of Financial Aid for advice. Review the student's academic record prior to entering graduate status in the 5 year program. Students must receive a grade of B or above in graduate level courses taken while in undergraduate status. Permit students to formally withdraw from the 5 year program and receive the bachelor's degree, as long as the student has met the undergraduate requirements for the specified program. Acceptance into the 5 year program is contingent upon final approval by the Dean of the Graduate School. Dual Degree Programs A student may wish to pursue two degrees simultaneously. Upon approv al by the appropriate College Dean(s) and Dean of the Graduate School, a prescribed number of courses (generally no more than nine (9) hours of core or basic courses) required for one degree may be applied to another degree that requires the same courses, without repetition or alternative courses. Procedures for applying for a Dual degree program are available on the Graduate School website. Off-Campus Courses and Programs Graduate courses and programs are offered at locations other than the Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and Lakeland campuses. Information on course enrollment procedur es for off-campus courses and programs may be obtained from the college in which the courses or programs are offered.USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 92 Section 8 University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following sections describe the University requirements established by the Graduate School for the Master's, Education Sp ecialist, and Doctoral degrees. However, individual programs and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college careers. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition The University of South Florida recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenure- track or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who hold a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligib le to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on master's, specialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activ ities, such as publications, performances, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Graduate School Dean to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to teach graduate courses, to serve on master's, specialist, and doctoral level committees, to direct master's and specialist's level committees, and to co-direct doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Graduate School Dean. For a current list of Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty in any pr ogram contact the program director or coordinator. Graduate Study Requirements See USF Regulation 6C4-3.011, http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg. htm Master's Degree Requirements Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degree, at least si xteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level. At least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled course work, ten (10) of which must be at the 6000 level. Up to six (6) hours of 4000-level courses may be taken as part of a planned degree program. Additional graduate credit may be earned in 4000-level courses only if specifically approved by the appropriate College Dean. Students enrolled in undergraduate courses as part of a planned degree program are expected to demonstrate a superior level of performance. Graduate students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without written permission from the College Dean. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 93 Institutional Residency The majority of credits toward a master's degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution granting the degree. Students at USF-St. Petersburg are expected to complete the majority of the required credits at USF St. Petersburg. Deviations from this rule must be recommended by the student's committee and approved by the College Dean and the Associate Vice Provost for Research and Dean of the Graduate School (Tampa) or the Regional Associate Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Studies (USF St. Petersburg). Time Limitations All requirements for master's degrees must be completed within five (5) calendar years from the student's date of admission for graduate study. Master degrees (including dual degree programs) that require course work in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer statute of limitations by the University Graduate Council. In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Graduate School website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/forms/grad_forms.a sp Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, prior to submission to the Graduate School for approval. Stud ents who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) Enrollment Requirements Refer to the Academic Policies Section Institutional Residency The majority of credits toward a master's degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution granting the degree. Students at USF-St. Petersburg are expected to complete the majority of the required credits at USF St. Petersburg. Deviations from this rule must be recommended by the student's doctoral co mmittee and approved by the College Dean and the Associate Vice Provost for Research and Dean of the Graduate School (Tampa) or the Regional Associate Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Studies (USF St. Petersburg). Major Professor A major professor will be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The student and major professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet th e following requirement: be regular graduate faculty, as defined by the University. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as Co-Major Professor with faculty who do. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co-Major Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other Co-Major Professor. It is important that one of the Co-Major Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Profe ssor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.), the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"Co-Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, etc.) (Co-) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Graduate School Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/policies.asp Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committe e of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 94 qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. Composition The committee will consist of the major professor and at least two other members or co-major professors and at least one other member of the department or area of interest in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and Programs may require additional committee members and specify characteristics.) Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the university and the college/department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by Graduate School as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a Masters Thesis committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Ma sters committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the university and the college/department must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the department, college, and Graduate School for each committee. Approval Once a committee has b een determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for instructions and forms. The original appointment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Associate Dean's office for approval. A copy of the approved form should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be certified. Committee form s need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed fr om the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co-) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co-)Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any non-faculty being added to a committee must submit a Curriculum Vitae (CV) for college approval. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. Masters Comprehensive Examination Prior to clearance for the degree, candidates must perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination or an alternative method designated by the academic unit to measur e student competency in the major area. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit during the semester when the comprehensive examination is taken. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Thesis If a thesis is required, it must conform to the guidelines of the University. Refer to the Thesis and Dissertation Guidelines, available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp f o r complete information about requirements, procedures, and deadlines. For enrollment requirements, refer to the Academic Policies section in the Catalog.

Manuscript Processing Fee Students participating in the thesis/dissertation process are required to pay a processing fee. If the student fails to complete the process within the semester, they are required to go through the process again and subsequently pay the Manuscript Processing Fee again. More information is available on the Thesis and Dissertation website. See USF Regulation USF4-0107, http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg. htm Exchange of Thesis for Non-Thesis Credit If a student changes from thesis to non-thesis during a semester and is currently enrolled in thesis credit, the current thesis credits may be exchanged without academic penalty if a Graduate School Petition is filed with the Graduate School no later than the last day to withdraw without Academic Penalty. If a student enrolled in a thesis required program has taken thesis credits but elects to change to non-thesis track or program, the accumulated thesis credits may not be exchanged or converted to another non- structured credit. The thes is hours will remain on the transcript and will retain the \"Z\" grade. Thesis Defense Policies and procedures for the thesis defense are handled within the College and Program. Contact the College and Program for requirements. Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available 5 Include either References or a Bibliography, as specified by your style guide online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduati on by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, submit their manuscript for processing again, and pay the manuscript processing fee again. Only after the Graduate School has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic format (ETD ). Requirements and procedures are available at the Graduate School website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp Changes after Publication Once a thesis is approved and accepted by the Graduate School for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor , the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby pres erving patent rights...\" 6 6 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University-Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 96 To protect the University's primary goal from un- due compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Graduate School. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Thesis, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Graduate School for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the thesis. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works The complete policy regarding Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works may be viewed at: http://www.research.usf.e du/pl/0_300_INVENTION S_WORKS.pdf For information about this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974-0994. Also see USF Regulation 6C4-10.012, http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg. htm Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Libr ary, the Graduate School submits the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the office of the registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 97 Education Specialist Degree (Ed.S.) Requirements Ed.S. Thesis Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Thesis must meet all of the requir ements for the thesis, as specified in the Master's Degree section of this publication. For specific degree program information, refer to the College of Education. Ed.S. Project Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Non- Thesis project must meet all of the requirements as specified by the College of Education. A project does not need to meet the requirements of a thesis and is not submitted to the Graduate School for approval and archiving. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 98 Doctoral Degree (Au.D., Ed.D., Ph.D., D.P.T.) Requirements The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of high attainment in a specific field of knowledge. It is a research degree and is not conferred solely upon the earning of credit, the completion of courses, or the acquiring of a number of terms of residency, but also the successful completion of scholarly work. The length of residency and the requirements below are minimums; programs/colleges may elect to establish more rigorous requirements. The degree will be granted after the student has shown proficiency and distinctive achievement in a specified field, has demonstrated the ability to do original, independent investigation, and has presented these findings with a high degree of literary skill in a dissertation. A major professor will be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The advisor will advise on any specific subject matter deficiencies and assist in the choice of a major professor and area of research Minimum Hours Because the doctoral degree is earned on the basis of advancement to doctoral candidacy status and satisfactory completion of the dissertation, the Graduate School does not specify any minimum number of courses or credit hours that must be completed for award of th e degree. Students must comply with general enrollment requirements and also institutional residency requirements . Time Limitations All requirements for doctoral degrees must be completed within eight (8) calendar years from the student's date of admission for doctoral study. Students have four (4) years from the date of admission to complete all required coursework, pass the qualifying examination, and be admitted to doctoral candidacy. Students then have four (4) years from the date of doctoral candidacy to complete degree requirements. In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Graduate School website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/forms/grad_forms.a sp Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, prior to submission to the Graduate School for approval. Stud ents who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section for information; the Leave of Absence Request Form is available online at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/forms/grad_forms.a sp ) Enrollment Requirements See Academic Policies Section Institutional Residency Students must be enrolled in a doctoral program for a minimum of three (3) years beyond the baccalaureate degree. The majority of cr edits toward a doctorate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the institution granting the degree. Students at USF- St. Petersburg are expected to complete the majority of the required credits at USF St. Petersburg. Major Professor A major professor will be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The student and Major Professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, should be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: be active in scholarly pursuits as evidenced by at least one referred publication in the last three years. be regular graduate faculty, as defined by the University. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as Co-Major Professor with faculty who do. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 99 retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co-Major Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other Co-Major Professor. It is important that one of the Co-Major Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Profe ssor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.), the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"Co-Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, admission to candidacy, etc.) (Co-) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Graduate School Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/policies.asp Doctoral Committee As soon as an area of research is determined and a major professor is selected , a Doctoral Supervisory Committee will be appointe d and approved for the student. The department will request approval of the Doctoral Committee from the Dean of the College and, as needed, the Dean of the Graduate School. The Doctoral Committee will approve the student's course of study and plan for research, supervise the research, grade the written comprehensive qualifying examination, read and appr ove the dissertation, and conduct the dissertation defense. Composition The Doctoral Committee will consist of at least four members, three of whom must come from the academic area in which the major work for the degree will be done. Member Definition All graduate faculty as defined by the university and the college/department a nd approved by their department and college are assumed by Graduate School as qualified to be a member of a Doctoral Committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Doctoral committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (e.g., visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the university and the college/department must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the Department, College, and, as needed, Graduate School for each committee. Approval Once a committee has b een determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signat ure. Check with the College for instructions and forms. To insure uniformity of excellence across the colleges, (Co-)Major Professor(s) of Ph.D. Dissertation Committees will need to submit a current curriculum vitae (equ ivalent to an NIH Bio, approximately two pages long with the last three [3] years of scholarly activity included) with the committee appointment form to the College Dean or designee. This approval is in addition to the approval from their department chairperson. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) Once approved, the original form and the approved Curriculum Vitae (CV) are placed in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be certified. Committee form s need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co-) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co-) Major Professor(s) indicat e(s) approval of the change, as well as acknow ledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any non-faculty being added to a committee must submit a CV for approval. If a faculty member is USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 100 being added as a Co-Major Professor, or if there is an appointment change to the Major Professor position, a CV must be included for the faculty member who is being added to that position. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Ch anges to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file before graduation may be certified. Doctoral Qualifying Examination As soon as the substantial majority of the course work is completed, the student must pass a written qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and related fields. This examination may be supplemented by an oral examination. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in their discipline at the time they take the qualifying examinations. If the exam is taken between semesters, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Admission to Candidacy In order to be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must meet the following requirements at USF 1. admission to a doctoral program 2. appointment of a Do ctoral Committee 3. attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Pointe Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. (All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"MF\" must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized) 4. completion of a qualifying examination 5. certification by the Do ctoral Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed The Admission to Candidacy form should be submitted for approval no later than the semester following the successful completion of the exam. The form will be approved by the Dean of the College and forwarded to the Dean of the Graduate School for final approval. Doctoral Cand idacy is effective as of the day that the Graduate School approves of the request and changes the student's status. As long as the Candidacy request is received between the first and last day of class during the fall and spring semesters or between the first day of class and one week before the last day of class in Session B during the summer semester, and the Candidacy is cleared for approval, the Candidacy will be effective as of that semester. Once candidacy status is approved, the student may then enroll in dissertation hours the following semester. Students may NOT enroll in dissertation hours prior to being admitted to doctoral candidacy. Each degree program has a required number of dissertation hours for completion of the degree. Departments may, with College approval, apply Directed Research hours to ward the total number of dissertation hours required. Directed Research hours shall not exceed 50% of the dissertation hour requirement. No directed research hours will be converted to dissertation hours (i.e. a directed research course dropped and a dissertation course added) prior to or during the semester of Candidacy. For more information refer to Enrollment Requirements in the Academic Policies section. Dissertation Dissertation requirements are for the academic degrees of Ph.D. and Ed.D . For the professional degrees of Au.D. and D.P.T., contact the professional school for doctoral project requirements. The Dissertation must conform to the guidelines of the University.

If the student fails to complete the process within the semester, they are required to go through the process again and subsequently pay the manuscript processing fee again. More information is available on the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp . Also, see USF Regulation USF4-0107, http://usfweb2.usf.edu/usfgc/ogc%20web/currentreg. htm Dissertation Defense After the Doctoral Committee has determined that the final draft of the dissertation is suitable for presentation; the Committee will request the scheduling and announcement of the Dissertation Defense (also called Final Oral Examination or Oral Defense.) Check with the College and program for college and program specifi c procedures for this process. A copy of the announcement should be sent to the Graduate School, preferably two weeks in advance of the defense date. The announcement must also be posted in a public forum for a minimum of twenty-four hours to comply with statute requirements for a public meeting. A student must successfully defend the dissertation in order to be able to proceed and complete the final submission process. Outside Chair of the Dissertation Defense The Dissertation Defense (or Final Oral Examination) shall be presided by a senior and distinguished scholar from outside the department, nominated by the Major Professor. If the chair is from another institution, this individual should have the equivalent qualificati ons necessary to chair a dissertation in the subject area at the University of South Florida. Note that the Major Professor may not serve as the \"Outside Chair.\" Procedures for Conducting the Oral Defense 1. The oral defense should be conducted to allow for the student to make any necessary corrections following the defense and still meet the final copy d eadline for turning in the dissertation to the Office of Graduate School. 2. It is required that all members of the Dissertation Committee be present for the examination unless an absence is approved prior to the defense taking place by the Graduate School Dean. In the event that a member cannot attend in person, participation is permissible via speakerphone or video conference. A minimum of three members, including the Major Professor is required to proceed with the defense. The Outside Chair is not considered as part of the Committee. 3. The presentation should be considered an important function in the department and all graduate students and faculty be encouraged to attend. 4. The presentation and defense are open to the public and as such, must meet the requirements of the Sunshine Laws for the State of Florida. The voting is not public. 5. The room selected for the examination should have adequate seating with an alternate room selected in case of problems. 6. The Outside Chair should open the proceedings by introducing the candidate and the Dissertation Committee. 7. The examination should begin with a presentation by the candidate designed to summarize the dissertation. 8. The remainder of the examination may take place in a different setting and will consist of questions about the research by the Outside Chair and the Dissertation Committee and by other interested persons. It is suggested that questioning should be limited to about 15 minutes for each person with subsequent rounds of questioning as necessary. 9. Questions from the faculty-at-large and/or the public may be allowed at the end of the committee's questioning. 10. The length of the examination period will generally not exceed three hours. Throughout this time the Outside Chair is to USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 102 be in charge of all pr oceedings and, ideally, is expected to play a balancing role between advocacy and contention. The Outside Chair, at anytime duri ng the course of the examination, may request all visitors to leave. 11. Following the completion of these proceedings, the Outside Chair will ask all visitors and the candidate to leave and will re-convene the Dissertation Committee only. The Outside Chair may share his/her impressions and opinions of the candidate and the dissertation. The Outside Chair will preside over the deliberations and voting of the committee, but is not to participate in the voting. The voting is to be limited to \"pass\" and \"fail\" votes. The Outside Chair has the responsibility of tallying the votes and of informing the candidate of the final decision. The vote of the Dissertation Committee must be unanimous and recorded on the Successful Defense form . The College Graduate Dean will resolve substitutions and disagreements within the committee. 12. The Outside chair will convey the decision of the Dissertation Committee (Successful Defense form) to the Department/College Graduate office to be kept in the student's file. Suggested Guide for Dissertation Defense Proceedings 1. Introduction of Candidate and Committee Members. 2. Presentation by Candidate. 3. Questions by Committee Members. 4. Questions from other faculty and/or other observers. 5. Candidate and observers leave the examination room. 6. Deliberation and voting by the committee, only. Sign documentation (to be determined by College/Department) if defense is successful. 7. The candidate shall be informed of the vote. 8. The record of the successful defense (to be determined by the College or Department) is forwarded to the College/Department for the student's file. Dissertation Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp . Students who fail to submit the final copy of a dissertation by the posted submission deadline will not be considered for graduation. The student may be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for the de gree (graduation) by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) dissertation hours for that subsequent semester, submit their manuscript for processing again, and pay the manuscript processing fee again. Only after the Graduate School has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the dissertation in an electronic format (ETD ). Requirements and procedures are available at the Graduate School website http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp Changes after Publication Once a dissertation is appr oved and accepted by the Graduate School for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Dissertation Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor , the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 103 publication, thereby pres erving patent rights...\"9 To protect the University's primary goal from un- due compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Dissertations will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Graduate School. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Dissertation, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Graduate School for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the dissertation. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their dissertations by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works The complete policy regarding Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works may be viewed at: http://www.research.usf.e du/pl/0_300_INVENTION S_WORKS.pdf For information about this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974-0994.

The Use of \"Ph.D.\" in Credentials and Publication Students may only use the credential of \"Ph.D.\" after degree conferral is granted. It is inappropriate to use the credential until it is officially and formally granted. The use of the abbreviation \"Ph.D.\" in university publications, correspondence, etc., including websites and other electronic media, shall be upper case \"P\", lower case \"h\" followed by a period, an upper case \"D\" and another period. It shall not be used in the format of all upper case letters without periods, as in \"PHD\"USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 8 University Degree Requirements 104 Section 9 Graduation Information Application for Degree (Graduation) To graduate, a student must submit the Application for Degree to the Office of the Registrar. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadlin e noted in the academic calendar. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new Application for Degree must be submitted by the deadline in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's academic record, the st udent must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. The application for a graduate degree is available from the Office of the Registrar (http://www.registrar .usf.edu/search.php ) or the student's college advising office. The application must first be certified (signed or stamped in the section, \"Office Use Only\") by the student's college. The college retains one copy, and the student must submit the remaining copies to the Office of the Registrar prior to the graduation application deadline. Inquiries concerning approval or denial of graduation should be made to the appropriate college. It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" (Incomplete) and \"M\" (Missing) grades in all courses and to provide official transcripts of all transferred course work needed for graduation at least three weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. Graduation Requirements It is the student's responsibility to make sure that he/she has met all degree requirements as specified in the Degree Requirements section of this publication, as well as any College and Program requirements for the degree. Commencement Graduate students may not participate in commencement exercises until all requirements for the degree sought have been fulfilled. Students graduating from programs based from the Tampa campus (despite location, i.e. may be located in St. Petersburg, Sarasota, Lakeland, etc., such as students in Marine Science) par ticipate in commencement exercises on the Tampa campus. All doctoral graduates receive degree conferral from the Tampa campus and therefore par ticipate in commencement exercises in Tampa. Diplomas Diplomas are mailed to the student's permanent address approximately six (6) weeks after commencement. Students wi th a change of address need to fill out a change of address form at the Registrar's office. Questions regarding diplomas and degree certification should be directed to the Registrar's office at 974-2000. Letters of Certification Students in need of verification of the degree prior to receiving their diploma may request a Letter of Certification. This letter specifies that the student has finished all of the requirements for the degree and the date the degree will be conferred on. The letter must include the student's social security number, name of degree program and official name of the degree. The Major Professor, the College Dean (or designee), the Coordinator (or designee) in the Graduate School, and the Registrar must sign the Letter of Certification. A template for the Certification Letter is available on the Graduate School website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/forms/grad_forms.a sp . USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 9 Graduation Information 105 Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The University may award a posthumous master's or doctoral (and medical) degree to a student who was in good standing at the Univ ersity at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substantive requirements for the degree. The University may also award masters, doctoral and medical degrees in memoriam to a student who was in good standing at the University at the time of his or her death. To award a non-thesis degree, the student would need to have completed all courses required for the degree. Courses required for the degree, in which the student is enrolled at the time of his or her death, must have been completed to the satisfaction of the faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other requirements (e.g., grade poi nt average, tests, etc.) must have been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must be completed as described above and the thesis must be sufficiently complete to th e satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The Chairperson of a Department, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the recommendation to the re spective dean of the college. If approved by the Dean, the recommendation with supporting documentation will be forwarded to the Provost for approval. If the Provost approves the reco mmendation, the Office of the Registrar will be notified and the degree will be awarded at the next comm encement ceremony or will be presented to the student' s family in an appropriate setting. Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identical to other degrees awarded in the same colleges and majors. Diplomas for Degrees in Memoriam will be prepared to read \"Master of Arts in Memoriam, Master of Science in Memoriam,\" \"Doctor of Philosophy in Memoriam,\" etc., depending upon the degree the student was pursuing at the time of his or her death. Transcripts Transcripts of a student's USF academic record may be requested by the student through the Office of the Registrar. A student's academ ic record can only be released upon authorizatio n of the student. Students requesting transcripts may do so in person or by writing to the Office of the Registrar. By law, the request must include the stud ent's signature and date. For transcripts to be issued, the student must have no financial obligations to the University. Procedures for requesting a transcript are available on the Office of the Registrar's website at http://www.regis trar.usf.edu/ . Degree statements are posted approximately five weeks after the graduation ceremony. Current term grades are posted approximately one week after the final exams end. If grades for the current te rm are needed, clearly indicate that the transcript request is to be held for grades. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 10 Degrees and Concentrations 106 Section 10 Degrees and Concentrations For the current list of authorized degree programs and concentrations, Accelerated Degree Programs, and Dual Degree Programs, go to www.grad.usf.edu As of the date of this publication, the University is authorized to offer: 131 Master's programs 2 Education Specialist programs 39 Doctoral programs (including the Ed.D., Au.D., D.N.P., M.D. and D.P.T.) 16 Accelerated programs (see table below) 9 Formalized Dual Degree programs (see table below) 234 Concentrations at the master's level 16 Concentrations at the specialist level 107 Concentrations at the doctoral level New graduate programs and concentrations are cons tantly under development and may now be approved and available. Check the website for r ecently approved programs and for info rmation on which programs are currently accepting applications and which are currently closed for admission. How to understand Degrees, versus Programs, versus Concentrations. The University offers a number of degrees (e.g. M.A., M.S.E.S., Ph.D., etc.) under which various programs (a.k.a. majors) are offered - for example Biology . Concentrations are formalized areas of study available within the program - for example Conservation Biology . Some programs are offered as the area of study pr esented. Other programs are offered through a variety of concentrations within the program. Th e degree is awarded in the program, e.g. M.S. in Nursing. Currently the diploma lists only the degree (Master of Science). However, program and concentration designations are both noted on the tran script. USF offers over 350 Concentrations within the 170+ Programs that are au thorized. For example: Adult Education (Curriculum and Instruction) M.Ed. Education Would translate to: M.Ed. in Curriculum and Inst ruction with a Concentration in Adult Education M.Ed. = the name of the degree - \"Master of Education\" Curriculum and Instruction = the name of the program of study the degree is awarded in. Adult Education = the name of the concentration within the program. To learn more about the program or concentration, refer to the corresponding college section of the catalog. Depending on the college, the information may be listed under the concentration name (as is the case for the College of Education) or the progra m name (as is the case for the College of Arts and Sciences). Questions about degrees and concentrations may be directed to the Graduate School.

Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has been approved by the Graduate Council. The graduate certificate is not defined as a degree by the Graduate School; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when completed, af fords the student some record of distinct acad emic accomplishment in a given discipline or set of related disciplines. Moreover, the graduate certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate degree program. While the courses comprising a graduate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a degree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite. Process of Approval for New Graduate Certificates Proposals for new areas of study for graduate certificates are created and submitted by the academic unit that wishes to offer such a certificate. Proposals must be accompanied by endorsement from the department heads and deans of the colleges/schools in which the contributing course work is offered as well as from the academic unit or units whose students or degree programs could be impacted by the creation of the graduate certificate. The Graduate Council will consider all the proposals for new graduate certificat es to assure proposal guidelines have been followed and that repetition and redundancy across areas of study for certificates are not evident. Those meeting the criteria set forth by Graduate Council will then be recommended to the Provost for approval. Criteria for Approval The general principles applied to the assessment of the academic quality of proposals for new graduate areas of study for certificate include: 1. The proposed sequence of course work must offer a clear and appr opriate educational objective at the post-baccalaureate level. 2. The proposed curriculum will achieve its educational objective in an efficient and well-defined manner. 3. A perceived need for such a certificate should exist. This provision might be defined in terms of either external markets (i.e., external demand for the skills associated with such a ce rtificate) or internal academic means (i.e., the need for a critical mass of students in a given discipline). 4. An appropriate number of credit hours must comprise the area of stud y for the certificate. The number of graduate credits cannot be less than nine (9) or more than one-half of the credits necessary for a related master's degree from the Graduate School. 5. If the area of study for a certificate requires new courses, those courses must be approved by the appropriate College bodies or offices and the Graduate Council. Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria Student must apply and be accepted into the graduate certificate area of study to be eligible to receive a certificate. The prerequis ites and general criteria of eligibility for admission to any graduate certificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited college or university or enrollment in a USF USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 11 Graduate Certificates 112 five-year academic program is required. Students in five-year academic programs may be admitted upon completion of 120 semester hours. 2. Each graduate area of study sets the requirements for admission, including minimum grade point average, standardized test scores, and other si milar criteria as part of the application. Students who wish to pursue a graduate certificate must apply and be admitted to the certificate area. Students are encouraged to contact the coordinator prior to applying. All students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates must be admitted to such areas of study before a second grad uate certificate course is completed. 3. Certificate-seeking-students not currently enrolled in a degree-granting graduate program, will be admitted into a separate classification within the University, and will be classified as \"Graduate Certificate Students.\" This separate classification will permit the University to monitor statistical and enrollment data fo r certificate areas of study, and will allow inclusion of such efforts in the annual reports and academic planning. The Graduate Certificate Office will note successful completion of a certificate on the studen t's transcript upon completion. 4. Students pursuing a graduate certificate will be required to meet the same academic requirements as those defined for degree-seeking students to remain in \"good standing\". 5. All graduate certificate students may apply one graduate course to two graduate certificates. 6. All graduate certificate students must meet all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll. Should a graduate certificate student subsequently apply and be accepted to a degree-granting program, up to twelve (12) hours of USF credit earned as a graduate certificate student may be applied to satisfy graduate degree requirements. Any application of such credit must be approved by the degree-granting college and must be appropriate to the program. See the Transfer of Credit Policy for more information. 7. For information on tran sfer of credit policies pertaining to Graduate Certificates, refer to the transfer of credit policy in Section 7, Academic Policies, of this catalog, Certificate Requirements To receive a graduate certificate: 1. Students must successfully complete certificate requirements as established by the university. 2. Students must submit a completion form. Degree-seeking students must submit this form before graduating from their degree program. Non-degree-seeking students must submit this form no later than one semester after completing their certificate course work. 3. Students must have been awarded a bachelor's or higher degree.

The comprehensive and rigorous curriculum prepares graduates for a full range of professional activities. The course of study emphasizes urban architecture and related topics to take advantage of its diverse metropolitan setting in Florida's Tampa Bay. The School of Architecture and Community Design (SACD) is home to the Florida Center for Community Design and Research, is a non-profit public service institute of the School of Architecture and Community Design. It was founded in 1986 to assist the citizens of Florida in the creation of more livable and sustainable communities through applied community design, multi-disciplinary research, and public education. The diverse staff includes architecture faculty and students, research scientists, and programmer analysts. In addition, the Center has affiliated faculty or graduate students from the Department of Anthropology, Biology, Fine Arts, Geography, and Social Work. Accreditation and Licensure: Applicants for architectural licensure in Florida, and most jurisdictions in the United States, normally must have: earned a professional degree from a School accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) completed the Intern Development Program (IDP) passed the Archite ct Registration Examination (ARE) According to the 1998 edition of the of the NAAB Conditions and Procedures:\"In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture, recognized two types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture and the Master of Architecture. A program may be granted a six- year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on its degree of conformance with established educational standards. Masters degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, which, when earned sequentially, comprise an accredited professional education. However, the pre- professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.\" Major Research Areas: Architecture and Community Design ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University re quirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. In order to enroll in the M.Arch. Program, students must be accepted by the Graduate School and the School of Architecture and Community Design. These are separate admission processes that involve different application forms, supportive materials, and deadlines. For more detailed information, students should see Graduate Admissions online and visit the SACD website. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Architecture (M.Arch.) 116 Program Admission Requirements The Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) requires a 3.00 undergraduate GPA; GRE Test Score; Portfolio of creative work; Completed 3 prerequisite courses: Physics, Calculus, and AutoCAD; Written Statement of Intent. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS The M.Arch. Degree normally requires 105 credit hours of coursework for students with baccalaureate degrees in non-architectural subjects. In order to complete the program in a timely manner, students must complete 15-17 credit hours per semester. Students with undergraduate degrees in architecture or related fields may receive waivers for some required courses for which a grade of B or better was earned. Students with four-year pre-professional degrees must complete a minimum of 51 credit hours in the Master of Architecture program. Student s with five or six year professional degrees from a NAAB/CAAB accredited program (U.S. and Canada) must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in the program. For more detailed information, in terested students should contact the School directly or visit its website.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS Computers The School of Architecture and Community Design requires each student enrolled in the Advanced Design Studios level, or higher, to possess (through purchase or lease) a NOTEBOOK COMPUTER system. The notebook computer requirement allows students to conduct the majority of digital work, which is an integral aspect of adva nced architectural design education and professional practice, in the design studio. The studio is the primary place for the exchange of design ideas, critique, and synthesis, and the Architecture faculty believes that the student's regular presence in the studio is critical for maximizing her or his architectural design learning. The notebook system is required in lieu of a desktop in order to address the limited design studio space available to each student. The mobility of the notebook allows the student to easily and quickly transform a relatively small desk space into a variety of configurations suitable for physical model-making, hand-drawing, hand-drafting, design research, and design writing as well as di gital drawing, modeling, and graphic design. The battery-powered notebook allows for maximum computer use within environments with limited electrical power outlets. The School will continue to maintain high-powered computer systems in the laboratory for intensive computing required for manipulating large digital models, renderings, etc. Students may begin their digital work on their laptops and, if needed, use removable storage and network connections to transfer files to the lab systems for final development. The School provides black and white printers, color and black and white plotters, and scanners in the computer laboratory. Because the notebook computer system is an educational requirement of the School, the cost of a new computer purchase can be factored in determining a student's financial need. The student must contact the USF Office of Financial Aid (813-974-4700) to request additional information and a \"Budget Adjustment for Computer Purchase\" form prior to USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Architecture (M.Arch.) 117 ordering a computer. The decision regarding a student's budget adjustment may take 6-8 weeks, so students are strongly encouraged to plan ahead. Only one financial aid budget adjustment up to $2,500 for a new computer can be issued during a three year period. Portfolios The faculty requires the submission of portfolios of academic work by each student at two formal portfolio reviews. Students must pass these portfolio reviews in order to advance in the program. The portfolio policy can be found on the School's website. Students are advised to prepare their design work for inclusion in their portfolios at the end of each design semester, instead of waiting until just before the portfolio due dates. Some expense, vary ing widely according to reproduction technique and/or ambition, should be anticipated. Field Trips Each year students in the fall term beginning students in take a field trip to Savannah, GA. Transportation, lodging and meals ($200-300) are paid by the students. Students in design studios take field trips to such cities as New York, Boston and Chicago in the spring. The cost of these trips may be $200-600 per student. Student Work Student work, submitted to the School in satisfaction of course or degree re quirements, becomes the physical property of the School. This work may include papers, drawings, m odels, and other materials in either physical or electronic form. The School assumes no responsibility for safeguarding such materials. At its discreti on, this School may retain, return, or discard such materials. The School will not normally discard the materi als of currently enrolled students without giving the st udent a chance to reclaim them. GPA of 3.00 in Design In addition to the state-wide requirement that students maintain an overall grade point average(GPA) of 3.00 or better, the Architecture faculty also requires that students maintain a GPA of 3. 00 or better in all design courses.

Faculty at USF specialize in various areas including medica l anthropology, biological anthropology, urban policy an d community development, education, archaeology, cult ural resource management (CRM), economic development, immigration, linguistics, media, and issues pertaining to race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographic specializations emphasize the Caribbean, Latin America, S ub-Saharan Africa, and the United States. More than 200 graduates have received an education in anthropology and its practical uses, leading to employment in government and private sector agencies and organizations. For many, th e MA is a terminal degree that qualifies them for professional careers in administration, program eval uation, planning, research, and cultural resource manage ment. Others have gone on to earn doctoral degrees and have gained employment in academic or higher level nonacademic positions. There are two graduate concentrations, one in Bio-cultural Medical Anthropology and another in Cultural Resouce Management. The former provides expertise on the management and preservation of cultural resources. Master's level anthropology at USF has three tracks, all leading to the M.A. in Applied Anthropology but with emphases in cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology. Although these three tracks share some common requirements, and are bound by general rules of the USF Graduate School, they have different curricula and em ployment trajectories. Archaeology graduates typically enter careers in contract archaeology, or public and private agencies and museums responsible for managing archaeological resources. The cultural focus of the M.A. in Applied Anthropology is designed to lead to employment in diverse areas that include health care, educa tion, urban planning, human services, private sector consulting and research, and non-governmental community organizations. Museum and heritage programming represent an area of overlap between the two emphases. Students who wish to pursue these kinds of specialties will develop curricula that draw from both applied and public archaeology requirements in consultation with thei r advisors. Biologocial Anthropology students are trained to work in health care, law enforcement, private sector consulting and research, and non-governmental organizations. MA students can select elective courses to fulfill a concentration in Bio- cultural medical anthropolog y or Cultural Resource Management. For information regarding the dual degree M.A./MPH program with the College of Public Health, refer to the separate listing under Anthropology or Public Health Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools. Major Research Areas: Biocultural medical research in the U.S., Latin America, and Africa including nutrition, population genetics, forensics, maternal and ch ild health, and HIV/AIDS; media and visual anthropology; urban Florida archaeology; Mesoamerican shift and revitaliza tion; bilingualism; heritage studies.

For the doctoral/master's combina tion, students develop individual programs of study in consultation with an interdisciplinary academic advisory committee. The committee must approve the plan of study as well as the proposal to fulfill the thesis and dissertation requirements or dissertation and special project requirements through a single project. The two programs review applicants independently. A single graduate school appli cation form is completed, listing both anthropology and public health as major areas of study. The review process may begin in either college. The timing of a pplication should take into consideration that the COPH admits students three times a year (Fall, Spring, and Su mmer) and the Department of Anthropology admits students annually in the Fall. Once the applicant has been accepted into one program, the application folder is forwarded to the other program for review. After admission to both programs, the Graduate Admissions office instructs the Registrar's Office to classify the student as dually enrolled in anthropology and public health. In choosing which program to apply to first, students should take into consideration the following: requirements in Anthropology for admission are different than in Public Health; admission to one program doesn't guarantee admi ssion to the other; and of course, the student's interests and career plans. Upon completion of all requirements for the dual degree program, the student submits separate applications for graduation to anthropology and public health, and is certified for graduation by both programs and receives two diplomas. Dual degree students can also select elective courses to fulfill a concentration in I Bio-cultural medical anthropology.

Currently, the Department of Biology is composed of the Division of Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Microbiology (CMM) and the Division of Integrated Biology (IB). The department is located in two modern, well-equipped buildings. Most research in cell and molecular, and microbiology is done by faculty housed in the Bio-Science facility, and most of the research in organismal biology and ecology is conducted by faculty housed in the Scie nce Center. In addition, the department has common research facilities in two nearby buildings. One theme that runs throughout the department is that of cooperation. Within the Depart ment, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Ma ny of the Department's cell molecular, microbiologists and ecologists are involved in cooperative research with thei r colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, and Medicine. Likewise, many of the Department's organismal biologists and ecologists are involved in cooperative resear ch with colleagues in the Departments of Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often biology graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require hands-on experimental labor atories, the Department supports many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. The Department values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research A ssistant positions also are available to support resear ch with specific faculty members. Students interested in atte nding graduate school should contact potential major professors to communicate their research ideas and establish that the professor will consider the student's applic ation. The selection of a major professor includes acceptance of the student by the faculty member. Applicants should contact faculty conducting research in the student's area of interest well in advance of the application deadline. For all master's students, the major professor and at least two additional faculty constitu te the student's supervisory committee, the major professor and at least one of the committee members must be from the Biology Department. For all Ph.D. st udents the major professor and at least three additional faculty constitute the student's supervisory committee. The major professor and three members must be from the Department of Biology. Supervisory committ ees must be established within two semesters after matriculation. Failure to do so will be cause for dismissal. The Divisional Graduate Dir ector, Divisional Chairman, the College Dean and the Dean of the Graduate School must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Biology (M.S.) 140 utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis or di ssertation, the student shall enroll for two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis or dissertation credits. A student must be registered for an appropriate load (in no case fewer than two [2] graduate hours) in the college for the semester in which all degree requirements are satisfactorily completed. A student who receives three grades below \"B\" in structured courses required by the advisory committee will be dropped from the program. Registration in courses entitled Directed Research, Thesis, or Dissertation must be with the approval of the major professor and must be commensurate with each student's research plan. Students may not register in Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral until a Supervisory Committee has been formed. A student who enrolls in courses entitled Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral but does not submit a thesis or dissertation will not be certified for graduation. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools. Major Research Areas: Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Microbiology, Conservation Biology and Coastal Marine Biology ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University re quirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below.

Currently, the Department of Biology is composed of the Division of Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Microbiology (CMM) and the Division of Integrated Biology (IB). The department is located in two modern, well-equipped buildings. Most research in cell and molecular, and microbiology is done by faculty housed in the Bio-Science facility, and most of the research in organismal biology and ecology is conducted by faculty housed in the Scie nce Center. In addition, the department has common research facilities in two nearby buildings. One theme that runs throughout the department is that of cooperation. Within the Depart ment, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Ma ny of the Department's cell molecular and microbiologists are involved in cooperative research with thei r colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, and Medicine. Likewise, many of the Department's organismal biologists and ecologists are involved in cooperative resear ch with colleagues in the Departments of Geology, Ge ography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often biology graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require hands-on experimental labor atories, the Department supports many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. The Department values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research A ssistant positions also are available to support resear ch with specific faculty members. Students interested in atte nding graduate school should contact potential major professors to communicate their research ideas and establish that the professor will consider the student's applic ation. The selection of a major professor includes acceptance of the student by the faculty member. Applicants should contact faculty conducting research in the student's area of interest and in advance of the application deadline. For all master's students, the major professor and at least two additional faculty constitu te the student's supervisory committee, the major professor and at least one of the committee members must be from the Biology Department. For all Ph.D. st udents the major professor and at least three additional faculty constitute the student's supervisory committee. The major professor and three members must be from the Department of Biology. Supervisory committ ees must be established within two semesters after matriculation. Failure to do so will be cause for dismissal. The Divisional Graduate Dir ector, Divisional Chairman, the College Dean and the Dean of the Graduate School must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Biology (Ph.D.) 143 professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis or di ssertation, the student shall enroll for two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis or dissertation credits. A student must be registered for an appropriate load (in no case fewer than two [2] graduate hours) in the college for the semester in which all degree requirements are satisfactorily completed. A student who receives three grades below \"B\" in structured courses required by the advisory committee will be dropped from the program. Registration in courses entitled Directed Research, Thesis, or Dissertation must be with the approval of the major professor and must be commensurate with each student's research plan. Students may not register in Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral until a Supervisory Committee has been formed. A student who enrolls in courses entitled Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral but does not submit a thesis or dissertation will not be certified for graduation.

DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Students with only a Bachelors degree must take 4 ACS entrance exam (with an option to take Biochemistry or Analytical and a requirement to take core exams in Organic, Inorganic, and Physi cal Chemistry). They must obtain at least the national median ACS score in the required core exams to pass. If they fail, they have the option to retake the exam or remediate the deficiency by obtaining at least B (not a B-) in one of our upper- division undergraduate courses (or by taking the exams in the appropriate course a nd obtaining the equivalent grade) in the area of the deficiency before their candidacy exam. Students with a Masters degree may be required to adhere to the policy at the discreti on of the Graduate Council at the time of acceptance. Entering students will have a Promotion to Candidacy Committee established upon entering the Ph.D. Program. The Committee advises students as to what courses they need to take in their first semester. There are no set c ourse requirements, but the decision of the Committee is binding. Students will normally be expected to take the first semester of the first year covering \"Tools of Research,\" including literature search and analysis, proposal writing, oral presentation skills, and laboratory instrumental techniques. The second semester of the cour se may be required by a student's promotion to Candidacy committee. Advanced courses in other subject ar eas may be assigned by the Committee, where appropriate. Final coursework decisions are made by the candidate's research advisor. Advisor Selection Students need to choose a pre-Ph.D. candidate research adviser by the beginning of the second semester to begin pre-candidate research in that laboratory (See below). The student will then proceed to initiate a research project by the beginning of the second semester and through the first summer of study. Selection of a research advisor is one of the most important decisions a student will make during the graduate career. In orde r to avoid hasty or poorly founded decisions each student must discuss potential research projects with at least three members of the chemistry faculty. Appropriate forms can be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office and should be completed and returned no later than the end of the second semester (excludi ng summer semester) after entering the program. Promotion to Candidacy At the conclusion of the first year (before the start of the third semester), a written research document outlining progress to date and future plans is submitted to and approved by the Promotion to candidacy Committee. This proposal is subsequently defended in front of the committee. A successful defense results in Promotion to Ph.D. Candidacy, contingent upon the student being formally accepted into a research group. The committee must vote three quarters in favor of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two or four members (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must se t conditions to be met to promote the student within 30 da ys of the first meeting. At the discretion of the committee, the student not promoted to candidacy may be given a pass at a JM.A. level of competency and pro ceed to obtain a terminal research master's degree or be terminated from the program. Appropriate forms to document promotion to candidacy must be completed and forwarded to the Graduate School. The forms may be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office. Dissertation Committee Upon promotion the candidate must formally choose and declare a research adviser and a dissertation committee must be established initially with at least three members. An additional committee member from outside the department or university must be added before the final defense. The research advisor chairs the committee. Original Rese arch Proposal An original research proposal must be written and defended by the end of the first semester of the third year. At the discretion of the research adviser, the student's original research proposal may or may not be related to the student's current or future research. The student must be informed of the research adviser's preference in advance of seeking approval fo r the thesis topic. The dissertation committee formally approves the proposal and its defense. The candi date should meet with the dissertation committee member s (individually or as a group) to discuss the proposal topic. The original research proposal should follow the format of a major federal granting agency appropriate to the nature of the proposed research. The format of the proposal, in conjunction wit the topic, s hould be approved in advance by the dissertation committee. The written proposal must be given to the dissertation committee members two weeks in advance of the scheduled defense. After the defense, the committee must vote three quarters in favor of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two of four members (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must set conditions to be met to pass the candidate within 30 days of the first meeting. Students not passing will normally be terminated from the Ph.D. program. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Chemistry (Ph.D.) 152 Research Data Presentation and Dissertation By the end of the fourth year, a research data presentation must be made to disse rtation committee and the committee formally advises the candidate on research milestones that need to be met before permission to \"write up\" the dissertation is granted. The permission to \"write up\" the dissertation can be given at any subsequent time. A peer-reviewed publication based upon the dissertation research is required to obtain the degree of Ph.D. Note: Extenuating circumstances will be reviewed on a cases-by-case basis. Further, studetns have to wait a minimum of 6 months after successful completion of the Research Data Presentation (aka Data Defense) (and the associated online data base forms) before they will be permitted to defend their dissertation. This rule can only be waived by the Department Chair with the written approval of the majority of the Thesis Committee in the case of exceptional circumstances. Final Dissertation Defense Each student should consult with their supervisory committee for deadlines in submitting the dissertation prior to the defense. Thesis or dissertation defense are not normally scheduled during final exam week or during the weeks between regularl y scheduled sessions.The dissertation defense must be scheduled through the Chemistry Graduate Office at least two weeks in advance. The Chemistry Graduate Office will then announce the defense to the entire Chemistry Department. The candidate normally defends their dissertation in the fourth or fifth year. NOTE: these deadlines are in addition to those imposed by the Graduate School. The Graduate School sets deadlines pertaining to thesis/dissertations each semester. Candidates may be offered a departmental TA position in year five given satisfactory progress in research as judged by the dissertation committee and approval of the Department Chair, TA's are not normally awarded beyond year 5. RA's are only permitted beyond year six in exceptional cases with the written approval of the department chair. It is important to note that the Graduate School will not award tuition waivers for credit hours beyond 120 for students entering with a baccalaureate degree and 90 for students entering with a master's degree. Supervisory Committees The M.S. and M.A. supervis ory committee should consist of at least three members including the major professor, and two other chemistry facult y members, at least one of whom is outside the student 's major area (analytical, biochemistry, etc.)According to University Regulations, the Ph.D. supervisory committee must consist of at least four (4) members, including the student's research director. At least two (2) of the members must be from an area related to the student's research.

The core seminars, directed by a faculty member from one of USF Graduate Catalog 20082009 Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies (M.A.) 186 the participating departments, will familiarize students with the literature, existi ng knowledge, and research approaches of the various fields of area studies and invited to acquaint students with faculty and their research. The purposes of the seminars are: \u00be to provide an interdisciplinary graduate experience \u00be to foster a community of scholars and learners focused on Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino experiences \u00be to encourage the integration of learners into the larger Latin communities of Tampa Bay, West Florida, and the hemisphere. Students will also take a three (3) hour methodology course that acquaints them with particular research relevant to their discipline and when possible, Latin America and/or the Caribbean. This includes special approaches to finding docum entation from Latin America and the Caribbean; newly-available search tools available on the internet; and an overview of how disciplines utilize different research materials. Major and Minor Fields With the concurrence of the ISLAC advisor, students will elect major and minor fields during their first semester. These fields will draw heavily on participating departments (e.g. Anthropolog y, History, Government and International Affairs, Art History). At that time the student will constitute a supervisory committee, made up of two professors from the major field and one from the minor field. The committee members will counsel the student and serve as members of the exam or thesis committees. A large number of courses are available to fulfill the major and minor field requi rements. These are listed separately and change somewhat from year to year. Departments who frequently work with ISLAC are Anthropology, Government and International Affairs, Sociology, Mass Communica tion, Geography, Social Work, Women Studies, Global Health, Philosophy, Economics, History, .World Languages, Humanities and American Studies, Art Histor y and Africana Studies. Students may also request to have courses from other departments count toward major or minor fields. Electives Students can take one elective from outside the major and minor fields, in order to complement their core studies. These might be technical courses, study abroad courses internships, math and scienc e courses, methodology, or another unrelated field. In al l cases, students must justify their elective hours and receive approval from their committees. In addition, students opting for the non-thesis track must take one more course in each of their major and minor fields. Students considering teaching in community colleges are encouraged to take more classes in their major field. Graduation Requirements At the conclusion of their coursework, students who opted for thesis must gain a pproval of the thesis by the committee. All candidates for the degree must also demonstrate language proficie ncy either by examination or by completing a 3000-level course in Spanish or Portuguese with a B or better.

Currently, the Department of Biology is composed of the Division of Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Microbiology (CMM) and the Division of Integrated Biology (IB). The department is located in two modern, well-equipped buildings. Most research in cell and molecular, and microbiology is done by faculty housed in the Bio-Science facility, and most of the research in organismal biology and ecology is conducted by faculty housed in the Scie nce Center. In addition, the department has common research facilities in two nearby buildings. One theme that runs throughout the department is that of cooperation. Within the Depart ment, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Ma ny of the Department's cell molecular, microbiologists are involved in cooperative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, and Medicine. Likewise, many of the Department's organismal biol ogists and ecologists are involved in cooperative resear ch with colleagues in the Departments of Geology, Ge ography, Marine Science, and the Environmental Science program. Often biology graduate students have facu lty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require hands-on experimental labor atories, the Department supports many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. The Department values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research A ssistant positions also are available to support resear ch with specific faculty members. Students interested in atte nding graduate school should contact potential professors to communicate their research ideas and establish that the professor will consider the studetn's applic ation. The selection of a major professor includes acceptance of the student by the faculty member. Applicants should contact faculty conducting research in the student's area of interest well in advance of the application deadline. For all master's students, the major professor and at least two additional faculty constitu te the student's supervisory committee, the major professor and at least one of the committee members must be from the Biology Department. For all Ph.D. st udents the major professor and at least three additional faculty constitute the student's supervisory committee. The major professor and three members must be from the Department of Biology. Supervisory committ ees must be established USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Microbiology (M.S.) 200 within two semesters after matriculation. Failure to do so will be cause for dismissal. The Divisional Graduate Dir ector, Divisional Chairman, the College Dean and the Dean of the Graduate School must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis or di ssertation, the student shall enroll for two hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis or dissertation credits. No student shall be required to enroll for more than nine graduate hours per semester. A student must be registered for an appropriate load (in no case fewer than two graduate hours) in the college for the semester in which all degree requirements are satisfactorily completed. A student who receives three grades below \"B\" in structured courses required by the advisory committee will be dropped from the program. Registration in courses entitled Directed Research, Thesis, or Dissertation must be with the approval of the major professor and must be commensurate with each student's research plan. Students may not register in Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral until a Supervisory Committee has been formed. A student who enrolls in courses entitled Thesis: Master's or Dissertation: Doctoral but does not submit a thesis or dissertation will not be certified for graduation.

International applicants from non English-sp eaking countries must also have a TOEFL score of 550 or higher on the written version, a minimum score of 213 on the computer-based test or a 79 on the internet-based test. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS A minimum of 90 semester hours beyond the bachelor's degree is required. This incl udes 21 hours of dissertation. A minimum of 45 hours of coursework must be completed at the University of South Florida. Foundation Courses These courses are designed to develop an appreciation of the institution of business and to help students see how their areas of specialization fit into this general picture. With the approval of the student's program committee, a student may satisfy these requirements in any of the following ways: A. By completing an undergraduate degree in business at an AACSB accredited institution, with an average of \"B\" or better in the last 60 hours, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program. B. By completing an M.B.A. degree at an AACSB accredited institution, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Bu siness Administration (Ph.D.) 247 C. By completing one approved course with a grade of \"B\" or better in each of the functional areas: Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Management, and Marketing. (Economics requirements are described under core requirements.) All graduate-level courses at the 6000 level or above, with the exception of specific \"tool\" courses (e.g. statistics), will count toward this requirement. D. By successfully petitioning the doctoral Program Committee to accept previous academic work (e.g., specialized Masters programs in business, degrees granted more than 5 years ago, etc.) in fulfillment of all or part of this requirement. Such a petition must be initiated during the first semester of the program. Core Courses The core courses are designed to provide a strong background in Economics and to develop the student's quantitative and statistical research skills. These courses are required of all students in the program. The College will waive a course only if the student has passed the same or equivalent course with a grade of \"B\" or better within the preceding five years. The Economics requirement can be met by completing two graduate level courses, one in microeconomics and one in macroeconomics, with a grade of \"B\" or better. The courses which satisfy this requirement are: ECP 6702 Managerial Economics 2 ECO 6708 Global Economic Env. of Business 2 ECO 6115 Microeconomics I* 3 ECO 6206 Aggregate Economics* 3 ECP 6408 Economics of Organization* 3 At least one course must be taken from among those listed above with an asterisk (*). The quantitative and statistical coursework is to be determined by the student's program committee in consultation with the student. A three course series is required. An appropriate sequ ence should be chosen from the following: ECO 6424 Econometrics I ECO 6425 Econometrics II ECO 7426 Econometrics III ECO 7427 Econometrics IV GEB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods QMB 7566 Applied Multivaria te Statistical Methods Any substitution of appropriate mathematics, statistical and quantitative coursework must be approved by the Doctoral Program Committee, preferably at the time of acceptance, or definitely before the student takes a substitute course. In addition, students are required to take an additional research elective approved by their advisory committee. Should a student earn a grade of \"C\" or lower in the core courses, the case will be brought before the Doctoral Program Committee for review. After reviewing the case, the Committee will take one of the following steps: a. Require the student to pass an examination that covers the material relevant to the subject. A student who fails the exam on the first attempt may retake it within one year. A student who fails the exam on the second attempt will be subject to dismissal. b. Require the student to retake the course. If the student retakes the course and fails to receive a grade of \"B\" or better, the student is subject to dismissal. Major Field All students will take at leas t five (5) courses at the 6000 or 7000 level in an area designated as the student's major. Students are encouraged to identify courses in the major field that will provide experience in applying current research techniques to probl ems in that field. To accomplish this, the student may propose a combination of formal classroom course s and independent directed- research courses. This combination may include a year- long research seminar in which the groundwork is laid for the student's dissertation. The specific agenda of courses will be determined by the student's program committee. The following fields are offe red as majors: Accounting, Economics, Finance, Informat ion Systems, Management (inactive) and Marketing. Courses taken as part of the Foundation or Core sections ma y not be counted as part of the hours required for a major field. Support Field The support area will consist of a minimum of three courses (9 hours) from one or more of the fields listed under the major field, or elsewhere in the university.. The support field and the major field cannot be taken in the same department. Courses within the support field can be selected to complement the major field and in special cases may include courses outside the College of Business. The nature and number of the support area courses will be determined by the Student's Program Committee in consultation with the Ph.D. coordinator of the support field department. Courses taken as part of the Foundation or Core courses may not be counted as part of the 9 hours required for support fields. Comprehensive Qualifying Examination Upon completion of all coursework, students must pass a comprehensive written examination in the major area. The student's performance on this exam should reflect familiarity with the literatur e, as well as with current issues and problems related to these fields. A student who fails the field exam may retake it within one year. A second failure disqualifies the student from continuing the Ph.D. program. If the degree is not conferred within 5 calendar years of the comprehensive qualifying examination, a second and diffe rent examination must be taken. Students passing the qualifying examination are USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Bu siness Administration (Ph.D.) 248 eligible for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. program. The decision to administer a separate comprehensive exam for a support area will be made by the department in which the support area is ta ken. In the event that an interdisciplinary support area is selected, any department represented by six (6) or more semester hours may require a qualifying examination. In the event that no single department represents six semester hours or more, the student's program committee will solicit input from the faculty teaching the courses in the support area. If a majority of those polled take the position that a separate comprehensive examination in the support area is not appropriate, the exam will not be administered. If a separate comprehensive examin ation is not administered in a support area, material from the support area will be integrated into the comprehensive exam in the major area. Normally, qualifying examinations will be administered in October and March of each year. A student who anticipates sitting for a field exam should notify the department chair and the Associate Dean in writing during the first week of the semester in which they plan to take the exam. The exams will be a minimum of 8 hours. Dissertation - 21 hours of dissertation are required for the degree. Residency Requirement - Ph.D. students in the College are required to complete a minimum of 15 hours per calendar year. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the student being placed on conditional status.

For updated details, please consult our website at www.coba.usf.edu . This program develops the skill to lead 21st century organizations. It is targeted for experienced, successful work ing managers - people who are already good at their jobs and who can be promoted to higher leadership and execu tive positions within or outside their present organizations. It is not intended for recent graduates seeking entry-level managerial positions. The future requires a very different type of leader than the past. The hierarchical model of scientific management is no longer wide ly accepted. The leaders of the future must be able to empower others and to facilitate teamwork in diverse groups, to recognize and adapt to the constraints and opportunities of a global economy, and to accommodate the ethical and societal needs of the environment within which the organization functions. The program focuses on the triple bottom line of sustainable economic perfo rmance, corporate social responsibility, and concern fo r the natural environment. Both the profit and not-for-profit communities have recognized these changes and have demanded that business schools provide a modified and improved manager for the future - a manager who succeeds by facilitating the performance of others. This manager must be successful in leadership and organizational effectiveness. Ethical and virt uous behavior as well as technical skills are promoted. These values lead to organizational behavior that is both effective and ethical. Intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational competencies are enhanced. The M.S.M. faculty members blend scholarly activity and applied skills. It is the goal of the faculty to prepare graduates for successful careers as leaders in the real world. This is an extremely progressive, dynamic, well-focused program. It is designed to help you reach career goals. The M.S.M. is a 31 credit hour program offered in cohort format. The program is designed around the needs of working managers. Classes meet Monday and Tuesday evenings for twenty-one months. All students begin in the fall semester. The curriculum proceeds from encompassing perspective to skills development through understanding of interpersonal and organizational dynamics, to planned change and implementation. Sections are limited to thirty students. Course offerings and section availability are guaranteed to cohort members. All majors are eligible and welcome.

The intent of the program is to develop personnel to work in unive rsities, school districts, government agencies, comme rcial test publishing and program evaluation enterprises. The doctoral program emphasi zes research in inquiry methodology and applied problems in education and the behavioral sciences. A s upervised practicum provides opportunities to apply methods in systematic inquiry in various settings. In sum, methodological skills are developed within a programmatic context that encourages growth of knowledge about education, considers important principles of res earch, and provides a clinical setting in which these elements can be fused into professional applications. Emphasis is placed on those aspects of research and evaluation design, measurement, statistical analysis, and systems approaches that are relevant to both decision- oriented and conclusion-oriented research. Inquiry methods include traditiona l experimental and quasi- experimental designs as well as survey, policy analysis, historical, ethnographic, case study, naturalistic and mixed methods approaches. The intent of the program is to develop instructional and research personnel who can strengthen the training, research and development capabilities of agencies and institutions concerned with education. While the doctoral program in measurement, research, and evaluation emphasizes methodology, concentration in substantive disciplines w ithin education and/or the social sciences is possible. Concentration in a cognate provides a context within which the methods of systematic inquiry may be applied.

PROGRAM INFORMATION The Science Education doctoral program in the College of Education is committed to providing students with opportunities to examine a nd expand their pedagogical content knowledge and to i mmerse themselves in the research process. In doing so, the program is able to graduate exceptional leaders to the field. The collective philosophy of the Science Ed ucation program, therefore, is to foster a vision of science literacy that encourages: constructing theoretical and practical knowledge of the natures of science, develo ping habits of mind open to multiple scientific perspectives, stressing skepticism and critical thinking, developing conceptual understanding of epistemology applied to pedagogical content knowledge, embedding science in cultural, moral and historical contexts, and providing opportunities for students to generate their own meaningf ul questions and design approaches to investigate original issues relevant to the science education community. The exploration of past, presen t, and future practices, and understanding how current decisions affect future trends is approached through a close professional and personal relationship between faculty an d graduate students. This relationship includes advising and working together in directed studies and seminars , professional associations, and informal gatherings as well as discussions about issues in education in genera l, and science education in particular. The fact that graduate students are regarded as professional colleagues with unique areas of expertise from the beginning of their association with the department contributes substa ntially to their development as science educators. .

Master's Degree Programs The Master's degree is awarded for advanced study beyond the baccalaureate de gree within an area of specialty. The College of Engineering offers several programs leading to degrees at the master's level. Master of Science in Designated Engineering Field - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who holds a Bachelor's degree in the designated field. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non-thesis option (30 credits). Master of Science in Engineering Science - This program is designed to meet the needs who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary course of study and research. This degree is individually tailored to student needs. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non-thesis option (30 credits). Master of Science in Engineering - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has a Bachelor's degree from a non-engineering program and has completed a prescribed series of undergraduate engineering courses. It is a thesis program. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non-thesis option (30 credits). Master of Designated Discipline - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has an undergraduate degree in the discipline and who follows an all coursework program or a project program. Master of Engineering - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has a Bachelor's degree from a non-engineering program and has completed a prescribed series of undergraduate engineering courses. Manufacturing Option - In addition, the departments of Chemical Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering andMechanical Engineering, offer a Master of Science in Engineering with a Manufacturing Systems Option (consisting of an 18 hour core and 18 hours of electives). The degree is administered by the Industrial Engineering Department and is a true interdisciplinary degr ee with areas of Robotics, Automation, Computer Aided Design, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Control Systems, Software Systems, Hardware Systems, and Production Systems available for emphasis. The student, upon completion of the core courses, may choose electives and concen trate within one of the above departments or may choose to acquire an in- depth knowledge in one of the above emphasis areas by making electiv e course choices from several departments. College of Engineering Requirements for Master's Degree 1. A thesis program must contain a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and a minimum of 6 credit hours of thesis. (If a student transfers from a thesis program to all coursework program, no thesis hours may be transferred, converted or counted toward the degree.) 2. Non-thesis program requirements vary according to department but must contain USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 16 College of Engineering 446 a minimum of 30 credits of approved coursework. 3. Students must maintain an overall grade point average of 3.00 . No grade below \"C\" will be accepted in a graduate program. If a student's average falls below 3.00, the student will be placed on probation and must obtain a directed program from the appropriate advisor, and approval by the Engineering Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, prior to continuing coursework for a degree. 4. Most programs require students to pass a final oral or written comprehensive examination prior to receiving the degree. These examinations are arranged and administered by the student's department. Five-Year Programs Leading to Bachelor and Master's Degrees Students who, at the end of the junior year, clearly are interested in graduate study are invited to pursue a five-year program leading simultaneously to the Bachelor of Science in Engineering or Engineering Science and Master degrees. This program offers the opportunity to take graduate courses during the fourth year and deferring senior courses to the fifth year. Students in the Five-Year Program may apply 6 credit hours of coursework, which must be approved by the Graduate Program Coordinator, to count both degrees. Students apply for admission to this program through their advisors, who should be consulted regarding additional requirements. Several factors, which vary by academic department, are considered for admission. However, all applicants must have a minimum GPA of at least 3.00. Doctoral Degree Programs The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of demonstrated scholarly competence and ability to conduct and report original and significant research. Unlike the baccalaureate and Master's degrees, the Ph.D. degree cannot be earned by an accumulation of course credits over a period of residence alone. After adequate fundamental preparation to gain competence, the student must demonstrate research capability through completion of an authoritative investigation in the chosen engineering field, culminating in a written dissertation. The dissertation must demonstrate that the student possesses the ability to reason logically, the talent for engaging in significant and original research, and the ability to organize and present conclusions in a professional manner. Doctor of Philosophy in Designated Engineering Field - This degree is awarded to students pursuing a program in one of the following Engineering disciplines: Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Indu strial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students receiving this degree must demonstrate a thorough foundation in the designated discipline. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science - This program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to pursue doctoral studies in interdisciplinary areas closely related to engineering. College of Engineering Requirements for Doctoral Degrees 1. Supervisory Committee . An advisor will be appointed by the chai r of the appropriate department or program for each student during the first semester of registration at the University of South Florida. The advisor will help determine the student's area of research interest and will delineate preliminary course assi gnments. At the earliest possible date, a major professor will be appointed and a supervisory committee formed. This committee will monitor the student's program of studies and has full responsibility for conducting the student's qualifying examination. The Supervisory Committee consists of a minimum of five members. One member of the committee must be outside the College of Engineering. (The requirement may be waived if special reasons exist and prior approval is obtained from the Engineering Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.) A majority of the committee will be from the College of Engineering, with at least two departments of the College represented. 2. Credit Hours . A minimum of 60 hours of coursework beyond the b accalaureate degree plus a minimum of 20 hours of dissertation research is required. Total hours of cr edit must equal or exceed 90 hours. A minimum of 27 hours coursework in an engineering area of concentration is required. The 27 hours need not be coursework in the same department, but must focus directly upon the areas USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 S ection 16 College of Engineering 447 of concentration; at leas t 20 hours must be at the 6000 level. In addition, a minimum of 8 hours of mathematics or statistics is required. Engineering Mathematics may be approved by the committee if appropriate. Also, a minimum of 8 hours of coursework as defined by the committee outside the major area of concentration is required. Further requirements may be imposed by the candidate's committee. 3. Learning Focus. Throughout the student's program of study, independent learning will be emphasized. For the first time in the participant's career, in most cases, the student will be responsible for mastering a new domain of knowledge without the aid of organized lectures and textbooks. The principal information source will be current literature. Such experience is a necessary preparation for a meaningful career in engineering and other fields where the professional must keep pace with a large, ever-changing body of knowledge. 4. Diagnostic Examination . All prospective candidates must pass a Ph.D. diagnostic examination that includes an area of mathematics and a prescribed area of concentration. This examination must be taken after the student has completed appropriate studies, usually equivalent to one year's coursework. Students entering with a Master's degree must take this examination before the end of the first year after admission to the program. 5. Qualifying Examination . A written and oral qualifying examination, conducted by the supervisory committee, will be taken by each Ph.D. student as soon as a substantial majority of coursework is completed. Completion of this examination and the tools of research admits the student to candidacy. 6. Admission to Candidacy . Students must be admitted to candidacy before they register for dissertation. Before admission to candidacy, students must have: a) passed the diagnostic examination of paragraph 4; b) passed the qualifying examination of paragraph 5; c) demonstrated proficiency in written and spoken English; d) satisfied the Tools of Research requirement; e) been accepted by a department faculty member credentialed to serve as chair of the dissertation committee. It is the responsibility of the Ph.D. committee for each doctoral student to define the tools of research requ irement. Once admitted to candidacy students must enroll for a minimum of 2 credit hours each semester of the academic year until completion of program. 7. Dissertation Research . The student must carry out an investigation resulting in an original and significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of research. The requirement of uniqueness means that the dissertation research will provide an important creative experience for the student. As the final stage of the student's program, the candidate must prepare a written dissertation covering the research. Students in the Ph.D. program must take an appropriate number of doctoral dissertation credits, but not less than 20 hours; the exact number is determined by department and/or individual requirements. The defense of the dissertation will conform to Graduate School general rules. 8. Residency . Minimum residency requirements may be satisfied by completing at the University of South Florida, beyond the Master's degree or equivalent, the following: (1) the University's minimal requirement, or (2) 24 hours in one calendar year, or (3) 30 hours in no more than four semesters within a period of three calendar years. Any graduate work counted toward the fulfillment of the requirement for the Ph.D. degree after admission to candidacy must be accomplished within 5 calendar years. Collaboration with Other Colleges and Departments Advanced study and research challenges exist at the interfaces between engin eering and other academic disciplines. Examples in clude surface physics and chemistry applied to semiconductor processing technology; semiconductor physics applied to VLSI and analog integrated circuit design, manufacture and quality control; chemical processing and its relation to chemical principles; environmental engineering and chemical identification of minute impurities; environmental and transportation engineering and its relation to public health and public administration; water resources engineering and geo-hydrology; and biomedical engineering, to name only a few.

The Florida Board of Regents declared it a University Center of Excellennce in 1978 and approved the Marine Science Ph.D. program in 1982. Staff and faculty serve students on the St. Petersburg campus, Tampa, and the other regional campuses together with their surrounding communities, espousing goals of both diversity and equal opportunity. The CMS at the University of South Florida is constituted as a graduate-level research program that forms the basis for educational opportunities at the Ph.D. and M.S. degree levels and for public service to the State of Florida. The College administratively reports to the Provost of USF. Mission The primary mission of the College is to conduct basic and applied research in ocean science. Here, ocean science is defined by application of the traditional fields of science to both the biology, chemistry, geology, and physics of the marine environment and to the interactions between the marine environment and th e adjoining atmosphere and land systems - presently and throughout earth's history. Included in th e primary ocean science mission is the development of new technologies and tools for explorin g the coupled ocean- atmosphere-land systems. The College expects its faculty to develop research programs of outstanding caliber and to fully engage the national and international scientific communities, through the reporting of research results in the most respected oral and written venues, and by professional service. Integral to th e ocean science research mission is the education of graduate students. The College recruits, trains, and graduates productive, creative scientis ts at the Ph.D. and M.S. levels that are prepared to make independent contributions to ocean science. The faculty are expected to develop outstanding graduate education programs that will afford students the opportunity to participate in all aspects of research. The College recognizes that graduate education requires strong mentoring along with traditional classroom instruction. An ancillary but important mission of the College is education outreach for students at all levels and for the public at large. Our outreach programs have significantly expanded our educational responsibilities, and they are intended to movtivate all generations to become scientifically literate citizens and to understand the environment in which they live. The College pursues innovative avenues for educational outreach. Efforts are made to attract more junior and senior level undergraduates into both the ocean science core courses and into advanced courses for which they have pre- requisites. Historically, this is a way in which students have made career decisions to engage in ocean science. In this manner the College maintains close ties with the student body in other University of South Florida Colleges and campuses. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Sect ion 17 College of Marine Science 503 The College of Marine Science's specialized laboratories include those for trace metal analysis, water quality, organic and isotope geochemistry, physical chemistry, opti cal oceanography, satellite imagery, benthic ecology, microbiology, planktology, and ichthyology. The College has a large flume facility and laser Doppler velocimeter for interdisciplinary boundary layer studies. It is often the case that a student's research is primarily conducted at sea. Bayboro Harbor can accommodate any ship in the fleet of the U.S. oceanographic vessels, and is home-port to the principal vessels operated by the Florida Institute of Oceanography for the entire State University System. Marine science students frequently participate in Gulf of Mexico cruises on either of two FIO vessels, the R/V Suncoaster (110ft) and the R/V Bellows (71ft).

Public health professionals can better perform these functions through not only obtaining the prere quisite knowledge but also through partnering with well-trained professionals in other fields such as law to develop and implement society's responses to public health needs. However, lawyers' effectiveness is often limited by their inadequate knowledge of public health an d its scientific disciplines. The joint degree program is intended to supply this knowledge by giving public health and Stetson Law School graduates a sound educ ation in both law and public health. A related goal is to increase the opportunities for inter-discip linary research, teaching, and advocacy for the faculties at the College of Public Health and Stetson University College of Law.

ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University re quirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Students will need to be accepted to both institutions and follow the admission standards of each setting. Students must complete the GRE and the LSAT for acceptance into this dual program. Refer to the MPH listing for specific USF admission requirements. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS College of Public Health Students : Students in the College of Public Health will enroll in the JD/MPH program, complete the MPH degree, and meet the admission requirements of Stet son which includes taking the LSAT, and then enroll in the Stetson College of Law to complete the JD. Students in the dual degree program will be permitted to count nine hours of credit from the MPH program toward satisfaction of JD credit requirements, and up to nine hours of credit from the JD program toward satisfaction of MPH credit requirements. All students in the dual degree program must complete a field experience requirement . Students in Stetson Law must do mandatory pro bono work (20 hours). Some of these hours may qualify for the field experience however these must be done in a public health setting. This will be determined by the student's public health advisor and department. Credit hours for the MPH may be more than 42 hours (i.e. 46 hours) depending on the concentration program. Stetson Law Students : Students already enrolled in Stetson College of Law will normally apply for the dual degree program in their first or second year. Students in the program will usually comple te either one or two years of law school, after which they will spend a year completing the MPH program in the College of Public Health. Students will have the ability to choose whichever concentration within the College that best meets their interests and needs and which they are formally accepted to by the College and Department. After completing their MPH, students will return to Stetson to complete their JD and prepare for the bar exam. The virtue of this study plan is that students will commence MPH study with a sound foundation in law and legal process, and students will complete the elective USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Public Health (MSPH) / Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) 551 portion of their legal study with a sound foundation in public health.

Specific program requirement s include the following: ARH 6798 Contemporary Thought 4 (20th Century Art History or its equivalent is a prerequisite to ARH 6798 Contemporary Thought.) ART 6890 Graduate SeminarI 3 (first semester) ART 6891 Graduate Seminar II 3 (second semester) ART 6999 Professional Practices 3 ARH 6798 Seminar in Art History 4 ARH 6897 Critical Writing Seminar 3 ART 6956 M.F.A. Research Project 2 ART 5000 and 6000 Studio and Discretionary Electives - 38 credits (3 hours of electives must be taken from a program other than the School of Art and Art History - 4000 level coursework may be used to satisfy this requirement) ART 6937 Graduate Instructor Methods 2 (This course is an elective option for students who have not worked as a Teaching Assistant. M.F.A. total course requirements 60 credits 20 th Century Art History is a pr erequisite to admission to the graduate program. It may be taken during the first year of graduate school but will not count as part of the 60 credit requirement. *All M.F.A. students must take at least one course in non-western art or thought. This course can be taken as an art history course or through another department offering such an emphasis. Course work taken as undergraduate studies in non-western art may substitute but only at the discretion of the Art Faculty. The rest of the program is discretionary and can be planned with the advice of the Graduate Art Advisor in its initial stages. After faculty acceptance of the student's proposed final MFA project, a Supervisory Committee will be selected and serve in an advisory capacity with the student for planning the rest of their program. Transfer Credits. Requests for use of transfer credits or credits earned as a non-degree seeking student should be made when the student applie s to the graduate program. The faculty will decide at the time of admission whether or not such credits will be used toward the MFA degree. Transfer credit is limited to 8 hours. S-U GRADES A Student may not take any course work for a grade of \"S/U\" until they have elected a supervisory committee, usually by the fourth semester. All course work taken during the first three semester s must be taken in course work assigning letter grades th at designate qua lity points. Appropriate contract numbers would include graduate level studios such as Sculpture or Painting, and ART 5910 for an area in which a graduate student did not have prior skill, or ART 6940 for studies in an area where prior skill exists but the student requires variable credit or the research does not confor m to clear categorization by discipline. ART 6907 Independent Study, and ART 6911 Directed Research offer only the S/U grading option and are not to be used until after the student has elected a supervisory committee. FACULTY EVALUATIONS AT THE END OF 1ST, 2ND and 3rd SEMESTER At the end of the first, second and third semester, students will receive a written evaluation from a faculty member with whom they are registered in a directed study contract. Students will receive this evaluation from the directed study faculty member no later than 1 week following critiques and reviews. This will indicate whether or not the student is doing satisfactory work, and will give a brief appraisal of the student's strengths and suggestions for improvement . These evaluations are based on faculty consensus, and are not necessarily in accord with grades from individual instructors. Students will receive a S/U grade after their first year in the program and after their 3rd semester in the second year. A student receiving two \"unsatisfactory\" grades after the first year and third semester evaluations will be dropped from the program. To continue, the student would need to reapply. Graduate students are requested to delay registration for courses for future semesters unt il after they receive their evaluation. This will enable students to consider any special faculty directives c oncerning individual needs and courses of study. It will be the students responsibility to follow through with directives given by the faculty. 1ST YEAR STUDENT FACULTY CRITIQUES Students are required to present their work in a faculty critique at the end of the fall and spring semesters of their 1st year. Faculty critique participation will be assigned by the MFA Coordinator (one dire cted study faculty and the rest non-directed study, 4 total); voluntary non-participatory attendance by fa culty is allowed; directed study faculty will discuss critique criteria with students before the critique; dir ected study faculty will discuss critique results with students in a timely manner after the critiques. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Art History (M.A.) 561 2nd YEAR STUDENT REVIEW BY FACULTY COMMITTEE In their third semester, students will receive a formal review by a 3 person faculty committee (including 1 directed study faculty). The review committee will be appointed by the M.F.A. Coor dinator in consultation with the faculty. The second year review will help the student assess his/ her progress and begin to articulate the terms of th e final project proposal. Directed study faculty will write the evaluation and meet with the student after the review in a timely manner. M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSALS During the fourth semester of a student's program, (s)he will give a 20 minute (maximum) presentation of a proposal for a M.F.A. Research Project. This will be followed by 10 minutes of questions from the faculty. The proposal must include a one page paper that is distributed to the faculty no less than 3 days before the proposal. The student must present a body of work supporting the student's proposed direction. The proposal should be clear, articulate and grounded in past work. It is understood that the proposal is provisional and that changes will occur in the development of the ideas and work. Students are required to meet with their directed study faculty to discuss proj ect proposal preparation. Students are discouraged from soliciting non-directed study faculty to discuss their proposals. Project proposal presentations will occur during the 11th or 12th week of the spring term and will be scheduled by the M.F.A. Coordinator. All faculty are required to attend. The student's presen tation may be in slide or digital format and will be delivered in a formal lecture setting. The faculty will discuss each student after the presentations have concluded and will decide by a simple majority vote whether or not the proposal is satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The student's directed study faculty member will notify the student of the results shortly after the faculty vote. Faculty comments will be submitted to the student in a written report prepared by the directed study faculty member. If a student's proposal is accepted, (s)he will select a graduate supervisory committee to oversee the realization of the research project. If a student's project proposal is not accepted during the fourth semester of his/her program, another proposal can be presented before the beginning of the following term. A faculty ad hoc advisory committee may be formed in the event the student receives an unsatisfactory vote. This committee will meet with the student to better prepare the student for the re-proposal. The ad hoc committee is not guaranteed and will be formed only if faculty members volunteer to participate on this committee. Students receiving 2 unsatisfactory votes after the Project Proposal and Re-proposal will be dismissed from the program. GRADUATE SUPERVISORY COMMITTEES The Graduate Supervisory Committee consists of a chairperson and two members from the School of Art and Art History Faculty. Faculty Supervisory Committees MUST be formed by the last Friday of classes for the semester during which the M.F.A. Project Proposal is approved by the f aculty. Students usually ask three studio art faculty members to be on their committee, selecting one as chair; faculty members accept at their discretion. All studio faculty are limited to 3 supervisory committees and can serve as chair on no more than 2 committees. Students may have Art History faculty members as members of their committee. Students may also have faculty members from other departments/colleges on thei r committee but as fourth members only. The role of the Committee Chair is as follows: logistical and procedural organization, carry ART 6956 Research Project credits with the student, scheduling the exhibition, monitor student ac tivity including maintaining active studio usage, submit an exhibition approval form. Graduate Student Supervis ory Committee Appointment (GSSCA) forms must be downloaded. The student will first secure the committee faculty signatures and then submit the GSSCA to the M.F.A. Coordinator. The M.F.A. Coordinator will sign th e form and send it to the Associate Dean of the College for signature. Once all the signatures are secured, the GSSCA will be sent to the M.F.A. Coordinator and kept as part of the student's file. The M.F.A. Students not complying with the above will have a \"hold\" placed on their records and not be able to register for classes in the subsequent semester or schedule their exhibitions. See Addendum VII to download the Graduate Stude nt Supervisory Committee Appointment Form. Any conflicts between the student and their committee that cannot be resolved by mutual agreement between the committee and the student should be then taken to the M.F.A. Coordinator for re view and recommendations. CRITICAL WRITING SEMINAR In the Fall of the third year, M.F.A. candidates are required to take ART 6897 Critical Writing Seminar for three credits. The intent is to ground the student in critical/analytical methodology, to identify the student's place within the broader critical discourse and to prepare the student for a cogent, articulate written documentation of his or her M.F.A. exhibition. USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Art History (M.A.) 562 M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT EXHIBITION/ORALS/WRITTEN DOCUMENT The exhibition, written document and the orals conclude the student's graduate program and take place after all course work is completed. The exhibition is usually during the term the student plans to graduate, typically the second semester of the third year. M.F.A. Research Project exhibitions cannot be scheduled for the summer term. Exhibition M.F.A. exhibitions are sche duled after the supervisory committee chair signs the exhibition approval form. Signed exhibition approval forms are to be submitted to the M.F.A. Coordinator no later than the 11th week of the semester preceding the student's exhibition. Orals Orals are required of all students. These are held during the exhibition period, normally on Friday afternoons. It is the student's responsibility to select three questioners for his/her orals. These are normally drawn from the faculty. Any non-art faculty questioner must have the approval of the student's committee. Faculty who have agreed to serve as questioners for the orals should receive a copy of the paper two weeks (14 days) before the scheduled orals. Orals are open to the public. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by the student's Graduate S upervisory Committee. Research Project Paper The School requires a written non-thesis research project paper in the belief that such a document helps the student organize and refine his or her thinking about the work (s)he is producing, and facili tates the process of forming and articulating ideas about art in general. The paper is also meant to provide others with access to the ideas which generate the artwork. Research Project Paper templates will be used by all students as a basic guideline for the structure of the paper. An M.F.A. candidate may choose to complete a formal th esis paper rather than the non-thesis research project paper. Any student wishing to do so must notify his/her committee of the intent upon formation of the committee, and will be responsible for adhering to all applicable deadlines and standards established by the USF Graduate Studies Program. Completion of the M.F. A. Research Project Immediately after the orals, the student's Graduate Supervisory Committee meets with the questioners to make a final recommendation on acceptance of the paper, the work and the oral presentation. If these are orally approved, the student is informed of acceptance. If the committee feels it cannot approve some part of the student's presentation, it will confer with the student at once and notify the student what clarifications and alterations need to be made to the exhibition or research project paper. Once the committee accepts the research project, the student must submit documentation of the exhibition and paper to the M.F.A. Coordinator for format check. The M.F.A. Research Project documentation includes the ETD (electronic thesis/dissertation) and the LRC Archive (exhibition documentation). Once the documentation is format checked by the M.F.A. Coordinator, the student must secure a Certificate of Approval signed by the supervisory committee. Those students who do not submit the ETD, LRC exhibition documentation and Certificate of Approval will be put on an administrative hold. This hold will prevent student transcri pts from being issued.

ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practical strategies to produce changes in socially significant behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of i ndividuals; b) it studies environmental influences upon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon single-subject research designs to analyze the effect s of different environmental variables. The 42-credit-hour master's degree in ABA is interdisciplinary and is housed in Graduate School. It provides coursework and practical supervision across three colleges (the School of Mental Health Studies in the Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Education). This interdisciplinary program links courses from a number of university departments to create a comprehensive, cohesive degree program. Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behavioral analysis skills through supervised practicum experien ces, and complete a data based thesis. The master's degree program is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAS). It will assist in their preparation for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for competent professionals with expertise in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA program, these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursework and practicum experiences. The curriculum requires applicat ion of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. In the USF program, students participate in practicum training in community agencies under the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 10-25 hours of behavior analysis practice they comple te in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semester. In these seminars, the Practicum Coordinator discusses impor tant practice issues and facilitates student discussion of their applied work. In the USF program, the supervision of the students' research theses rests in the hands of designated core faculty members (i.e., \"major professors.\"). Major professors serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising their research and their progress through the program. Therefore, as students are mentored by their major professors during the program, a meaningful major professor-student relati onship is essential. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools. ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University re quirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Three letters of reference from professors and/or employers who know the applicant well USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 App lied Behavior Analysis (M.A.) 580 Current resume or curriculum vitae One-page narrative describing the applicants interest in Applied Behavior Analysis and in the Master's Program in Applied Behavior Analysis at USF. GRE Scores on the general subtests Specific Procedures The primary assumption underlying admission to the M.A. program is that every student accepted is capable (a) of successfully completing his or her respective program and (b) of performing competently in the field as an Applied Behavior Analyst. Applicants are selected based on their potential to benefit from the program and their potential to contribute both to the Program and the field of Applied Behavior Analysis. Within the admissions process, a culturally diverse student body is actively recr uited, and applicants of academic and professional promise are not systematically excluded on the basis of race, ethnic origin, gender, age, religion, lifestyle, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. The admissions pr ocess is selective, but flexible--all pertinent data submitted for consideration will be evaluated as an entire package. The evaluation process, however, does i nvolve both academic and interpersonal considerations . The profession of Applied Behavior Analysis requires th at the practitioner possess personal characteristics as well as academic and technical competencies, and the admissions process attempts to evaluate both these areas. Admission to the program is based on past academic work; a resume outlining relevant work, volunteer, and extracurricular experience in applied behavior analysis; letters of recommendation; and a statement of professional goals. Students may apply, after conferral or anticipated conferral of their Bachelor's degree. Applications should be submitted by March 15 to be considered for application in the following fall term. Late applications ill be considered if space in the program is available. For further Admissions Info rmation, please visit Graduate Admissions. After interviews, a decision about each applicant's candidacy is made by the Program Director based on the strength of the applicant's record and his/her: a) Career goals and their compatibility with those of the program b) Potential for successful completion of the program c) Sensitivity to the needs of potential client populations d) Interpersonal skills e) Communication skills, both oral and written f) NOTE: If geographical constr aints prohibit a personal interview, the applicant may be granted a telephone interview at the discretion of the Program Director . The Program Director, of course, re serves the right to contact all references identified by the candidate.

USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 25 Graduate Courses 586 Section 25 Graduate Course Information To view the Course Listing with Co urse Descriptions, see Section 26. Courses offered for credit by the University of South Florida ar e listed with the program or college that offers them. The firs t line of each description includes the State Common Course pref ix and number (see below), title of the course, and number of credits. Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System. This common numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institu tions in Florida and by participating non- public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutio ns. Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and c ontent of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the leve l at which students normally take the course. C ourse prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty disc ipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institu tion and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with their gene ric titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course details.\" Courses are created using the State Coursewide Numbering Sy stem (SCNS). The following information is from the SCNS Handbook. For more informatio n visit their website at: http://scns.fldoe.org/scns/public/pb_index.jsp# The SCNS uses a course designation which consists of a three-letter prefix and a four digit number and, when necessary, a one-letter laboratory (L) or le cture/laboratory (C) suffix. Example: SCNS COURSE ID AML 6 Laboratory Content Suffix Explanation: AML 6017, Studies in American Literature to 1860 American Studies course taught at the graduate level (no lab). A level code, which roughly corresponds to th e year in college the course is normally taken (i.e., masters, doctoral, etc.), is placed between the course prefix and the course number. Th e level is recommended by the institution according to its own policies and the policies of the State of Florida, and approved by the faculty committee. The level digit does not affect course equivalency - course equivalency is determined by the prefix and the last three digits . The following are the level definitions: 0 Upper-level undergraduate 5-9 Graduate and Professional Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by depart ment or program. This means th at a single program may have courses in several different disciplines and may cons ist of courses having several different prefixes.

Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code (first digit) Century Digit (second digit) Decade Digit (third digit) Unit Digit (fourth digit) Lab Code SYG 1 0 1 0 Sociology, General Freshman Level at this institution Entry-level General Sociology Survey Course Social Problems No lab in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course numbe r and are guaranteed to be transferable between participati ng institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions. (Exceptions are listed below.) For example, a survey course in social problems is offered by 34 different postsec ondary institutions. E ach institution uses \"SYG_010\" to identify its social problems course. The level code is the first di git and represents the year in which students USF Graduate Catalog 2008-2009 Section 25 Graduate Courses 588 normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"SYG\" means \"Sociology, General,\" the century Sociology,\" the decade digit \"1\" represents Course,\" and the unit digit \"0\" represents \"Social Problems.\" In science and other areas, a \"C \" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course. The \"L\" represents a laboratory c ourse or the laboratory part of a course, having the same prefix and course number without a lab indicator, which may meet at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one instituti on to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institu tion. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and las t three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institu tions. For example, SYG 1010 is offered at a community college while the same course is offered at a state university as SYG 2010. A student who has su ccessfully completed SYG 1010 at the community college is guaranteed to receive transfer cred it for SYG 2010 at the state university upon transfer. The student cannot be required to take SYG 2010 again since SYG 1010 is equi valent to SYG 2010. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent c ourses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements on the same basis as credit awarded to the nativ e students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution to offer transfer credit for courses successfully comple ted which have not been designated as equivalent. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major di vision of an academic disciplin e, subject matter area, or sub- category of knowledge. The prefix is not in tended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the prefix designation. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses State Board of Education Rule 6A-10.024( 19), Florida Administrative Code, reads: When a student transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that partic ipate in the common course designation and numbering system, the receiving institution shall award credit for courses satisfactorily completed at the previous participating institutions when the courses are judged by th e appropriate common course de signation and numbering system faculty task forces to be academically equivalent to course s offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic contro l of the previous institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the course numbering sy stem. Credits so awarded shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for cour se equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution: Courses in the 900-999 series(e.g., HUM 2905) Internships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad courses Performance or studio courses in Ar t, Dance, Theater, and Music Skills courses in Criminal Justice Graduate courses Courses not offered by the receiving institution College preparatory and vocational prep aratory course may not be used to meet degree requirements and are not transferable.
