The [State of Colorado is in Phase 1 (1A and first half of 1B) of its vaccine distribution plan](https://covid19.colorado.gov/for-coloradans/vaccine/vaccine-for-coloradans), and supply remains limited. One way to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine may be through UCHealth. Make sure you have a My Health Connection account, or set one up today, using the gold button below. This step ensures you are set up for email notification of vaccination options when available through the UCHealth system. You can find information on [how to access vaccines through other providers here](https://covid19.colorado.gov/for-coloradans/vaccine/where-can-i-get-vaccinated). Remember, [on-campus safety and screening protocols](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/coronavirus#rtc) remain in place, even for those who have been vaccinated. We all must continue to wear masks, keep our distance, stay home when sick, and [self-report](eb06d1e5-3028-64d9-a5bf-ff0a001ce385) our status if symptomatic, test positive or may have been exposed as the vaccination process unfolds. New and returning students are invited to a virtual town hall on Monday, February 1, from 12 to 1 p.m. co-sponsored by CU Anschutz Student Senate and CU Anschutz Student Affairs. Campus leaders will discuss the current state of the virus, the university's response to COVID-19 and the work being done to keep our campus community safe. An interactive Q&A will follow. [This week, we announced](https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-resource-to-support-faculty-and-staff-well-being) the launch of YOU@CU Anschutz for faculty and staff. This online wellness platform has been available to students for some time, and we are now able to offer personalized content to our entire campus community. Log in to the confidential site and create your profile. There, you will find customizable tools and resources on mental health, stress management, relationship support, career growth, work-life balance and more. Additional [mental health and wellness resources](3bdfd7e5-3028-64d9-a5bf-ff0a001ce385) are available to our campus community. Annual evaluation meetings for faculty and university staff are taking place through the month of February, offering supervisors and employees the opportunity to review performance for the period that ended December 31, 2020. While evaluation meetings are typically conducted in person, this year's meetings must be conducted via Zoom or another virtual platform to align with our [current campus operational status and safety protocols](/coronavirus). As with all campus activity, anything that can be done remotely should continue to be done remotely. Employees cannot be required to come to campus for an evaluation meeting. In the rare instances in which both faculty or staff member and supervisor are already approved for on-campus work activity, in-person evaluation sessions may be considered.

The Colorado School of Public Health launched a new dashboard that tracks status and risk factors of COVID-19 at the county level. The [Colorado Population Data Dashboard](https://www.colorado-data.org/) gives Colorado communities and the general public a clearer picture of the pandemic's impact locally, and the new resource is designed to help inform decisions about protecting public health.
