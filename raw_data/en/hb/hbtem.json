A widespread perception, in Britain and some other countries, is that autism has been on the rise since the early 1990s and that the surge has been triggered by the single-shot MMR vaccine (aimed at measles, mumps and rubella). The study in the journal, [Archives of Disease in Childhood](http://adc.bmjjournals.com/), said there was indeed a statistical rise in autism in the 1990s. But it found this was probably because doctors became better at diagnosing the condition, and parents became more willing to accept it than in the past, when the disorder was little known and a social taboo. It also shot down notions that the MMR vaccine was to blame for a new form of 'regressive autism', possibly connected with bowel problems. \"The claims that MMR vaccine is involved in the initiation of autism, and/or with regression, and/or with bowel problems associated with autism are not associated with any credible scientific evidence,\" wrote Professor Brent Taylor of London's [Royal Free and University College Medical School](http://www.rfc.ucl.ac.uk/) and colleagues. Driving the nail home, he added: \"There is compelling and increasing evidence showing no association.\" The findings were based on follow-up research of 567 London children born with autism between 1979 and 1998. It determined that the number of new cases rose between 1979 and 1992 and then levelled out from 1992 to 1996, reaching a plateau of around 2.6 cases for every 1,000 live births. In contrast, the number of parents who blamed the MMR vaccine for their child's autism shot up after a controversial research paper, in August 1997, linked the jab with bowel disease and what it described as a 'new variant' of regressive autism. The MMR jab was introduced in October 1998. Before the research paper was issued, it was cited as a trigger in two out of 46 cases; afterwards, it was cited in six out of 30 cases. Autism is a developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life, resulting from a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain. But whether the cause is genetic or environmental is unknown. Autism and associated behaviors have been estimated to occur in two to six of every 1,000 individuals. Males are four times more likely to have autism than females. "}
