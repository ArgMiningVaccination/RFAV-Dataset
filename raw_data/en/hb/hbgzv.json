When it comes to weight loss the subject is complex and subjective......and we need to look into adrenal function, thyroid evaluation, food allergies, malabsorption, emotional eating, trauma, nutritional status and more. We know that when insulin is high is almost impossible to lose weight. That is why the first step is to recommend a mental diet which is RELAXATION as that reduces the stress hormones. To help lose weight we address the regulation of insulin, leptin, glucagon. Insulin resistance is implicated in weight gain, irritability, belly fat, amyloids (stroke, Alzheimer). Insulin resistance has been correlated with trauma event. The bottom line, hormones tell your body to store fat with insulin and regulate glucose low to keep low insulin. Insulin resistance blocks the branched amino acids to be pulled in the cells. How about leptin resistance? Leptin is responsible for weight, appetite and metabolism. How about cortisol? Cortisol is belly fat hormone made outside of adrenal gland. Then how do we lower cortisol naturally? With sun (vitamin D3) sleep (increases growth hormone and increase insulin like growth factor), walking, acupressure, increase potassium (supports parasympathetic) and through nutritional yeast in kefir, apple cider (vit B1). How about thyroid resistance? My favorite nutrients to nourish thyroid are: L- Thyrosine, Ashwaganda, Zinc, Iodine, Selenium. How can you reduce abdominal fat and insulin sensitivity? HGH stimulation through diet can be accomplished through amino acids like Lysine (1000 mg/day), Glutamine (6,000 mg/day) Arginine/ Ornitine (2000 mg a day) and Glycine. HGH (human growth hormone) is associated with muscle building, bone density, deeper sleep and our body produces less and less as we age. Excess insulin was found in low hCG. Great results have been reported with CLA (safflower oil): Conjugated Linoleic Acid 4,000 mg/day for at least 12 weeks anti-obesity and reduces appetite, increases energy metabolism, increases fat breakdown, reduces insulin resistance, anti-diabetic, reduces inflammation. Over all to manage weight naturally: reduce stress, sleep longer, exercise, and proper nutrients. Some micronutrient have been found to fight insulin resistance and weight gain. Here are few: Cinnamon bark, Camelia leaf, Rebes nigrum leaf, Aloe vera, Gymmena Sylvester, and Fermented Red Ginseng. "}
