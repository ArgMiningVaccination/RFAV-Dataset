Kewish, MD This is a case report of an occurrence of shingles (herpes zoster [HZ]) following auricular acu- puncture. The patient developed acute reactivation HZ in the V1 distribution of the right trigeminalnerve involving the forehead, scalp, and medial upper eyelid 13 days after being treated with au-ricular acupuncture for chronic low-back pain. The lesions were initially painless, but they clus-tered and became painful within 2 days. The patient was treated with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg, 3times daily for 7 days, and ibuprofen as needed. The lesions resolved without sequelae.(J AmBoard Fam Med 2017;30:552-555.) Keywords: Pain, Trigeminal Nerve, Valacyclovir A 53-year-old male patient sought treatment for chronic low-back pain through auricular acupunc-ture. A standard \"battleeld acupuncture\" tech-nique was applied to reduce pain (Figure 1). Thistechnique calls for the use of 5 semipermanentneedles applied to specic points on 1 or both ears.The patient recalls the initial Aiguille Semi-Perma-nente (ASP) needle, placed at the base of the rightintertragic notch (labeled \"cingulate gyrus\" in Fig-ure 1), causing a shocklike sensation. AdditionalASP needles were placed bilaterally at the left cin-gulate gyrus and at the midantitragus (labeled\"thalamus\" in Figure 1). None of the subsequent needles caused the same shocklike sensation. Thesewere the only ASP needles used, and they remainedin place for 48 hours, after which they became looseand fell out. The treatment succeeded in relievingthe patient's low-back pain for about 10 days. Ap-proximately 12 days after the acupuncture session,the patient reported that he began feeling mildmalaise, which he treated with rest. The followingmorning he awoke and noticed an area of redness just below the hairline on the right forehead. As theday progressed the area became larger, and by theend of the day, a small cluster of vesicles had ap-peared. The next morning a second cluster devel-oped, beginning above the hairline on the right andextending down in a narrow broken line toward themedial right eyebrow and terminating near the me-dial canthus (Figure 2). Neither of these were ini-tially painful but \"tingling\" was noted. The patientvisited his family physician, who diagnosed himwith shingles in the V1 distribution of the trigem-inal nerve. The patient was subsequently evaluatedby an ophthalmologist, who found no ocular in-volvement. This patient had a history of chicken pox at age 10, no history of herpes zoster (HZ), and had neverreceived Zostavax or a detailedhistory and physical examination of this patientrevealed no signicant acute or chronic medicalconditions, and no other issues predisposing to thedevelopment of shingles. Standard treatment for HZ was initiated with valacyclovir, and symptoms were managed withoral ibuprofen. The patient's symptoms resolvedwithout complication and, at the time of this writ-ing, had not returned.

Downloaded from puncture has not, to my knowledge, previously been described as being associated with HZ reac-tivation. Numerous other potential side effects areknown; however, only 1 primary source documentwas located showing an association between acu-puncture and herpes. 1-3A literature review noted several cases of trauma-induced trigeminal nervezoster, but none were specically associated withauricular acupuncture 1-3). Discussion After acute varicella zoster infection, the virusmigrates up sensory axons and becomes latent inregional ganglia or nuclei, where it remains dor-mant, often for years. Trigeminal nerve nucleiand thoracic spinal ganglia are the most com-monly affected. Under certain conditions, thevirus reactivates and travels to the dermatomecorresponding to its nucleus or ganglion, pro-ducing the typical painful, vesicular rash of shin-gles. Recurrence can happen at different ages andin different locations in the same person. Typi-cally, however, subsequent cases are progres-sively less common. Precipitating factors forshingles include stress, trauma, chronic disease,systemic illness, and immune disorders, amongothers. 2,3Reactivation is also influenced by the age-related waning of immunologic response bythe host to the virus, prompting the recommen-dation for shingles vaccination. While Zostavaxis approved by the FDA for use in patients aged50 years and older, the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention recommend routine vaccina-tion starting at age 60, largely because of thelimited vaccine supply and a lower incidence ofpostherpetic neuralgia among people in their 50s(based on the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention and Advisory Committee of Immuni-zation Practices 2014 guidelines). Acupuncture is a procedure that represents a minor trauma. Physical trauma and surgical proce-dures are known to precipitate HZ eruptions, in-cluding in cranial nerve distributions. 4- 7A case-con - trol study in 2012 noted an increased proportion oftrauma in HZ cases compared with controls in any ofthe 52 weeks before the onset of symptoms; thegreatest proportion occurred in the rst week. Inaddition, patients diagnosed with cranial HZ were/H1102225 times as likely as controls to have had cranialtrauma during the week before HZ onset. 8A case- control study by Thomas et al4in 2004 concluded that recent trauma was associated with an adjusted12-fold increase in the risk of developing HZ atthe site of the trauma within 1 month. Mecha-nisms by which trauma might reactivate the zos-ter virus are not specically known, but stimula-Figure 1. Approximate needle insertion sites forBattleeld Acupuncture. Figure 2.

The literature suggests that outbreaks are most likelyto occur within the rst month after the insult.Although cause and effect cannot be proven inthis case, the timing, mechanism, and proximityto the acupuncture \"trauma\" are compelling. Theproposed explanation for triggering the onset ofreactivation HZ in this patient is stimulation ofthe trigeminal nuclei, perhaps via a branch of theauriculotemporal nerve, secondary to the acu-puncture (Figure 3). Recommendations HZ is a painful disease process with potential forsignicant morbidity. Auricular acupuncture is be-coming more widely used in outpatient settingsbecause of its quick and easy application, effective-ness, and presumed safety. In the military, battleeld acupuncture describes a limited auricular acupuncture technique used to treat pain, and this technique iscommon 9(Figure 1). The 2 most common compli - cations of acupuncture are pneumothorax and hepa-titis. When counseling susceptible individuals, shin-gles should be considered as an additional, yet lesscommon, risk of this procedure. Verbal screening fora history of varicella or shingles, monitoring aftertreatment, and perhaps applying prophylaxis for at-risk populations should considered.
