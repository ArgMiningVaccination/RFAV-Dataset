Religion: About ofpopulation Roman Catholic, census. Protestants (about 6percent) ranked second. Number ofProtestants hasincreased dramatically since 1960s, especially insouthern states. Economy Overview: From acolonial economy based largely onmining, especially silver, inthetwentieth century, theeconomy has diversified toinclude strong agriculture, petroleum, and industry sectors. Strong growth from 1940-80 interrupted by series ofeconomic crises, caused inpartbymassive overborrowing. byinflation ofcontinued deficit andovervalued exchange rate in1994financed bysaleofshort-term bonds andforeign- exchange reserves. Series ofpolitical shocks anddevaluation of newpeso inlate1994caused investor panic. Inflation soared, andmassive foreign intervention wasrequired tostabilize situation. Although overall economy remains fundamentally strong, lackofconfidence makes short-term prospects for strong growth unlikely. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Estimated atUS$370 billion in1994; approximately US$4,100 percapita. Relatively stable throughout most oftwentieth century, thepeso(Mex$) began to depreciate rapidly during economic crisis consumption corn, beans, wheat, and rice.

Industry: Mining, manufacturing, andconstruction contributed largely inindustrial triangle ofMexico City,Monterrey, andGuadalajara. Most industrial goods produced, including automobiles, consumer goods, steel,and petrochemicals. World's sixth largest producer ofpetroleum andmajor producer ofnonfuel Energy: More than120billion kilowatt-hours produced 1993, about 75percent from thermal (mostly oil-burning) plants, 20percent from hydroelectric, proven reserves. Exports: US$60.8 billion in1994.

When severe recession hitin1982,government declared moratorium ondebtpayments, precipitating international economic crisis. Austerity measures andrenegotiation ofthe debteased crisis, butin1995debtstood atUS$158.2 billion. Balance ofPayments: Large trade deficits from 1989 to1993 pushed current account deeply into deficit. Dramatic improvement intrade balance in1994and1995, however, nearly eliminated deficit. Heavy international borrowing allowed international reserves torisetoUS$15.7 billion atend of1995. Fiscal Year: Calendar Roads: ofroads linking allareas. More than 240,000 kilometers ofroads, ofwhich 85,000 paved (more than 3,100 kilometers expressway). Heaviest concentration in central Mexico.

Personnel assigned toairforce alsowithin command structure of Secretariat ofNational Defense, distributed among airbase installations throughout country. Principal airbase, Military AirBaseNumber 1,located atSanta Lucia instateofMexico. installations located ineach coastal state.

Following initial reports forthekilling, additional involving onthePRIpresidential ticket byhis campaign manager andformer education Zedillo Ponce deLeon.ThePRIonce again faced acompeti- tiveelection, withthemain opposition the PRI's dubious political party (surpassing even theCommunist Party oftheformer Soviet Union). Although Zedillo waselected tothepresidency took office, when evidence wasuncovered linking former president Salinas's brother, Raul, totheRuizMassieu murder. The firstmonth oftheZedillo administration coincided with adramatic financial crisis thatdealt asevere setback to Mexico's economic recovery efforts. The crisis wasrooted in Mexico's accumulation ofadangerously highcurrent-account deficit from theMexi- canstockandbond markets, and asinterest rates rose inthe United States, theMexican government became increasingly dependent onshort-term, high-yield instruments toattract scarce capital. Following theRuizMassieu assassination, Mexican investors withdrew largeamounts ofcapital from theMexican theUnited States provided assistance to Mexico intheform ofaUS$20 billion emergency debt relief package. Theconcession bytheUnited States of anemergency loan andtheZedillo administration, witheach other formishandling Shortly JoseFrancisco Ruiz Massieu, themotives behind the killing remained unanswered. Questions about theassassina- tionincreased when, inNovember 1994, Mario Ruiz Massieu, Mexico's ofJose ofthemur- hisinvestigation efforts.

Hewasplaced under house arrest, andpro- ceedings fordeportation began. Investigations ofMario Ruiz Massieu's finances revealed aUS$9 million bank account in Houston.

While Gutierrez Rebollo aggressively prosecuted Mexican drug cartels inhistenweeks inoffice, heallegedly protected theCiudad Juarez trafficking were particularly embarrassing totheMexican military, longconsidered theoneinstitution in Mexico largely untouched bycorruption. Thatassumption was again challenged when, inMarch 1997, Brigadier tocleanupthescandal-ridden National Institute toCombat Drugs, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar named Mariano Federico Herran Salvatti astheinstitute's new head. Herran hadpreviously served liedetector testsbefore being offered theposition.
