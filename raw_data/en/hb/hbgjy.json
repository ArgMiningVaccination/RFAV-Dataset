After finishing high school, he obtained his MD from the University of Groningen in 1998. Between 1998 and 2004 he did his residency psychiatry at Lentis mental health care, Groningen. His clinical instructor, Frits Milders, accepted his proposal for a final scientific presentation on the use of, and evidence for, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Frits also supported Rogier to do a written inquiry into the use of CAM by psychiatric outpatients. The results were published in the Dutch Journal for Psychiatry (Hoenders et al., 2006). Rogier got appointed as a psychiatrist in Winschoten in 2005. Inspired by two international conferences on integrative medicine (in Verbania, Italy and Colombo, Sri Lanka), the foundation of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM) in the USA, the publication of David Servan-Schreiber's book \"Without Freud or Prozac\", and also because of his own interest in different healing traditions, Rogier initiated the first Dutch congress on integrative psychiatry ('The Best of Both Worlds') in 2006, together with six colleagues. More than 1200 people participated in this first conference (including almost 10% of all Dutch psychiatrists). Since then, he has chaired the organizing committee of five consecutive congresses on integrative psychiatry. The committee now prepares for the sixth (www.congressintegratedpsychiatry.com). Rogier started an outpatient center for integrative psychiatry with two employees in the fall of 2006. This center has now expanded to 25 employees and 500 outpatients. In 2010 Rogier co-founded the International Network for Integrative Mental Health (INIMH; www.inimh.org). Today, Rogier works as a psychiatrist, clinical instructor psychiatry, researcher and head of the Center for Integrative Psychiatry and the Berkenhof of Lentis. He is a board member of INIMH. He is on the advisory board of the Lama Gangchen International Global Peace Foundation (LGIGPF), the Netherlands. He is married and lives in Zuidlaren, the Netherlands. When he is not working, he spents his time traveling, meditating, reading, running and singing. Every year, together with his wife and friends, he goes to the Borobudur for a meditation retreat. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001212 Hoenders Integrative Psychiatry Rogier Hoenders The contents of this thesis Despite important progress in psychiatry not all patients respond well to available treatments. There are also concerns about increasing costs and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, which seems threatened by managed care, focus on protocols, and a tendency to reductionism, narrowing the view to diseases or symptoms and losing sight of the whole person in his or her context. 'Integrative medicine' is a new concept in health care defined as: 'the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing'. Integrative medicine may provide some solutions to the problems raised. However, there is a paucity of research on the application of integrative medicine in mental health care ('integrative psychiatry'). We explored the conceptual foundation of integrative psychiatry in the first part of this thesis. The second part is about its implementation in Dutch mental health care. Taking into account the Dutch law, jurisprudence, rules of professional bodies, and scientific research, we wrote a treatment protocol for the judicious application of complementary medicine in conventional mental health care. In the third part we assessed evidence for the effectiveness of integrative psychiatry and some selected complementary medicines and lifestyle changes. In the discussion we respond to criticism and offer suggestions for future research. "}
