Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all the community members who joined us in this important work. During December 2017 and January 2018 members of the community were asked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. Winner Regional in partnership with Sanford Health, further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and collaborated with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise were also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. WRH has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Children and Youth Healthcare and Wellness The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. The asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the action steps planned to address each identified need. At Winner Regional Health, patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not-for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Kevin Coffey Chief Executive Officer Winner Regional Health 3 Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining not-for- profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify not-for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology The following report includes non-generalizable survey results from an online survey of community leaders and key stakeholders identified by Winner Regional Health. This study was conducted through a partnership between the Community Health Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. Members of the Community Health Collaborative distributed the survey link via e-mail to stakeholders and key leaders, located within various agencies in the community, and asked them to complete the online survey. Therefore, it is important to note that the data in this report are not generalizable to the community. 1. Primary Research Stakeholder Survey: an online survey was conducted with identified community key stakeholders. The study concentrated on the stakeholder's concerns for the community specific to economic well-being, transportation, children and youth, the aging population, safety, health care and wellness, mental health and substance abuse. The study was conducted through a partnership between Sanford Health, and the Center for Social Research 5 (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. Sanford Health distributed the survey link via email to stakeholders and key leaders in Tripp County. Data collection occurred during December 2017 and January 2018. A total of 7 community stakeholders participated in the survey. Resident Survey: the resident survey tool includes questions about the respondent's personal health. An online survey was developed in partnership with public health experts from across the Sanford footprint. The Minnesota Health Department reviewed and advised Sanford about key questions that they request of the SHIP surveys and those questions were included in the resident survey. Questions specific to American Indian residents were developed by the North Dakota Public Health Association. The survey was posted on Facebook and a link to the survey was published in the local newspaper. A total of 35 community residents participated in the survey. Community Asset Mapping: asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise followed with key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. Community Stakeholder Discussions: community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA research. Facilitated discussion commenced and each participant was asked to consider his or her top two or three priorities that should be further developed into implementation strategies. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. Prioritization Process: the primary and secondary research data was analyzed to develop the top unmet needs. The analyzed list of needs was developed into a worksheet. A multi-voting methodology from the American Society for Quality was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. Key community stakeholders met with medical center leaders to complete the multi- voting exercise. 2. Secondary Research A. The 2018 County Health Rankings were reviewed and included in the report and in the asset mapping process. B. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates were reviewed. C. Community Commons were reviewed and specific data sets were considered. Key Findings - Primary Research Key findings are based on the non-generalizable survey data, with indicators ranked on a 1-5 Likert scale, with 5 being of highest concern. Survey results ranking 3.5 or higher are considered to high-ranking concerns. 1. Economics: Cost of affordable housing was the highest ranked economic concern at 4.00. Skilled labor workforce and employment options were also top concerns at 3.29 and 3.0 respectively. 2. Children and Youth: Childhood obesity ranks highest of the concerns for children and youth with a ranking of 2.86. Other top concerns were availability of education about birth control (2.8) and teen pregnancy (2.8). 6 3. Health Care and Wellness: Access to affordable prescription drugs was of highest concern to survey respondents at 3.33. Access to affordable health insurance coverage and access to affordable health care were other key concerns ranking at 3.29 each. 4. Aging Population: At 2.80, the cost of in-home services was the top aging concern among survey respondents. Additionally, cost of long-term care and the cost of memory care at 2.80 each were also mentioned as community needs. 5. Mental Health/Behavioral Health : Survey respondents indicated that depression was the top mental health concern at a rating of 2.86. Alcohol (2.71) and drug (2.86) use and abuse were also mentioned as concerns.

A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining not-for- profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate not-for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. At Winner Regional Healthcare, ongoing commitment to quality and integrity is reflected in our mission statement: Professional Care with a Personal Touch. Thank you for entrusting your health care to Winner Regional Health. We are proud to be a part of the community and we look forward to providing a continuum of care for many years to come. Regulatory Requirements Federal regulations stipulate that non-profit medical centers conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years and prioritize the needs for the purpose of implementation strategy development and submission in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code 501(r). IRS Code 501(r) requires that each hospital must have: (1) conducted a community health needs assessment in the applicable taxable year; (2) adopted an implementation strategy for meeting the community health needs identified in the assessment; and (3) created transparency by making the information widely available. The regulations stipulate that each medical center take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community. We are required to seek at least one state, local, tribal or regional government public health department or state Office of Rural Health with knowledge, information or expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Non-profit hospitals are required to seek input from members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in the community, or organizations serving or representing the interest of such populations, and underserved populations experiencing disparities or at risk of not receiving adequate care as a result of being uninsured or due to geographic, language or financial or other barriers. The community health needs assessment includes a process to identify community resources available to address the assessed needs and to prioritize the needs. Hospitals are to address each assessed need or defend why we are not addressing the needs. Once the needs have been identified and prioritized, hospitals are required to develop an implementation strategy to address the top needs. The strategies are reported on the IRS 990 and a status report must be provided each year on IRS form 990 Schedule H. Finally, hospitals are to be transparent with the findings and make the written CHNA report available to anyone who asks for the report. Sanford places the CHNA reports and the implementation strategies on the Sanford website. Hospitals are required to keep three cycles of assessments on the web site. 12 Acknowledgements Winner Regional Health would like to thank the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University for their assistance and expertise while performing the assessment and analysis of the community health data.

The nine-person volunteer Board of Directors manages the operation of our institution. The board chooses three candidates from our local communities each year to serve three-year terms on the board. Our management agreement with Sanford Health aids the hospital and long-term care facility with purchasing, training, technology, and administration. Winner Regional is dedicated to providing quality employment opportunities and purchasing local goods whenever possible. Winner Regional Health is a 25-bed Critical Access Hospital and 80-bed long-term care facility that caters to the health needs of south central South Dakota and north central Nebraska. Physicians in the following specialties provide consultation and treatment at Winner Regional Health's Outreach Clinic. Specialty care includes: chemotherapy Pain Clinic Podiatry Pulmonology 14 Retail Pharmacy (Winner Regional Health Pharmacy) Speech Therapy Urology Vascular Description of the Community Served Winner, South Dakota is located in south central South Dakota along Highways 18, 183 and 44 and is the county seat of Tripp County. The population of Winner is 3,137 and the city covers approximately 922.5 acres of land. Winner was part of the famous Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and later part of the Dakota Territory, established by an act of Congress and a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Winner was so named because it was the \"winner\" in the struggle to establish a town along the railroad right-of- way when the Chicago North Western began moving west from Dallas, SD in 1909. Over 300 businesses are active in Winner. The Winner School District is rated level 1 by the South Dakota Division of Education, with the high school accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and High Schools. Winner is home to a regional health care center and two modern assisted living centers. Recent capital improvements in the city include a new main street, new runway at the airport, and a new fire hall/ambulance facility with a new training room. 15 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide a limited snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the Winner, SD area. Invitations were extended to a wide base of county and city leadership, local organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, it was evident that older, white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. Literature reviews indicate that there are non-response rate issues among younger respondents. In particular, response rates to health care and community health needs assessment surveys have often been found to be higher for older respondents. Studies have also shown lower response rates for socially disadvantaged groups (i.e., socially, culturally, or financially). A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. Invitations were extended to county and community leaders, organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations. Winner Regional Health extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases, there were surveys that were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts to develop the survey tool and throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implementations strategies are welcome on the Winner Regional Health web at http://winnerregional.org 16 Key Findings 17 Community Health Concerns Economics The availability of affordable housing is of high concern for the respondents of the survey. Other concerns included skilled labor workforce and employment options. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding ECONOMIC WELL-BEING (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Aging Population The greatest areas of concern among survey respondents for the aging population includes the cost of in-home services and the cost of long-term care and memory care. Respondents are also concerned about the availability of resources to help the caregiver. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 18 Children and Youth The highest concerns regarding children and youth are childhood obesity, availability of education about birth control, teen pregnancy, and availability of quality childcare. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding CHILDREN AND YOUTH (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Safety Respondents have concerns with respect to safety issues concerning the abuse of prescription drugs, child abuse and neglect, criminal activity, and domestic violence. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding SAFETY (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 19 Health Care and Wellness The top concern among survey respondents is access to affordable prescription drugs. Access to affordable health care and vision insurance coverage, affordable health care, and availability of providers are also areas of concern in the community. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding HEALTH CARE AND WELLNESS (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) Mental Health and Substance Abuse Survey respondents were concerned a variety of mental health and substance abuse issues including depression, drug use and abuse, alcohol use and abuse, and dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE (1=no attention needed; 5=critical attention needed) 20 Personal Health Concerns Respondents' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI), which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height, the majority (63%) of respondents reported themselves as overweight or obese. However, the vast majority (95%) of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good, or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to note that within the past year, 69% visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical and 77% visited a dentist or dental clinic. Respondents' rating of their health in general Obesity is a common, but serious disease. Obesity can have adverse effects on health and lead to a reduced life expectancy. Adults with a BMI over 25 are considered overweight and adults with a BMI over 30 are considered obese. According to the CDC, obesity and overweight are the second leading cause of preventable deaths, tagging close behind tobacco use. Health conditions related to obesity: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon) Hypertension Dyslipidemia Stroke 21 Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Gynecological problems Nationally, more than 30% of adults, 17% of youth age 6-19 years, and more than 8% of children 2 to 5 years of age are obese. For information about the BMI, visit the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, About BMI for Adults , www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/ Respondents' weight status based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale 22 Length of time since respondents last visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical exam and length of time since they last visited a dentist or dental clinic for any reason. Preventive Health Preventive health care promotes the detection and prevention of illness and disease and is another important component of good health and well-being. Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a flu shot, blood pressure check, dental cleaning or x-rays, and cholesterol screening. However, there are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e., bone density test, cardio screening, glaucoma test, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screening [males], cervical cancer screening, and skin cancer screening in the past year). Many tests and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sensitive/appropriate. 23 Whether or not respondents have had preventive screenings in the past year, by type of screening Screenings Breast cancer screening : According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening : Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow-up. Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early: o The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. o The HPV test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes (human papillomavirus) (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) Colorectal cancer screening : Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using 24 high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75. Prostate cancer screening : The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: o Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. o Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first-degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). o Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone, is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening : The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: 1) Be aware that fair-skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma; 2) Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the survey indicate that 26% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. 25 Fruit and Vegetable Intake The study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fruit recommended dietary guidelines. Only 31% of respondents reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day, and only 12% respondents reported having 3 or more servings of fruits the prior day. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced-calorie diet can be beneficial for weight management. Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday 26 Physical Activity Levels Study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet physical activity guidelines. 54% of survey respondents engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 21% engage in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health. Number of days in an average week respondents engage in MODERATE and VIGOROUS activity 27 Tobacco Use Study results indicate that the vast majority of community respondents are not currently tobacco users with only 3% of respondents indicating they use tobacco on a daily basis. Secondary research through the 2019 County Health Rankings finds that 17% of Tripp County residents are current smokers. How often respondents currently use tobacco Mental Health Mental health is an important component of well-being at every stage of life and impacts how we think, act and feel. Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress, how we make choices, and how we relate to others. Among survey respondents, mental health is a moderately high area of concern. 23% of respondents report that they had little interest or pleasure in doing things several days per week or more, and 26% report that they feel down, depressed, or hopeless several days per week or more. 28 Percentage of respondents who have been bothered by these issues over the past two weeks 29 Substance Abuse Responses Substance abuse is also a mental health disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition (DSM-IV), and can stem from mental health concerns. In the Winner community, 29% of respondents report binge drinking at least once per month and 17% report binge drinking two to three times per week. Secondary research through the 2019 County Health Rankings indicates that 17% of Tripp County residents report excessive drinking. 9% of respondents indicated that alcohol has had a harmful effect on themselves or on a family member in the past two years. Number of times with at least 1 drink in the past 30 days Average number of drinks per day when you drink by gender 30 Demographics General Population Data - Tripp County, South Dakota Tripp County Total population 5,460 Median age 46.5 Median household income $48,409 % living below poverty level 19.7% Unemployment rate 2.9% % high school graduate or higher 89.4% Source: 2017 United States Census Bureau - www.census.gov Survey Respondents Of the respondents, 57% were female and 43% were male. 83% of respondents owned their own homes, 71% were employed with 29% self-employed, and 71% had completed at least some post-secondary education. 29% of those surveyed are military veterans. Zip code of respondents Zip code # of respondents 57580 6 31 Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholders participated in the asset mapping and reviewed the research findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined, the group proceeded to the prioritization process. Top priorities, for further development into implementation strategies, were determined via the multi-voting methodology. The McKnight Foundation Model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University was the process implemented for this work The asset map includes identified needs from the following: Identified needs from the non-generalizable survey Community stakeholders review and further development Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the need(s) The Asset Map can be found in the Appendix. Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics - availability of affordable housing and skilled labor workforce Children and Youth - childhood obesity, availability of information about birth control, teen pregnancy Health Care and Wellness - access to affordable prescription drugs, access to affordable health insurance coverage health care Aging Population - cost of in-home services, cost of long-term care and memory care Mental Health - depression and drug use and abuse WRH is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases, the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the need; however, WRH leaders will communicate the findings to community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. A document that shares what Winner Regional Health is doing to address the need or defends why WRH is not addressing the need can be found in the Appendix. Members of the community stakeholder group determined that children and youth and healthcare and wellness are the top unmet needs. Winner Regional Health has determined the 2020-2022 implementation strategies for the following needs: Children and Youth Healthcare and Wellness 32 Addressing the Needs Identified Concerns How Winner Regional Health is addressing the needs Economics Cost of affordable housing 4.00 Skilled labor workforce 3.29 Employment options 3.00 Hospital leadership will address this need by sharing the findings of the CHNA with community leaders.

The following strategies were implemented. Concerns Identified 2017-2019 Implementation Strategies Health Care Access Conduct community focus groups to develop a strategic plan based on the outcome Evaluate the usage of the emergency room to determine how many visits are Level 1 Determine how many ill patients are seen the same day as they call the clinic Physical Health Improve the overall physical health of the community Offer Better Choices, Better Health support group meetings Encourage healthier eating These strategies have served a broad reach across our community and region. The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. 1. Impact of the Strategy to Improve Health Care Access The first concern identified was Health Care Access. The actions that were conducted with the first Goal were to Conduct Community Focus Groups, prioritize the results and develop a plan to address the needs. Throughout the three-year period, the focus groups were conducted, the feedback was prioritized and the plan was implemented. During this same period, a building project was underway and many of the issues from the concerns addressed in the focus groups were resolved. Other items that were not a result of the physical building layout were addressed throughout the CHNA timeframe. The second goal was to evaluate the usage of the emergency room. There appeared to be less than 1% of emergency room visits that were classified as a level 1, or clinic type needs. The third goal was to determine if patients that call the clinic and needed to see a clinician due to being ill, could be seen the same day. A process has been developed where a provider is available to handle walk-in patients. The impact of the three goals has been overall successful. The community now knows we listen to their concerns, the emergency room is rarely being used as a clinic visit and patients can get access to a provider for illness the same day they call. 2. Impact of the Strategy to Enhance the Physical Health of the Winner Community The Physical Health of the Community was the second key concern addressed during the 2017 - 2019 CHNA. WRH is fortunate to have medical students that complete a rotation in rural areas. The program is called FARM (Frontier and Rural Medicine). One of the requirements of the program is to do community projects to bring health related awareness to community members. The second strategy was to offer the program Better Choices, Better Health support group meetings in and around the Winner area. This program helps people with chronic conditions (i.e. diabetes, pain, and any disease that has affected one's life) by providing coping skills to enhance the person's daily life. The program is gaining popularity throughout the entire state and those that have taken the six-week workshop feel the course was valuable to them. The third task was to encourage healthier eating. Physical Health must start with awareness and knowledge. The three tactics WRH chose to focus did just that. 38 Community Feedback Winner Regional Health leadership is prepared to accept feedback on our 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment and has provided online comment fields for ease of access on our website.
