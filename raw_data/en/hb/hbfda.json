With this comes a lot of fear and concern about diseases, vaccines, choices, traveling abroad and simply not being fully informed before making a decision around vaccinations. As one of very few ND's in British Columbia to have obtained the Immunization Certification, I would like to present on some key areas around vaccinations that we as practitioners should know and what we can provide for our patients when they have questions. This should not be a topic of fear or anger but a topic that is honest, forthcoming and transparent. In my office, I help parents uncover the risks and susceptibility for their child in terms of contracting disease, educating them around infant immunity, ingredients in vaccines, what herd immunity is, the diseases we vaccinate against, and how we can mitigate potential adverse reactions with vaccines. Practitioners should know what resources to offer their patients who have questions around vaccines along with knowing where they can go for current and reputable information. From simply knowing how to locate a vaccine insert, utilizing annual surveillance reports from the CDC, understanding how adjuvants work and the risks they play (aluminum) and lastly understanding infant physiology as it pertains to vaccination (immunology). Taylor Bean is passionate about providing accurate information within the conversations surrounding vaccines. She feels strongly about access to accurate, transparent information because anything less, compromises our movement towards best practices for infants, adults and elderly population. Taylor Bean has worked in Singapore from 2014-2016 and continue to support several families in Singapore and around SE Asia. The topic of vaccinations has been one of the main topics with the families she supported in Singapore so she believes it is imperatives for physicians of Singapore to understand the concerns of Singaporeans and expats.
