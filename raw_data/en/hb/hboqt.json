Acupressure mats have spikes that stimulate key points on the body, which helps reduce pain and inflammation. They can also help improve circulation and promote relaxation. In this blog post, I will discuss the benefits of acupressure mats and review some of the best ones on the market. A Friendly Swap I have recently discovered the joys of [weighted blankets](https://www.carlacorelli.com/reviews/why-i-love-my-weighted-blanket-the-benefits-of-deep-pressure-stimulation/) and I was raving about my new one to a friend. She countered that she swore by her acupressure mat. A few years ago I became a big fan of [acupuncture](http://Acupuncture%20for%20Anxiety%20-%20How%20does%20it%20work%20and%20why%20does%20it%20help?). Whenever my neck muscles became as hard as stones I would make an appointment with a lovely Chinese doctor who performed miracles with her needles. So I am a believer in acupuncture, but I could not understand how lying on a mat could possibly have the same benefits as going to a practitioner. So my friend and I agreed to swap. I lent her my weighted blanket and she lent me her acupressure mat. We decided that we would give it two weeks and then compare notes. How does an acupressure mat work? Acupressure is an ancient Chinese [healing](https://www.carlacorelli.com/narcissistic-abuse-recovery/the-10-stages-of-healing-after-narcissistic-abuse-what-to-expect-and-how-to-cope/) practice that involves applying pressure to key points on the body. This helps to release tension and promote relaxation. Acupressure mats have spikes that stimulate these key points. When you lie on an acupressure mat, the spikes help to release tension in your muscles and improve circulation. The pressure also encourages the release of endorphins, which are natural painkillers. In addition to reducing pain, acupressure mats can also help to improve your mood and reduce stress levels. They can increase energy levels and promote better sleep. So did the acupressure mat work? My friend lent me her [ProsourceFit Acupressure Mat](https://amzn.to/3Ma0Juh) which is made out of 100% high quality thick cotton and plant-based eco foam. The cushioned foam mat is large enough to fit your full back and has more than 6210 acupressure points that stimulate nerves and improve blood circulation for faster muscle recovery. The mat also comes with a pillow covered with 1782 acupressure points for neck support and more holistic pain relief. I have to say that I was a bit sceptical at first. And the first time I lay on it, it felt like torture - my back was on fire! Had it not been for the fact that I had promised my friend that I would stick it out, I probably would have quit. I built up my time on the mat slowly, and by day 4 I was lying on it for 20 minutes at a stretch. And that is when the magic happened. I could feel my muscles relaxing. The next day, my neck and shoulders felt much better. By the end of the two weeks the mat really did help reduce my pain levels. It also helped me to relax and de-stress. The Takeaway My friend and I were both impressed. She loved the weighted blanket and I loved the mat.
