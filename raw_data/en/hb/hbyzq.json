It is an ancient healing art that has withstood the test of time. One thing that makes it particularly effective is that it is customized to the individual. There is no one size fits all. Another, is that it is HOLISTIC. The mind, body, and spirit are interconnected and all are considered and addressed during treatment. At EAST, space is held for your healing journey. Enough time is allotted for you to discuss your goals and concerns. Traditional diagnostics and modern lab testing are integrated when necessary to provide a clear picture of your health. Treatments are gentle, relaxing, and restorative. EAST can be complementary to your current medical treatment or used as an alternative to allopathic methods. EAST is for accessing the best of all worlds to promote healing and a sense of true wellbeing. \"When you touch one thing with deep awareness, you touch everything.\" - Lao Tzu SERVICES ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is one branch of Chinese Medicine. Ultra thin, sterile, single-use, stainless steel needles are used to stimulate points along channels of energy to restore proper flow of Qi. Gentle Japanese style insertion technique is used to create a pain free experience. CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE Chinese herbal medicine is another branch of Chinese Medicine. Herbs are strategically combined into formulas in a way that balances the properties of each ingredient. Chinese herbs often undergo years of preparation to bring out precise medicinal properties. CUPPING Suction is used to apply cups to the body to relieve muscle tension and pain, increase blood flow to promote healing, and release toxins. Cupping causes temporary marks to appear on the skin that typically disappear within a week. Suction can be modified to your comfort level. ACU-TONICS Acu-Tonics involves the use of tuning forks on acupuncture points. The gentle vibrations of the tuning forks stimulate the points to induce tranquility and healing. This is a nice option if you'd like to change your vibration or if you're interested in acupuncture but very needle phobic. It may be used in conjunction with other modalities, or on its own. REIKI Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing using only the hands and may or may not involve gentle touch. It can be used in conjunction with acupuncture or as a stand alone treatment. It is used to treat almost anything without side effects due to its gentle nature. It is a great modality to those who are overly sensitive to other types of treatment, or those who respond well to the effects of energy healing. LASER THERAPY Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is also known as Light Therapy, LED, or Cold Laser. It is a very gentle wavelength of light that has virtually no side effects. It is great for treating inflammation, post surgical scars, acne, wrinkles, and can help improve fertility. A comfortable warmth is generated during the 30 minute session, and can used as a standalone treatment or be combined with acupuncture.
