Company Overview, Mission and Values Salus Scientific will use state-of-the-art technol ogies pioneered by key members of their team to cultivate and accurately formulate, package, a nd administer efficacious doses of therapeutic quantities of cannabinoids specific to Salus Scientific brands. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.6(b)(1) the following Standard Operating Procedures are submitted to the Department as evidence that Salus Scientific will be able to manufacture approved medical marijuana products, each w ith a consistent cannabinoid profile (the concentration of total tetrahydrocannabinol (THC ) and total cannabidiol (CBD) will define the brand) and each able to pass the required quality control testing. 2. Hours of Operation In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a7 1004.5(b)(4)(viii), the proposed hours of operation for the manufacturing facility are as follows: Due to perpetual harvesting, energy efficienc y measures, multiple cycles and different preventative and beneficial treatments, the manuf acturing facility will be operational 24 hours per day, with security onsite and functional at all times. Employees will work in shifts, and will only have access to the facility during their shift. Employee shifts will be implemented in phases, with one or two 8 hour shifts during initial operations, and a third added when the manufacturing facility is operating at full capacity. Because Salus Scientific strives to hire employees from the local community whenever possible, the value of a perpetually operating manufacturing facility such as this one will provide substantial economic activity to the community of Johnson City and Broome County. Due to the pace of the implementation of the New York's medical marijuana program and the requirement to create a sustainable, reliable supply of brands, Salus Scientific expects that state and local government will allow operations to function at all hours; however, should certain state or local regulations preclude such activities, Sa lus Scientific will yield to that regulatory oversight. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 3. Good Agricultural Practices In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11(e)(1) Salus Scientific will use good agricultural practices (GAPs) and must conform to all applicab le laws and rules of New York State. To fulfill the requirements of 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.5(b)(18)(i), Daniel Harder PhD, Genetics and Cultivation Team Lead for Salus Scientific, has more th an eight years experience in applying and implementing GAPs within a botanical garden and more than 15 years experience in using GAPs in international rare plant conser vation and restoration projects. He is familiar with general principles and specific practices. Sa lus Scientific will adhere to and remain current in GAPs as it applies to the cultivation, propagation, harvesting , and handling medical marijuana. As the overriding principle of GAPs is to reduce food safety risk, Salus Scientific will apply these same standards and precautions to the cultivation of me dical marijuana, keeping patient health and safety as its top priority. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11 subsection (e) (3) the manufacturing facility will only use pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides that are approved by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. No synthetic marijuana additives will be used in the production of any medical marijuana product pursuant to 10 NYCRR \u00a7 1004.11. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11 subsection (f), production of any approved medical marijuana product will be in accordance with ge neral sanitary conditions. Poisonous or toxic materials, including but not limited to insecticides , rodenticides, detergents, sanitizers, caustics, acids and related cleaning compounds are stored in a separate area fr om the marijuana and medical marijuana products in prominently and dist inctly labeled containers, except that nothing herein precludes the convenient availability of de tergents or sanitizers to areas where equipment, containers and utensils are washed and sanitized.

These specifications will be used to inform Salus Scientific approved standard operating procedures regarding storage at dispensing facilities and the manufacturing facility, and will be incorporated into patient education materials on proper storage of medical marijuana products. 18. Storage a. Overview These standard operating procedures have b een designed for the storage, labeling and shipping of high quality medicine, free of mold, disease, heavy metals and other contaminants. The storage of marijuana is present ed in this manual to ensure consistency and standardization. In the case of herbal drugs, the storage method and primary curing of the plant preserves the ultimate properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Therefore, an effective quality assurance system in the steps leading up to shipping is needed in order to guarantee reproducible quality. Efficient operations require extensive understanding of the curing stage of plant production by each member of the cultivation team. These standard operating procedures are to enhance the consistency of medicati ons by formulating an appropriate quality standard for storing marijuana. Specifically, it is critical that cured marijuana is: REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION i. Released on a lot-by-lot basis, with each lot being approved by the Quality Assurance Manager before sale. ii. Manufactured, packaged, labeled, tested and stored hygienically to minimize contamination. iii. Stored under proper conditions, which ensure the preservation of the therapeutic properties of the end product. iv. Shipped in a reliable, constant, and reproducible manner. v. Monitored in a way that reduces cultivation, processing, and storage errors. b. Storage Conditions Pursuant to New York Department of Health regulations, all marijuana product is be stored in accordance with the security direct ive in a manner that ensures its quality and non-diversion at all times. All environments that contain or may potentially contain marijuana are regularly sanitized in accordance with the sanitation protocol. The ideal conditions for the storage of pre- processed marijuana depend on what method of processing is employed. Because mechanically processed marijuana must be fresh, it would not be harvested until it is ready for processing. When a hand-manicure is intended, storage of the preprocessed plants take place under the ideal conditions of the environmental drying and curing chamber between 10 and 16\u00b0C and 50% RH. Storage of post- mechanically processed marijuana occurs in the environmental drying and curing chamber between 10 and 16\u00b0C and 50% RH. Storage of post-processed hand-manicured product is weighed, packaged internally, labeled and stored in the secure products vault on-site. When the mechanically processed marijuana has completed the drying and curing phase, it is be weighed, processed, packaged in ternally, labeled and stored in the secure products vault on-site. When marijuana is held at the ideal conditi ons (shown below), and is properly monitored for contaminants, marijuana flowers can be held stable for months to years where the decarboxylation and curing processes reach their end points. After wh ich time, flavor and potency stabilize, and the marijuana may be sold or consumed. It is important to note that UV light degrades cannabinoids; so all storage must take place in periodic low-light or REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION constant-dark conditions. One (1) year of st orage is recommended, however, 2 years is the maximum retention time for products without batch re-testing.

Overview In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.10(a)(7), Salus Scientific will dispose of unusable medical marijuana products that have failed laboratory testing or any marijuana used in the manufacturing process in accordance with the operating plan described below, presented here for the Department's approval. The Salus Scientific disposal policy is designed to balance public safety with the most environmentally friendly disposal methods for marijuana waste. The methods outlined here include protocols for securely storing marijuana waste, rendering mariju ana waste non-recoverable, disposing of non- recoverable marijuana waste, and disposing of non-marijuana waste. Any changes to Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 6REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION these protocols will be submitted to the Department of Public Health prior to implementation b. Marijuana waste The following will be considered marijuana waste: i. marijuana plant waste, including discarded immature and mature plants and seedlings ii. leaves and flowers used to create marijuana extracts iii. improperly stored, expired or damaged marijuana leaves and flowers iv. improperly stored, expired or damaged mar ijuana extracts and marijuana products v. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11(l)(1), any lot of marijuana product that does not meeting the minimum standards or specifications for safety vi. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11(l)(2), any lot not meeting the minimum standards or specifications for brand consistency vii. unusable medical marijuana products that have failed laboratory testing viii. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.12(m), any approved medical marijuana product returned to a Salus Scientific dispensing facility ix. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.10(c )(2)(ii), any marijuana or marijuana products that need to be destroyed in the event that a Salus Scientific facility must close, pursuant to the Salus Scientific closure plan Marijuana waste will be considered psychoactive and will be treated as a threat to public safety should it be lost, stolen or diverte d. As such, marijuana waste will be either securely stored or rendered unrecoverable at the moment it is generated or determined unusable as the result of laboratory testing. c. Temporary secure storage for marijuana waste In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.11(e)(6), the manufacturing facility will have a separate secure area for temporary storage of any medical marijuana or medical marijuana product that needs to be destroyed. The secure waste storage area will remain locked at all times and will be accessible to employees only with managerial approval. No marijuana waste will remain in the secure waste storage area for more than 24 hours before it is rendered non-recoverable. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION d. Rendering marijuana waste unrecoverable The manufacturing facility will use the grinding method to render marijuana waste unrecoverable. This is the method most used by regulated medical marijuana facilities in other states. The grinding method effectively destroys the psychoactive as well as non- psychoactive molecules of marijuana and mar ijuana products, ensuring that marijuana waste is undesirable and does not create a nuisance for public safety officers. The grinding method uses an electric leaf mulcher machine to grind marijuana waste into mulch. The waste is then incorporated with other types of non-consumable solid waste so that the resulting mixture is at least fifty percent non-marijuana waste. The Salus Scientific manufacturing facility will incorporate the following types of non- consumable solid waste: x paper waste (cardboard, offi ce paper, newspaper, etc.) x organic food waste x non-psychoactive plant waste, including root balls and mature stems x yard waste The machine used will be capable of grinding marijuana waste into fine mulch, with a motor capable of running for extended time periods when necessary. All regular employees and managerial staff will be instruc ted in the safe operation of this machine, including the use of safety goggles and gloves and performing regular safety checks with each use. i. Procedures 1. Identify marijuana waste that has been tagge d for disposal by accessing the list of marijuana waste in the inventory control system. 2. Obtain managerial approval and/or ove rsight to access the temporary secure storage area for marijuana waste. 3. Transfer marijuana waste from temporary se cure storage to the waste storage area where the electric mulcher and non-consumable waste products are located. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 4. Remove marijuana waste from packaging, as necessary. Follow company procedures to tare the scale and weigh the marijuana waste products, and record the weight in the inventory control system. 5. Weigh out non-consumable waste in an amount equal to the weight recorded, plus an additional 5 percent. 6. Perform mulcher safety checks and put on protective safety goggles and gloves. 7. Follow manufacturer's directions to feed marijuana waste into the mulcher, taking care not to overload the machine. 8. Mix the mulched marijuana waste with the previously weighed non-consumable waste. 9. Dispose of the resulting non-recoverable marijuana waste in the designated container. This container shall be kept lo cked at all times, opened only to deposit and remove non-recoverable marijuana wa ste, and stored indoors at all times. 10. Note in electronic inventory control system that the marijuana waste products that have been rendered non-recoverable, the date and time that they were rendered non-recoverable, the employee who performed the procedure and the manager who approved or oversaw the procedure. Salus Scientific will maintain and make available a separate record of each such disposal indicating: a. The date and time of disposal. b. The manner of disposal. c. The brand name and quantity of marijuana disposed of d. The signatures of the persons disposing of the marijuana and any other persons present during the disposal. 11. Marijuana waste will be rendered non-recoverable a minimum of once daily, unless no marijuana waste has be en generated or identified. e. Disposal of marijuana waste Marijuana waste that has been rendered non-recoverable will be disposed of along with other non-recyclable, non-hazardous solid waste, using the services of the local waste management company. Solid waste will be picked up a minimum of once weekly. An employee or manager will request the na me and signature of the waste management REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION employee responsible for pickup before unloc king the marijuana waste container for disposal. f. Non-marijuana waste Solid waste that is nonhazardous will be stored in bins or dumpsters for regular weekly trash pick-up, including the following types of waste: i. growing medium from marijuana cultivation - soil, seedling plugs, etc. ii. recyclable waste - plastics, metal, paper etc. iii. food and bathroom waste from employee break room and restrooms g. Hazardous waste Hazardous waste will be disposed of in compl iance with all federal, state and local codes and statutes. When hazardous waste is generated in the manufacturing process, a manager will schedule a hazardous waste pick-up or drop-off with the local waste management company or landfill. The following items will be treated as hazardous waste: i. Chemical waste from the extraction process ii. fluorescent light bulbs and other mercury-containing bulbs iii. electronic waste Electronic waste may be donated or disposed of at an e-recycle event, as available. h. Liquid Waste Liquid waste resulting from manufacturing processes will be disposed of in compliance with the requirements for discharge into surface water, groundwater and sewers. i. Dispensary waste Salus Scientific dispensaries will also use the most environmentally sound practices available so that minimal waste is generated. Any marijuana product that is identified as waste using the protocols listed in the Salus Scientific operating manual, including marijuana products returned to the dispensary by a patient, will be returned to the Salus Scientific manufacturing facility and disposed of in accordance with the protocols REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION described herein. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a71004.12 (m), if an approved medical marijuana product is returned to a Salus Scientific dispensing facility, the dispensing facility will return the product to the manufactur ing facility and it will be destroyed in accordance with the approved operating plan that is described above. j. Marijuana Extract Oil Waste In order to prevent any excess, undesired, recalled, obsolete, adulterated, misbranded or deteriorated marijuana extrac t product from making its way to non-patients or illicit markets, Salus Scientific will use an on-site via a Micro Auto Gasification unit to render non-recoverable any large quantity of marijuana extract oil or a large quantity of approved medical marijuana products that must be destroyed. Because this type of waste is incredibly potent, Salus Scientific will tak e the additional precaution of treating it as medical waste. The Micro Auto Gasification unit does not emit an odor of marijuana as a result of the gasification process. It is currently in use by the Canadian military on navy ships and in hospital settings.

Closure Plan Salus Scientific understands that there are many challenges to operating a successful medical marijuana business. There is always the possibi lity of unforeseen circumstances having a significant impact on business operations. Our strong business plan and our company leaders are prepared for any challenge, and our mission to provide certified patients with the approved medical marijuana products they require motivates us to ensure that Salus Scientific remains a pioneer in the medical marijuana industry. However, in the event that an unforeseen circumstan ce arises and results in the necessary closing or suspension of Salus Scientific operations, our cl osure plan will guarantee the closure process is performed in accordance to all the applicab le rules and regulations of New York State. Some unforeseen circumstances may include a change in New York medical marijuana laws and regulations, an unfavorable economic climate, na tural catastrophes which render any of our facilities inoperable, or a change in location of any of Salus Scientific's facilities. The following steps describe Salus Scie ntific's closure plan. a. Notify the Department REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION i. Before any closure procedures may commence, Salus Scientific will notify the department in writing at least 120 days pri or the anticipated date of closure. The intent of closure letter to the department will be drafted by a professional legal team and signed by the appropriate Salus Scientific members. ii. In its contents, the intent of closure letter will explain in detail to the department the nature of the circumstances resulting in the necessary closure, the address and location of all affected facilities, whether ce rtified patients will be affected, and the steps that Salus Scientific will undertake to ensure the closure plan is successful. These steps include describing to the department the steps that will be taken to notify all affected certified patients and designated caregivers, the steps that will be taken to properly destroy, transfer, or dispose of the supply of medical marijuana and medical marijuana products, how records will be maintained, and also how Salus Scientific will remain in compliance with all applicable regulations while it undergoes the closure process.

No closure procedures will be undertaken until after the department has given its final approval to Salus Scientific. b. Notify Certified Patients and Designated Caregivers i. Upon department approval, Salus Scientific w ill begin to contact all affected certified patients as well as designated caregivers . Salus Scientific will call each certified patient and designated caregiver to explain to them the closure procedure and the timetables. The timetables will give certif ied patients and desi gnated caregivers information on the last date on which they will be able to purchase approved medical marijuana products from Salu s Scientific. The certified patients and designated caregivers will be asked if they would like to receive the information in writing, and if they elect to do so, Salus Scientific will mail the certified patient or designated caregiver the information in a discreet envelope. Additionally, Salus Scientific will advise each certified patient and designated caregiver of alternative registered organizations in New York that may be convenient for their needs. Salus Scientific will work with certified patients and designated caregivers to ensure that their needs are met. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION c. Destroying and Transferring Medical Marijuana Products i. Securely handling all medical marijuana a nd medical marijuana products during the closure process is crucial. Extra security steps must be taken to prevent diversion. Salus Scientific will take every step necessary to account for all medical marijuana and medical marijuana products in its possession during the closure process. During the closure process, Salus Scientific manager s will decide whether medical marijuana and medical marijuana products will be dest royed or transferred to another facility. Before either process is initiated, a complete inventory will be taken of all medical marijuana and medical marijuana prod ucts located in the facility. ii. Destroying medical marijuana and medical marijuana products will be done by following the appropriate procedures described in the disposal plan. The inventory will be cross-referenced after destroying the batches or lots of medical marijuana and medical marijuana products to ensure accuracy. iii. Transferring medical marijuana or medical ma rijuana products to another facility will also be a meticulous process. Salus Scientific will take precautions to ensure no medical marijuana or medical marijuana products end up in the possession of any unauthorized persons. When transporting any products to another facility, the same protocols used in the transportation of a pproved medical marijuana products will be used. iv. Extra audits will be conducted at each step of the destroying or transferring process. Salus Scientific is committed to accountin g for all medical marijuana and medical marijuana products in the closure proce ss. Managers will investigate any discrepancies in the inventory. d. Maintaining Records i. Maintaining records and making them available to the department will continue as usual during the closure process. All records procedures will be followed and records will be maintained for no less than five (5) years. Salus Scientific will appoint a records custodian who will maintain the records in both physical and digital format REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION for no less than five (5) years. These records will be made available to the department upon request. ii. Salus Scientific will inform the department of the appointed records custodian. The department will have the custodian's personal information, including name, address, contact information, and the location where the records are being held for safekeeping. The department will also be made aware of all the persons who have access to the records. e. Approved Closure Date i. Salus Scientific shall take no action to close a facility prior to department approval of the closure plan. When the department approves the closure plan, the closure plan will be put into effect. Salus Scientific's effective closing date will be on the approved closure date; so long the closure plan has been successfully observed and implemented. Any of Salus Scientific's facilities identified in the closure plan will cease their operations on the approved clos ure date.

Introduction Salus Scientific is intent upon providing a positive impact for residents, businesses, and community organizations in New York. Salus Scientific is committed to providing patients and employees with safe, clean, and responsible medical marijuana manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The four dispensing facilities and one manufacturing facility will create much- needed jobs. Salus Scientific strives to be a model business by establishing productive partnerships with law enforcement agencies and area non-profits; putting safe environmental practices in place; and hiring local employees to help boost the state's economy. Salus Scientific also has a plan to educate the public on marijuana law, safe practices, the marijuana plant itself and general marijuana industry practices and stan dards. A well-educated public means the entire industry has a better chance of moving forward in a positive direction. Below is our likely impact on the community and our plan for meeting the needs of the patients in the state of New York. II. Salus Scientific Facilities Salus Scientific plans to open facilities across the state: x Manufacturing Plant: 100 Oakdale St, Johnson City, NY 13790 x Dispensary 1: 4700 Vestal Parkway East Vestal, NY 13850 x Dispensary 2: 26183 US Route 11 Evans Mills, NY 13637 x Dispensary 3: 6801 Kinne St. East Syracuse, NY 13057 x Dispensary 4: 56-15 58th St Maspeth, NY 11358 REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION The above map shows the geographic diversity of Salus Scientific's facilities. See reproduction of Application Attachment A, included at the end of this Section, for maps and street views of individual locations. The location of these faci lities is meant to help increase economic development, create jobs, aid in patient accessi bility, and create greater community cooperation and education. Salus Scientific projects that by establishing their facilities they will create 24 security jobs, 50 dispensary jobs, and 126 manufacturing jobs, totaling 200 new jobs across the state. a. Johnson City, Broome County i. Population The Manufacturing Plant is located in Johnson City, which belongs to the Broome County/Binghamton Metropolitan Area, collectiv ely the Southern Tier. In 2010, Broome County had 200,600 residents, making it the most populous county in New York's Southern Tier region. Broome County counts Tioga county to the west, Delaware County to the east, and Cortland and Chenango Counties to the north and the Northern Tier of Pennsylvania as its neighbors. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION Together Broome and Tioga create the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Population centers include the Town of Union (56,346), the City of Binghamton (47,376), and the Town of Vestal (28,043) in Broome County and the Town of Owego (19,883) in Tioga County. Together, these four communities comprise 60% of the population of the Binghamton MSA. Salus Scientific is conscientious of the changes in the economy in the Southern Tier region. When the fracking industry promise did not come to fruition after the recession, economic rebound did not seem promising. In the last few years the unemployment rate in Broome County has been greater than the statewide average. In 2011 the unemployment rate in Broome County was 8.5% and in the state as a whole it was 8.2%, but by January of 2013 the unemployment rate in Broome County had expanded to 10.2%. Unemployment in Broome County grew the most in the private sector, but strong job growth in health care, social services and construction helped to keep the unemplo yment rate from reaching higher numbers. Working with partners in Broome County, Salus Scientific will create a place where residents can rely on jobs that help them and their community to become more integrated and prosperous. ii. Economic Impact Salus Scientific anticipates that it will initially create 126 manufacturing jobs and six security jobs at the manufacturing plant, with the potential to add more manufacturing jobs and dedicated transportation positions. The manufacturing jobs will increase if th e demand for medical marijuana products at the dispensaries grows. Salus Scientific anticipates that the Department will approve its plan to deliver medical marijuana products to patients. If this occurs, j ob creation for dedicated drivers from the manufacturing plant to the dispensaries will be necessary to fulfill the increased demand. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION iii. Community Partnership With a strong healthcare presence in Broome County, Salus Scientific believes that there will be many opportunities to learn from the heal thcare sector when it comes to developing new products to serve patient needs and to help educate the region's h ealthcare providers on medical marijuana, the products the manufacturing plant produces and the benefits eligible patients could receive from medical marijuana recommendation. The largest Healthcare provider in Broome County is United Health Services (UHS). UHS is a comprehensive regional health care system that operates two hospitals in Broome County: Binghamton General Hospital, a full service hospital founded in 1888, and Wilson Medical Center, a teaching hospital that provides a range of medical and surgical services, in Johnson City. UHS also has primary care centers, walk in clinics, and medical offices throughout the Southern Tier, serves as a leading provider of home care services and offers nursing care, assisted living, and private apar tments at its Ideal Senior Living Center in Endicott. In 2011, UHS completed an expansio n of its Cardiac Rehabilitation Program at Binghamton General Hospital, and initiated a fundra ising campaign for a $5 million expansion of the Intensive Care Unit at Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City. The latter is the first major upgrade to the unit since the mid 1970s. In addition, construction was completed on a $29 million project to build a new state oftheart primary care center in Vestal, across from Binghamton University. UHS would be an excelle nt Healthcare partner for Salus Scientific. b. Vestal, Broome County The dispensary closest to the manufacturing plant will be in Vestal. Vestal is also located in Broome County. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION i. Economic Impact In addition to the jobs created by the manufacturing facility, the Vestal dispensary would bring an additional 12-15 dispensary staff jobs and 2-6 security jobs, with the potential for expansion as the patient base expands and if S alus Scientific is eventually permitted to deliver medical marijuana products directly to patients. ii. Patient Accessibility Having a dispensary located in such close proximity to the manufacturing plant will increase the speed with which pa tients served by the Vestal disp ensary can have access to the medical marijuana products that they need. Additionally, many patients will access dispen saries via public transportation. The Vestal dispensary is served by Broome County Transit. c. Evans Mills, Jefferson County i. Population Evans Mills is a village in Jefferson Count y in Northern New York. The population was 621 at the 2010 census. The Village of Evans Mill s in within the Town of Le Ray and is northeast of Watertown. The total Jefferson County population as of the 2010 U.S. Census is 116,229 people. The City of Watertown has a population of 27,023. The largest town is the Town of LeRay with a population of 21,782 people. The relatively large population of LeRay is attributed to the military presence of Fort Drum. By comparison, the town with the smallest population is the Town of Worth, with a total of 231 residents. There are 22 Towns, 20 Villages, and one City in Jefferson County. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION The largest industry in Jefferson County is government, employing almost 40% of the workforce. That is largely due to the presence of Fort Drum and the two state prisons in the County. Fort Drum is located nine miles east of Watertown and is home to more than 36,900 soldiers, family members and civilian employees of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) and its supporting tenants. Fort Drum is the largest Army installation in the Northeast. Fort Drum occupies 107,265 acres in Jefferson County and stretches across the Towns of LeRay, Philadelphia, Antwerp, and Wilna. With around 24,000 employees, Fort Drum is the largest single-site employer in Jefferson County and in Upstate New York. With a location in Evans Mills, qualifying patients from other medical ma rijuana program states who are displaced due to assignment to Fort Drum will still have access to the medical marijuana products they need. d. East Syracuse, Onondaga County i. Population and Location East Syracuse is a part of the city of Syracuse in eastern Onondaga County. As of the 2010 U.S. census, the village has a population of 3,084, greater Syracuse has a population of 145,170 and Onondaga County had a population of 467,026. The city of Syracuse is situated in the approximate center of the county and serves as the focus for commercial and business activities. Onondaga County is conveniently situated at the intersection of Interstate Highways 81 and 90 (NYS Thruway). Local Amtrak and Greyho und terminals are located in the new Regional Transportation Center. One can also reach the city by air using Hancock International Airport, while the New York State Barge Canal System provides local connection by boat to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION ii. Economic Impact In 2013 the Syracuse Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 9.8%, which was a .3% increase from the year before and was much higher average than greater Onondaga County (6.7%), greater New York (7.7%) and the United States (7.4%). The introduction of a Salus Scientific dispensary into East Syracuse will bring reliable jobs to the region, with the potential for further job growth as the medical marijuana patient base grows. Salus Scientific anticipates an initial staff of 12-15 as dispensary staff and 2-6 as security staff. iii. Patient Accessibility As Syracuse is the business center of Onondaga County, transit into and from Syracuse is readily available. Bus service in Onondaga is provided by four carriers, including three independent carriers and CENTRO, which is operated by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority. Inter-city service is provided by a number of providers, including Greyhound and Adirondack Trailways. iv. Community Partners In Onondaga County five of the largest employe rs are healthcare providers. The area's largest employer, the Upstate Medical University, a medical school that includes University Hospital, is the home of one of the country's eleven Joslin Centers for Diabetes. It is also the region's trauma center, burn center, kidney transplant center and pediatric emergency center. The University has also been given grants to research spinal cord and wrist injuries and to improve emergency response capabilities. University Hospital expanded the hospital's east wing to include a two- story children's hospital , creating Central New Yor k's Children's Hospital at University Hospital. The $99 million five-story vertical expansion increased the amount of space dedicated to pediatric medicine from 18,000 square feet to 87,000 square feet, which can house 50 private patient rooms and other amenities ca tering to the children and families cared for at the hospital. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION Creating a partnership with the hospital will help to further potential patient education, especially in the pediatric ward, and to help to serve patient needs in the state. Salus Scientific would like to work with the hospital to have visitors and potential patients counsel with the dispensary pharmacists to answer questions that pot ential patients and visitors from the hospital have about medical marijuana products. In all, Onondaga County's health care system includes five hospitals, over 1,500 practicing physicians, two mental health centers, numerous ambulatory care programs, and a full range of long-term care facilities. Salus Scientific will attempt to reach out and create connections with as many of thes e institutions as possible. e. Maspeth (Queens), Queens County i. Population Maspeth is a small community in the New York City borough of Queens. Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City, geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the western end of Long Island. The borough of Queens is also Queens County. The borough of Queens is the second largest in population behind Brooklyn with a Census-estimated 2,321,580 residents in 2014, approximately 48% of which are foreign- born. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. ii. Patient Accessibility Meeting patient needs in Queens presents the unique challenge of serving an extremely diverse client base. In Queens, residents speak an estimated 138 languages. All Salus Scientific dispensaries will adhere to protocols set out by organizations such as The Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters. Salus Scientif ic will contract with a reputable, HIPAA- compliant translation service such as RxTran, so that the organization and its team members may safely and effectively serve and educate all potential and current clients in their preferred languages, comply with all local, state, and federal regulations regarding medical and REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION pharmaceutical translation services, and maintain accurate communications with a linguistically diverse public. Having this service available in Queens will be essential to the dispensary there, but serving the needs of patients in Queens will help the other dispensaries better serve their patients as well. Salus Scientific will make sure that as much of the information that is disseminated to patients is translated into a language they speak as is possible. Salus Scientific hopes also to be able to print labels for medical marijuana products that are available in different languages. Salus Scientific will seek written approval from the Department before issuing any translations of statutorily required labeling language. Salus Scientific will create a relationship with the Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters and use their services in the dispensa ries, with the permission of the Department, to aid patients and dispensary staff. Making sure that all parties understand one another will ensure that the right product gets to the right patient with the right security information.

The Queens dispensary can be accessed via MTA bus routes Q67, Q32, and Q39. Salus Scientific acknowledges the need for physically accessible facilities that comply with all requirements stipulated by the Americans with Di sabilities Act. All facilities will meet these requirements prior to becoming operational. III. Spreading Medical Marijuana Education a. Goals Salus Scientific wants to cultivate a populous that is educated about medical marijuana, how to access it and how it helps patients. In order to assess the educational needs of the community, Salus Scientific will undertake an exten sive fact-finding mission. Examples of ways in which Salus Scientific will address the community's \u2014and its own \u2014educational needs include: i. Remaining knowledgeable and responsible about the community's diverse cultural beliefs on medical marijuana. For example, Salus Scientific is staying up to date on the Orthodox Union's plans to approve kosher certified medical marijuana and plans to produce and distribute koshe r certified marijuana products. ii. Anticipating that concerned citizens may have fears about medical marijuana being linked with crime, mental illness, or underage use. Salus Scientific does not seek to brush aside the concerns of comm unity members, and when concerns are based on myth, misinformation, or speculation, we aim to mitigate such concerns with public education. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION b. Community Partnership One of the best ways to increase community e ducation is by creating partnerships with local community-based organizations. Salus Scientific 's community partners will include local hospitals. Employees will also be encouraged to volunteer at educational and community organizations geographically close to the Salus Scientific facilities. These employees will be instructed that their purpose in volunteering is not to educate the students on medical marijuana products but to positively represent Salus Scien tific and the medical marijuana industry while giving back to the local community. c. Transparency and Availability of Dispensaries Salus Scientific will work to open its doors to the fact-finding missions of various other groups, including community organizations and local governments. Salus Scientific actively engages with the public in order to maintain tr ansparency and to ease the fears of community members. The organization will engage with th e following community entities in these ways: i. Government and Law Enforcement. Salus Scientific will comply with all government regulations and cooperate with local government and law enforcement agencies and personnel. Salus Scientific believes in working with law enforcement to create relationships that improve the safety of the entire community. ii. Community and Non-Profit Groups. Salus Scientific will establish and maintain productive corporate partnerships with community and environmental organizations, exploring relationships with groups including the National Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club New York City, Environment New York and the New York Environmental Justice Alliance. REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION d. Company Procedures: The Environment and the Community The Salus Companies are committed to minimizing the environmental footprint of all of their operations, from cultivation through dispensi ng. The companies will only use agricultural and horticultural practices that avoid, to the grea test extent possible, the use of herbicides and pesticides and conserve, to the greatest extent pos sible, soil and water associated with the land used for cultivation. With regard to harvesting and transportation of product, Salus Scientific will use equipment that produces the lowest emi ssions profile that can be readily obtained. By limiting power use and waste, Salus Scientific will seek to obtain LEED status for the processing facility and operations, with the guidance and support of the Green Building Council, NYSERDA and the local utility. If necessary, Sa lus Scientific will seek funding from the New York Green Bank to help purchase and install state of the art building materials and equipment. Finally, Salus Scientific will study the feasibility of installing renewable energy technologies on- site, including solar, anaerobic digestion, small wind and fuel cells.

Critical Safety Overview Throughout these instructions, this sy mbol is used to indicate that the instructions are critically important to your safety and the safety of your system.Failure to follow the instructions as written can result in a rapid release of highpressure CO 2 potentially causing equipment or personnel damage. WARNING Subcritical and Supercritical CO 2 systems operate under high pressure. Operators must be fully trained and familiar with the system. Failure to operate the system can result in equipment damage and/or bodily injury. WARNING Subcritical and Supercritical CO 2 systems use large amounts of CO 2 during operation. Ensure that system is installed in a well-ventilated area to prevent buildup of CO2 which can cause asphyxiation. Use of a CO 2 monitor is strongly recommended. WARNING Opening a vessel under pressure can result in a rapid release of pressure and ejection of the material inside the vessel. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN A VESSEL UNDER PRESSURE! Always make sure a vent path for the vessel is opened and the corresponding pressure gagereads zero prior to loosening the vessel closure bolts. WARNING Subcritical and Supercritical CO 2systems are designed to operate in doors. Extreme temperatures (below 50\u00b0F and above 85\u00b0F) will negatively impact the functionality of the system. The environmental temperature range is for the system, chiller, pump and CO 2 bottles. WARNING Only use Propylene Glycol and distilled water in the chiller and cooling system. Never use Deionized Water in the chiller or cooling system. WARNING Never turn on the chiller without the thermocouple probe installed and connected to the chiller. 452. Unpacking Instructions CO 2extraction systems are shipped in three separator crates. One containing the chiller, one containing the air compressor and one containing the botanical extraction system. Followingare the steps for removing the system from the crates and making service connections for initial use. 2.1. Shipping Crate Inspection 2.1.1. Prior to opening the crate(s), verify that that there was no external damage caused to the wood crate. If damage is found, do not accept the delivery from the shipping company without first opening the crate to verify that there was nodamage to the system. Figure 1. Approximate appearance of 1500-5L and 1500-20L Shipping Crate 2.1.2. Locate the two TiltWatch Plus sensors on the outside of the crate.

System Operation The following operating instructions are for the 1500-5L and 1500-20L CO 2-based Botanical Oil Extraction systems. Instructio ns assume that chiller and CO 2 Booster Pump are OEM supplied. Failure to follow the instructions provided below may void the warranty of the 1500-5L and 1500- 20L systems. 5.1. 1500-5L and 20L Overview Extraction Vessel Separation Vessels Chiller Collection Cup 155.2. Automation Systems Overview 5.2.1. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is a touch screen. Almost all of the inputs, outputs and human/machine interactions are managed through the HMI. The features not controlled or reported through the HMI are the Air Compressormaintenance schedule and the chiller/heater temperature setting. Refer to their respective owners manuals for additional operational instructions. 5.2.2. The HMI has two functions; 1) to provide information and 2) to accept inputs from the operator. The ways to determine if an action is required by the user are defined below. 5.2.2.1. If a display value or message is colored Red or Orange, an operator must take and action before progressing forward. 5.2.2.1.1. Red indicates messages indicate that a component of the system has either failed to reach the minimum operating pressures or temperatures or that it exceeded the programmed operating limits. 5.2.2.1.2. Orange indicates that an operator activity is required before the Start button can be depressed. Typically, messages highlighted Orange are indicative of a scheduled maintenance interval being reached. 5.2.3. Any variable or message that needs to be (or can be) controlled by the operator are graphically raised to illustrate that the \"message\" is a button. An example of the different graphical representations is shown below. Title/Output Display Input Button Figure 15. Chiller/Heater Remote Temperature Probe Connection 5.2.1. The controller has safety interlocks pr eprogrammed into it. These safety interlocks prevent unsafe operations from occurring by always monitoring the systemsparameters and by removing unsafe action/input control buttons from the HMI. When buttons appear to be missing from the home screen, it is because the system is performing an operation that would be unsafe in combination with themissing button/action. 5.2.2. The HMI will provide message popups (in yellow boxes) to instruct the operator what steps are required next in order in to complete any action selected. Most message popups are also acknowledgement buttons that must be pressed before any further action can be taken. 5.2.3. The primary operating valves on the 1500-5L and 1500-20L are air actuated valves controlled by the systems controller. In the event of an air compressor failure or a power failure all air actuated valve will close automatically. 5.2.4. Each air actuated valve has an indicator on the top to inform the operator which valves are open and which ones are closed. The indicator lines correspond with the flow direction. The following figure illustrates both and open and closed valve. Note that it does not matter which way the air actuator is oriented, rather the direction of CO 2 flow is important. ////HHHHeHHHHHea ttte r RRRem ttot eTTT em per ttat urePPPPPP16CO 2 Flow Direction CO 2 Flow Direction Figure 16. a) Valve 1 in the open position, b) Valve 1 in the closed position 5.3. Pre-Cleaning 5.3.1. The 1500-5L and 20L systems are constructed from 304 and 316 stainless steel and can be cleaned with any cleaner that is compatible with both stainless steeland your extracted product. Simple Green cleaner, ethanol and acetone work well for most applications. 5.3.2. The system should be cleaned to the appropriate level (determined by your application and corresponding regulations) prior to processing each batch ofbotanical material. 5.3.2.1. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the system meets their required level of cleanliness. 5.4. Opening Extraction Vessel WARNING DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN A VESSEL UNDER PRESSURE! Always make sure a vent path for the vessel is opened and thecorresponding pressure gauge(s) reads zero prior to loosening thevessel closure bolts. 5.4.1. This operation cannot be performed during an extraction. The extraction must be stopped prior to opening the Extraction vessel 5.4.2. From the home screen (see Figure 29), press \"Go To Manual Screen\" button. 5.4.3. From the manual screen (see Figure 30), press the \"Open Extractor Vessel\" button. 5.4.3.1. If the extractor is under pressure, the system will require the operator to acknowledge that they want to vent all the CO 2 in the extractor. 5.4.4. When the extractor vessel gauge on top of the vessel and on the home screen both read zero, it is safe to move to the next step. 5.4.5. Used the supplied impact wrench to remove the bolts from the top or bottom flange. 5.4.6. Pivot the flange toward the back and let it rest on the integral hinge stops. 5.4.6.1. Use caution not to scratch or otherwise damage the O-ring sealing surfaces on the flanges. 17Figure 17. Appearance of extractor vessel in open condition, note bolt can be placed in bolt rack below the flange 5.5. Loading Botanical or Other Media 5.5.1. Material to be extracted is loaded directly into the extraction vessel. The supplied funnel can be used to help minimize spillage. 5.5.1.1. Typically botanicals perform best in CO 2 extractions when ground to a particle size between 50 in and roughly the consistency of coffee grounds. 5.5.1.2. Any amount of material can be loaded into the Extraction Vessel - the vessel does not have to be full in order to operate correctly 5.5.2. Gentle compression or packing can be used to increase the amount of material loaded in the vessel, however heavy compaction should be avoided because it will cause channeling of CO 2 during the extraction process. 5.6. Closing Extraction Vessel 5.6.1. Ensure all sealing surfaces are clean and free of debris 5.6.2. Check the O-ring for any visible damage or defects. Replace as necessary 5.6.2.1. The O-ring does not require any lubrication 5.6.3. Close the vessel flange and install each of the closure bolts hand tight 5.6.4. Using the supplied impact wrench and socket, tighten the bolts in a star pattern. Use the supplied impact wrench with 1-2 second bursts to deliver approximately 50 ft-lbs of torque to each bolt. Heavy torqueing of the bolts is not required. 393 5 7 5 7 1 11 1 2 8 2 12 6 4 6 10 48 Figure 18. Torque sequence for 1500-5L and 1500-20L extraction vessels 5.7. Chiller Start Up 5.7.1. Verify chiller's cooling lines are connected to the extraction system. 185.7.2. Turn chiller on 5.7.2.1. The main power switch is located on the back of the chiller see Figure 14 5.7.2.2. The operations power button is located below the black knob on the front of the chiller 5.7.3. Set the target temperature to 65\u00b0F by quickly depressing the control knob on the chiller and turning it to the appropriate temperature. 5.7.3.1. In the event that the chiller is displaying temperatures in Celsius, turn off the main power switch, press and hold the menu button on the front of themachine and turn on the main power. Then let off the menu button. Thechiller will briefly display dF indicating it is set to display temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 5.8. Evacuating the System 5.8.1. From the Home Screen (see Figure 29), click the Manual Screen Button. 5.8.2. From the Manual Screen (see Figure 30), click the Evacuate Button. 5.8.3. Verify that all the gauges on the system display zero pressure.5.8.4. Verify that the supplied vacuum pump is filled with the appropriate oil. 5.8.4.1. Refer to the vacuum pump owners manual for more detailed information. 5.8.5. Connect the vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and vacuum pump to Valve 10 on the bottom of Separator #2. Figure 19. Appearance of correctly connected vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and vacuum pump 5.8.1. Open Valve 10. 5.8.2. Turn on the vacuum pump. 5.8.3. Allow the pump to run for approximately 10-min. 5.8.3.1. If the vacuum gauge does not reach -20 in.Hg, either the pump is faulty or there is a leak in the system. 5.8.4. Close Valve 10. 5.8.5. Turn off the vacuum pump. 5.8.6. Disconnect the vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and pump. 5.8.7. Press the message button acknowledging that the evacuation is complete 5.8.7.1. The acknowledgement message button will appear on the Manual Screen after pressing the Evacuate Button. 5.8.8. Press the Blue Arrow Buttons to select the Go To Home option on the Manual Screen and press the Return button \"enter\". 195.9. Conducting an Extraction 5.9.1. Press the Go To Auto Mode Button on the upper left hand corner of the Home Screen. 5.9.1.1. This resets the controller and enables it to start a new cycle/extraction. 5.9.1.2. The first time you run the system, immediately following a loss of power, or after any abnormal run conditions the system will default to Manual Modefor safety. 5.9.2. Verify the chiller is on and target temperature is set to 65\u00b0F. 5.9.3. Verify that a 50-lb, 75-lb or 100-lb cylinder of CO 2 with a sufficient amount of CO 2 is connected to the system. 5.9.4. Verify that material is loaded into extraction vessel and extraction vessel is properly closed 5.9.4.1. The system can be run with no material in the extraction vessel. This can be used as a way to clean the stainless steel tubing upstream of theseparation vessel. 5.9.5. Verify that the Separator vessels are both closed and sanitary clamps are tight (clamps are considered tight when there is a 1/16-in to 1/8-in between opposingsides of the clamp) Figure 20. Appearance of tight sanitary clamp 5.9.6. Press the Start button on the home screen, Figure 29. 5.9.7. After pressing start the system will prompt the operator to; 5.9.7.1. Set Extractor Pressure (between 900-psi and recommended starting extractor pressure is 1200-psi 5.9.7.2. Set the System Run Time (between 1-hour and 48-hours) 5.9.7.2.1. The recommended run time is 2 hours per pound of botanical 5.9.7.3. Verify the Extractor is properly closed 5.9.7.4. Verify the Separator is properly closed 5.9.7.5. Close Valve 10 5.9.7.6. Open the CO 2 Bottle 5.9.8. The system will start filling the vessels with CO 2 to the target extractor pressure. 5.9.8.1. During the filling stage the Ho me Screen will display a blue box labeled \"Filling\" to inform the operator of the systems current activities. 5.9.9. Once the target extractor pressure is reached, the system information box will change from \"Filling\" to \"Running\". An additional information box will appear indicating the direction of the flow, either \"Forward Flow\" or \"Reverse Flow\". 205.9.9.1. The system routinely switches the flow direction to keep the filters from clogging with plant material and to prevent the CO 2 from forming flow channels inside the plant material. 5.9.10. The system will continue in run mode until it reaches the target run time, at which point it will begin recovering the CO 2 into the CO 2 cylinder. The information box will switch from \"Running\" to \"Recovering\". 5.9.10.1. The system will prompt the operator to turn up the chiller/heater to 110-F. This helps to speed up the recovery process. 5.9.10.2. It is not a required step, the system will recover without turning up the temperature or acknowledging the message. 5.9.10.2.1. Note that increases the chiller/heater temperature also increases the temperature of the oil in the collection cup. 5.9.11. At the end of recovery the system will have approximately 70-psi in all the vessels. The system will provide me ssage boxes to instruct the operator through the final shut down process. The prompts are; 5.9.11.1. Close the CO 2 cylinder 5.9.11.2. Open Valve 10. 5.9.12. Once the operator acknowledges that the CO 2 cylinder and Valve 10 are closed, the system will open all valves, vent any trapped CO 2 and wait for the next command. 5.10. Removing Spent Botanical 5.10.1. From the home screen (see Figure 29), press \"Go To Manual Screen\" button. 5.10.2. From the manual screen (see Figure 30), press the \"Open Extractor Vessel\" button. 5.10.2.1. If the extractor is under pressure, the system will require the operator to acknowledge that they want to vent all the CO 2 in the extractor. 5.10.3. When the extractor vessel gauge on top of the vessel and on the home screen both read zero, it is safe to move to the next step. 5.10.4. Used the supplied impact wrench to remove the bolts from the top or bottom flange. 5.10.5. Pivot the flange toward the back and let it rest on the integral hinge stops. 5.10.5.1. Use caution not to scratch or otherwise damage the O-ring sealing surfaces on the flanges. 5.10.6. Once the extraction vessel is open, the spent botanical material can be removed with a dust collector or stainless steel vacuum. 5.10.6.1. Alternatively, the bottom vessel closure can be opened using the same instructions provided above. With the bottom closure open the botanical will fall out of the vessel and can be collected in a bag or other collectiondevice. 5.11. Oil Collection WARNING DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN A VESSEL UNDER PRESSURE! Always make sure a vent path for the vessel is opened and thecorresponding pressure gauge(s) reads zero prior to loosening thevessel closure bolts. 215.11.1. Verify that both Separator vessel gauges read zero and that Valve 10 is open. 5.11.2. Remove the flexible metal lines from the top of the separators. Use two wrenches to prevent the NPT fittings from loosening in the separator cap. Figure 21. Illustration of using two wrenches to remove flexible metal lines 5.11.3. Remove the yellow wire connected to the Separator #1 thermocouple.5.11.4. Use the 5/8-in ratchet wrench to remove the high pressure sanitary clamps from the top of both the separator vessels. 5.11.5. Remove the caps from the top of both separator vessels. 5.11.6. Collect any available oil from the separator caps. 5.11.7. Use acetone or alcohol to clean the caps and orifice tube. 5.11.7.1. Separator caps must be cleaned every run. 5.11.8. Use the supplied round squeegee to push any residual oil from the sides of the separators down to the bottom of the separators. 5.11.9. Use the 5/8-in ratchet wrench to remove the high pressure sanitary clamps from the bottom of the separator vessels. 5.11.10. Turn off the chiller/heater 5.11.11. Disconnect the two blue water line quick connects on the back of the collection cup. 5.11.12. Remove the collection cup from Separator #1 and the bottom cap from Separator #2 5.11.13. Collect the oil from inside the collection cup. 5.11.13.1.Note: there is typically residual dry ice in the collection cup mixed in with the oil. The dry ice will sublimate without any additional heat. It is sometimesmore efficient to remove the dry ice/oil mixture and place it in collection device (like a Pyrex dish). Figure 22. Image of collection cup after removal from separator. 225.11.14. Use the round squeegee an d alcohol or acetone to th oroughly clea n the inside of the separators and collection cup. 5.11.15. Both separators and the collection cup must be cleaned after each extraction. 5.11.16. Reassemble both separators by reversing the steps above. 5.11.16.1.Reconnect the water lines before turning on the chiller/heater. 5.11.17. Verify that the system is in its waiting mode and all valves are in the open position. 5.11.17.1.If Valve 11 is not open, skip to the next section. 5.11.18. Disconnect the separator outlet line from the cap of Separator #2 Figure 23. Image of separator outlet line after being disconnected. 5.11.19. Disconnect the pump inlet line at the tee immediately in front of the pump. Loosen the fitting in the same line (closer to the front of the system so the benttubing can be pointed downward. Figure 24. Image of pump inlet line before and after being disconnected. 5.11.20. Pour alcohol or acetone into the separator outlet line until the solvent is colorless coming out the end that was connected to the pump inlet. After which use compressed air to blow out the line ensuring that no residual alcohol oracetone remains in the line between the separator and the pump. 5.11.21. Reconnect the separator outlet line and pump inlet line. 5.11.22. The separator outlet line must be cleaned after each extraction. 6. Troubleshooting 6.1. Ice On SeparatorIt is normal for the high pressure clamps and flexible metal lines on the top of the separator toform ice during operation. If ice is forming on the outside of the separator vessels that is anindicator that either the chiller/ heater was not connected properly/turned on, the collection cup 23water lines were not reconnected, or that the CO 2 cylinders were too cold. If the bottles are below approximately 50\u00b0F, it is possible for the chille r/heater to have difficulty maintain system temperature. If ice forms on the outside of the separator vessel, it suggests that the coolantcannot keep up and may be freezing inside the cooling jacket. In either event, the systemshould be shut down by pressing the Recover CO 2 Button on the Manual. This will put the system into recovery mode so that the cooling system can be inspected or the bottle can warm up. It will take several hours for the ice to thaw if it froze inside the collection cup cooling jacket. Do not attempt to work on the cooling system while the system is running. 6.2. Opened Bottle Too Early If the bottle was accidently opened while the system was in stand by (waiting after previous extraction was completed) there is no way to recover the 100% CO 2. The only way to correct this event is to slowly open Valve 10 until the separator pressure is below 300-psi. At which point the system can be started and it will operate as normal. 6.3. Low Extractor Pressure If the extractor pressure is unable to meet the target pressure, first verify that the CO 2 cylinder has sufficient CO 2. If yes, this is an indicator that the pump seals have reached the end of their life. If the extractor is above 1000-psi, the system will continue producing oil. Adjust the target pressure to 1000-psi and alloy it system complete its target run time, it is recommended that the run time be increased by 10% to make up for the reduced extractor pressure. After the systemcompletes the cycle, either rebuild the pump or send it out for a rebuild. Manufacturer can provide contact information for pump rebuild if it is going to be sent out. 6.4. Extractor Overpressure - Orifice Clog The valveless expansion technology uses a small orifice to regulate pressure. This orifice canbecome plugged when foreign material is entered into the plumbing between the extractionvessel and separator vessel. Typically, the foreign material is a piece of Teflon tape from theNPT fittings near the orifice. In the event that separator pressure decreases or extractor pressure increases causing an extractor high pressure fault, it is most likely a plugged orifice.

Press the popup message button when orifice is reinstalled, the high pressure clamps are tight and the flexible hoses are reconnected. 6.5. Low Separator Pressure - Orifice ClogLow Separator pressure is typically caused by one of two things (an orifice clog or the wrongorifice installed). If the system has been operating with the current orifice and consistently maintained a separator pressure between 250-psi and 350-psi, this suggests that the orifice is clogged. To correct an orifice clog refer to the instructions in the section above (ExtractorOverpressure).6.6. Low Separator Pressure - Wrong Orifice SizeLow Separator pressure is typically caused by one of two things. If the orifice was recently changed or the system was moved to a new location, the low separator pressure is typically anindicator that the installed orifice is too small.

System Maintenance Maintenance on the system is critical to proper operation. Failure to follow these maintenance items can cause premature system failure and void the warranty. The maintenance items below pertain to the CO 2 system only. Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance plan for the chiller/heater unit and the air compressor. This maintenance schedule is based on the maintenance timer on the Maintenance Screen (see Figure 31). Frequency Maintenance Item After Each Extraction xRemove spent material from the extraction vessel by vacuuming it out through the top flange. xVerify the extractor filters are clear and free of debris xCheck extraction vessel O-rings and O-rings groove sealing surfaces for damage - replace if necessary xRemove extracted oil from separator vessels and clean entire vessel and cup with acetone or alcohol. xClean the separator outlet line/pump inlet line with acetone or alcohol. xCheck separator vessel gaskets for damage - replace if necessary WeeklyxLubricate CO 2 pump spool valve O-rings. Replace if necessary. xClean all flexible metal lines going into and out of both separators xCheck chiller/heater water level is between min and max xClean CO 2 flow lines between the pump and the coiled heat exchanger with acetone or alcohol. Flowlines must be disconnected from pump and extraction system to thoroughly clean. MonthlyxRemove the CO 2 pump heads and clean with alcohol or acetone. Do not remove the seals from the head unless they show visible signs of wear. In which case, replace the seals before reassembly. Every 500 HoursxReplace all seals on the CO 2 Pump. The pump seal life is highly dependent on cleanliness. Lack of performing scheduled maintenance will decrease seal life.REQUEST F OR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Critical Infrastructure (POL \u00a7 86[5]) - Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION Attachment D Section 2: Transportation and Distribution (\u00a7 1004.5(b)(4)) Redacted pursuant to N.Y.

Salus Scientific is committed to providing patients and employees with safe, clean, a nd responsible medical marijuan a manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The four dispensing facilities and one manufacturing facility will create much- needed jobs. Salus Scientific strives to be a model busin ess by establishing productive partnerships with law enforcement agencies and area non-profits; putting safe environmental practices in place; and hiring local employees to help boost the state's economy. Salus Scientific also has a plan to educate the public on marijuana law, safe practices, the marijuana plant itself and general marijuana industry prac tices and standards. A well-educ ated public means the entire industry has a better chance of moving forward in a positive direction. Below is our likely impact on the community and our plan for meeting the need s of the patients in the state of New York. II. Salus Scientific Facilities Salus Scientific plans to open facilities across the state: xManufacturing Plant: 100 Oakda le St, Johnson City, NY 1: 4700 Vestal Parkway East Vestal, NY 13850 xDispensary 2: 26183 US 11 Evans Mills, NY 13637 xDispensary 3: 6801 Kinne St. diversity of Salus Scientific's f acilities. See reproduction of Application Attachment A, included at the end of this Section, for maps and street views of individual locations. The location of these f acilities is meant to help increase economic development, create jobs, aid in patient accessibility, and crea te greater community cooperation and education. Salus Scientific projects that by establishing their facilities they will create 24 security jobs, 50 dispensary jobs, and 126 manufacturing jobs, totaling 200 new jobs across the state. a. Johnson City, Broome County i. Population The Manufacturing Plant is located in Johnson City, which belongs to the Broome County/Binghamton Metropolitan Area, collectivel y the Southern Tier. In 2010, Broome County had 200,600 residents, making it the most populous county in New York's Southern Tier region. Broome County counts Tioga county to th e west, Delaware County to the east, and Cortland and Chenango Counties to the north and the Northern Tier of Pennsylvania as its the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Population centers include the Town of Uni on (56,346), the City of Binghamton (47,376), and the Town of Vestal (28,043) in Broome County and the Town of Owego (19,883) in Tioga County. Together, these four communities co mprise 60% of the population of the Binghamton MSA. Salus Scientific is c onscientious of the changes in th e economy in the Southern Tier region. When the fracking industry promise did not come to fruition after the recession, economic rebound did not seem promising. In the last few years the unemployment rate in Broome County has been greater than the statewid e average. In 2011 the unemployment rate in Broome County was 8.5% and in the state as a whole it was 8.2%, but by January of 2013 the unemployment rate in Broome County had ex panded to 10.2%. Unemployment in Broome County grew the most in the private sector, but st rong job growth in health care, social services and construction helped to keep the unemplo yment rate from reaching higher numbers. Working with partners in Broome County, Sa lus Scientific will cr eate a place where residents can rely on jobs that help them and their community to become more integrated and prosperous. ii. Economic Impact Salus Scientific antic ipates that it will initially create 126 manufacturing jobs and six security jobs at the manufacturing plant, with the potential to add more manufacturing jobs and dedicated transportation positions. The manufacturing jobs will increase if the demand for medical marijuana products at the dispensaries grows. Salus Scientific anticipates that the Department will approve its plan to deliver medical marijuana products to patients. If this occurs, job creation for dedicated drivers from the manufacturing plant to the dispensari es will be necessary to fulfill the strong healthcare presence in Broome County, Salus Scientific believes that there will be many opportunities to learn from the heal thcare sector when it comes to developing new products to serve patient needs and to help edu cate the region's healthcare providers on medical marijuana, the products the manufacturing plant pr oduces and the benefits eligible patients could receive from medical marijuana recommendation. The largest Healthcare provider in Broome County is United Health Services (UHS). UHS is a comprehensive regional health care system that operates two hospitals in Broome County: Binghamton General Hospital, a full -service hospital founded in 1888, and Wilson Medical Center, a teaching hospita l that provides a range of medical and surgical services, in Johnson City. UHS also has primary care centers, walk -in clinics, and medical offices throughout the Southern Tier, serves as a lead ing provider of home care services and offers nursing care, assisted living, and private apar tments at its Ideal Senior Living Center in Endicott. In 2011, UHS completed an expans ion of its Cardiac Re habilitation Program at Binghamton General Hospital, and initiated a fundraising campaign for a $5 million expansion of the Intensive Care Unit at Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City. The latter is the first major upgrade to the unit since the mid -1970s. In addition, constr uction was completed on a $29 million project to build a new state -of-the-art primary care center in Vestal, across from Binghamton University. UHS would be an excelle nt Healthcare partner for Salus Scientific. b. Vestal, Broome County The dispensary closest to the manufacturing plant will be in Vestal. Vestal is also In addition to the jobs created by the manufacturing facility, the Vestal dispensary would bring an additional 12-15 dispensary staff jobs and 2-6 security jobs, with the potential for expansion as the patient base expands and if Salus Scientific is eventually permitted to deliver medical marijuana products directly to patients. ii. Patient Accessibility Having a dispensary located in such close proximity to the manufacturing plant will increase the speed with which patients served by the Vestal dispensary can have access to the medical marijuana products that they need. Additionally, many patients will access dispensaries via public transportation. The Vestal dispensary is served by Broome County Transit. c. Evans Mills, Jefferson County i. Population Evans Mills is a village in Jefferson County in Northern New York. The population was 621 at the 2010 census. The Village of Evans Mills in within the Town of Le Ray and is northeast of Watertown. The total Jefferson County population as of the 2010 U.S. Census is 116,229 people. The City of Watertown has a population of 27,023. The la rgest town is the Town of LeRay with a population of 21,782 people. The relatively large population of LeRay is attributed to the military presence of Fort Drum. By comparison, th e town with the smallest population is the Town of Worth, with a total of 231 residents. Th ere are 22 Towns, 20 Villages, and one City in Jefferson Jefferson County is government, employing almost 40% of the workforce. That is largely due to the presence of Fort Drum and the two state prisons in the County. Fort Drum is located nine miles east of Watertown and is home to more than 36,900 soldiers, family members and civ ilian employees of the 10th Mount ain Division (Light Infantry) and its supporting tenants. Fort Drum is the larges t Army installation in the Northeast. Fort Drum occupies 107,265 acres in Jefferson County and stretches across the Towns of LeRay, Philadelphia, Antwerp, and Wilna. With around 24,000 employees, Fort Drum is the largest single-site employer in Jefferson County and in Upstate New York. With a location in Evans Mills, qualifying patients from other medical marijuana program states who are displaced due to assignment to Fort Drum will still have access to the medical ma rijuana products they need. d. East Syracuse, Onondaga County i. Population and Location East Syracuse is a part of the city of Sy racuse in eastern Onondaga County. As of the 2010 U.S. census, the village has a population of 3,084, greater Syracuse has a population of 145,170 and Onondaga County had a population of 467,026. The city of Syracuse is situated in the approximate center of the county and serv es as the focus for commercial and business activities. Onondaga County is conveniently situated at the intersection of Interstate Highways 81 and 90 (NYS Thruway). Local Amtrak and Greyh ound terminals are located in the new Regional Transportation Center. One can also reach the city by air using Hancock International Airport, while the New York State Barge Canal System provides local connection by boat to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence In 2013 the Syracuse Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 9.8%, which was a .3% increase from the year before and was much higher average than greater Onondaga County (6.7%), greater New York (7.7%) and the United States (7.4%). The introduction of a Salus Scientific dispensary into East Syracuse will bring reliable jobs to the region, with the potential for further job growth as the medical marijuana patient base grows. Salus Scientific anticipates an initial staff of 12-15 as dispensary staff and 2-6 as security staff. iii. Patient Accessibility As Syracuse is the business center of Onondaga County, transit into and from Syracuse is readily available. Bus service in Onondaga is provided by four carriers, including three independent carriers and CENTRO, which is operated by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority. Inter-city service is provided by a number of providers, including Greyhound and Adirondack Trailways. iv. Community Partners In Onondaga County five of the largest empl oyers are healthcare providers. The area's largest employer, the Upstate Me dical University, a medical sc hool that includes University Hospital, is the home of one of the country's elev en Joslin Centers for Diabetes. It is also the region's trauma center, burn center, kidney tran splant center and pediatric emergency center. The University has also been given grants to research spinal cord and wrist injuries and to improve emergency response capabilities. University Hospital expanded the hospital's east wing to include a two-story children's hospital, creating Central New York's Children's Hospital at University Hospital. The $99 million five-story vertical expansion increased the amount of space dedicated to pediatric me dicine from 18,000 square feet to 87,000 square feet, which can house 50 private patient rooms and other amenities catering to the children and families cared for at the hospital will help to further poten tial patient education, especially in the pediatric ward, and to help to serve patient needs in the state. Salus Scientific would like to work with the hospital to have visitors and potential patients counsel with the dispensary pharmacists to answer questions that potential patients and visitors from the hospital have about medical marijuana products. In all, Onondaga County's health care system includes five hospitals, over 1,500 practicing physicians, two mental health centers , numerous ambulatory care programs, and a full range of long-term care facilities. Salus Scientific will attempt to reach out and create connections with as many of these institutions as possible. e. Maspeth (Queens), Queens County i. Population Maspeth is a small community in the New Yo rk City borough of Queens. Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boro ughs of New York City, geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the western end of Long Island. The borough of Queens is also Queens County. The borough of Queens is the second largest in population behind Brooklyn with a Census-estimated 2,321,580 re sidents in 2014, approximately 48% of which are foreign- born. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. ii. Patient Accessibility Meeting patient needs in Queens presents the unique challenge of serving an extremely diverse client base. In Queens, residents speak an estimated 138 languages. All Salus Scientific dispensaries will adhere to protocols set out by organizations such as The Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters. Salus Scientific will contract with a reputable, HIPAA- compliant translation service such as RxTran, so that the organization and its team members may safely and effectively serve and educate all potential and current clients in their preferred languages, comply with all local, state, and federal regulations regarding medical maintain accurate communications with a linguistically diverse public. Having this service available in Queens will be essential to the dispensary there, but serving the needs of patients in Queens will help the other dispensaries better serve their patients as well. Salus Scientific will make sure that as much of the information that is disseminated to patients is translated into a language they speak as is possible. Salus Scie ntific hopes also to be able to print labels for medical marijuana products that are availa ble in different languages. Salus Scientific will seek written approval from the Department before issuing any translations of statutorily required labeling language. Salus Scientific will create a relationship w ith the Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters and use their services in the dispensa ries, with the permission of the Department, to aid patients and dispensary staff. Making sure that all parties understand one another will ensure that the right product gets to the right patie nt with the right security information. Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters\u2014Utica Office 287 Genesee St., Suite #101 Utica, NY 13501 (315) 732-2271 Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters\u2014Albany Office 33 Central Ave., 3rd Floor Albany, NY 12210 (518) 426-1626 Multicultural Association of Medical Interpreters\u2014 Syracuse Office 731 James St., Suite 315 Syracuse, NY 13203 (315) 214-5003 RxTran 10 will access their local dispensary via public transportation. The Queens dispensary can be accessed via MTA bus routes Q67, Q32, and Q39. Salus Scientific ac knowledges the need for physically accessible facilities that comply with all requirements stipulated by the Americans with Disabilities Act. All facilities will meet these requirements prior to becoming operational. III. Spreading Medical Marijuana Education a. Goals Salus Scientific wants to cultivate a populous that is educated about medical marijuana, how to access it and how it helps patients. In order to assess the educational needs of the community, Salus Scientif ic will undertake an extensive fact -finding mission. Examples of ways in which Salus Scientific will address the community's \u2014and its own\u2014educational needs include: i. Remaining knowledgeable a nd responsible about the community's diverse cultural beliefs on medical marijuana. For example, Salus Scientific is staying up to date on the Orthodox Union's plans to approve kosher certified medical marijuana and plans to produce and distribute koshe r certified marijuana products. ii. Anticipating that concerned citizens ma y have fears about medical marijuana being linked with crime, menta l illness, or underage use. Salus Scientific does not seek to brush aside the concerns of co mmunity members, and when concerns are based on myth, misinformation, or specula tion, we aim to mitigate such concerns One of the best ways to increase community education is by creating partnerships with local community-based organizations. Salus Scientific's community partners will include local hospitals. Employees will also be encouraged to volunteer at educational and community organizations geographically close to the Salus Scientific facilities. These employees will be instructed that their purpose in volunteering is not to educate the student s on medical marijuana products but to positively represen t Salus Scientif ic and the medical ma rijuana industry while giving back to the local community. c. Transparency and Availability of Dispensaries Salus Scientific will work to open its doors to the f act-finding missions of various other groups, including community organizations and local governments. Salu s Scientific actively engages with the public in order to maintain transparency and to ease the fears of community members. The organization will engage with the following community entities in these ways: i. Government and Law Enforcement. Salus Scientific will comply with all government regulations and coopera te with local government and law enforcement agencies and personnel. Salu s Scientific believes in working with law enforcement to create relationships that improve the safety of the entire community. ii. Community and Non-Profit Groups. Salus Scientific will estab lish and maintain productive corporate partnerships w ith community and environmental organizations, exploring relationships with groups including the National Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club New York City, Environment New York and the New York Environmental Justice and the Community The Salus Companies are committed to minimizing the environmental footprint of all of their operations, from cultivation through dispensing. The companies will only use agricultural and horticultural practices that a void, to the greatest extent possible, the use of herbicides and pesticides and conserve, to the greatest extent possible, soil and water associated with the land used for cultivation. With regard to harvestin g and transportation of product, Salus Scientific will use equipment that produces the lowest emissi ons profile that can be readily obtained. By limiting power use and waste, Salus Scientific will seek to obtain LEED status for the processing facility and operations, with the guidance and support of the Green Building Council, NYSERDA and the local utility. If necessary, Salus Scientific will seek funding from the New York Green Bank to help purchase and install stat e of the art building materials and equipment. Finally, Salus Scie ntific will study the feasibility of inst alling renewable energy technologies on- site, including solar, anaerobic di gestion, small wind buildings, property, and facilities used for manufacturing and dispensing pursuant to PHL \u00a7 3365 and 10 NYCRR \u00a7 1004.5(b)(2). 1.

Public Officers Law, Art. 6$WWDFKPHQW\u0003 D.6.1 \u00036WDQGDUG\u0003 Operating Procedure: Organizational Overview Salus Scientific, LLC - Executive Summary Company Mission: Cultivating global medical breakthroughs in New York. Company Vision Combining over 200 years of pioneering scientif ic research, industry safety, and security benchmarks with a collaborative community of world-class innovators, Salus Scien tific will provide pure, safe, and consistent cannabinoid medicines to New Yo rk's qualified patients. We aim to employ good manufacturing practices, pe rform standardized extractions, and formulate consistent cannabinoid medicine. Salus Scientific is at the forefront of medical cannabis research and delivery. Our comprehensive team of researchers, physicians, cultivators, manufacturers and patient care specialists has the unique expertise to produce a safe, consistent and sustainable supply of cannabis-derived, pharmaceutical-grade medicines. Through integrity, transparency, reliability and stewardship, we will provide efficient and affordable access for the relief of New York's countless qualifying patients in need. Our Team and Inspiration At its core, Salus Scientific's culture comes from its most valued asset - its people. By strategically partnering extensive scientific research and industry knowledge from around the nation and the globe, Salus Scientif ic is able to empower local New York resources to match passion with relevant expertise, compassion with global teamwork and responsible science with innovative products to move New York State into the forefront of all aspects of this nascent industry. Salus Scien tific provides a unique, made-in-New-Yo rk solution: global in reach, but clearly local in economic and social impact. Salus Scientific cofounder and Chairman of the Board Michael P. Falcone, a fifth generation New Yorker, contributes his passion for commun ity development in New York State to the opportunities created by the region's emerging medi cal cannabis industry. As an owner of an organic farm and several wineries in New Yor k, Mr. Falcone sees the potential for 200 medical marijuana manufacturing and retail jobs to be created by Salus Scientific and its partners in New York. Creating economic devel opment while providing innovative, research-oriented patient solutions will compound the local benefit where it is needed most. Through her work with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain He alth, Salus Scientific cofounder and CEO Nicole Ruvo Falcone has beco me passionate about the use of medical cannabis to treat devastating c onditions. Her entire family has dedicated themselves to the treatment of neurological conditions like Alzhei mer's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) throug h the fundraising of over $200 million for the Keep Memory Alive Foundation to operate th e clinic. Ms. Ruvo Falcone brings a unique business-minded desire for clinical research in ne urology and has a successful career of bringing highly regulated products to market. The lynchpin to the recent move to regulated ma rijuana access across much of the nation stems from the compounding effect of br illiant scientific research from Israel, formulated by Salus Scientific team members over deca des of isolated study with the move to demonstrable efficacy in usage. This is embodied by Salus Scientific team members' involvement in the forwarding of medicinal marijuana usage by children in Colora do. Chris Stubbs, long passionate about proper dosage and the responsible labelling of cannabi s-related products, actually counseled the Figi family (Charlotte's Web) on the appropriateness of canna bis-derived medicines, sourced the high cannabidiol (CBD) cultivars from locals, and helped to formulate and test the first delivery systems in this nationally significant case. Hi s recent work, embodied in the rigorous devotion to detailed production protocols (GenCanna Production PlatformTM), has enabled the leading industrial hemp producer in Kentucky to pr ovide jobs in producti on, laboratory testing, processing, formulation, produc t development and branding. The most exciting discoveries relating to the application of cannabis-derived medicines to various disease-states have yet to be scientifically demonstrate d. This has led Dr. Perry Fine, past President of the American Association of Pa in Management, to bring to Salus Scientific his considerable efforts as a new br eed of clinicians slowly begin to embrace this new treatment modality. With his ability to bridge the gap between global research and the clinical proof of efficacy, Dr. Fine inspires growing confidence in new treatment modalities. Furthermore, his colleague and CEO of ISA Scie ntific, Dr. Mark Rosenfeld, ha s done an outstanding job of securing intellectual property and technological market solutions for the delivery of CBD in relevant disease states. Hugh Hempel, Vice President of Community Serv ices, and his wife, Chris, know firsthand the power of cannabis to treat epilepsy. Though thei r identical 11-year-old twin daughters, Addison and Cassidy, are currently using cannabis oils rich in CBD to alleviate seizures related to a fatal genetic disorder that presents as childhood Al zheimer's, the Hempels did not always have a reliable supply of high quality me dicine; before turning to cannabis treatments, their work with top Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) officials to create an experimental pharmaceutical medicine for their daughters resulted in the initiation of current clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This medicine has been used to tr eat terminally ill children around the world. In order to achieve the goal of finding a cure for serious public health epidemics such as diabetes, chronic pain, cancer, a nd immunological and neurological disorders including adult and childhood onset Alzheimer's through medical canna bis research, Salus Scie ntific depends on the crucial ingredient of a highly skilled team of professionals with hands on experience in the cannabis industry. Salus Scientific has a ssembled many of the most recognized professionals from the global cannabis industry including chemists, clinicians, agronomists, leading cannabinoid researchers, world-cl ass botanists and operators fr om several western states and New York's leading physicians. Salus Scientific also intends to pursue research relationships with the new Binghamton University School of Ph armacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In each instance, these professionals are recognized as leading experts in their field, and their portfolio of patents, proprietary pr ocesses, publications and trials prove it. Jim Rice, Vice President of Operations for Salus Scientific, opened High Level Health as a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver, CO in September of 2009 and it currently remains one of the premier marijuana dispensaries in Denver , with two locations serving both the recreational and medical markets. High Level Health has maintained their market leading position through strong vertical integration, effe ctive management, tight inventory and financial controls, superior products, strict adherence to compliance and main taining a loyal customer base. Additionally, High Level Health owns and operates two mar ijuana production facilities comprised of 10 acres with 20,000 square feet of active grow space a nd an additional 67,000 square feet of warehouse space for potential future expansion. Salus Scientific has embraced all aspects of it s security footprint because the new industry requires top-down compliance in every regard. The ability to bring forward decades of experience from the DEA, ATF, TSA, NYPD and NYSP to internalize this in Salus Scientific's culture is a testament to the organization's broa d strength through its people and the clear path towards assuaging any and all fears that this ne w industry is anything other than completely transparent. Salus Scientific al so intends to employ security personnel from the pool of local retired law enforcement officers who are familiar with not only law enforcement, but the local communities Salus Scientific will be working in. Company Values Integrity: A sense of follow-through is sorely lacking in the medical cannabis industry. Our team has been dedicated, for many years now, to truth in dosing and labeling, community involvement, training, providing jobs, and positiv ely impacting the lives of patients that need palliative care involving cannabis therapies. Transparency: A sense of transparency in our oper ational motivations means that Salus Scientific can have meaningful implications on industry and research surrounding the medical cannabis program in New York by sharing data and intellectual property while keeping employees and patients safe. Paramount to our success is providing transparency in production methods so that the lives of patients are positiv ely impacted. Furthermor e, our security team lends a sense of regulatory importance with respect to compliance that is top-notch. Reliability: Our spectrum of care is predicated on guaranteed dosing levels and testing standardization, safe methods of administration, and a commitment to expanding our capabilities to best educate and serve patients in need. S imply put, being able to serve a patient population that has found something that works for them is extremely important. We firmly believe it is unethical to provide a beneficial treatment that works, then not have it available in the future. This problem is widespread in the cannabis indus try; patients often find a product that works for them, but cannot reproduce the result because the produc t line is erratic in its formulated content. Community Stewardship: Developing a sense of responsibility in the community is key to the success of any business. The c ontroversial nature of medical cannabis necessitates responsibility through scientific knowledge. We intend to le ad our community involvement efforts through a series of outreach mechanisms and research endea vors that help inform and educate the public in a positive and responsible manner. In support of these values, Salus Scientific has created four critical advisory boards: Advisory Board, Physician Advisory Boar d, Science Advisory Board and Security Advisory Board. This ensures that everything we do is grounded in decade s of specifically relevant experience and in the best interest of our patients. Once Salus Scientific becomes operational, a Community Advisory Board will be created and local communi ty leaders will be appointed as members. As Salus Scientific begins serving certified patients, we will also establish an advisory board specifically for the indivi duals we directly serve. Company Goals Salus Scientific will meet an aggressive op erational timeline of six (6) months without issue due to the experience of our team's operational fortitude. Salus Scientific estimates an ability to provide 200 local jobs and begin local and statewide public education programs in the can nabinoid clinical and research sciences. Salus Scientific will pursue research partnerships with Cornell University, as well as programmatic and educ ational opportunities with the ne w Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Standardize cannabinoid dosing, testing and labeling practices through internal testing and external collaboration with labs and other industry partners. Develop products more familiar to patients and physicians to increase acceptance and emphasize New York State's evolution of cannabis-derived medicine delivery. Develop responsive formularie s and delivery innovations for specific ailments with the intent of carrying out clinical trials with existing clinical networks. Support the Department of Health in the thoughtful consid eration of expanding the list of recognized conditions to eventually include Alzheimer's, PTSD, chronic pain, and a host of other illnesses shown clinically to respond to cannabinoid therapies. Impact the agronomic side of research and development through future participation in the New York hemp program with industry experts GenCanna Global. Salus Scientific Research Advantage Mankind has used the cannabis plant as both food a nd medicine for centuries. In recent decades the plant has been exhaustively studied by our partners and advisers who have created a significant and industry-renowned body of evidence regarding cannabis's pote ntial as a treatment for some of humanity's most devastating conditions, such as diabetes, chronic pain and numerous neurological conditions. Salus Scientific, through its part ners, owns, controls and/or othe rwise has exclusive rights to: An extensive cannabis-specific patent library from decades of research and development, many of which are specific for the use of CBD to treat diabetes, cancer, and cancer- related pain. Next generation technology for bioavailab ility, extraction, and related processes. Four patents pending on phytocanna binoid extraction and purification. Proprietary patents based on water soluble liquids and powder technology of CBDiolTM.

Attachment D.6.2: Standard Operati ng Procedures: Human Resources 1. Salus Scientific Mission Statement and Values a.

Led by a team of seasoned business owners, experienced cannabis cultivators and compassionate healers, Salus Scientific o ffers a holistic and educational healing approach to help its patients maintain a higher quality of life. In compliance with 10 NYCRR \u00a7 1004.14(b), no board member, officer, manager, owner, partner, principal stakeholder or member of a regist ered organization shall have an interest or voting rights in the laboratory performing medical marijuana testing. b. We have many values that define who we are and that set us apart. At Salus Scientific, we strive to understand and facilitate the patients' needs, ensuring they have the product they need and the research they deserve. We cultivate a company atmosphere based on prof essionalism, education, compassion, security, and privacy. Salus Scientific strives to respect and honor the medical marijuana laws set forth by the State of New York and the local jurisdictions in which we will operate. c. We provide a variety of high quality medi cal marijuana solutions for patients and ensure that their experience with the medicine is positive and comfortable. Helping keep the local communities safe, clean, and peaceful is also very important for Salus Scientif ic. We plan to be active supporters of local charities, local culture, and the local economy. At Salu s Scientific, we believe that it is our responsibility to be a positive example to both the marijuana industry and for other communities working to revise medical marijuana laws. d. Our employees are what make everything possible. Providing our employees with a safe, friendly and positive working environment will ensure that our mission is carried out. Eliminating negative stigmas attached to medical marijuana and patients seeking treatment, through industry-leading services, charitable outreach, ongoing research and continuing education, is also a value that Salus Scientific strongly believes in.2. Equal Opportunity Employment a. Salus Scientific is an equal employment opportunity employer. All employment decisions are based on merit and on our business needs. Salus Scientific will not base employment needs or preferences on race, color, citizenship status, national origin, ancestry, gender, sexual orient ation, age, religion, creed, physical or mental disability, marital status, veteran status, political affiliation, or any other trait that is protected by law. Salus Scientific complies with the laws regarding reasonable accommodation for handi capped and disabled employees. 3. Staffing Plan a. The human resources department will evaluate work performance at Salus Scientific on an ongoing ba sis, and determine whether new positions need to be created and also whether the company requires new hires to assist in the workplace duties. It is important to have a sufficient amount of employees so that every aspect of Salus Scientific can be properly executed. We believe that being understaffed is never an option; such a situation can lead to unsafe work conditions and low quality work product. b. In determining whether new hires are needed, human resources will also evaluate the department that requires new hire s and determine whether the business climate at Salus Scientific is able to support new hires. Economic forecasts should be conducted to better un derstand the effects of changes in staffing. 4. Hiring and Recruiting a. Hiring new employees is an exciting and challenging process at Salus Scientific. We strive to hire people that meet our strict standards and comply with all applicable state and local laws. Candi dates will be placed through several screenings to ensure that we are able to select the best fit for us. After writing a detailed job description and placing the open position available on proper recruitment boards, the hiring process can begin. b. As a first step, only applications from applicants who are over 21 years old and who have no convictions of any felony for the sale or possession of drugs, narcotics, or controlled substances will be considered. Those applicants who meet the requirements will then be given a short telephonic interview. Successful candidates will then be scheduled for in-person interviews with supervising managers. If, at this point, supervising mana gers are not ready to offer candidates a position, the candidates may be given a second interview. This process will ensure that only the candidates that best fit Salus Scientific will be recruited. 5. Employee Benefits a. Retaining talented employees is important for Salus Scientific. Competent employees benefit the company tremendously, and to that end we offer a competitive employee benefits package to all eligible employees. b. All Salus Scientific employees will be given time off to perform their civic duties, such as voting and jury duty. Paid time off will be given to eligible employees who use their accrued vacation time. Employees must request their time off in a timely manner; otherwise it may be difficult or impossible for Salus Scientific to accommodate sudden requests. Exceptions will be made for bereavement leave and other unforeseen situations. c. At Salus Scientific, we ar e proud to offer our employees fully subsidized health, vision, and dental health plans. Add itionally, employee's immediate family members qualify, as do dome stic partners. By ensuring the health of our employees, our employees can in return perform their dutie s and responsibilities to the fullest of their abilities, reduce absences due to illness, and maintain a healthy workplace environment.

Public Officers Law, Art. 6R EQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FOIL Critical Infrastructure (POL \u00a7 86[5]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 68. Employee Communication a. At Salus Scientific, we en courage you to discuss any issue you may have with a co-worker directly with that person. Such a discussion should not adversely interfere with work-related duties. In the event that you and your coworker are unable to reach a resolution, your next st ep is to arrange a meeting with your supervisor to discuss any concern, probl em, or issue that arises during the course of your employment. From time to time, Salus Scie ntific will conduct employee meetings. All information di scussed in an employee meeting is considered confidential and may not be di scussed outside of the workplace or with non-employees. It is understandable that every once in a while, employees may misinterpret information, and pass along that information as gossip or rumor. Such miscommunications harm the mission of Salus Scientific, and we encourage employees to speak with their supervisors if they have questions or concerns. All employees will be given oppor tunities to discuss their ideas on how to make the workplace at Salus Scientific a better place. 9. Harassment Policy a. The workplace environment at Salus Scientific will be professional and free from intimidation, hostility, and other offenses that would interfere with employee work performance. Harassment of any sort, whether verbal, physical, or visual will not be tolerated. Any sort of harassment against employee's race, color, religion, sex, age, sexual orie ntation, national origin or ancestry, disability, medical conditi on, marital status, vetera n status, or any other attributable characteristic will not accep table at the workplace and will be grounds for discipline. b. Sexual harassment is a form of em ployment misconduct that undermines the integrity of the employment. Unwelcome, unsolicited sexual overtures do not conform to Salus Scientif ic employee policies, and are unacceptable in the workplace. Sexual harassment is against th e law, thus it is illegal and against the policies of Salus Scientific for any employ ee, regardless of gender, to sexually harass another employee. c. Sexual harassment refers to behavior th at is not welcome, that is personally offensive, that lowers morale, and that results in disrupting employee work effectiveness. There are many different forms of sexual harassment, all of which will not be tolerated. Some forms of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to: sexual innuendos, sexual slurs, suggestive language, sexually themed jokes, sexual propositions, obscene gestures, touching and unwanted physical contact, coercing sexual intercourse, and assault. 10. Disciplinary Procedures a. Salus Scientific employees will be subject to disciplinary policies. Management will determine the level of discipline necessary. More severe cases may result in automatic termination, rather than go ing through the steps outlined below. Managers are expected to follow th e disciplinary procedures, unless they determine that other action is necessary . Serious offenses may justify other means of discipline. b. The Salus Scientific proc ess for dealing with unacceptable behavior involves an oral reminder, a written warning, a period of unpaid leave, and finally, termination. c. All employees will be required to conform to Salus Scientific policies regarding attendance, conduct, work performance, a nd other work rules and regulations. Managers are trained to support empl oyees when they experience problems meeting Salus Scientific standards, and to devise a plan to achieve an effective solution. Unfortunately, it may not always be possible to have a positive result. In such cases when the employee does not respond to the plan, the supervising manager will resort to the disciplinary steps. 11. Termination Procedures a. Employment at Salus Scientific is at-will. At-will employment means that neither employees nor Salus Scientific have entered into an employment contract for a specific duration. Employees may terminate their employment with Salus Scientific at any time, with or wit hout reason. Similarly, Salus Scientific reserves the right to terminate, discipline, transfer, or demote employees at any time, with or without reason.b. An employee will be considered terminated once they are removed from the company payroll. The effective day of termination will be the last day worked by the employee. After an employee has been involuntarily terminated, they will receive their final paycheck within one business day. For employees who voluntarily elect to terminate their employment with Salus Scientific, their final paycheck will be given on the next scheduled payday. c. Salus Scientific will consider the following situations and actions as an employee's election to voluntarily terminate their employment: resigning from Salus Scientific, failing to return from an approved leave of absence on the date specified by Salus Scientific, or failing to report to work or call in for three (3) or more consecutive workdays. d.

After the system is operational, recheck the coolant level (while the system is running) and add more coolant as necessary. 4.6.6. More detailed operating instructions for the heater/chiller can be found in the manufacturer's operating instructions. 145. System Operation The following operating instructions are for the 1500-5L and 1500-20L CO 2-based Botanical Oil Extraction systems. Instructio ns assume that chiller and CO 2 Booster Pump are OEM supplied. Failure to follow the instructions provided below may void the warranty of the 1500-5L and 1500- 20L systems. 5.1. 1500-5L and 20L Overview Extraction Vessel Separation Vessels Chiller Collection Cup 155.2. Automation Systems Overview 5.2.1. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is a touch screen. Almost all of the inputs, outputs and human/machine interactions are managed through the HMI. The features not controlled or reported through the HMI are the Air Compressormaintenance schedule and the chiller/heater temperature setting. Refer to their respective owners manuals for additional operational instructions. 5.2.2. The HMI has two functions; 1) to provide information and 2) to accept inputs from the operator. The ways to determine if an action is required by the user are defined below. 5.2.2.1. If a display value or message is colored Red or Orange, an operator must take and action before progressing forward. 5.2.2.1.1. Red indicates messages indicate that a component of the system has either failed to reach the minimum operating pressures or temperatures or that it exceeded the programmed operating limits. 5.2.2.1.2. Orange indicates that an operator activity is required before the Start button can be depressed. Typically, messages highlighted Orange are indicative of a scheduled maintenance interval being reached. 5.2.3. Any variable or message that needs to be (or can be) controlled by the operator are graphically raised to illustrate that the \"message\" is a button. An example of the different graphical representations is shown below. Title/Output Display Input Button Figure 15. Chiller/Heater Remote Temperature Probe Connection 5.2.1. The controller has safety interlocks pr eprogrammed into it. These safety interlocks prevent unsafe operations from occurring by always monitoring the systemsparameters and by removing unsafe action/input control buttons from the HMI. When buttons appear to be missing from the home screen, it is because the system is performing an operation that would be unsafe in combination with themissing button/action. 5.2.2. The HMI will provide message popups (in yellow boxes) to instruct the operator what steps are required next in order in to complete any action selected. Most message popups are also acknowledgement buttons that must be pressed before any further action can be taken. 5.2.3. The primary operating valves on the 1500-5L and 1500-20L are air actuated valves controlled by the systems controller. In the event of an air compressor failure or a power failure all air actuated valve will close automatically. 5.2.4. Each air actuated valve has an indicator on the top to inform the operator which valves are open and which ones are closed. The indicator lines correspond with the flow direction. The following figure illustrates both and open and closed valve. Note that it does not matter which way the air actuator is oriented, rather the direction of CO 2 flow is important. ////HHHHeHHHHHea ttte r RRRem ttot eTTT em per ttat urePPPPPP16CO 2 Flow Direction CO 2 Flow Direction Figure 16. a) Valve 1 in the open position, b) Valve 1 in the closed position 5.3. Pre-Cleaning 5.3.1. The 1500-5L and 20L systems are constructed from 304 and 316 stainless steel and can be cleaned with any cleaner that is compatible with both stainless steeland your extracted product. Simple Green cleaner, ethanol and acetone work well for most applications. 5.3.2. The system should be cleaned to the appropriate level (determined by your application and corresponding regulations) prior to processing each batch ofbotanical material. 5.3.2.1. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the system meets their required level of cleanliness. 5.4. Opening Extraction Vessel WARNING DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN A VESSEL UNDER PRESSURE! Always make sure a vent path for the vessel is opened and thecorresponding pressure gauge(s) reads zero prior to loosening thevessel closure bolts. 5.4.1. This operation cannot be performed during an extraction. The extraction must be stopped prior to opening the Extraction vessel 5.4.2. From the home screen (see Figure 29), press \"Go To Manual Screen\" button. 5.4.3. From the manual screen (see Figure 30), press the \"Open Extractor Vessel\" button. 5.4.3.1. If the extractor is under pressure, the system will require the operator to acknowledge that they want to vent all the CO 2 in the extractor. 5.4.4. When the extractor vessel gauge on top of the vessel and on the home screen both read zero, it is safe to move to the next step. 5.4.5. Used the supplied impact wrench to remove the bolts from the top or bottom flange. 5.4.6. Pivot the flange toward the back and let it rest on the integral hinge stops. 5.4.6.1. Use caution not to scratch or otherwise damage the O-ring sealing surfaces on the flanges. 17Figure 17. Appearance of extractor vessel in open condition, note bolt can be placed in bolt rack below the flange 5.5. Loading Botanical or Other Media 5.5.1. Material to be extracted is loaded directly into the extraction vessel. The supplied funnel can be used to help minimize spillage. 5.5.1.1. Typically botanicals perform best in CO 2 extractions when ground to a particle size between 50 in and roughly the consistency of coffee grounds. 5.5.1.2. Any amount of material can be loaded into the Extraction Vessel - the vessel does not have to be full in order to operate correctly 5.5.2. Gentle compression or packing can be used to increase the amount of material loaded in the vessel, however heavy compaction should be avoided because it will cause channeling of CO 2 during the extraction process. 5.6. Closing Extraction Vessel 5.6.1. Ensure all sealing surfaces are clean and free of debris 5.6.2. Check the O-ring for any visible damage or defects. Replace as necessary 5.6.2.1. The O-ring does not require any lubrication 5.6.3. Close the vessel flange and install each of the closure bolts hand tight 5.6.4. Using the supplied impact wrench and socket, tighten the bolts in a star pattern. Use the supplied impact wrench with 1-2 second bursts to deliver approximately 50 ft-lbs of torque to each bolt. Heavy torqueing of the bolts is not required. 393 5 7 5 7 1 11 1 2 8 2 12 6 4 6 10 48 Figure 18. Torque sequence for 1500-5L and 1500-20L extraction vessels 5.7. Chiller Start Up 5.7.1. Verify chiller's cooling lines are connected to the extraction system. 185.7.2. Turn chiller on 5.7.2.1. The main power switch is located on the back of the chiller see Figure 14 5.7.2.2. The operations power button is located below the black knob on the front of the chiller 5.7.3. Set the target temperature to 65\u00b0F by quickly depressing the control knob on the chiller and turning it to the appropriate temperature. 5.7.3.1. In the event that the chiller is displaying temperatures in Celsius, turn off the main power switch, press and hold the menu button on the front of themachine and turn on the main power. Then let off the menu button. Thechiller will briefly display dF indicating it is set to display temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 5.8. Evacuating the System 5.8.1. From the Home Screen (see Figure 29), click the Manual Screen Button. 5.8.2. From the Manual Screen (see Figure 30), click the Evacuate Button. 5.8.3. Verify that all the gauges on the system display zero pressure.5.8.4. Verify that the supplied vacuum pump is filled with the appropriate oil. 5.8.4.1. Refer to the vacuum pump owners manual for more detailed information. 5.8.5. Connect the vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and vacuum pump to Valve 10 on the bottom of Separator #2. Figure 19. Appearance of correctly connected vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and vacuum pump 5.8.1. Open Valve 10. 5.8.2. Turn on the vacuum pump. 5.8.3. Allow the pump to run for approximately 10-min. 5.8.3.1. If the vacuum gauge does not reach -20 in.Hg, either the pump is faulty or there is a leak in the system. 5.8.4. Close Valve 10. 5.8.5. Turn off the vacuum pump. 5.8.6. Disconnect the vacuum gauge, blue vacuum hose and pump. 5.8.7. Press the message button acknowledging that the evacuation is complete 5.8.7.1. The acknowledgement message button will appear on the Manual Screen after pressing the Evacuate Button. 5.8.8. Press the Blue Arrow Buttons to select the Go To Home option on the Manual Screen and press the Return button \"enter\". 195.9. Conducting an Extraction 5.9.1. Press the Go To Auto Mode Button on the upper left hand corner of the Home Screen. 5.9.1.1. This resets the controller and enables it to start a new cycle/extraction. 5.9.1.2. The first time you run the system, immediately following a loss of power, or after any abnormal run conditions the system will default to Manual Modefor safety. 5.9.2. Verify the chiller is on and target temperature is set to 65\u00b0F. 5.9.3. Verify that a 50-lb, 75-lb or 100-lb cylinder of CO 2 with a sufficient amount of CO 2 is connected to the system. 5.9.4. Verify that material is loaded into extraction vessel and extraction vessel is properly closed 5.9.4.1. The system can be run with no material in the extraction vessel. This can be used as a way to clean the stainless steel tubing upstream of theseparation vessel. 5.9.5. Verify that the Separator vessels are both closed and sanitary clamps are tight (clamps are considered tight when there is a 1/16-in to 1/8-in between opposingsides of the clamp) Figure 20. Appearance of tight sanitary clamp 5.9.6. Press the Start button on the home screen, Figure 29. 5.9.7. After pressing start the system will prompt the operator to; 5.9.7.1. Set Extractor Pressure (between 900-psi and recommended starting extractor pressure is 1200-psi 5.9.7.2. Set the System Run Time (between 1-hour and 48-hours) 5.9.7.2.1. The recommended run time is 2 hours per pound of botanical 5.9.7.3. Verify the Extractor is properly closed 5.9.7.4. Verify the Separator is properly closed 5.9.7.5. Close Valve 10 5.9.7.6. Open the CO 2 Bottle 5.9.8. The system will start filling the vessels with CO 2 to the target extractor pressure. 5.9.8.1. During the filling stage the Ho me Screen will display a blue box labeled \"Filling\" to inform the operator of the systems current activities. 5.9.9. Once the target extractor pressure is reached, the system information box will change from \"Filling\" to \"Running\". An additional information box will appear indicating the direction of the flow, either \"Forward Flow\" or \"Reverse Flow\". 205.9.9.1. The system routinely switches the flow direction to keep the filters from clogging with plant material and to prevent the CO 2 from forming flow channels inside the plant material. 5.9.10. The system will continue in run mode until it reaches the target run time, at which point it will begin recovering the CO 2 into the CO 2 cylinder. The information box will switch from \"Running\" to \"Recovering\". 5.9.10.1. The system will prompt the operator to turn up the chiller/heater to 110-F. This helps to speed up the recovery process. 5.9.10.2. It is not a required step, the system will recover without turning up the temperature or acknowledging the message. 5.9.10.2.1. Note that increases the chiller/heater temperature also increases the temperature of the oil in the collection cup. 5.9.11. At the end of recovery the system will have approximately 70-psi in all the vessels. The system will provide me ssage boxes to instruct the operator through the final shut down process. The prompts are; 5.9.11.1. Close the CO 2 cylinder 5.9.11.2. Open Valve 10. 5.9.12. Once the operator acknowledges that the CO 2 cylinder and Valve 10 are closed, the system will open all valves, vent any trapped CO 2 and wait for the next command. 5.10. Removing Spent Botanical 5.10.1. From the home screen (see Figure 29), press \"Go To Manual Screen\" button. 5.10.2. From the manual screen (see Figure 30), press the \"Open Extractor Vessel\" button. 5.10.2.1. If the extractor is under pressure, the system will require the operator to acknowledge that they want to vent all the CO 2 in the extractor. 5.10.3. When the extractor vessel gauge on top of the vessel and on the home screen both read zero, it is safe to move to the next step. 5.10.4. Used the supplied impact wrench to remove the bolts from the top or bottom flange. 5.10.5. Pivot the flange toward the back and let it rest on the integral hinge stops. 5.10.5.1. Use caution not to scratch or otherwise damage the O-ring sealing surfaces on the flanges. 5.10.6. Once the extraction vessel is open, the spent botanical material can be removed with a dust collector or stainless steel vacuum. 5.10.6.1. Alternatively, the bottom vessel closure can be opened using the same instructions provided above. With the bottom closure open the botanical will fall out of the vessel and can be collected in a bag or other collectiondevice. 5.11. Oil Collection WARNING DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN A VESSEL UNDER PRESSURE! Always make sure a vent path for the vessel is opened and thecorresponding pressure gauge(s) reads zero prior to loosening thevessel closure bolts. 215.11.1. Verify that both Separator vessel gauges read zero and that Valve 10 is open. 5.11.2. Remove the flexible metal lines from the top of the separators. Use two wrenches to prevent the NPT fittings from loosening in the separator cap. Figure 21. Illustration of using two wrenches to remove flexible metal lines 5.11.3.

Separator caps must be cleaned every run. 5.11.8. Use the supplied round squeegee to push any residual oil from the sides of the separators down to the bottom of the separators. 5.11.9. Use the 5/8-in ratchet wrench to remove the high pressure sanitary clamps from the bottom of the separator vessels. 5.11.10. Turn off the chiller/heater 5.11.11. Disconnect the two blue water line quick connects on the back of the collection cup. 5.11.12. Remove the collection cup from Separator #1 and the bottom cap from Separator #2 5.11.13. Collect the oil from inside the collection cup. 5.11.13.1.Note: there is typically residual dry ice in the collection cup mixed in with the oil. The dry ice will sublimate without any additional heat. It is sometimesmore efficient to remove the dry ice/oil mixture and place it in collection device (like a Pyrex dish). Figure 22. Image of collection cup after removal from separator. 225.11.14. Use the round squeegee an d alcohol or acetone to th oroughly clea n the inside of the separators and collection cup. 5.11.15. Both separators and the collection cup must be cleaned after each extraction. 5.11.16. Reassemble both separators by reversing the steps above. 5.11.16.1.Reconnect the water lines before turning on the chiller/heater. 5.11.17. Verify that the system is in its waiting mode and all valves are in the open position. 5.11.17.1.If Valve 11 is not open, skip to the next section. 5.11.18. Disconnect the separator outlet line from the cap of Separator #2 Figure 23. Image of separator outlet line after being disconnected. 5.11.19. Disconnect the pump inlet line at the tee immediately in front of the pump. Loosen the fitting in the same line (closer to the front of the system so the benttubing can be pointed downward. Figure 24. Image of pump inlet line before and after being disconnected. 5.11.20. Pour alcohol or acetone into the separator outlet line until the solvent is colorless coming out the end that was connected to the pump inlet. After which use compressed air to blow out the line ensuring that no residual alcohol oracetone remains in the line between the separator and the pump. 5.11.21. Reconnect the separator outlet line and pump inlet line. 5.11.22. The separator outlet line must be cleaned after each extraction. 6. Troubleshooting 6.1. Ice On SeparatorIt is normal for the high pressure clamps and flexible metal lines on the top of the separator toform ice during operation. If ice is forming on the outside of the separator vessels that is anindicator that either the chiller/ heater was not connected properly/turned on, the collection cup 23water lines were not reconnected, or that the CO 2 cylinders were too cold. If the bottles are below approximately 50\u00b0F, it is possible for the chille r/heater to have difficulty maintain system temperature. If ice forms on the outside of the separator vessel, it suggests that the coolantcannot keep up and may be freezing inside the cooling jacket. In either event, the systemshould be shut down by pressing the Recover CO 2 Button on the Manual. This will put the system into recovery mode so that the cooling system can be inspected or the bottle can warm up. It will take several hours for the ice to thaw if it froze inside the collection cup cooling jacket. Do not attempt to work on the cooling system while the system is running. 6.2. Opened Bottle Too Early If the bottle was accidently opened while the system was in stand by (waiting after previous extraction was completed) there is no way to recover the 100% CO 2. The only way to correct this event is to slowly open Valve 10 until the separator pressure is below 300-psi. At which point the system can be started and it will operate as normal. 6.3. Low Extractor Pressure If the extractor pressure is unable to meet the target pressure, first verify that the CO 2 cylinder has sufficient CO 2. If yes, this is an indicator that the pump seals have reached the end of their life. If the extractor is above 1000-psi, the system will continue producing oil. Adjust the target pressure to 1000-psi and alloy it system complete its target run time, it is recommended that the run time be increased by 10% to make up for the reduced extractor pressure. After the systemcompletes the cycle, either rebuild the pump or send it out for a rebuild. Manufacturer can provide contact information for pump rebuild if it is going to be sent out. 6.4. Extractor Overpressure - Orifice Clog The valveless expansion technology uses a small orifice to regulate pressure. This orifice canbecome plugged when foreign material is entered into the plumbing between the extractionvessel and separator vessel. Typically, the foreign material is a piece of Teflon tape from theNPT fittings near the orifice. In the event that separator pressure decreases or extractor pressure increases causing an extractor high pressure fault, it is most likely a plugged orifice. Follow the steps below to clearan orifice clog. 6.4.1. From the Home Screen, Press the Manual Screen Button. 6.4.2. From the Manual Screen, Press the Clear Clogged Orifice Button. 6.4.3. Wait for the system to provide a message popup indicating it is safe to Open Valve 10 and clean the orifice. 6.4.4. Open Valve 10 6.4.5. Verify that both Separator vessel gauges read zero.6.4.6. Remove the flexible metal lines from the top of the separators. Use two wrenches to prevent the NPT fittings from loosening in the separator cap. 6.4.7. Remove the yellow wire connected to the Separator #1 thermocouple.6.4.8. Use the 5/8-in ratchet wrench to remove the high pressure sanitary clamps from the top of Separator #1. 6.4.9. Remove the cap from the top of Separator #1.246.4.10. Remove the orifice from the orifice tube using two wrenches to prevent the 45- deg fitting from rotating. 6.4.11. Clean the orifice by soaking it in acetone or alcohol and blowing it out with compressed air. Verify the orifice is clear by looking through it. 6.4.12. Reassemble the orifice using Teflon tape. Use caution to prevent excess Teflon tape from getting into the orifice. Tighten the orifice assembly such that the orifice is between tangent and +30 degrees from tangent to the separator wallas shown below. This facilitates cyclonic separation and minimizes oil carryover. A B Figure 25. Orifice orientation A) Tangent and B) 30-Deg off tangent 6.4.13. Replace the separator cap and tighten the clamp bolts. 6.4.14. Reinstall the flexible metal hoses and the thermocouple connection. 6.4.15. Close Valve 10. 6.4.16. Press the popup message button when orifice is reinstalled, the high pressure clamps are tight and the flexible hoses are reconnected. 6.5. Low Separator Pressure - Orifice ClogLow Separator pressure is typically caused by one of two things (an orifice clog or the wrongorifice installed). If the system has been operating with the current orifice and consistently maintained a separator pressure between 250-psi and 350-psi, this suggests that the orifice is clogged. To correct an orifice clog refer to the instructions in the section above (ExtractorOverpressure).6.6. Low Separator Pressure - Wrong Orifice SizeLow Separator pressure is typically caused by one of two things. If the orifice was recently changed or the system was moved to a new location, the low separator pressure is typically anindicator that the installed orifice is too small. To install the correct orifice; 6.6.1. From the Home Screen, Press the Manual Screen Button. 6.6.2. From the Manual Screen, Press the Clear Clogged Orifice Button. 6.6.3. Wait for the system to provide a message popup indicating it is safe to Open Valve 10 and clean the orifice. 6.6.4. Open Valve 10 6.6.5. Verify that both Separator vessel gauges read zero.6.6.6. Remove the flexible metal lines from the top of Separator #1. Use two wrenches to prevent the NPT fittings from loosening in the separator cap. 6.6.7. Remove the yellow wire connected to the Separator #1 thermocouple. 6.6.8. Use the 5/8-in ratchet wrench to remove the high pressure sanitary clamps from the top of Separator #1. A B Fi 2 O if i i i A)T d B) 30 D f f f256.6.9. Remove the cap from the top of Separator #1. 6.6.10. Remove the orifice from the orifice tube using two wrenches to prevent the 45- deg fitting from rotating. 6.6.11. Use the graphs below to determine which orifice best fits the operating conditions of the system. 6.6.11.1. Note that it is best to run the largest orifice possible to produce the target extractor pressure while maintaining a separator pressure under 350-psi. 6.6.11.2. The graphs are baseline recommendations only, temperature, elevation, and humidity all impact air and CO 2 density\u2014which impact orifice size optimization and selection. Figure 26. Orifice selection guide for a 15-hp compressor Figure 27. Orifice selection guide for a 25-hp compressor 6.6.12. Install a larger orifice using Teflon tape. Use caution to prevent excess Teflon tape from getting into the orifice. Tighten the orifice assembly such that the 26orifice is between tangent and +30 degrees from tangent to the separator wall as shown below. This facilitates cyclonic separation and minimizes oil carryover. A B Figure 28. Orifice orientation A) Tangent and B) 30-Deg off tangent 6.6.13.

System Maintenance Maintenance on the system is critical to proper operation. Failure to follow these maintenance items can cause premature system failure and void the warranty. The maintenance items below pertain to the CO 2 system only. Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance plan for the chiller/heater unit and the air compressor. This maintenance schedule is based on the maintenance timer on the Maintenance Screen (see Figure 31). Frequency Maintenance Item After Each Extraction xRemove spent material from the extraction vessel by vacuuming it out through the top flange. xVerify the extractor filters are clear and free of debris xCheck extraction vessel O-rings and O-rings groove sealing surfaces for damage - replace if necessary xRemove extracted oil from separator vessels and clean entire vessel and cup with acetone or alcohol. xClean the separator outlet line/pump inlet line with acetone or alcohol. xCheck separator vessel gaskets for damage - replace if necessary WeeklyxLubricate CO 2 pump spool valve O-rings. Replace if necessary. xClean all flexible metal lines going into and out of both separators xCheck chiller/heater water level is between min and max xClean CO 2 flow lines between the pump and the coiled heat exchanger with acetone or alcohol. Flowlines must be disconnected from pump and extraction system to thoroughly clean. MonthlyxRemove the CO 2 pump heads and clean with alcohol or acetone. Do not remove the seals from the head unless they show visible signs of wear. In which case, replace the seals before reassembly. Every 500 HoursxReplace all seals on the CO 2 Pump. The pump seal life is highly dependent on cleanliness. Lack of performing scheduled maintenance will decrease seal life.REQUEST FOR EXEMP TION FROM FOIL Critical Infrastructure (POL \u00a7 86[5]) - Trade Secret (POL \u00a7 87(2)[d]) NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION Redacted pursuant to N.Y.

Overview Salus Scientific, LLC - Executive Summary Company Mission: Cultivating global medical breakthroughs in New York. Company Vision Combining over 200 years of pioneering scientif ic research, industry safety, and security benchmarks with a collaborative community of world-class innovators, Salus Scien tific will provide pure, safe, and consistent cannabinoid medicines to New Yo rk's qualified patients. We aim to employ good manufacturing practices, pe rform standardized extractions, and formulate consistent cannabinoid medicine. Salus Scientific is at the forefront of medical cannabis research and delivery. Our comprehensive team of researchers, physicians, cultivators, manufacturers and patient care specialists has the unique expertise to produce a safe, consistent and sustainable supply of cannabis-derived, pharmaceutical-grade medicines. Through integrity, transparency, reliability and stewardship, we will provide efficient and affordable access for the relief of New York's countless qualifying patients in need. Our Team and Inspiration At its core, Salus Scientific's culture comes from its most valued asset - its people. By strategically partnering extensive scientific research and industry knowledge from around the nation and the globe, Salu s Scientific is able to empower local New York resources to match passion with relevant expertise, compassion with global teamwork and responsible science with innovative products to move New York State into the forefront of all aspects of this nascent industry. Salus Scien tific provides a unique, made-in-New-Yo rk solution: global in reach, but clearly local in economic and social impact. Salus Scientific cofounde r and Chairman of the Board Michael P. Falcone, contributes his passion for commun ity development in New York State to the opportunities created by the region's emerging medi cal cannabis industry. , Mr. Falcone sees the potential for 200 medical marijuana manufacturing and retail jobs to be created by Salus Scientific and its partners in New York. Creating economic devel opment while providing innovative, research-oriented patient solutions will compound the local benefit where it is needed most. Salus Scientific cofounder and CEO Nicole Ruvo Falcone has b ecome passionate about the use of medical cannabis to treat devastating c onditions. has dedicated themselves to the treatment of neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) throug h the fundraising of over $200 million for the to operate th e clinic. Ms. Ruvo Falcone brings a unique business-minded desire for clinical research in ne urology and has a successful career of bringing highly regulated products to market. The lynchpin to the recent move to regulated marijuana access across much of the nation stems from the compounding effect of br illiant scientific research from Israel, formulated by Salus Scientific team members over decade s of isolated study with the move to demonstrable efficacy in usage. This is embodied by Salus Scientific te am members' involvement in the forwarding of medicinal marijuana usage by children in Colora do. Chris Stubbs, long passionate about proper dosage and the responsible labelling of cannabis- related products, , sourced the high cannabidiol (CBD) cultivars from locals, and helped to formulate and test the first delivery systems in this nationally significant case. Hi s recent work, embodied in the rigorous devotion to detailed production protocols has enabled the leading industrial hemp producer in Kentucky to pr ovide jobs in producti on, laboratory testing, processing, formulation, product development and branding. The most exciting discoveries relating to the application of cannabis-derived medicines to various disease-states have yet to be scientifically demonstrate d. This has led Dr. Perry Fine, to bring to Salus Scientific his considerable efforts as a new br eed of clinicians slowly begin to embrace this new treatment modality. With his ability to bridge the gap between global research and the clinical proof of efficacy, Dr. Fine inspires growing confidence in new treatment modalities. Dr. Ma rk Rosenfeld, has done an outstanding job of securing intellectual property and technological market solutions for the delivery of CBD in relevant disease states. Hugh Hempel, , and Chris, know the power of cannabis to treat epilepsy. ; , their work with top Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) officials to create an experimental pharmaceutical medicine resulted in the initiation of current clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This medicine has been used to tr eat terminally ill children around the world. In order to achieve the goal of finding a cure for serious public health epidemics such as diabetes, chronic pain, cancer, a nd immunological and neurological disorders including adult and childhood onset Alzheimer's through medical cannabi s research, Salus Scie ntific depends on the crucial ingredient of a highly skilled team of professionals with hands on experience in the cannabis industry. Salus Scientific has a ssembled many of the most recognized professionals from the global cannabis industry including chemists, clinicians, agronomists, leading cannabinoid researchers, world-cl ass botanists and operators fr om several western states and New York's leading physicians. Salus Scientific also intends to pursue research relationships with the new Binghamton University School of Ph armacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In each instance, these professionals are recognized as leading experts in their field, and their portfolio of patents, proprietary pr ocesses, publications and trials prove it. Jim Rice, Vice President of Operations for Salus Scientific, Salus Scientific has embraced all aspects of its security footprint because the new industry requires top-down compliance in every regard. The ability to bring forward decades of experience from the DEA, ATF, TSA, NYPD and NYSP to internalize this in Salus Scientific's culture is a testament to the organization's broa d strength through its people and the clear path towards assuaging any and all fears that this new industry is anything other than completely transparent. Salus Scientific al so intends to employ security personnel from the pool of local retired law enforcement officers who are familiar with not only law enforcement, but the local communities Salus Scientific will be working in. Company Values Integrity: A sense of follow-through is sorely lacking in the medical cannabis industry. Our team has been dedicated, for many years now, to truth in dosing and labeling, community involvement, training, providing jobs, and positiv ely impacting the lives of patients that need palliative care involving cannabis therapies. Transparency: A sense of transparency in our oper ational motivations means that Salus Scientific can have meaningful implications on industry and research surrounding the medical cannabis program in New York by sharing da ta and intellectual property while keeping employees and patients safe. Paramount to our success is providing transparency in production methods so that the lives of patients are positiv ely impacted. Furthermor e, our security team lends a sense of regulatory importance with respect to compliance that is top-notch. Redacted pursuant to N.Y. Public Officers Law, Art. 6Reliability: Our spectrum of care is predicated on guaranteed dosing levels and testing standardization, safe methods of administration, and a commitment to expanding our capabilities to best educate and serve patients in need. S imply put, being able to serve a patient population that has found something that works for them is extremely important. We firmly believe it is unethical to provide a beneficial treatment that works, then not have it available in the future. This problem is widespread in the cannabis indus try; patients often find a product that works for them, but cannot reproduce the result because the pr oduct line is erratic in its formulated content. Community Stewardship: Developing a sense of responsibility in the community is key to the success of any business. The c ontroversial nature of medical cannabis necessitates responsibility through scientific knowledge. We intend to le ad our community involvement efforts through a series of outreach mechanisms and research endea vors that help inform and educate the public in a positive and responsible manner. In support of these values, Salus Scientific has created four critical advisory boards: Advisory Board, Physician Advisory Boar d, Science Advisory Board and Security Advisory Board. This ensures that everything we do is grounded in decade s of specifically relevant experience and in the best interest of our patients. Once Salus Scientific becomes operational, a Community Advisory Board will be created and local communi ty leaders will be appointed as members. As Salus Scientific begins serving certified patients, we will also establish an advisory board specifically for the indivi duals we directly serve. Company Goals -Salus Scientific will meet an aggressive operational timelin e of six (6) months without issue due to the experience of our team's operational fortitude. -Salus Scientific estimates an ability to provide 200 local jobs and begin local and statewide public education programs in the can nabinoid clinical and research sciences. -Salus Scientific will pursue research partnerships with Cornell University, as well as programmatic and educ ational opportunities with the ne w Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. -Standardize cannabinoid dosing, testing and labeling practices through internal testing and external collaboration with la bs and other industry partners. - Develop products more familiar to patients and physicians to increase acceptance and emphasize New York State's evolution of cannabis-derived medicine delivery. - Develop responsive formularie s and delivery innovations for specific ailments with the intent of carrying out clinical trials with existing clinical networks. - Support the Department of Health in the thoughtful consid eration of expanding the list of recognized conditions to eventually include Alzheimer's, PTSD, chronic pain, and a host of other illnesses shown clinically to respond to cannabinoid therapies. - Impact the agronomic side of research and development through future participation in the New York hemp program with industry experts GenCanna Global. Salus Scientific Research Advantage Mankind has used the cannabis plant as both food a nd medicine for centuries. In recent decades the plant has been exhaustively studied by our partners and advisers who have created a significant and industry-renowned body of evidence regarding cannabis's pote ntial as a treatment for some of humanity's most devastating conditions, such as diabetes, chronic pain and numerous neurological conditions. Salus Scientific, through its part ners, owns, controls and/or othe rwise has exclusive rights to: - An extensive cannabis-specific patent library from decades of research and development, many of which are specific for the use of CBD to treat diabetes, cancer, and cancer- related pain. - Next generation technology for bioavailabilit y, extraction, and related processes. - Four patents pending on phytocanna binoid extraction and purification. - Proprietary patents based on water soluble liquids and powder technology of CBDiolTM. - A number of patents related to biomarker availability and proprietary ingredients and formulations that are currently used in many products for anti-inflammatory pain, osteoporosis, sports performance, and type II diabetes. - Technology to make numerous fat solubl e compounds more easily absorbed as a new natural process that makes bene ficial oils such as fish oil omega-3 more stable and less resistant to spoilage.The Salus Scientific team of advisers a nd partners also owns trade secrets for: -Improved quality management system s for natural products development. -Improved manufacturing processes for devel oping commercially viab le natural -Marketing and lopment processes for deve loping natural products. -Improved extraction methods offering better yield, better control of finished product. -Improved dose delivery systems offering greater bioavailability and efficacy. -Compositions treating diseases and/or having a specific effect on the body. -Processes for producing compositions treating diseases. Significant rigorous clinical research is still required to confirm eviden ce and, more importantly, to provide solid data that help s to optimize cannabis use efficacy and safety. To that end, Salus Scientific is committed to facilitating broad public and private clin ical research efforts in medical cannabis. Oversight of public research by Salus Scientific will be led by advisory board members Dr. Gloria Meredith, Founding Dean for the Bing hamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Dr. Flint Beal, . Private research will be facilitated w ith non-profit research institutions including the Nicole Ruvo- Falcone-supported and family-f ounded Cleveland Clinic Lou R uvo Center for Brain Health. With our partners, and with the support of the St ate of New York, Salus Scientific will answer the call for non-psychoactive and non-abusable oral cannabinoid products, paving the way for substantive potential improvements in treating debilitating and even life-threatening health conditions afflicting many New Yorkers. 2.General Organization a.

Us. Now.\" As \"citizen scientists,\" the Hempels successfully filed drug applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and received unprecedented approval from the FD A to start cyclodextrin treatment As a result of developing this novel drug and Niemann Pick Type C patients worldwide, Mr. Hempel have become nationally recognized healthcare advocates who are frequent speakers on a variety of topics including small clinical trial design, new drug discovery, and patient reported outcome systems.

Medical Marijuana Knowledge Mr. Hempel is a licensed and registered medical marijuana caregiver in Nevada (#C140400756). . As a licensed caregiver, Mr. Hempel is extremely knowledgeable about the benefits of medical marijuana and has been researching the endocannabinoid receptors system since 2009. Mr. Hempel decided to create a Nevada-based \"cannabusiness\" focused on legally developing and distributing pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products (high-quality flowers, extracts and concentrates) at competitive prices for Nevada pa tients. Mr. Hempel aims to create a statewide cannabis research program in Nevada to better elucidate the potential benefits of the cannabis plant. The creation of a pharmaceutical-quality cannabis supply network is the first step towards this larger goal of building knowle dge about using cannabis to improve health.

Through this historical scientific breakthrough, Mr. McKernan began unlocking the mysteries of marijuana DNA. He has spoken at conferences around the world on this topic; a video of his presentation can be found at http://tinyurl.com/Se quencingCannabisGenome . He is undisputedly one of the top cannabis genetics re searchers in the world, and has successfully provided genetic profiling of child ren with intractable epilepsy to support clinical developments with cannabidiol (CBD). . . Mr. McKernan's research and genetic analysis on children with Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome, two rare and severe forms of infantile-onset, genetic, drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes, has played a part in the FDA granting orphan drug designation for one of his product candidates that contains plant-derived cannabidiol as its active ingredient. Mr. McKernan initiated an R&D uencing and spearheaded a process to acquire the DNA sequencing compan y, Ion Torrent, for $350M. These collaborations resulted in hundreds of publica tions and seven journal covers from Science Translational Medicine to Nature. Mr. McKernan holds a B.S. in Biology from Emory University with a focus on cloning and expressing Norepinephrine Transporters. Redacted pursuant to N.Y.

About Christopher Chris was immediately interested in the laboratory and performed four years of undergraduate research with the CU Biology Department and the CU Institute of Bioenergetics, studying the endocannabinoid signaling system in human and animal models of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancers, their metabolic differences, and the effects of cannabinoid treatment on various parameters, including programmed cell death, or apoptosis. After graduating, Chris took a position with the CU Health Sciences Center in Aurora, CO in the Department of Cells, Stem Cells & Development studying developmental cell signaling pathways. At the time this position ended, the cannabis industry was just starting to grow in Colorado. Chris took a scientic approach to modifying cannabis production practices from cultivation through to product development, allowing for increased production efficiencies and reproducibility-a problem that still plagues the industry.Chris played an integral role in the rulemaking process that now regulates the Cannabis industry in Colorado, and is well versed when it comes to sharing his knowledge with regulators, lawmakers, the public, and scientists alike. Chris has worked with countless patients and parents of pediatric patients to help them achieve the level of access and understanding they desire. Currently, Chris is working in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to elucidate the current science behind the endocannabinoid system and the many phytocannabinoid based therapies the cannabis plant offers, as well as apply current analytical techniques and instrumentation to properly test and label cannabis products in the marketplace, thus contributing to and spreading the fact that cannabis and it's formulations are valid, efficacious, and safe therapies for a number of human diseases.SNAPSHOT Christopher Stubbs Chris double major ed in Biology and Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, focusing on molecular biology and analytical chemistry.

(Y issum), the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hadasit Lt d. (Hadasit), the technology transfer company of the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem, and the Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research (KIR) in the United Kingdom announced today that they have signed an exclusive worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with ISA Scientific, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and comme rcialization of cannabinoids as human medicine, for using the non-psychoactive cannab inoid, cannabidiol (CBD), to treat serious medical conditions, diabetes, inflammato ry diseases (like arthritis, atherosclerosis and ulcerative colitis) and cardiovascular disorders. The licensed intellectual property is the result of many years of research and collaboration between renowned cannabinoid scientists, Raphael Mechoulam, Professor of medicinal chemistry, and Ruth Gallily, Professor of immuno logy, both from the Hebrew University; the distinguished immunologist, Professor Sir Marc Fe ldman, Director of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology; and prominent physicians and sc ientists at Hadassah Professors Chaim Lotan and Ronen Durst, and Dr. Lola Weiss. Page 2 of 3 Yaacov Michlin, Chief Executive Officer of Yissum, stated: \"We are very pleased with this business collaboration, which is a result of many years of multi-disciplinary cooperation between distinguished scientists in the field of CBD chemistry and biology, together with leading clinicians and researchers in the area of diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and inflammation diseases. We are confident that IS A Scientific is the right partner to translate these academic accomplishments into CBD treatme nts that will benefit patients worldwide.\" \"ISA Scientific is pleased to be collaborating with Yissum, Hadasit and KIR in making the human therapeutic use of CBD a reality,\" said Mark J. Rosenfeld, M.S., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of ISA Scientific. \"The licensing agr eement is very well timed because our Phase 1 clinical trials on dosing and safety are now un derway in Israel, and arrangements for Phase 2 trials on treating diabetes and neuropathic pain are in process. It is important to recognize that very little CBD usually gets into the bl oodstream when it is taken by mouth, and this inefficiency is a major obstacle to making or al CBD medicines with consistent dosing and reliable therapeutic outcomes. ISA Scientific has uniquely resolved this key problem with proprietary drug delivery technology now being integrated into our clinical trials. Besides maximizing the therapeutic utility of ISA Scient ific's CBD formulations, this technology also helps reduce production costs and thus the price of medicine to patients.\" \"The licensed technology encompasses diabet es and other disorders of immense public health relevance, and these are impacting hun dreds of millions of people around the world. That there is tremendous demand for alternatives to more successfully treat these diseases is an understatement. What ISA Scientific is doing to make efficient and affordable CBD medicine will prove eminently valuable in that regard.\" AAbout Yissum Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was founded in 1964 to protect and commercialize the Hebrew University's intellectual property.

About ISA Scientific ISA Scientific is a closely-held American corpor ation whose activities are centered on making non-psychoactive, safe and effective therapeuti c products based on cannabis plant chemistry, for the improved treatment of debilitating and even life-threatening health conditions impacting millions of people worldwide as well as to help better health in general. The Company is distinctively proceeding down a commercial product development pathway that includes refereed human clinical trials, which it considers regrettably lacking for cannabis chemistry but essential to achieving regulatory approval and widespread acceptance by healthcare professionals. The Company is also positioned to become a major supplier of cannabis-plant chemistry, espe cially CBD. ISA Scientific has situated its research, development and production where most advantageous. The Company's R&D occurs largely in Israel, the global center for cannabis-rel ated research. Certain scientific and medical activities along with other matters of importa nce are strategically situated in the US and Canada. ISA Scientific is also distinctively located in China, where the therapeutic alternatives offered by cannabis chemistry could go far in helping to resolve conditions responsible for a huge public health crisis there.

Sincerely, John Schaffer Town of Vestal Supervisor WJS/tlp New York State Department of Health Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Medical Marijuana Program 150 Broadway Albany, NY 12204 June 5, 2015 To Whom It May Concern: As community leaders in Broome County, we are writing as a group to express our complete suppor t for the Salus Scientific medical marijuana license application. The Salus Scientific team brings together a world class research, clinical, and management team with the unprecedented applied technical experience to produce, manufacture, and dispense pha rmaceutical grade medical marijuana on a large scale. Their collective history as safe and secure operators in other states gives us the confidence that they will be a responsible corporate citizen in our region, as does their association with respected national and international research partners. After reviewing their plans, we are convinced that through the establishment of their cultivation and manufacturing facility in the Southern Tier, Salus Scientific will help drive a new global paradigm in cannab is from the heart of the Greater Binghamton Region. They are committed to using local business and labor in their operations and will seek to use locally grown product. They also plan to minimize their environmental footprint through the use of the most modern agricultural practices, green building principles and clean transportation alternatives. With these approaches, they have committed to revitalizing an area that has long struggled to rebuild its economy. Their decision to locate in our community was also very much driven by proximity to the planned Binghamton University School of Pharmacy. This developing partnership shows their intention to undertake further research into medical marijuana dispensation and delivery with a highly recognized academic partner like BU. Cutting- edge health care will remain at the very core of their work. Salus Scientific exemplifies, in every facet of their application, the best of what we in the Southern Tier consider a model program in the newly developing field of med ical marijuana cultivation and distribution business. Their unmatched, research -driven approach brings together some of the most recognizable names in the study of cannabis and in related fields, which will allow them to help transform health care in this state and ensure that New York continues to be a model for the rest of the country We urge your support of the Salus Scientific application and look forward to your decision.
