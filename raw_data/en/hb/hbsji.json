What is Energy Healing? Every living creature on earth is made up of atoms. In humans, these atoms create energy systems inside and outside of our bodies. Energy Healing or Energy Medicine is a practice that focuses on correcting any imbalance of these energy systems or to unblock and invigorate the flow of your body's energy to improve physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health. Not to be used as a replacement to traditional medicine, Energy Healing can be used to help trigger the body's own ability to heal itself. What are the Different Types of Energy Healing Practices? Energy healing encompasses a variety of practices, many with roots in Eastern medicine that go back thousands of years. Some of the more popular methods of energy healing are: Reiki Qigong Acupuncture and Chinese Meridians Healing Touch or Therapeutic Touch Reflexology EFT Quantum Touch Pranic and Aura Healing Chakra Healing Crystal Healing Beauty and Wellness Practitioner Spotlight This is the first part in our Spotlight series where The Parlor highlights professionals who are pioneering change in the beauty & wellness industry.

Looking to create a beauty service that had more meaning and lasting impact, Nicole took the leap in 2016 and went out on her own to develop an entirely new type of stylist practice that would transform the way beauty services are experienced. Using her two decades of experience behind the chair and as an educator as well as her training in positive psychology and energy medicine, Nicole started her solo practice aptly titled [Truth, Beauty & Goodness](http://www.truthbeautyandgoodness.net). Her innovative salon mixes traditional beauty services and positive psychology with the energy healing practice of Healing Touch to create a unique salon experience that promotes relaxation and awakens her clients' inner and outer beauty. What is Healing Touch? Healing touch is a therapy that uses thoughtful touch to work with the magnetic field around the body, referred to as a \"biofield.\" It is a non-invasive technique that, like other energy healing methods, works to unblock, rebalance and energize the body's energy systems to promote physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. Nicole offers a variety of energy therapy sequences that are customized for her clients. Sequences include relaxation, joy, mind clearing, replenishment, sleep well and balance. What Is Embeautyment? Not only is Nicole transforming the salon experience for her clients but she is also helping to educate other beauty professionals on methods to incorporate wellness into their traditional beauty services. In her trademarked [Embeautyment method practitioner training](http://www.truthbeautyandgoodness.net/em-training/), Nicole teaches a set of 19 practices that help beauty professionals create services, products and daily routines that improve mind, body and spiritual health.
