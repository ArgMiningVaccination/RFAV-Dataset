The long-term time for preparation reaches to end with the beginning of this exciting Meeting. This is the second time that an IFPA Meeting is held in South America, and thus, this meeting in Argentina is highly expected in the countries of our region. On the other hand, IFPA Members from different countries will have the opportunity to experience the passionate nature of our South American cultures, and to meet an important number of Placental researches from Latin America. This interaction will nourish the progress of Placenta Research worldwide. The scientific and social program has a huge number of opportunities for this interaction. The theme of this Meeting \"Placenta: the origin of pregnancy health and disease\" is highly comprehensive. We count with great International speakers, so I would like to thank all the speakers that will be part of this IFPA. It also has 12 workshops in different topics, and I would also like to thank the organizers in charge of them. It has long poster presentation sessions to allow having time to find and interact with your favorite presenting authors. We have included several ECR and educational activities, and I would like to thank those in charge of these interesting activities. Now it is time to start and enjoy the program. During these four-day-meeting, I hope that all of you can enjoy, teach, learn and find something inspiring for the next step in your research in Placenta and Feto-Maternal interaction. Welcome to IFPA 2019 Meeting in 2019 September Buenos Aires, Argentina As a co-chair of the meeting, I would like to welcome you to the International Federation of Placenta Associations - IFPA 2019 conference and the VIII Meeting of the Latin America Society of Materno-Fetal Interaction and Placenta (VIII SLIMP). It is our pleasure to host this international event we hope you find stimulating and rewarding. This year, the conference is being held in Buenos Aires on the campus of the Pontificia Catholic University, in Puerto Madero, at the edge of the river and just a 10-minute walk from downtown. Buenos Aires is a city full of charm, a combination of Latin and European ambient, with many cultural attractions, that should not be missed. We look forward to seeing you, and other conference participants, at this delightful venue. The conference starts on September 10, followed by sessions covering diverse aspects of the research and innovation related to placental science, which will happen up to September 13. You will have the opportunity to participate and to present your work, to establish essential scientific collaborations, and to see presentations from leading academics and practitioners in placenta field. The meeting also supports and promotes young scientists with travel grants and dedicated presentations. We have worked hard to create a program consisting of the best quality, state of the art in placenta science. We hope this makes the conference an exciting and memorable scientific event for you! We look forward to seeing you all in ESTELA BEVILACQUA Co-Chair, IFPA 2019 - VIII SLIMP Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil IFPA & SLIMP 2019 6 IFPA WELCOME 10-13 September Buenos Aires, Argentina It gives me great pleasure to welcome IFPA members and friends to Buenos Aires for the 2019 International Federation of Placenta Associations meeting held together with the 8th meeting of Sociedad Latinoamericana de Interaccion Materno-Fetal y Placenta (SLIMP). The meeting is chaired by Professor Alicia Jawerbaum, hosted by the Placenta Association of the Americas and sponsored by IFPA. SLIMP was founded in 2000 by IFPA members attending the last Rochester Trophoblast and IFPA meeting in 2000. Since then Latin American placenta research has taken off encompassing comparative, basic and clinical placental science, as well as DOHAD research. Latin America has an estimated 648 million people in 2019 with Argentina the 4th most populous with nearly 45 million people. Between 2015 and 2020 there will be over 52 million births in Latin America. At 10 million Latin American births each year and some very exotic eutherian and 73 metatherian (marsupial) species, the opportunities are endless for Latin American placenta researchers! The IFPA/SLIMP 2019 program encourages new members and delegates from Latin America to join the IFPA network, to participate and contribute to global placenta research. We welcome new research priorities and collaborations on issues that impact the placenta and pregnancy success in the region and look forward to working further with SLIMP in the future. The congress program has something for everyone in placenta science with both familiar and new faces. Importantly there are many opportunities for younger researchers to learn and engage with others in academic sessions, workshops and social functions. Take every opportunity you can.

Congenital transmission of pathogens is the consequence of complex interactions among the pathogen, maternal and fetal/newborn immune responses, and placental factors. Here we will discuss different topics about infection with different pathogens during pregnancy including the Shiga toxin producing Echerichia coli, Trypanosoma cruzi the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease and Zika virus. Intrinsic factors of the different pathogens, placental factors as well as the inflammatory/immune response triggered by these pathogens will be discussed.

MARIANA FARINA Head of Laboratory of Physiopathology of Placenta, CEFYBO-UBA-CONICET, Bs As, Argentina SUMMARY: This workshop is dedicated to discuss similarities and differences between the two common and life threatening placental syndromes preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR). The topics will include pathophysiology, placental morphology and function, biomarkers and relation to future maternal and offspring health. Dysfunctional placental function is common for both preeclampsia and FGR. Abnormal placentation and abnormal trophoblast invasion and function is common both for early-onset preeclampsia and FGR. New-onset hypertension after gestational week 20 and FGR is today one of the clinical criteria to define preeclampsia in many revised definitions, in the absence of new-onset proteinuria. In this workshop, we will discuss the similarities and differences between these placental syndromes and discuss whether they represent separate or partly overlapping etiologies and pathophysiologies.

Sep 11 14:00 - 16:00 Organizers CARLOS SALOMON University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, Australia LARRY CHAMLEY University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand SUMMARY: The past decade has observed an extraordinary explosion of research in the field of extracellular vesicles (EVs). There are different population of EVs including nanovesicles (some of which are exosomes) microvesicles and in the specific case of the human placenta, macrovesicles. As this very rapidly expanding field grows we are learning that within the different sized vesicle populations there are additional specialized subsets of EVsthat may have specific functions. For example, exosomes may be sub-classified as exomeres, exo-S and exo-L (accordantly to their size) Regardless of the type, all EVs carry complex cargos including various nucleic acids, proteins and lipids all of which may be biologically active. Placental EVs are targeted to specific maternal organs and have the potential to regulate maternal cellular and organ function during pregnancy. Thus, placental EVs may be major players in feto-maternal communication. Since placental EVs are present in the maternal blood they are also potentially readily accessible biomarkers of fetal well-being Speakers Yoel Sadovsky. University of Pittsburgh, USA. Udo Markert.

Hannover, Germany DEREK E. WILDMAN University of South Florida (Tampa, USA) SUMMARY: The placenta is one of the most variable features of mammalian anatomy and physiology. Because no other species has a placenta that is identical to the human it has been challenging to find appropriate animal models for comparative experimental studies. Each animal model species has advantages and disadvantages. In this workshop we will work to develop a workflow for deciding which species is appropriate for specific research questions. Some species may share anatomical or physiological features with human placentas while lacking good genomic resources while other species may have strong genomic and transgenic resources but have placental anatomy that diverges greatly from that seen in humans. We will also consider the placenta from the broad definition given by H.W. Mossman, any apposition of fetal and maternal tissue. With this broad definition in mind it is possible to consider placentation in non-mammalian species such as reptiles and invertebrate onychophoran velvet worms.

Sep 12 17:15 - 19:15 Organizers THERESA POWELL University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA. ANDREA LEIVA Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. SUMMARY: The human placenta is critical for pregnancy success through its roles as an endocrine organ, establishing the relationship between maternal and fetal blood supplies and in nutrient delivery and gas exchange to ensure adequate growth. Multiple cellular signaling pathways are responsible of the regulation of these critical functions. This workshop is aimed to review some of the placental cellular signaling critical for placental development and highlight the cellular signaling events that modulate placental function, pregnancy outcome and life long health.

LYNDA HARRIS University of Manchester, UK SUMMARY: The placenta plays many crucial roles for the maintenance of pregnancy. It is the chief regulator of fetal development by facilitation of transfer of nutrients, gases and waste products between the mother and fetus; synthesising hormones to support feto-placental growth; remodel the uterine spiral arterioles to establish an optimum vascular environment; and prevent and protect not only from immune-mediated rejection of the fetus but also from infectious agents and environmental insults. As such adequate placental function is instrumental for a successful pregnancy outcome and abnormalities of placental development and function contribute to major pathologies of pregnancy including spontaneous preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia. Assessment of placental function across gestation is challenging due to the risks for the mother and the developing fetus. Thus far, reports on human placental development and function comes from studying placentas from pathological and uncomplicated pregnancies collected at third trimester or term deliveries. However, molecular changes in the placenta may initiate processes that lead to placental pathologies, well before clinical signs of pregnancy complications are detected. In this workshop we will discuss on novel technologies used in placental research in defining the structure and function of the human placenta, their use in clinical settings and also the model systems that have been developed to better understand abnormal development leading to pregnancy pathologies.

The importance of the adaptations to pregnancy are obvious from the fact that many pregnancy complications are associated with aberrant immunological adaptations. During this symposium immunological adaptations in the mother during healthy pregnancy are presented both peripheral immune changes as well as changes in the placental bed. Actors that may interfere with these immune responses will be discussed as well as aberrant immune responses in some pregnancy complications will be discussed. Finally, developing fetal immune responses will be discussed and how these could be influenced by various maternal factors. During the symposium there will be plenty of time for questions and discussions. Speakers Ana Zenclussen. Medical Faculty, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany. Silvia Daher.

FEDERICO JENSEN Laboratory for Immunology of Pregnancy, Center for Pharmacological and Botanical Studies, Medical Faculty, Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Argentina. SUMMARY: Preterm birth, defined as birth occurring before 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity as well as the second cause of dead in children under 5 years. 15 million babies are born prematurely every year, representing 5 to 18% of pregnancies worldwide. In addition, due to immaturity of multiple organ systems, neonates born preterm are more susceptible to develop short-term complications as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, and vision and hearing impairments during post-natal life. Thus, despite extensive efforts, preterm birth has remained an intractable medical and public health challenge. Although it is considered a syndrome attributable to multiple pathogenic processes, intrauterine and systemic infection and/or inflammation are causally linked to preterm birth. In this workshop we will discuss the latest advances in the understanding of preterm birth pathophysiology. Speakers Nardhy Gomez-Lopez. Wayne State University School of Medicine, USA. Kang Chen.

JAMES M. ROBERTS Global Pregnancy Collaboration and Magee-Womens Research Institute, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Epidemiology and Clinical and Translational Research University of Pittsburgh.SUMMARY: Women with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, have excess risk of later life cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mechanisms of these disorders could be associated with an underlying high-risk vascular phenotype, that may have been programed during intrauterine life. Since the placenta is a highly vascularized tissue, it may constitute a unique source of information of what and how vascular structure/function is affected in women with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Even more, placental evidence of impaired vascular function may serve as \"a fingerprint\" that may alert us to what would be the vascular response of women and their offspring in future life. In this symposium we aim to analyze evidence of impaired placental vascular structure/function and its relevance to future cardiovascular risk. This may suggest potential underling mechanisms and pharmacological targets. The relationship of placental structure/function to later maternal disease could provide unique insights in the field and help us to move forward in both the understanding of cardiovascular disease in women and to alert health care systems about future cardiovascular risk.

PAOLA CASANELLO Departments of Obstetrics & Neonatology, School of Medicine Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. SUMMARY: The placenta field has been strongly molded in recent years by the concept of epigenetic determinants of health. From less than 5 papers published in this field in 2005 to more than 80 in 2018, we are gaining a glimpse of how DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling are associated with the way maternal conditions and exposures during pregnancy are sensed by the placenta and compromise fetal and postnatal physiological responses. Epigenetic marks have often been interrogated independently of genetic variation. However, there is strong evidence showing the interaction between genetics and environment in mediating epigenetic variation. In this workshop we will offer talks with different looks from senior and young researchers in the field, with the objective of setting a fructiferous discussion on the current challenges that genetic and epigenetic studies in the placenta confront today.

SUMMARY: Maternal metabolic derangements in pregnancy are a worldwide growing problem and can induce placental and fetal anomalies. Notably, as a result of the disturbed intrauterine environment offspring\u00b4s metabolism might be compromised and may lead to long-lasting alterations as well. Affected newborns are at increased risk of developing related diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular disorders during life. The research in the field has explored and identified that excess of nutrients, a disturbed lipid profile, an altered hormonal milieu together with an imbalance of antioxidant/pro-inflammatory substances are the main stressors and causes of the anomalies observed in placentas, fetuses and offspring. This workshop focusses on the underlying mechanisms of these alterations on the feto-placental axis and offspring. A holistic view of this specific topical problem will be achieved through presentation of different experimental models and including the spatial-temporal axis of pregnancy.

While placental science has outstanding representation of women at the trainee and, more recently, mid-career levels, women are still under-represented at senior academic levels or their non-academic equivalents. Our panel of three highly successful mid-career women scientists is led by IFPA 2019 Andr\u00e9e Gruslin Award winner Dr. Natalie Hannan (University of Melbourne, President of ANZPRA, our SLIMP's Pacific Rim sister society). Panelists will outline the greatest challenge they faced in becoming successful mid-career scientists. They will discuss how they resolved these challenges in the first half of our session. The second half will be dedicated to discussion, by panel and audience, of the two themes or questions regarding career development that have been identified by trainees attending IFPA 2019 as their most significant challenges.

The recent identification of new pathways of trophoblast invasion into all luminal structures of the uterine wall shows that our understanding of placentation and support of the embryo and fetus needs to be taken to a next level. The first luminal structures eroded by trophoblasts are uterine glands. Invasion of endoglandular trophoblasts starts a few days after implantation to assure nutrition of the embryo as early as possible (uterine milk). During further placental development, invasion of glands at the margin of the growing placenta allows endoglandular trophoblasts to escape the uterine wall and to reach the uterine cavity and cervix. The next luminal structures eroded by extravillous trophoblasts are uterine veins. Invasion of endovenous trophoblasts is essential for the backflow of any maternal fluids from the placenta back into the maternal system. Shortly afterwards, endoarterial trophoblasts invade spiral arteries, connect them to the intervillous space of the placenta as well, but block blood flow to the placenta via arterial plugs. Hence, during the first trimester of pregnancy, the arteries are still plugged by endoarterial trophoblasts, while the veins are already open and linked to the placenta. This allows a flow of plasma (arteries) and glandular secretion products (glands) towards the placenta and the backflow into the maternal circulation (veins). Since alterations of any of the newly identified pathways of trophoblast invasion (glandular, venous as well as lymphatic) have not been studied so far, the new invasion pathways (trophoblast invasion 2.0!) allow the development of new concepts to elucidate the impact of altered trophoblast invasion into any luminal structure of the uterus to further identify the causes of pregnancy pathologies. THE ROLE OF MATERNAL ADIPONECTIN AND PLACENTAL mTOR SIGNALING IN FETAL PROGRAMMING OF ADULT DISEASE Thomas Jansson University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, USA. In women, maternal circulating adiponectin levels are inversely correlated to birth weight suggesting that maternal adiponectin limits fetal growth. Consistent with this concept, infusion of full-length adiponectin to pregnant mice in rates that increased circulating levels 2-3-fold caused intrauterine growth restriction. Studies in cultured primary human trophoblast cells and in mice in vivo have demonstrated that these effects are likely to be due to direct actions of adiponectin on the trophoblast. In contrast to its well-known insulin-sensitizing effects in skeletal muscle and liver, adiponectin inhibits placental insulin and mTOR signaling and amino acid transport. This effect is mediated by activation of trophoblast PPARa signaling, which increases ceramide synthesis, resulting in inhibition of IRS-1. Overweight and obese women have low circulating adiponectin levels and have an increased risk to deliver large babies, associated with an activation of placental function, in particular nutrient transport. We have developed a mouse model of maternal obesity with extensive similarities to the human condition, including elevated levels of maternal leptin, glucose intolerance, activation of placental insulin and mTOR signaling, increased placental nutrient transport and fetal overgrowth. Restoration of normal circulating levels of adiponectin in obese pregnant mice the last four days of pregnancy completely prevented placental dyfunction, fetal hyperglycemia and overgrowth. In addition, normalization of maternal adiponectin levels in obese dams during late pregnancy, prevented the development of obesity, glucose tolearance, insulin resitance, liver steatosis and cardiac diastolic dysfynction in the offspring. Our findings demonstrate that low circulating adiponectin in maternal obesity is mechanistically linked to activation of mTOR signaling, increased placental nutrient transport and fetal growth and offspring metabolic and cardiovascular health. Thus, adiponectin constitutes an important endocrine link between maternal adipose tissue and the placenta, with powerful impact on placental signaling, fetal development and offspring long-term health. IFPA & SLIMP 2019 128 LATE SPEAKERS ABSTRACTS 10-13 September Buenos Aires, Argentina MRI OF EMBRYO IMPLANTATION Michal Neeman Department of Biological Regulation, The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot Israel Focal maternal angiogenesis surrounding the adhered embryo is one of the hallmarks of implantation and decidualization. Characterized by highly regulated vessel expansion, sprouting and enhanced vascular leak, this angiogenic response enables detection of very early pregnancy using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE; 1). By application of MRI on advanced genetic mouse models we were able to detect multiple regulatory checkpoints that impact the success of implantation. Using transgenic mice in which the dendritic cells (DCs) express diphtheria toxin, we could show that selective ablation of DCs was sufficient to obstruct the maternal angiogenesis and abort pregnancy (2). Similar failure of implantation was observed with mice carrying selective deletion of connexin 43 (3). Recently we reported that trophoblast expression of tissue transglutaminase 2 and factor XIII regulate maternal angiogenesis at implantation, and that selective over expression or deletion of either of these enzymes selectively in the blastocyst trophectoderm impacts implantation (4). Finally, the same approach of selective manipulation of the trophectoderm, was applied for demonstrating the role of hyaluronan deposition and degradation on spatial-temporal vascular morphogenesis during implantation (Hadas et al submitted). 1.

In our mouse model of maternal obesity, which is induced by a high fat diet (HFD), we investigated molecular and physiological changes of the placenta at E15.5 regarding the proteomics profile of the transfer zone, endothelial cell homeostasis, the ultrastructure, and materno-fetal transfer. Results: Not only did feeding a HFD cause weight gain in dams, it also led to an IUGR phenotype in the offspring which is reversed at the end of pregnancy (E18.5), where HFD fetuses display similar weights as controls. We sought to further characterize the vascular morphology of HFD placentas by stereological means to determine surface area, volumes, and length of the materno-fetal transfer zone, placental structures, and fetal capillaries, respectively. Interestingly, the capillary profile was significantly altered while volumes of the placental tissue zones remained nearly unaffected in terms of volume changes. Proteomics profiling revealed alterations of adherens junction markers in the transfer zone of HFD placentas which was further investigated by western blot of whole placental lysates. On the ultrastructural level, the basement membrane, cell-cell contacts, EC and trophoblast integrity seemed altered in the transfer zone of HFD placentas. Further, we found a significant change in materno-fetal transfer of radiolabeled tracer in HFD placental units. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate placental and endothelial dysfunction, and suggest placental barrier alterations, changes in cell-cell adhesion, and a HFD-specific phenotype of placental units from HFD dams, which demands further investigation of the underlying mechanisms. LA.2 CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN PLACENTAL BARRIER EXPOSURE TO 1124, F-75005 Paris, France Objectives: Air pollution is a major concern and exposure of pregnant women can lead to harmful effects on both fetal growth and pregnancy outcome. The offending pollutants crossing other barriers could reach the placenta and impair its integrity and functions. We investigate here the impact of two distinct pollutants found in air pollution, Benzo(a)Pyrene (BaP) and Cerium dioxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NP), on human placental barrier integrity and functions. Methods: We used primary cultures of villous cytotrophoblasts purified from term placenta that differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts in vitro. The concentrations range of pollutants used for the assessments were from very low, to mimic the concentrations found in the blood, up till the highest airborne level measured at Paris. We evaluated the internalization of CeO2 NP by TEM and the dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity of NP and BaP by WST-1 assay. At subtoxical level, we determined the impact of these pollutants toward the formation of the syncytium (under confocal microscopy) and hormonal functions (by measuring steroid and peptidic hormones secretion). Results: We demonstrate the ability of CeO2 NP to be uptaken by the trophoblasts at any concentration tested. In regard to cell viability BaP make no difference either after 3 days of incubation with high doses, whereas CeO2 NP are cytotoxic to primary trophoblast cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, BaP induces an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in trophoblasts from low doses while there is a decrease of ROS production with NP at high doses. Moreover, at non- cytotoxic doses, CeO2 decrease the capacity of differentiation of cytotrophoblasts and disturbs both hCG and P4 secretion in culture media. Conclusion: Both BaP and CeO2 NP impacts placental functioning. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the consequences of CeO2 NP and of BaP on human primary trophoblasts from term placenta. IFPA & SLIMP 2019 SECRETION OF France Objectives: was to study the implication of NADPH oxidase/p38 MAPK pathway on sFlt-1 explants (7-9 GW) were cultured for 72 h. After 24 h of culture, the villi were treated with TGF-1 (10 ng / ml) for 48 h or pre-incubated with p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor (SB203580 - 10 M). Treatment with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI - 2.5 M) for 1 h was also performed. Expression levels of p38 and smad2 (total and phosphorylated) were studied by Western Blot. The secretion assay of sFlt-1 in supernatants after 72 h of culture was performed by ELISA (R&D Systems\u00ae). The localization of p38 in chorionic villi (7-9 GW) was studied observations were realized by confocal microscopy. Results: We showed that the p38 protein is mainly expressed in the villous cytotrophoblast in first trimester chorionic villi. The activation of p38 using TGF-1 significantly increases the secretion of sFlt-1 in culture supernatants at 72 h (n = 7, p < 0.05). This effect is reversed when chorionic villi are pre-incubated with the p38 inhibitor (n = 7, p <0.05). A downward trend of sFlt-1 secretion is observed when the villi are treated with DPI (p = 0.1250, n = 4). Furthermore, the treatment in the presence of TGF-1 showed smad2 activation regardless of the p38 MAPK pathway Conclusion: In first trimester is preferentially localized in the villous cytotrophoblast is involved in the sFlt-1 secretion, independently of smad2 activation. NADPH oxidase also appears to be involved in sFlt-1 secretion in this model. LA.4 LIPODYSTROPHY-ASSOCIATED PPARG VARIANTS INDUCE A DECREASED CELL FUSION AND MIGRATION IN HUMAN VILLOUS CYTOTROPHOBLAST AND FIBROBLAST, RESPECTIVELY reference centre of rare diseases of insulin secretion and of insulin sensitivity proliferator-activated receptor gamma) belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptor acting as a transcription factor on target genes. PPAR is involved in adipogenesis and is essential for placental development, vasculogenesis and trophoblast differentiation. Alterations in its expression and/or activity are associated with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. To date, the molecular regulation of PPAR in cytotrophoblast differentiation and in the underlying mesenchyme has been poorly studied and remains to be explored. Vascular placental abnormalities have been described in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3) due to PPARG pathogenic variants. The objective of the project is to study the impact of heterozygous mutations in the LBD of PPARG on trophoblastic isolated from human term placenta, plated on plastic culture dishes and cultured for 72h in DMEM/10% FCS. PPAR reconstitution experiments were performed after 16h of culture by transfecting cells with plasmids GFP-PPARWT or index was assessed by nuclei counting of GATA3 immunostaining. Skin fibroblasts from 3 control subjects and 2 patients bearing the PPARG p.R262G or p.L339X heterozygous variants, were assayed IncuCyte\u00ae Live-Cell Analysis Imaging System. Results: In vitro, PPAR silencing in VCT led to a significant decrease in syncytiotrophoblast formation and compared to the reconstitution with PPARWT, PPARE352Q led to a significant lower restoration of the trophoblast fusion. Compared to controls, fibroblasts bearing the PPARG p.L319X mutation, or, to a lesser extent, the p.R262G variant, show a significantly decreased cell migration. Conclusion: Missense variants in the LBD of PPAR inhibit significantly the cell fusion and migration processes in villous cytotrophoblasts and fibroblasts, which could play a role in vascular placental abnormalities associated with FPLD3. IFPA & SLIMP LATE ABSTRACTS 10-13 Aires, Argentina LA.5 TARGETED DELIVERY Center, USA; 3University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA Objectives: To reduce the risk of detrimental side effects associated with systemic drug administration in pregnancy, approaches that facilitate uteroplacental-specific drug delivery are being investigated. We have previously developed targeted liposomes which selectively deliver payloads to the placentas of pregnant mice. In this pilot study, we assessed whether systemic administration of targeted liposomes resulted in selective delivery to the non-human primate placenta. Methods: Liposomes were produced using homing peptide a marmoset (gestational term and a cynomologous macaque (GD~81; term = GD165), or administered via injection into a rhesus macaque (GD~135; term = GD165). 24h, animals anaesthetised, received cardiac saline perfusion and were euthanized. A variety of maternal, uteroplacental and fetal tissues were harvested; biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections were prepared, stained with DAPI and viewed using a fluorescence microscope. Results: Targeted liposomes were well tolerated, with no adverse reactions reported. Microscopy revealed liposomal accumulation in both placental discs of each animal, which varied in intensity and tissue distribution. Liposomal fluorescence was also observed in the maternal liver of the marmoset, with a much weaker signal observed in the spleen and heart. Limited fluorescence was noted in the maternal livers of both macaque species, but no visible signal was observed in any of the other maternal organs, or in any fetal tissue examined. Conclusion: These preliminary observations suggest that iRGD-decorated liposomes selectively accumulate in the placentas of three different non-human primate species in vivo, but are not transferred to the fetus. Their composition appears to be compatible with short term treatment, indicating this nanoparticle formulation may be suitable for targeted placental delivery of therapeutic payloads in human pregnancy. LA.6 INVESTIGATION OF THE PLACENTAL STEROIDOGENESIS DISRUPTION CAUSED BY BISPHENOL of Veterinary Medicine, Rakuno Gakuen University Objectives: Bisphenols are contained in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, leading to the various toxic effects such as reproductive disorders. Notably, it is suggested that bisphenols are transferred to the fetus through the placenta in the pregnant. In addition, placenta produces steroids which affect pregnancy and parturition; however, steroidogenesis disruption caused by bisphenols in the placenta is not well described. In this context, we investigated the effect of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) on steroidogenesis in the human derived placental trophoblast (BeWo) cells in the present study. Methods: To evaluate effects of BPA and BPF on steroidogenesis in BeWo cyto-trophoblasts, steroidogenic proteins detected treatment of BPA and BPF (100 nM). mRNA expression of these molecules were also quantified. In addition, enzymatic activity of sulfotransferases and transporter activity of the organic anion transporter were investigated by measuring BPA and BPF by using LC-MS/MS. Results: We initially confirmed whether BeWo cells express proteins regarding the steroidogenic pathway. As the result, we confirmed gestagen producing molecules such as TSPO, P450scc, 3\u00df-HSD1 and P45017 in BeWo cells. Notably, protein expression of TSPO and P450scc, which are related to progesterone (PGS) biosynthesis, were significantly decreased in 48 hrs by treatment of BPA and BPF in the cells. In addition, protein expression of P450scc and TSPO were decreased by treatment of the BPF-sulfate (100 \u00b5M) conjugate. Conclusion: Cholesterol, the initial substrate in the steroidogenic pathway, is trafficked to inner-mitochondrial membrane by TSPO, subsequently converted to pregnenolone mediated by P450scc, indicating that exposure of BPA and BPF might disrupt PGS biosynthesis in BeWo cells. We will investigate the mechanisms underlying suppression of TSPO and P450scc caused by BPA and BPF in BeWo and placental transfer of through metabolites (glucuronide and sulfate of bisphenols).

Methods: In the cross-sectional study, 102 pregnant tea garden (TGW) and 73 housewives (HW) were included with normal birth weight (NBW) and low birth weight (LBW) babies. Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) levels in maternal blood, placenta and umbilical cord blood were measured. Pathological changes in placental tissues by the analysis of Hypoxia-Induced Factor -1 (HIF-1) expression were also evaluated. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies were also performed to investigate the binding interaction of AChE with its standard substrates acetylcholine and pesticides. Results: Low levels of AChE were observed in maternal blood and cord blood in TGW as compared to HW in the LBW group. However, in the NBW group, AChE in maternal blood and placenta was comparatively higher than the LBW group. In silico approach, Docking and MDS results also revealed that pesticides have a comparatively higher binding affinity with AChE than its standard substrate acetylcholine. In adjusted regression analysis according to occupations, birth outcome (birth weight-BW, head circumference-HC, infant's length-IL, and ponderal index- PI) showed a significant and positive association with AChE levels of maternal blood, placenta and cord blood in TGW (p<0.05). The placental weight was found to be positively correlated with maternal blood and placental levels of AChE in TGW when compared with housewives. In HW, birth weight expects HC, IL, and PI, was also significantly and positively associated with AChE level. However, compared with TGW, the relative weight of placenta (RWP) showed a significant and inverse association with AChE in maternal blood and placenta in housewives (<0.05). Histologically, placental syncytial knots, higher among TGW with LBW babies. Scanning Electron Microscopy, revealed micro-infarction, increased deposition of fibrinoid material in the placental tissue of TGW and HW exposed to pesticides along with other atypical characteristics of villi, such as the balloon-like formation of microvilli. IHC exhibited increased HIF-1 expressions in placental tissues of TGW and HW exposed to pesticides. Conclusion: The study revealed that In-utero exposure to pesticides might be associated with pathologic changes and increased HIF-1 expression, decreased AChE levels in the placenta of TGW and HW might present implications such as adverse pregnancy complications. In silico analysis also established that pesticides act as competitive acetylcholine inhibitors. The findings strengthened the evidence that pesticides exposures during pregnancy may restrict fetal growth and placental development. "}
