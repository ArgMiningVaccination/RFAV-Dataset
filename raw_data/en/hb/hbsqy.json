The human body is the product of five elements of nature: Akasha i.e. Space; Vayu i.e Air; Agni i.e Fire; Jal i.e. Water; Prithvi i.e. Earth. Food is one of the primary means to keeping our bodies healthy and balanced in Ayurveda. Eating seasonally and making dietary choices based on our dosha imbalances can help us feel our best throughout the entire year. In Ayurveda, fall is Vata season, the season governed by air and space. During this season, it's important to incorporate warming, moist, and heavy qualities to offset the cold and dry nature of this dosha. To eat your way to a nourishing and balanced Vata season, follow these simple Ayurvedic recipes. Summer is on its way out the door and as the daylight begins to dwindle, we welcome the transition into fall, the season governed by Vata. Vata is the dosha ruled by air and space, and Vata season begins during fall and lasts until mid-winter. This season can bring along dry, cold, and flighty qualities that may create imbalances for those who already have Vata as a prominent part of their constitution. Because you are unique, adapting to the world is different for you than for someone else. One environment is beneficial to some people but not to others. If you want to practice self-care, this is a critical aspect. Ayurveda has been a self-care system for thousands of years, and understanding how your doshas work remains one of the best ways to practice self-care. Vata season is associated with autumn. Just as we see the wind blowing the colored leaves down to earth, the qualities of air and ether become dominant in our constitution. Leading up to the vata season, now is a perfect time to start changing routines and modifying yoga sequences. As a physician, one thing I hear often from patients is the question \"This has been working fine for me, so why isn't it now?\" They are usually referring to a diet, exercise program, or lifestyle that had been keeping them balanced previously, but doesn't seem to be anymore. The simple answer, according to Ayurveda, is that nature is constantly changing, so therefore our daily practices and choices must change to accommodate for that. We are not the same year to year, month to month, or even day to day. When we understand that our body, thoughts, emotions, and nature itself is constantly changing, we understand that our routines need to change in order to stay healthy. When the heat of summer dwindles and the chill of autumn begins to set in, we welcome the onset of Vata season. Vata is the Dosha associated with the elements of air and space. The dry and cold qualities of fall can tend to aggravate Vata in certain people this time of year, so it's imperative we implement proper self-care to counteract Vata imbalance. The three doshas are naturally dynamic, which means that they constantly respond to changes in your life. The biggest changes occur seasonally, and summer is the season when Pitta dosha is strongly affected, because heat and humidity are two qualities that summer shares with Pitta, which is warm and moist. Summer heat can easily aggravate Pitta, so you want to pay special attention during this season. Keeping our doshas balanced is an important part of maintaining a healthy body and mind throughout the entire year. Seasonal shifts are big news in the world of Ayurveda and can cause doshic imbalances if we aren't honoring their cycles and living accordingly. While the summer season is a magical time of year, it is also Pitta season, and if we don't adjust our diets and lifestyle to keep Pitta at bay, we risk accumulating excess heat in the body. A Pitta imbalance can show up as anger, irritation, loose stools, acid reflux, skin disorders, and more. "}
