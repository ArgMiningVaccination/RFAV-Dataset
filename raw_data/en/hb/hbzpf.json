All rights reserved. 2 Section 1: Executive Summary Beginning in November 2016, the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM\u00ae) undertook a full- scale Job Analysis study of the role of the licensed acupuncturists, creating a survey of the knowledge elements required of competent, entry -level practice. The results of this survey provided support for the relevance, validity, and legal defensibility of the NCCA OM \u00ae examination programs, establishing the link between what acupuncturists do on -the-job and the content of the NCCAOM\u00ae Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM), Biomedicine (BIO), Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL), and Chinese Herbology (CH) examinati ons. The survey was developed based on results from a comprehensive literature review of the professional certification and licensure role of acupuncturists (e.g., curricula for training programs, and job descriptions), phone interviews of practicing licensed acupuncturists, and feedback from a Panel of subject matter experts (SMEs). The 18 members of the Job Analysis (JA) Panel were recruited by NCCAOM leadership to represent the diversity of practice, experience, geographic location, education, ethnic bac kgrounds, and high -level professional expertise. All Panel members were NCCAOM credential holders in good standing. The findings from the literature review and licensed acupuncturists practitioner interviews were used to develop exhaustive lists of the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required of competent, entry -level acupuncture practice. One list was created for each of the NCCAOM examinations (FOM, BIO, ACPL, CH), for a total of four KSA lists to be included on the survey. These lists were presented to the JA Panel members for review and approval at a three -day meeting held in Jacksonville, Florida, January 20 -22, 2017. A single rating scale was adopted, providing a mechanism for measuring both KSA importance and whether or not the KSA was performed . A demographic questionnaire was developed to gather confidential data describing the survey respondents, which included branching questions to determine whether the respondent was qualified to evaluate the CH KSA list and should be presented with that section of the survey. After the Panel meeting the survey was created and posted online by staff at Schroeder Measurement Technologies (SMT), one of NCCAOM's testing vendors. The survey was beta tested with the Panel members and NCCAOM and SMT staffs, and the first invitations to respondents were issued June 30, 2017. Invitations were sent via email to all known licensed acupuncturists and NCCAOM constituent groups, numbering approximately 33,000 practitioners. Three email reminders to participate were sent while the survey was open through October 1, 2017. During that time the survey was also advertised via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and an article about the job analysis and how to complete the survey, written by the NCCAOM' s CEO and the \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 3 Director of Credentialing and Testing, was published in the July 2017 edition of Acupuncture Today . There were 3,285 unique logins to the survey, representing a response rate of approximately 10%, which is excellent for an unsolicited online survey. Over 95% of respondents indicated that the survey either completely or adequately described the critical KSAs required for competent, entry -level practice as an acupuncturist. This supports a high degree of confidence that the depth and breadth of the survey content was reflective of practice across geographic settings and among various work -practice settings. The internal consistency of the survey ratings was evaluated using the Cronbach Alpha reliability estimate, which was calculated on each of the four KSA lists separately. This statistic is bound between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating higher instrument reliability, and coefficients of 0.7 or higher deemed acceptable. The average reliability estimate across all four sections was 0.9 6, which indicates that the KSAs did an excellent job measuring the same construct, i.e., knowledge base required for competent, entry- level practice as an acupuncturist. A second JA Panel meeting was held in San Diego, California, November 4 -5, 2017, to consider and review the results of the survey data analyses. The primary goal of this meeting was to use the survey results to establish exclusion criteria to differentiate between the critical and non -critical KSAs. Among the results presented by the NCCA OM's psychometrician were mean importance , percentage of non -performance, and calculated criticality for each KSA. The criticality of a KSA was computed as follows: criticality=mean importance \u00d7(1- % NP), where % NP= percent of respondents who selected \"0=Not Performed\". Also provided were the results of subgroup analyses of KSA importance based on responses to select demographic categories such as years of experience, geographic location, and pr actice setting, to ensure that the results held across all respondents. Based on the review of the survey results, exclusion criteria were developed that eliminated five KSAs from the FOM list and eight KSAs from the ACPL list; two additional KSAs were removed from ACPL because one could not be assessed on a m ultiple -choice exam and the other already appeared on the FOM KSA list. No KSAs were removed from the BIO or CH KSA lists, and no KSAs were added to any of the lists after Panel review of open -ended comments from the survey respondents. The Panel also confirmed the lists o f pharmaceuticals, nutrients and supplements, and medical conditions for the BIO examination, Extra Points for the ACPL examination, and Chinese individual herbs and formulas for the CH exam. During the meeting, the Panel agreed to minor additional editing resulting in final approved content outlines for the FOM, BIO, ACPL, and CH examinations. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 4 Once each content outline was finalized, the content area weightings were established by the Panel based on data from the survey along with their own expert opinions. The Panel discussed the scoring and reporting procedures, recommending that the scaled score reporting model be continued, allowing for the reporting of a consistent minimum scaled passing score. The Panel also confirmed the test specifications were app ropriate for the examination: 100 items administered during a 2 hour and 30 -minute testing window, candidates have access to a white board and markers but no other resources. The Panel also reviewed and confirmed that the minimum eligibility and recertification requirements are sufficient and appropriate based on the new content outlines. See the NCCAOM website for the content outlines for the Foundations of Oriental Medicine, Biomedicine, Acupuncture with Point Location, and Chinese Herbology certification examinations. These blueprints will take effect beginning January 1, 2020. Section 2: Introduction About the NCCAOM and Its Role in Credentialing Acupuncturists: The Mission of the NCCAOM is to ensure the safety and well -being of the public and to advance the professional practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine by establishing and promoting evidence. NCCAOM certification or a passing score on the NCCAOM certification examinations [Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM) , Biomedicine (BIO), Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL) and Chinese Herbology (CH)] are documentation of competency for licensure as an acupuncturist . Forty-seven U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia have practice a cts in place to define and regulate the practice of acupuncture. California is the only state which currently develops and administers its own state licensing exam . Of the 46 states that use two or more of the NCCAOM exam scores for competency verification , 25 states require NCCAOM Board Certification in Acupuncture, and/or Chinese Herbology, or Oriental Medicine (See Illustration 1) . Practitioners who earn one or more of the following certification designations: Diplomate of Acupuncture (NCCAOM)\u00ae, Diplomate of Chinese Herbology (NCCAOM)\u00ae or Diplomate of Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)\u00ae, may refer to themselves as NCCAOM National Board- Certified Acupuncturists . All NCCAOM certification programs are currently accredited by the National Commission for Certification Agencies (NCCA). \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 5 Illustration 1 : Map of States that Use NCCAOM C ertifications or Exams for Acupuncture Licensure There are four eligibility routes to certification for a Diplomate of Acupuncture (NCCAOM) \u00ae and a Diplomate of Chinese Herbology (NCCAOM)\u00ae: Route 1 - Formal Education: United States Applicant Route 2 - Formal Education: International Applicant Route 3 - Apprenticeship Applicant Route 4 - Combination of Formal Education & Apprenticeship Applicant \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 6 There are three routes to certification fo r Diplomate of Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)\u00ae: Route 1 - Formal Education: United States Applicant Route 2 - Formal Education: International Applicant Route 5 - Converting to an NCCAOM Oriental Medicine Certification Applicant The eligibility requirements for these routes are expla ined in detail on the NCCAOM website's Certification - Eligibility requirements sub -page. An Overview of t he JA Process and Other Background Information on the Acupuncturist Profession: This report details the results of a year -long job analysis (JA) study, also known as an occupational analysis, or practice analysis which is a process used to validate the co ntent of high -stakes, competency assessments, used for credentialing or employment in an occupation. This research -based analysis is for the professional occupational role of an acupuncturist, (The Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS)'s Standard Occupational Code - Acupuncturists - SOC -29- 1291 ), therefore this research requires participation of a significant number of acupuncturists actively working in their occupational role. I t captures individual opinions of these professionals that span the diversity of practice and results in the creation of a professional profile that describes the essential core knowledge elements in the role to practice safely , ethically, and competently. The JA is the first step in the development of certification examinations . This research process is used to validate the content of the exams, in other words, the JA provides the critical link between competent practice on -the-job with the examination con tent on the certification exams. The JA survey process includes the creation of, or the updating of occupational tasks through a detailed survey questionnaire, designed by subject matter experts (SMEs) who are credentialed (national board- certified, and/or licensed as acupuncturists ). The survey questionnaire, i.e., survey instrument , is then used to confirm, all tasks that need to be assessed, and are therefore, on the c ertification examination content outline(s), for individuals wanting to enter the profession (i.e., occupation). The final analysis of the JA survey results, links the knowledge, skills and abilities to the final exam content outlines used for the certification /licensure exams. The content outlines for each examination are published wit h separate sub -content content domains which are weighted as to the percentage of items in each domain and all the associated KSAs within each of the domains. The JA study ultimately establishes the link between test scores achieved on certification/licens ing exams and the competencies being tested; therefore, pass or fail decisions correlate to competent performance. When evidence of validity based on examination content is presented for a specific professional role, it is critical to consider \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 7 the importan ce of the competencies being tested. The Joint Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing ( AERA , APA, and NCME , 1999) state: Stand ard 14.10 \"When evidence of validity based on test content is presented, the rationale for defining and describing a specific job content domain in a particular way (e.g., in terms of tasks to be performed or knowledge, skills, abilities, or other personal characteristics) should be stated clearly\". Standard 14.14 \"The content domain to be covered by a credentialing test should be defined clearly and justified in terms of the importance of the content for the credential -worthy performance in an occupation or profession. A rationale should be provided to support a claim that the knowledge or skills being assessed are required for credential -worthy performance in an occupation and are consistent with the purpose for which the licensing or certification program was instituted.\" The above standards are used by the NCCAOM and are included in the NCCA's Standards for Accreditation of Certification Programs , the agency which accredits each of the NCCAOM certification programs. The overall test development process for national certification exam involves seven steps: 1. The JA Study - Described above; 2. Item Writing - Drafting exam items (i.e., exam questions ) by an Item Writing Panel and/or throughout the year, by a diverse number of SMEs (both practitioners and educators ) from various regions of the United States , years in the profession, and practice settings. 3. Item Review and Revision - This step in the process involves a review of each draft item by an Examination Development Committee (EDC) to agree on the content and construct of each item to be used for examining candidates for certification and/or passage of the exam used for licensure. During this step each item is reviewed for accuracy, readabi lity, and sensitivity (appearance of no obvious subjective bias such as gender or ethic biases). It is during this step each item is identified by the SMEs as to where each item appears on the exam content outline and is classified to taxonomy level (recall, recite, recognize, etc. through comparison and computation, through application and judgment decisions). \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 8 4. Field testing Exam Items - During a certification examination session, candidates answer items on their test that have previously been validated for accuracy, reliability, and fairness, these items are the only ones used for scoring. The \"field tested items\" that are answered by the candidates are not used to score their exam, instead these items are first reviewed by a psychometrician to determine, certain statistic measurement qualities of the items, such as its ability to discriminate a competent from a non -competent performer , i.e. candidate, determine level of difficulty, and detect any subjective bias. Th e SMEs from the EDCs are again brought back together under the guidance of the psychometrician, to review any poorly performing items, which then are then reviewed, revised and rewritten, and will go into the pool of \"field -tested items\" during the next cy cle of field testing items. 5. Test Assembly - After a JA, a form-based (i.e. , linear ) test administration occurs and all items that have passed the field testing are assembled into several complete examinations covering all the content identified on the exa m content outlines. Following the first administration of the linear exams, based on the updated exam content outlines, another panel of SMEs conducts the next step in the test development and validation of the exams. Note: once there are enough candidates who take the linear exams (typically 250 to 300 candidates per linear exam) and the reliability of all the new test items are validated, then all future exam administrations return to computer adaptive testing. 6. Standard Setting (setting cut- scores for th e exam) - The purpose of this step to determine the minimum passing score used to screen competent from incompetent candidates. 7. Publish the Exam Preparation Guide for all stakeholders - Adequate notice must be given to all stakeholders before using any new exam content outlines, NCCAOM typically gives a minimum of one -year public notice. The NCCAOM Job Analysis Information Page on the NCCAOM website contains information from the last three JA Surveys. The results of this 2017 JA Survey provide support for the relevance, validity, and legal defensibility of the NCCAOM examination programs, establishing the link between what tasks acupuncturists perform on-the-job and the content of the NCCAOM Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM), Biomedicine (BIO), Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL), and Chinese Herbology (CH) examinations. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 9 Section 3: Research Design and Methodology for Conducting the 2017 JA Study Goals for the Survey: In November 2016, the NCCAOM\u00ae commenced preparation for a full-scale Job Analysis study of the occupational role of the licensed acupuncturist. The following goals for the study were to: 1. Determine what tasks acupuncturists currently perform , on the job, across all practice set tings; 2. Define a core set of knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), and competencies for entry- level acupuncturists , defined as credentialed (certified and/or licensed for up to two years); 3. Update the NCCAOM examination blueprints (i.e., exam content outl ines) to ensure that the certification/licensing exams remain fair, job -relevant, appropriate and legally defensible; and 4. Inform stakeholders of NCCAOM with information about acupuncturist skill sets and demographic profile. Appointment and Assignments fo r the First JA Panel Meeting : The Job Analysis (JA) Panel members were recruited by the NCCAOM leadership to represent the diversity of practice, experience, geographic location, education, ethnic backgrounds, and high -level professional expertise. All Panel members were NCCAOM credential holders in good standing. See Appendix A: 2017 JA Pane l Members . This table provides a list of the 18 SMEs who attended one or both face -to-face panel meetings, the state where they practice, years of experience, NCCAOM certification, dates of initial certification and if they are also California licensed , and type of practice. The appointment of the JA Panel commenced in 2016. In November of 2016, preliminary research was conducted after the appointment of the JA Panel. The first step of this process was to develop the JA Survey instrument, which was based on the results of a comprehensive literature review of the role (e.g., curricula for education/training programs, job descriptions ), the 2015 California Licensed Acupuncturists Occupational Analysis, and the 2013 NCCAOM JA Report by the Panel members. Addit ionally, structured phone interviews of practicing licensed acupuncturists, exploring their daily professional practice activities was conducted by Kate Windom, former Program Director, in the Assessment and Psychometric Services Department of Schroeder Measurement Technologies, Inc. (SMT) . Windom conducted the phone surveys and gathered feedback from the panel of SMEs after they had completed their literature review. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 10 The findings from the literature review and practitioner interviews were used to develop exhaustive lists of the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required of competent, entry - level acupuncture practice. One list was created for each of the NCCAOM ex aminations (FOM, BIO, ACPL, CH), for a total of four KSA lists to be included on the survey. These lists were presented to the JA Panel members at their first face-to- face meeting for their review and approval at a three -day meeting held in Jacksonville, Florida, January 20-22, 2017. The JA Survey instrument was then created to include an importance rating scale that was approved by the Panel. The rating scale was used throughout each exam section of the survey instrument to provide a mechanism for determ ining if a job task was performed or not performed (NP), and the importance rating of each job task . Below is the rating scale used: Table 1 : Screenshot of Non-Performance and Importance Rating s Scale Next, the Panel reviewed and refined the demographic questions for the JA Survey, which was developed to gather confidential data describing the survey respondents, which included branching questions to determine whether the respondent was qualified to evaluate the CH KSA list and, therefore, be presented with CH section of the survey. The following screenshots of the survey provide information about the online survey instructions and timelines and incentives, as well as the purpose and confidentiality nat ure of the responses to the demographic questions: \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

Development of the Knowledge Elements (e.g. , Job Task lists) and Other Reference Lists: The Job Analysis Panel 's next charge was to assist with development the 2017 JA Tasks (knowledge element lists). SMEs updated the 2013 JA Survey instrument knowledge elements based on their literature review, structured interviews outcomes captured, and consideration of the 2015 California Occupational Analysis Report. Beta Testing the Online JA Survey Instrument : Between February and March 2017, the electronic survey was built by SMT consultants. In April 2017 the online survey platform was reviewed and tested for appearance, content and branching by NCCAOM staff and SMT consultants, followed by a final review by the Panel members who beta tested the survey and provided feedback to the SMT developers and administrators of the survey instrument. During the months of May and June 2017 the SMT consultants incorporated the feedback from the beta test . The survey instrument was created to have respondents branch into one or more of the four examination sections for FOM, BIO, ACPL and CH (e.g., if the respondent's demographic information indicated experience and licensure in Chinese herbal medicine and or NCCAOM certification in Chinese Herbology they were prompted to take the C H survey) . \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 16 The survey instrument was designed so that each respondent was asked to consider their role as an acupuncturist and provide a single rating response to the following question: How Important is this knowledge elem ent in relation to ethical, effective, and safe practice? The respondents were asked further to use the rating scale (See Table 1. Rating Scale for Determining Importance Rating), select the rating that best describes \"Your\" opinion on the importance of t he knowledge element; and if you believe that the knowledge element is \"Never\" used in practice, to select \"Not Performed\" as a rating. The total number of knowledge elements (i.e., KSAs) across all sections of the exam sections (FOM, BIO, ACPL and CH) was 248 knowledge elements. The following Appendices are the screenshots for the various examination validation sections containing the KSAs, and reference lists: Appendix B1: Screenshot of the Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM) Survey - Knowledge Element s and Additional Post Survey Questions ; Appendix B2: Screenshot of the Biomedicine (BIO) Survey - Knowledge Elements, Pharmaceutical Classes, Supplements, Medical Conditions, and Post Survey Questions; Appendix B3: Screenshot of the Acupuncture with Poi nt Location (ACPL) Survey - Knowledge Elements, Extra Points, Additional Acupuncture Techniques, and Post Survey Questions; and Appendix B4: Screenshot Chinese Herbology (CH) Survey Knowledge Elements , Chinese Herbal Formulas, Individual Chinese Herbs, and Post Survey Questions In the FOM section ( see Appendix B1 ) of the JA Survey each respondent was asked to consider their role as a practitioner and provide a single rating response to the following question : How Important is this knowledge elemen t in relation to ethical, effective, and safe practice? [0 = Not Performed; 1 = Not Important; 2 = Low Importance; 3 = Moderately Important, and 4 = Extremely Important] for pattern syndrome differentiation and for the knowledge elements within each of the following three domains: Domain I : Clinical Examination Methods Domain II: Assessment, Analysis, Differential Diagnosis, Based Upon Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory Domain III: Treatment Principle (Zhi Ze) and Strategy (Zhi Fa) \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 17 The BIO section (see Appendix B2 ) of the JA Survey used the same rating scale, as defined for the FOM knowledge elements sections in three different domains: Domain I: Biomedical Model Domain II: Safety and Professional Responsibilities Domain III: Integration of traditional Chinese Medicine and Biomedicine. Next the respondents were asked to indicate the frequency of encountering certain pharmaceutical classes, supplements, and medical conditions . The respondents were to answer \"How frequently \"You\" encounter the following_____ in \"Your\" practice , using the following scale for frequency: [0 = Never; 1 = Rarely; 2 = Sometimes; and 3 = Often]. In the ACPL section (see Appendix B3 ) of the JA Survey the same rating scale, as defined for the FOM and BIO knowledge elements sections was used to determine importance of each knowledge element within four domains: Domain I: Safety and Professional Responsibilities Domain II: Treatment Pla n Domain III : Treatment Techniques Domain IV: Acupuncture Point Location Methods Each respondent was then asked to : \"Please indicate how often the following extra points are used in \"Your\" practice.\" using the same frequency scale as used for the BIO section lists [0 = Never; 1 = Rarely; 2 = Sometimes; and 3 = Often]. Next the respondents were offered a list of acupuncture techniques and asked to \"Please indicate : (1) Whether \"You\" use each of the following acupuncture technique in your practice (Rating scale: \"0\" = No and \"1\" = Yes ); and (2) Whether \" You\" first learned the technique \"pre\" or \"post\" licensure or did not learn it (Rating scale: \"0\" = Did not learn; \"1\" = Pre -licensure; \"2\" = Post -licensure) The final section of the JA Survey co nsisted of the CH section ( see Appendix B4 ). The same rating scale used for rating the importance of the knowledge elements for the FOM, BIO and ACPL were used for the following three domains: Domain I: Safety and Quality of Chinese Herbs Domain II: Treatment Planning and Strategies Domain III: Patient Management When evaluating the list of Chinese herbal formulas, the importance rating scale was used [0 = Not Us ed; 1 = Not Important; 2 = Low Importance; 3 = Moderately Important, \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 18 and 4 = Extremely Im portant] . Each respondent was asked to: \"Please indicate how important the following formulas are to \"Y our\" practice. If you do not use the formula, select the \"Not Used\" rating.\" When evaluating the list of individual Chinese herbs, the respondents used the frequency rating scale [0 = Never; 1 = Rarely; 2 = Sometimes; and 3 = Often] . Each respondent was asked to: \" Please indicate how often \"You\" apply or prescribe the following individual Chinese herbs alone or in formulas\". Any respondent completing the entire survey with demographics and all KSAs and lists answered a total of 88 6 survey questions . The online surv ey instrument was constructed to have each respondent complete the demographic profile section of the survey first. If a respondent listed the designation of Diplomate of Chinese Herbology or Diplomate of Oriental Medicine, after the completion of the FOM , BIO and ACPL sections of the survey, then they could branch into the Chinese Herbology section of the survey instrument. Also, if they answered that they were practicing in a state that allowed for acupuncturists to practice Chinese herbal medicine they c ould also complete the Chinese herbology section of the survey. Table 2 below provides a summary of the number of demographic questions, number of KSAs (i.e., knowledge elements) included per examination module and identifies the title of any reference lists associated with each exam listed in the appendices above.

All rights reserved. 19 At the end of each JA Survey section the following post survey questions were asked of the respondents: \"What percentage of questions should be allotted per main content area (i.e., Domain) of the _____ exam? \" See Appendices B1, B2, B3 and B 4; and \"How well do you feel the survey covered the topics in the exam? \"; and \"Describe any task or knowledge elements that \"you\" feel were left off the survey?\" Finally , at the end of each e xam section, respondents who were Diplomates could indicate if they wanted to earn Professional Development Activity ( PDA) credits for completing each section of the survey. They had to provide their NCCAOM ID number to be awarded the PDA p oints. Communications and Incentives to Complete the JA Survey: In June 2017 the NCCAOM also reached out to all state association leaders about the upcoming JA Survey. See Appendix C: Announcement to State Associations Regarding the JA Survey for the announcement details. Once the survey launche d on June 30, 2017 numerous email reminders went out to 33,000 licensed acupuncturists and a separate e - blast to 25,000 practitioners from constituent groups to include NCCAOM active Diplomates and other acupuncture practitioners. In July 2017, NCCAOM published an article in Acupuncture Today , written by NCCAOM's CEO and Director of Credentialing and Testing, the title of the article was NCCAOM A Call to Action: Shape the Future o f Certification . It discussed the purpose and components of the upcoming 2017 JA Survey. There were also an announcement in the Summer 2017 NCCAOM Diplomate Newsletter , as we ll as posting announcements on NCCAOM social media sites (Facebook, Linked -In and Twitter) stating the importance for Diplomates to become involved and participate in the JA survey . The NCCAOM continued to incentivize the potential and current survey respondents that there would be i -Pad minis awarded during the survey period. Names were drawn randomly, and a winner was announced on each of the following days in 2017: July 14 , July 28, August 11, August 20; and a $250 cash award was given out on August 2 8th right before the survey closed on October 1 . Note: The survey was scheduled to close on August 27, 2017, however, it was extended to October 1, 2017 to allow for greater participation especially for the CH section . Data Analysis by SMT and NCCAOM Direc tor of Credentialing and Testin g: The data analysis took place during the month of October 2017 and was completed by the early November 2017 . \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

This was out of an estimated population of 33,000 practicing acupuncturists. Demographic Results: The following graphs and tables provide summative descriptive results for all the demographic and clinical questions from the 2017 JA Survey. Although not all the questions on the survey were identical to the demographic and clinical practice questions included in the 2013 JA Survey, changes can be compared to what was reported in the 2013 by referring to the Executiv e Summary of the Descriptive Demographic and Clinical Practice Profile from the 2013 JA Report .

This report is located on the NCCAOM Job Analysis Information Page of www.nccaom.org . Section 5: Data Analysis and Reliability of Ratings Survey Reliability: The internal consistency of the survey ratings was evaluated using the Cronbach Alpha reliability estimate (), which was calculated for each of the four examination modules KSA (knowledge elements) lists , separately. This statistic is bound between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating higher instrument reliability, and coefficients of 0.7 or higher deemed acceptable. The average reliability estimate across all four sections was 0.96, which indicates that the KSAs did an excellent job measuring the same construct, i.e., knowledge base required for competent, entry -level practice as an acupuncturist. Table 20, below, displays the reliability coefficients (coefficient alpha - ) for the KSA \"importance\" ratings in each exam section. The overall ratings of task importance across all knowledge elements for each exam were highly reliable. These results indicate that the responding acupuncturists rated the task and knowledge elements consistently throughout the questionnaire.

All rights reserved. 42 Section 6: Review of the Results by the JA Pane l and C ontent Verification for the 2020 Exam Content Outlines and Reference Lists A second JA Panel meeting was held in San Diego, California, November 4 -5, 2017, to consider and review the results of the survey data analyses. The primary goal of this meeting was to use the survey results to establish exclusion criteria to differentiate between the critical and non -critical KSAs. Among the results presented by the NCCAOM's psychometrician were percent of non -performance , mean importance and calculated criticality for each KSA. Also provided were the results of subgroup analyses of KSA importance based on responses to select demographic categories such as years of experience, geographic location, and practice setting, to ensure that the results held across all respo ndents. Panel members determined the inclusion and exclusion of the knowledge elements based on the survey results and their personal expertise to establish the final weightings for each domain within each of the exam content outlines for the FOM, BIO, ACPL and CH exam blueprints , i.e. content outlines . The 2017 NCCAOM Exam Content Outlines generated from the JA survey, ar e scheduled for use in 2020 . The Panel was also responsible for updating the various reference lists associated with the BIO, ACPL and CH exam section s of the survey based on the respondents' results. As a final exercise, the Panel discussed the scoring and reporting procedures, recommending that the s caled score reporting model be continued, allowing for the reporting of a consistent minimum scaled passing score. The Panel also confirmed the test specifications were appropriate for the examination: 100 items administered during a 2 hour and 30 -minute t esting window, candidates have access to a white board and markers but no other resources. The Panel also reviewed and confirmed that the minimum eligibility and recertification requirements are adequate and appropriate based on the new content outlin es. In summary, the JA Panel members completed the following meeting tasks: 1. Reviewed survey perceived adequacy of the KSAs lists, by respondents. 2. Reviewed all survey results for percent of non-performance ( NP), mean importance and calculated criticality of KSAs results. 3. Reviewed respondents' suggestions for missing tasks and KSAs. 4. Assembled final KSA lists to ensure that all included KSAs were consistent for the following subgroup analyses: a. Entry-level practice, i.e. , within the first 2 years of practice b. Practice setting c. Regions of the country 5. Established domain content weighting (i.e., relative importance) for each exam 6. Confirmed: \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 43 a. Test administration specifications b. Minimum eligibility requirements c. Recertification requirements The JA Panel members also reviewed the NCCA Certification Program Standard 14: The Job Analysis which states: \"A job analysis must be conducted frequently enough to ensure that the content specifications accurately reflect current practice\"; \"A job analysis must be conducted in accordance with sound psychometric practice. If a validation study is not conducted, sufficient justification for relying only on non- quantitative data must be provided;\" \"The job analysis must lead to clearly delineated domains and tasks that characterize profic ient performance.\"; and \"The report of the job analysis must describe methods, results and outcomes of the job analysis study, including supporting documentation for each element and sufficient information to justify the study's findings and conclusions.\" As described earlier in this report, a ll knowledge elements were rated for performed or not performed (NP) and importance using the rating scale of 1 to 4 in Table 1. All respondents were asked to rate the importance of each task elements for all sections. If they did not perform the task, it was rated as a zero ( 0); otherwise, they rated the importance on a scale of 1 to 4 . The criticality of a KSA was computed as follows: criticality=mean importance \u00d7(1- % NP), where percent of resp ondents who selected \"0=Not Performed\". Although there were 3,285 unique individuals who logged into the survey instrument and answered the demographic questions, the \"useable\" response rate for each exam subsection of the survey were as follows: FOM - - 2,554 - 1,274 As a first \"task\" the JA Panel members undertook was to review the perceived survey adequacy results for each exam section. Respondents were asked - \"how well do you feel the survey covered the topics for ________ (FOM, BIO, ACPL and CH)? Table 21, below , provides a summary of the perceived survey KSA list adequacy for each exam section: \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 44 Table 21: Survey Adequacy Perceived by R espondents: FOM, BIO, AC PL and CH Sections Perceived Adequacy FOM (percent of respondents) BIO (percent of respondents) ACPL (percent of respondents) CH (percent of Based on the above results that the respondents and the calculated Cronbach Alpha reliability estimate ( ) - See Table 20 , above, believed that the JA survey sections for each exam were adequately covered. Respondents had an opportunity to provide open - ended comments or suggestions for future surveys which the panel reviewed. The next task the JA P anel members undertook was to review the rating results provided by the respondents for each exam section (listed above). Each knowledge element presented in the appendices below are in sequential order as they appeared on the survey. Results of the calculated mean importance ratings and criticality for each of the exam areas can be found in the following appendices: Appendix D1a: Foundations of Oriental Medicine ( FOM) - Mean Importance Ratings and Criticality Appendix D2a: Biomedicine (BIO) - Mean Importance Ratings and Criticality Appendix D3a: Acupuncture and Point Location (ACPL) - Ratings and Criticality Appendix D4a: Chinese Herbology (CH) - Mean Importance Ratings and Criticality After a rigorous review of all mean importance rating and criticality for each of the exam sections the following cut -off ratings and decisions for KSAs (tasks) inclusions and deletions were determined . Please see Appendices D1b, D2b, D3b and D4 b for the list of KSAs based on ascending criticality order. Items highlighted in rose red were \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. All rights reserved. 45 eliminated by the Panel. Details for each examinations KSAs, and lists are summarized in each exam section below. Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM) Decisions by the JA Panel : A calculated criticality cut -off of 2.0 was determined for the FOM exam; therefore, all KSAs in this exam were included if the criticality was 2.00 or above. As a result of this inclusion determination, the following five (5) of the 78 rated KSAs were deleted from the exam blueprint since they fell below the threshold cut -off: 1. Identify and relate the pat hological significance of the infantile index finger. 2. Observe normal and abnormal manifestations of the infantile index finger. 3. Identify and relate head size and shape to pattern/syndrome differentiation *. 4. Identify and relate facial features to pattern/syn drome differentiation *. 5. Assess other pulses (abdomen, pedal, carotid ). *Please note that a list of pattern s/syn drome s was provided . See Appendix D1b for the list of all FOM KSA s mean importance rating and criticality sorted from lowest criticality to highest. All KSAs shaded in rose red were excluded from the exam blueprint. Biomedicine (BIO) Decisions by the JA Panel: For the BIO section , the lowest calculated criticality was 2.74 which the JA Panel deemed as important to remain on the exam ; therefore , all the 53 KSAs were determined to be important and critical enough to be included in the BIO exam blueprint. See Appendix D2b for all KSAs is ascending criticality order. Additionally, in reviewing the frequency use of pharmaceuticals - antiprotozoal medications, was removed due to low frequency. See Appendix D2c. The JA Panel members also determined that one medical condition - addictions should be added based on the current United States opioid crisis and the need for practitioners to treat this patient population . See Appendix D2 c. Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL) Decisions by the JA Panel: A calculated criticality cut -off rating of 2.55 was determined for the ACPL exam; therefore, all KSAs in this exam were included if the criticality was 2.55 or above. As a result of this inclusion determination, the following ten (10) of the 71 rated KSAs were deleted from the exam blueprint. Eight (8) were removed owning to low criticality , one other fell of f because failure to be able to write a multiple choice question for that particular KSA; and another dropped off the ACPL KSA list because it was discovered that it was also covered in the FOM KSA inclusion list. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

The KSAs that fell below 2.55 are shaded in rose red and were not included in the exam blueprint. The JA Panel members determined that a cut -off level of 30% or higher \"not performed\" rating for the inclusion of the E xtra Points lists for the ACPL exam. As a result of the cut -off percentage established for inclusion (i.e. , less than 30% performance frequency), four \" Extra Points\" were deleted. These were: 1. Qipang 2. Qiuhou 3. Tituo 4. Shixuan This information can also be found in Appendix D3 c. Chinese Herbology (CH) Decisions by the JA Panel: After reviewing the CH exam calculated criticality for the CH KSAs, it was determined that a ll 45 KSAs should be included on the exam blueprint. Additionally , based on mean frequencies determined for the Chinese individual herbs list, and the importance rating for the herbal formulas list, all remained.

All rights reserved. 47 Subgroup Analyses: Once all the KSAs and lists were confirmed based on the overall ratings the JA Panel reviewed and the decisions were made for inclusion and exclusion of KSAs, subgroup analyses of KSAs were performed on each of the demographic variables (Years of Experience, Primary Practice Settings, Regions of the Country) . For the analyses, mean importance ratings were calculated for each subgroup, and then pairwise differences between subgroups were calculated using the Cohen's d effect size measure . Results sh owed that there were no substantial difference s in ratings across subgroups , as Cohen's d values were all less than 0.50; therefore, no changes were made by the JA Panel to the list of KSAs. See Appendices E1, E2, E3, and E4 for the subgroup analyses for each exam . Missing KSAs : Next, the JA Panel reviewed the unedited comments for each section and determined that there were no additional tasks were identified for inclusion. Domain Weightings : Once all the KSAs were determined fo r each exam by the respondents (See Illustrations 10, 11, 12, and 13 for a description for all domains ), for each exam section , the final domain weightings were assigned by the Panel members. See Tables 22, 23 , 24 and 25 showing the mean respondent ratings of the domains compared to the final Panel members weightings. The final Panel weightings were used for the exam blueprints and appear on the 2020 content outlines. First the Panel members looked at the average percent respondent weightings (importance rating) for each exam domain and considered their expert opinion on any adjustments to the weightings. Some ratings were significantly modified by the Panel members who recognized some domain weightings needed to consider the number of KSAs within each section and the criticality weightings within those domains to assign the final weightings. In a few cases some areas were decreased or increased based on their expert subject matter opinion. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

All rights reserved. 52 Section 7: Final Content Outlines and Other Considerations for Testing Once the final domain weightings were completed for all the exam sections the derived updated NCCAOM Content Outlines were created. See Appendices F1: FOM Exam Content Outline, Appendix F2: BIO Exam F3: ACPL Exam Outline, and Appendix F4: CH Exam Content Outline . A copy of all four of the Examination Content Outlines was published initially on the NCCAOM w ebsite in June of 2018. These blueprints/content outlines will take effect beginning January 1, 2020. The final set of tasks for the Panel was to review and confirm the test administration specifications, minimum eligibility requirements to sit for the examinations and review of the recertification requirements. The Panel discussed the scoring and reporting procedures, recommending that the scaled score reporting model be continued, allowing for the reporting of a consistent minimum scaled passing score. The Panel also confirmed the test specifications were appropriate for the examination: 100 items administered during a 2-hour and 30 -minute testing window, candidates have access to a white board and markers but no other resources. The Panel reviewed and confirmed that the minimum eligibility and recertification requirements were sufficient and appropriate based on the new content outlines. The Panel members acknowledged that the Apprenticeship Only Route of Eligibility would be ending December 31, 2020. A fter 20 21, no new apprenticeship applicants for certification can sit for the Acupuncture Certification or the Chinese Herbology Certification. The decision by the NCCAOM Board of Commissioners, to terminate the Apprentice Only Eligibility Route (Route 3) to certification was first announced in 2016, so that potential applicants could have adequate notice. The new exam content outlines for the FOM, BIO, ACPL and CH were given to the respective Exam Development Committees (EDCs) so that a cross -walk of the c ontent changes could be identified and the EDCs could determine those exam items in the item bank that needed to be added, deleted or moved to another exam or new section of the examination within the new content outline. This process is called the \"item b ank remapping\" activity. Once the updated exams are written and the linear exams are administered, a Standard Setting Panel will determine the minimum passing score for each certification exam. This activity will take place in early 2020, by separate NCCAO M Standard Setting Panel for each certification exam. \u00a9 2019 by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

This Core will provide the framework for updating the NCCAOM certifying examinations to ensure they reflect current practice. As you can imagine, it is critical to the profession and public protection to cr eate certification examinations that are relevant and accurately represent the knowledge, skills, and abilities that AOM practitioners must possess to perform competently and safely . Earlier this year, a diverse group of licensed Acupuncturists, represent ing various educational and experience backgrounds, developed an exhaustive list of the Core knowledge required of competent AOM practice. This list was converted into an online survey which will launch in July. All licensed Acupuncturists are encouraged to respond, and your participation is vital to help ensure that the results reflect the diversity of AOM practice. In addition to providing a framework for the certification examinations, the survey results will also allow the NCCAOM to develop a profile of licensed Acupuncturists, how they practice, and the environments in which they practice. Without the JA survey, achievements such as the recognition of Acupuncturists by the Bureau of Labor Statistics would not be possible. We need your input! Watch for the survey invitation, which will be distributed via email on June 30, 2017!
