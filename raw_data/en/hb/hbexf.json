Harvey Davis, M.D.,hs'69 Virginia Beach, Va. Primary care is vanishing as a practice model Regarding \"Taking the e-road \" [Yale Medicine , Autumn 2007], I'd like to tell the academics whodecry the decline in the numberof primary care physicians why I left primary care in 1968. It hadnothing to do with lifestyle oreconomics. I didn't leave primarycare, primary care left me. The whole practice model was disappearing. I lay awakenights wondering what to doand told my patients that if theycould scare up 1,500 familieswho would let me deliver theirbabies, treat their fractures, takecare of their kids, etc., then Iwould stay. This was a feelingshared by many of my contem-poraries. But the climate wasrapidly changing and the aca-demics were clueless as to thereasons. Family practice disap-peared, never to return. Thechange wasn't just within themedical community but inAmerican society as a whole. Asan example, house calls didn'tdisappear because physicianswouldn't make them butbecause people stopped askingfor them. yalemedicine Alumni Bulletin of the Yale University School of Medicine Winter 2008, Volume 42, No. 2 Editor in Chief Michael Kashgarian, m.d.

The medical schoolhospitals I am familiar with(Yale, where I went to medicalschool, and Dartmouth, in thearea where I now live) have sim-ply never had that model. And I don't know that they can. Following my wife's surgery, a serious post-op problem washandled without talking to herfamily. Consults were gotten,care discussed and treatmentordered without talking to the patient's spouse or familydoctor until, after four days, indesperation, the husband (me,an m.d .) insisted the primary care m.d . be called. With his background knowledge the pri-mary care m.d . corrected the problem immediately. When Iprotested the lack of communi-cation I discovered that the pri-mary care m.d . had no privileges even though he is part of theDartmouth-Hitchcock MedicalCenter system. I have yet to betalked to by anyone but theintern\u2014even three years later!Today's medical student neversees the kind of practice thatwas once so common in com-munity hospitals. He or she hasno role model, a fact that is sadbut true. The current primarycare model bears no resem-blance to what I knew and themodern version is no replacement. Robert P . Gerety, M.D. '52 White River Junction, Vt. 3 Lessons from Uganda When I returned from Uganda in July, people who asked about my reporting trip to Mulago Hospital assumed thatthe Yale attendings and residents had gone there to teach. Itwould seem to make sense that professionals coming fromone of the leading universities in the richest country in the world and with access to the latest medical technologieswould have much to teach the doctors and medical students at a hospital in one of the world's poorest countries. In fact,the reverse was often true. In the middle of one Yale doctor'srst day on the wards at Mulago, he lamented how ineffectu-al he felt. Said Sam Luboga, m.d., deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Makerere University in Kampala, \"When people come here they can really feel bewildered. They nd a hospital full of patients, without drugs, without supplies.\" At Mulago the Yale doctors became the students, with a lot to learn from their Ugandan colleagues. Denied all theaccoutrements of modern medicine that are part of theirdaily lives, the Yale physicians fell back on the most basictool of medicine\u2014the physical exam\u2014at which the Ugandandoctors excel. This is not to say that the Yale doctors hadnothing to offer. While at Kampala, the Yale attendings andresidents taught evidence-based medicine and provided newstarting point SECOND OPINION BY SIDNEY HARRISmodels for interactions with patients. The collaboration has also brought to Uganda textbooks and access to electronicmedical texts. Both Makerere University and Yale Universitystand to benet from the collaboration, which is expected toimprove clinical care in New Haven as well as in Uganda. In this issue we also feature profiles of two doctors who specialize in the heart. John A. Elefteriades, m.d. '76, hs'83, chief of cardiothoracic surgery, learned the basics of cardiology from Lawrence S. Cohen, m.d., hs'65. The two started as student and mentor, became colleagues and arenow co-authors of a book about the heart, Your Heart: An Owner's Guide . On November 30 we learned of the passing of Nicholas P.R. Spinelli, m.d. '44, a warm, kind and generous man and a good friend to all of us at Yale Medicine . When we were next door to the Office of Alumni Affairs, he often tookthe time to chat with us and ask us what stories we wereworking on or to suggest ideas for articles. And he alwayshad something nice to say about our latest issue. We willmiss him. John Curtis Managing Editor 4 chronicle news from cedar streetyale medicine win ter 2008Biotech spinoffs fuel New Haven economy 2007 was a banner year for startup companies based on discoveries inYale labs. \"Restaurants. Good restaurants.\" The surge in upscale eateries opening inNew Haven, said Jon Soderstrom, ph.d ., managing director of the Ofce of Cooperative Research ( ocr), is one way of gauging Yale's efforts to buildup the local biotechnology industry.When a decade ago Yale made its com-mitment to create new business ven-tures based on laboratory discoveries,city gourmets could point to fewerthan a handful of top-flight restau-rants. Today diners have more than ascore to choose from, and Yale's headof technology transfer thinks much of the credit belongs to biotech. \"Biotechnology has made a substan- tial difference in the economic climate of the city,\" said Soderstrom. Investmentin new and existing Yale ventures reached its highest level yet during the2007 scal year that ended on June 30. According to ocr's year-end report, outside investors provided close to $70million in scal 2007 to launch sevencompanies based on Yale discoveries.Bioscience companies already in theregion secured around $400 million innew cash for operations. That's on topof more than $1.5 billion in private bio-technology investment to date, a por-tion of it going to the 25 new companiesestablished by the ocr. Among the newly launched com- panies was BioRelix, which will developantibiotics based on discoveries aboutbacterial rna targets made in the labo- ratory of Ronald R. Breaker, ph.d ., the Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular,Cellular and Developmental Biologyand professor of molecular biophysicsand biochemistry. The nearly $26 million frominvestors. Existing company AchillionPharmaceuticals received $52 million from its initial public offering, part of which will fund development of anantiretroviral therapeutic based on workdone by Yung-Chi \"Tommy\" Cheng, ph.d ., the Henry Bronson Professor of Pharmacology. Achillion is one of numerous young companies based in 300 George Street,a former telephone company ofcebuilding now converted to laboratoryspace. The building's nine floors arenearly full, and private developers areplanning to construct a new buildingnearby for biotechnology companies. Venture capital rm chl Medical Partners has already invested morethan $25 million in eight Yale spinoffcompanies. chl partner Jeff Collinson, a 1963 Yale College graduate, recallsthat before ocr began its push few laboratory facilities existed for fledg-ling companies and his rm had tolook outside the region for experiencedexecutives and skilled labor. Now, hesaid, \"biotechs have good laboratoryfacilities ready to move to New Havenand there's a pretty good labor pool to recruit from, so it's much easier toget a company started.\" Said Paul R. Pescatello, j.d.,ph.d ., president and ceo of cure , an organization supporting bioscience in Connecticut: \"I travel to meetingsaround the world. My sense is thatqualitatively Yale is regarded as highlyas any academic medical center in the world\" for developing biotechnol-ogy enterprises. But quantitatively theregion lags, he said, behind Cambridge,South San Francisco, San Diego andother areas with more prominent bio-technology sectors. Those areas, hesaid, have \"other engines\" to generatenew ventures, while New Haven reliesalmost solely on Yale. Soderstrom agreed: \"New Haven is an emerging phenomenon. We're a work in progress. But 10 years ago itwas hard to get venture capitalists to come to New Haven. Today they'rehere all the time.\" And new restau-rants keep opening. \u2014 Marc Wortman 5 Eyeing \"broader impacts,\" Yale bolsters efforts to bringscience to local schools High school students in New Haven and neighboring communities are reap-ing benets from a federal effort toencourage them to study science andengineering. Because fewer collegeundergraduates and graduate studentsare pursuing careers in the sciencesthan in the past, national organizationsare asking researchers to help recruitthe next generation of scientists.According to Kathie L. Olsen, ph.d ., deputy director and chief operating ofcer at the National Science Founda-tion ( nsf), the percentage of students remaining in science and engineeringafter obtaining a master's degreedropped from 23 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 2003. The nsfbelieves that if science were brought into the classroom and pre-sented by scientists in a compelling way,more students might choose careers inscience. nasa and other major funding sources, including the National Insti-tutes of Health, have followed the foun-dation 's lead. As a result, since 2002 the nsf has required scientists to include a community outreach plan or a \"broader-impact\" component in their grant applications. Yale faculty, staff and students were already running science outreach pro-grams that brought more than 10,000New Haven young people into free Yale-sponsored programs each year. The nsf broader-impact requirement meant that hundreds more researchers would begetting involved in science outreach. Claudia R. Merson, the public school partnerships director in Yale's Ofce ofNew Haven and State Affairs, said reac-tion to the nsfinitiative was immediate. \"Suddenly, researchers were approach-ing us saying, 'I want to do some out-reach. What can I do?' \" Yale respondedby convening a science outreach advi-sory committee that recommendedappointing a coordinator for communityprograms. Joanna Price, ph.d ., whose degree is in molecular biology and biotechnology,took on the job earlier this year. Her goalis to support and expand the many sci-ence education programs being offered.She will help faculty members interestedin science outreach identify potentialpartners within the university as well asin the community; facilitate information and resource-sharing among the univer-sity's science outreach programs; andserve as a liaison to area schools. A newwebsite, www.yale.edu/scienceoutreach,lists all of Yale's science programs avail-able for the public. So far Price has helped with four grant applications and launched a number of initiatives, including a seriesof talks at Hill Regional Career HighSchool. She's also working on a $1 million project to enhance scienceeducation in public schools, a programundertaken as part of the university'spurchase of the Bayer facility in neigh-boring Orange and West Haven. Price's position is funded by the provost's ofce, the Howard HughesMedical Institute and the nih and has the support of existing Yale scienceoutreach programs and from the YaleUniversity Peabody Museum ofNatural History. Now that Yale has a conduit between researchers and K-12 educators, Mersonis condent that up-to-date informationon a full range science-related topicswill reach and excite the scientists oftomorrow. \"We have always had amaz-ing people here doing world-classresearch,\" she said. \"Now we have anorganized way to share that with thecommunity.\" \u2014 Jennifer Kaylin YALE SCIENTIST TAPPED TO LEAD WELLESLEY COLLEGE H. Kim Bottomly, ph.d. , a renowned immunobiologist and a deputy provost at Yale, became the 13th president of Wellesley College in Massachusetts in 2007. As deputy provost, Bottomly led an initia-tive to add women and minorities to the Yale faculty. As a scien-tist she focused on factors that influence the initiation of immuneresponses. She has served as a member of the ImmunobiologyStudy Section of the National Institutes of Health and wasappointed to the Advisory Council of the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases. michae l m arslan d6 chronicle New building on Amistad Street: a place \"where greatscience is done\" Taking a page from theoretical physics, scientists at the School of Medicine'snewest building will shorten the dis-tance between two places\u2014the benchand the bedside. \"This is the future,\"declared President Richard C.

The 120,000-square-foot building at 10 Amistad Street will house threeprograms\u2014the InterdepartmentalProgram in Vascular Biology andTherapeutics, the Human and Trans-lational Immunology Program and the Yale Stem Cell Center. These pro-grams, each of which draws on faculty throughout the university, wereidentied as crucial to the medicalschool's strategic plan, said Robert J. Alpern, m.d., dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine. A lack of labspace, for example, had limited growthin vascular biology. The stem cell center needed facilities after HaifanLin, ph.d ., a leading researcher, wasrecruited to initiate the program with the help of a $7.8 million grant from the state of Connecticut. And,Alpern said, the new facilities will\"capitalize on our incredible strengthin immunology.\" The $88.6 million structure is the latest to be built under a $1 billionplan to expand science facilities at Yale.The dedication came just as the uni-versity acquired 550,000 square feet oflaboratory space at the Bayer HealthCareCompany's former headquarters inWest Haven. With workstations for more than 250 scientists, the building on AmistadStreet offers sophisticated microscopyand technology for cell sorting and isenvironmentally sustainable. Designedby Herbert S. Newman and Partners, a New Haven-based rm, with labspaces planned by EllenzwiegAssociates of Cambridge, Mass., thebuilding features lights that turn off automatically, rainwater collectionand other green features.

These studies could lead tonew ways to combat the cravings of addic-tion and improve control over excessivesmoking, drinking and eating. \"Stress is the kind of topic that really begs for being studied in an interdisciplinaryway, because it affects every organ system in some way or another,\" said Rajita Sinha, ph.d ., professor of psychiatry and leader of a research consortium that will include psychia-trists, neuroscientists, social psychologistsand communications and policy experts. They will analyze the ways in which events early in life shape a person's ability tohandle stress; use neuroimaging to illumi-nate changes in the brain under stress; andexplore the effects of pharmacologicalagents on stress and on lapses in self-controlover such addictive behaviors as smoking,drinking alcohol and overeating.

Mor, m.d., associ- ate professor of obstetrics, gynecologyand reproductive sciences, was thinkingof ways to get local high school studentsinterested not just in science but also in studying science at Yale. \"Kids in the area would never apply here,\" he said. \"They always think Yaleis something belonging to a completelydifferent world. And then there's adecrease in the number of these youngkids going into science and medicine.\" So Mor initiated the Discovery to Cure program, which brought six highschool juniors into Yale research labsthat summer. The same year, Mor alsoasked teachers at the participating highschools how many of their studentsplanned on applying to Yale. The answerwas zero. But last year four students inthe program applied to Yale, and two arenow attending. Other program gradu-ates went on to study science and medi-cine at such schools as Harvard, Cornelland the University of Chicago. Somehave returned to Yale for summerresearch as undergraduates. Last sum-mer, the fourth year of the program, 20students spent six weeks in Yale labs. The new program joins other Yale initiatives to bring high school studentsinto research labs. For several years students at New Haven 's Hill RegionalCareer High School have lived on campus in a summer program duringwhich they participate in small-groupproblem-based learning. And theAnatomy Teaching Program has broughtCareer students to the anatomy lab for sessions led by medical students. \"We were a little afraid of bringing teenagers into the lab,\" Mor said. \"Theymight break things, damage things. But the opposite happened. They con-tributed to the lab. The work that theydid was outstanding.\" Kaitlin Markoja from Cheshire High School studied the connection betweenthe immune system and pregnancy inMor's lab. \"People who are pregnant don 't respond to viruses in the sameway as other people, and we're trying tounderstand this,\" she explained. Markoja's summer research cemented her plans to pursue a careerin science or medicine. \"It was such ahands-on experience,\" she said. Irene Visintin, a research associate who coordinates the program with Mor,said complete immersion is what makesthis opportunity so remarkable. \"Wedon 't want them in there washing dishes.That's not the goal,\" she said. Not onlydo the students contribute to research,but they also remind some of the moresenior researchers why science is fun.\"They ask a million and one questionsand run around smiling,\" Visintin said. Kelsey Hogan, a budding neurosci- entist from Mercy High School, aparochial school in Middletown, Conn.,worked in the lab of Tamas L. Horvath, d.v.m. ,ph.d ., professor of comparative medicine, of neurobiology and of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductivesciences. She studied the effects ofmaternal obesity on mice offspring,spending most of her days dissectingbrains to look for dye that indicated the activity of cells that control appetite. This gory and repetitive work could turn some people away from science.But Kelsey loved it. \"This was the bestsummer vacation I've ever had,\" shesaid, grinning. \u2014 Sarah C.P.

Horizontal scars across their throats, although now fading, remind mem-bers of the Block family of what theyhave been through in the past year.Last summer, doctors at Yale foundthat this family of cattle farmers fromMonroe, Conn., has been passingmore than hair and eye color betweengenerations; the family's 10th chromo-some harbors a mutation that causes arare and severe form of thyroid cancer. Since this discovery, 13 members of the extended family have been diag-nosed with the mutation and 10 havehad their thyroids removed. Five of thesurgeries took ynhh ) under the supervi- sion of Julie Ann Sosa, m.d., assistant professor of surgery. Sosa, who specializes in thyroid cancer, said that the mutation that theBlocks carry, called men 2a, is extremely rare and that most families in thiscountry with the condition have beenknown to researchers for years. Sosaherself follows ve such families.\"Many endocrinologists go their wholelives without seeing any cases of thismutation,\" she said. But last June, Beverly Block Lewis, 51, learned that she had medullary thyroid cancer. In a very few instancesthis rare cancer is inherited. \"Thegenetic study we ran came back posi-tive,\" said Sosa. Beverly already had hypothyroidism, a deciency of thyroid hormone, which she inherited from her mother's side of the family. The condition was thereason for her routine endocrinologyappointments. The family assumed the thyroid cancer would also comefrom the maternal side. But testing showed that Beverly inherited her mutation from her father,Burton Block, who was then found tohave asymptomatic thyroid cancer. Twoof Beverly's siblings, her son and twonephews were also diagnosed with themutation. All but 4-year-old nephewJake already had cancer. \"Every diagnosis was a new blow,\" said Alyce Block, Beverly's mother.\"Every time was as hard as the rst.\" For Beverly's recently married son, Aaron Lewis, 28, one of the biggestchallenges was thinking about futuregenerations. \"Kids that aren 't even bornyet are going to be affected,\" he said. Over the next several months, ynhh became like a second home for the family members, who were con-stantly in and out of the hospital witheach successive surgery. But every operation went well and the family pulled through. After histhyroid surgery, 83-year-old Burton also survived a near-fatal car accidentthat landed him back at ynhh , just doors away from where his son Danwas recovering from a pulmonaryembolism following thyroid surgery. In August, more than a year after the family's medical saga began,Burton passed away due to inoperablepancreatic cancer unrelated to the thyroid cancer. \"He's really taught usa tremendous amount about strengthand patience,\" said Beverly, standingat Burton 's bedside a month beforehis death. \" And the importance of aclose-knit family bonding together,\"added Alyce. \u2014 Sarah C.P.

In a survey of 277 inter- nal medicine residents in 11 programs, resi-dents scored an average of 41 percent. Seniorresidents performed worse than junior resi-dents, suggesting that, with the passage oftime, knowledge was lost or not reinforced. \"Most residents in this study lack the knowledge in biostatistics needed to interpretmany of the results in published clinicalresearch,\" said corresponding author DonnaM. Windish, m.d. ,m.p.h ., assistant professor of medicine. \"Residency programs shouldinclude more effective biostatistics training intheir curricula to successfully prepare resi-dents for this important lifelong learning skill. \u2014 J.C.Blood vessels made from scaffolds and stem cells soon to be in clinical trials Two Yale physician-scientists are creat- ing a living organ from scratch, coax-ing cells to form articial tissue thatcan be used to repair or replace faultyblood vessels. Christopher K. Breuer, m.d., assistant professor of surgery and pediatrics, and Toshiharu Shinoka , m.d.,ph.d. , associate professor and director of pediatric cardiovascular sur-gery at Yale-New Haven Children 'sHospital, believe their tissue engineer-ing project could lead to the buildingof more complex organs. \"We gure if you start with blood vessels, that's going to be the rst stepin making just about anything,\" saidBreuer. \"Plus, there's an immediateneed for vessels in vascular cardio-vascular surgery.\" Because the blood vessels Breuer and Shinoka have created rely on stem cells from a patient's own bonemarrow, they are not prone to theinflammation or rejection that affectstransplanted tissue. And they are livingorgans that can grow as a child grows. When a child is born with such defects as a heart with only a singleventricle, doctors rst try to form thechild's own tissue into new vessels thatcan be used as grafts. \"But the problemis these children usually require multi-ple grafts and you never have enoughtissue,\" said Breuer. Such alternativesas synthetic Gore-Tex grafts may leadto and blood clotting, whilebiological grafts from animals tend tocalcify and need replacement. Breuer and his colleagues designed a scaffold in the shape of a vein withmaterials used to make absorbable sutures. They then coat the scaffoldwith bone marrow stem cells. As bloodflows through the vein, the stem cellsattract cells from elsewhere in the body to form a blood vessel around the scaffolding. As the vessel forms theoriginal matrix dissolves. The resultingvessel can grow over time, and its elasticity matches that of the body'sown blood vessels. Over the past six years, Shinoka has used the process successfully in 47 children in Japan. The techniqueworks well and the grafts have anexcellent safety prole, he said, and replacement oftube grafts. Shinoka and Breuer expectto hear soon about their application tothe U.S. Food and Drug Administrationto conduct clinical trials of their graftsat Yale, but they also continue to pur-sue improvements in their techniques. Breuer said that his next goal is to gure out which chemical in bonemarrow is attracting cells to the scaf-folding. He hopes to isolate that compound and build it into the matrixto eliminate the intermediate step of drawing bone marrow from eachpatient. \"We would have immediateoff-the-shelf availability when a patientneeded a graft,\" he said. \u2014 S.C.P.W. Institutes of Health ( nih) involving 35 groups of researchers at 80 institu-tions in 11 nations. Researchers havespent the last four years sifting throughmore than 400 million data points to make sense of just 1 percent of thehuman genome. Their analysis hasturned up some surprises. For one thing, the genome hosts a lot more activity than expected. Theconventional wisdom has long heldthat the important pieces of dna\u2014the readily decipherable genes making up1.5 percent of the genome\u2014are con-verted into rna via a process called transcription. rna in turn instructs the cell to make proteins. Scientists havelong assumed that in general each geneis transcribed into one rna fragment and that the remaining gene-free por-tions of our dna aren 't transcribed at all. Not so, according to the encode project. Most letters in the genomic instruction manual wind up being tran-scribed.

Doing so may prove crucial for under-standing complex human diseases . \"We're trying to map out what's there,\" said Michael Snyder, ph.d. , professor of molecular, cellular anddevelopmental biology. Snyder's lab is part of the Encyclo- pedia of dna Elements ( encode ) project, ofthe ResearchInstitute ( nhgri ) at the Nationalto produce some extraordinarily long rna fragments. A single gene can be transcribed into many different rna fragments of varying lengths. The pur- pose of all these extra transcriptsremains unclear. Even more perplexing is the preva- lence of rna molecules transcribed entirely from gene-free portions of thegenome. npc rna transcripts were previously known to exist, but the encode project identied many new ones. Again, their purpose is unknown. Snyder is even more excited that the project has identied new regulatoryregions that do not encode proteins butinstead control when, where and towhat extent genes are expressed. Recentstudies have linked complex diseaseswith variations in npc regions of the human genome that could have regula-tory functions. Might variations in npc dna promote disease by interfering with the expression of genes at distal sites? Snyder and his collaborators hope that the project will answer such ques-tions. \"This is really what the encode project is all about,\" he said. \u2014Robin Orwant podcast A podcast of Michael Snyder speaking on this subject can be found on the Yale page on iTunes U.Visit itunes.yale.edu or launch iTunes, then selectYale from the offerings under iTunes U.

Prusoff Professor and chair of pharmacology,has solved the atomic-level structuresfor active and inactive forms of a proteinsegment implicated in several types ofcancer, opening up a new set of molecu-lar targets for cancer therapies. The results, reported in the July 27 issue of Cell, highlighted previously unidentied changes in the protein 'sstructure that seem to be crucial forits activation. \"It gives us totally newavenues for developing drugs for alarge group of target proteins that areresponsible for several cancers,\"Schlessinger said. The study focused on one of 59 receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks), a set of related proteins whose activitieshave long been linked with cancer.Normally, rtks become active only under particular circumstances inorder to help cells proliferate, differ-entiate and survive. But certain muta-tions in rtks can turn on the proteins inappropriately, causing aberrant cell proliferation that may lead to can-cer. Blocking the activities of rtks has become a major strategy in anti-cancer drug design. Two recently developed and highly successful cancer-ghting drugs,Gleevec and Sutent, work in this way.Gleevec is effective against some stom-ach cancers and leukemias; Sutentworks against stomach and some kid-ney cancers. But Schlessinger, whohelped discover Sutent, said many cancers don 't respond to Gleevec orSutent and those that do develop resist- ance to the drugs. Schlessinger's laboratory has spent the last 10 years assembling an atomic-level view of the extracellular domainof an rtk called Kit. By comparing the structure of the protein segment(representing Kit in its inactive state)with that of the active form, hisresearch group has identified changesin Kit that are important in under-standing its activation. The results suggest that in their active state Kit molecules change theirshape such that certain portions of theextracellular domain in one Kit mol-ecule move close enough to interactwith their counterparts on the other Kitmolecule. Schlessinger and colleagueshave also provided evidence that thesepreviously unidentied interactions arerequired for Kit activation, and muta-tions predicted to strengthen the inter-actions are known to contribute tovarious forms of cancer. Since Kit is part of a family of rtks with similar extracellular domains, thetargets represented by this study prob-ably exist in more than a half-dozenother rtks that have been implicated in various cancers. \"It's a mechanismthat is likely to be universal to quite a few of these rtks,\" Schlessinger said. Drugs aimed at these new targets might be effective against Gleevec- andSutent-resistant cancers, offering hopeto many cancer patients who are tryingto stay one step ahead of the enemy. \u2014 R.O.NANOTUBES CAN KILL BACTERIA A study to measure the toxic effects of nano- tubes on human cells has led to a possiblenew approach to treating antibiotic-resistantinfections. In a paper published in the August 28 issue of the American Chemical Society jour-nal Langmuir , Yale researchers said that single-walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnt s) can kill such bacteria as E. coli . \"We began the study out of concern for the possible toxicity of nanotubes in aquaticenvironments and their presence in the foodchain,\" said Menachem Elimelech, ph.d ., the and chairof chemical engineering. \"While nanotubeshave great promise for medical and commer-cial applications, there is little understand-ing of how they interact with humans andthe environment.\" Elimelech speculates that the long, thin nanotubes puncture the cells and cause cel-lular damage. \"We are looking at the effectsof swcnt s on a wide range of bacterial strains to better understand the mechanismof cellular damage,\" Elimelech said. \u2014 John Curtis TO BEAT CANCER, EAT YOUR VEGGIES! Kids aren't the only people who should pile more vegetables on their dinner plate.A study published in the August 1 issue of jnci : Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that men who regularly eat broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts andturnips are 40 percent less likely to developadvanced prostate cancer than those whoconsume few of these veggies. \"All these vegetables have compounds called glucosinolates that have been shownto protect cells from dna damage in the lab, and thus may be anticarcinogenic,\" saidlead author Victoria Kirsh, ph.d. , a former doctoral student of Susan T. Mayne, ph.d. , professor of epidemiology. Kirsh is now atCancer Care Ontario. To make sure that men who consume more vegetables aren't just more likely toget prostate screening tests than others,Kirsh used data that identified 1,338 mendiagnosed with prostate cancer out of 29,361 who were screened. \u2014 Sarah C.P .

The night in June 1969 that gay men fought police raid- ing the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village marked the beginning of wider acceptance of male homosexuals.Homosexuality has not been considered pathological by mainstream psychiatry since the 1970s, and in the yearsthat followed gay couples have begun to acknowledge their partnerships publicly. \"There's much more social acceptance than there was 20 or 30 years ago,\" said psychiatrist and psychoanalystRichard A. Isay, m.d. ,hs'65. Many gay men are still suffering, however, said Isay. The main, though not the only, source of their distress, he thinks, lies in the ways their parents treated them aschildren. He believes that the social acceptance of homo-sexuality \"has not filtered down to the way homosexualboys are raised.\" Fathers tend to criticize or shun sonswho dislike rough sports, play with dolls or otherwise pre-fer stereotypically feminine pursuits. Mothers who enjoythe sensitivity and shared interests of gay sons may leantoo much on them, using them to fulfill their unmet emo-tional needs. Isay believes that these dynamics can prevent adult gay men from forming long-term romantic bonds. \"Boys maygrow up mistrusting the love of another person and will ndmany other ways of nding the self-esteem enhancementthat they missed in childhood,\" said Isay. Many gay menseek afrmation not through an enduring, loving relation-ship, he said, but in cultivating large networks of friends,pursuing transient sexual liaisons, focusing on professionalsuccess and creating flawlessly appointed environments for themselves. In his new book, Commitment and Healing: Gay Men and the Need for Romantic Love , Isay describes how therapy can help provide gay men with insight into the effects of child-hood influences on the capacity to commit to a partner. In a book accessible to nontherapists and illustrated with casestudies, Isay shows how gay men can recover from child- hood wounds and learn to sustain committed monogamouspartnerships. A clinical professor at Weill Medical College ofCornell University and a faculty member at the ColumbiaUniversity Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research,Isay draws upon his experience as a Manhattan psychothera-pist with mostly gay clients. Isay published his rst book, Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their Development , in 1989, at a time when he was coming out. He was the rst openly gay member of theAmerican Psychoanalytic Association. His 1996 book, Becoming Gay , outlines the ways in which gay teenagers and adults develop self-acceptance. Isay said that his new book has stirred up some contro- versy because he argues that gay couples who tolerate sexualadventures outside the partnership may do so out of anunconscious fear of closeness rather than a sense of libera-tion from traditional heterosexual strictures. \"It runs counterto the prevailing doctrines of the gay community that main-tain that our relationships are ne, more democratic andbetter than heterosexual relationships,\" said Isay. He hopes that his new book will help gay men to exam- ine the patterns of their romantic relationships and perhapsseek the guidance of a therapist attuned to gay issues. He'd like parents to pay attention to the way they treat theirsons. Ideally, he said, even when a son doesn 't act like a typical boy, \"if both father and mother love him as they dotheir other children, if they value what he has to say about his attractions to others, then they can inculcate the value of love and can greatly influence how he forms loving relationships as an adult.\" \u2014 Cathy Shufro Richard Isay hopes that his new book, Commitment and Healing: Gay Men and the Needfor Romantic Love , will lead gay men to examine how theirupbringing affects their adultromantic relationships.gordon harre llLewis' Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: A ed. by Andr\u00e9s S.

Mongan, who delivered the 11th annual Samuel O. ThierLecture in Health Policy, said thatthe landscape of health carefinance has shifted from onedominated by governmentprograms to a regulatory/free-market hybrid that includesMedicare, Medicaid and man-aged care. Attempts to broadencoverage through employermandates have failed because of a \"tenacious desire for autono-my\" in the private sector\u2014businesses have exploited \"ournational ambivalence aboutheavy-handed government regu-lations\" and taxation. Meanwhile, 45 million unin- sured Americans get emergencyroom treatment when they aresick instead of preventive care.Ignoring the cost of this ten-dency is dangerous, Monganwarned. While Massachusettshas a \"promising\" if flawed sys-tem to insure its residents, pro-viding health care for all citizens\"will demand some nationalaction,\" Mongan said, though he wasn't optimistic that suchaction could be taken in the heatof a presidential campaign. \"Wecurrently stand as a nation with-out a good answer.\" \u2014 J.D.ROBERT FINE A third party to speak for the terminally ill Doctors and nurses in cases involving medically futile treat-ment often clash with a patient'sloved ones over whether to con-tinue that treatment. An extra-judicial process, however, allowsboth sides to appeal to a com-mittee of physicians, nurses,community representatives andother caregivers, a medical ethi-cist told an audience at pedi-atric grand rounds in September. The Texas Advanced Direc- tives Act of 1999, the first state-wide attempt to resolve suchdisputes, has created \"a legalsafe harbor,\" said Robert L. Fine, m.d ., director of the Office of Clinical Ethics at Baylor HealthCare System. When a case isdeemed futile, it may go beforethe ethics committee, whichdoes not always agree with themedical team. If the committeeagrees with the medical team,treatment may be withdrawnunless an alternative health careprovider is found within 10 days. Most cases are settled within the 10-day process. \"In manycases the family is relieved,\"said Fine, who helped write the Texas law. \" They didn't let go. It lifted the burden.\" Doctors arerelieved, too. \"Sometimes thehighest level of care with-draw medically inappropriatetreatment.\" \u2014 John DillonGERALD FRIEDLAND TB, an Atlanta lawyer and 52 South African patients At first glance a diagnosis of tuberculosis seems to be all thatunites Andrew Speaker, anAtlanta lawyer, with 52 impover-ished South Africans who diedof drug-resistant TB in a remoterural area in 2005.

Speaker made headlines last spring after being diagnosedwith extensively drug-resistanttuberculosis ( xdr -TB) and then putting fellow airline passen-gers at risk by traveling on sevenseparate commercial flights.He later received treatment at atop-rated TB hospital. Most ofthe rural South Africans, on theother hand, had all died by thetime laboratory testing revealedthe diagnosis of xdr-TB, said Friedland, who reported thecases in The Lancet in 2006. Friedland said both Speaker and the South Africans sufferedfrom the slowness of TB diagnos-tic tests and limited treatmentoptions for drug-resistant TB.Friedland says presence ofgrowing numbers of cases with xdr -TB underlines the long- standing neglect of TB and themore recent rise of TB and hiv coinfection. \"If there's a silver lining,\" he said, \"it's that theworld attention focused on bothof these cases has been a wake-up call for the need for resourcesto promote scientific advancesand improved care for TB.\" \u2014 Cathy ShufroANDREW VON ESCHENBACH Speeding the pace of biomarker discovery Biomarkers that identify cancer in its early and more treatablestages have emerged as thenewest tools in its prevention,diagnosis and treatment.

Burge, as the rst preserva- tion librarian for the Cushing/WhitneyLibrary in 2005, has begun a full preser-vation program for the collection. Shedevotes her time to the historic materi-als, which attract scholars from all|over the world. Many of the rare bookscame from the collections of surgeonHarvey W. Cushing, m.d., physiologist John F. Fulton, m.d., and tuberculosis specialist Arnold C. Klebs, m.d.\u2014all bibliophiles\u2014whose donations formedthe backbone of the historical libraryfounded in 1941. \"They had a realappreciation of the book as an objectand the book as content,\" said Burge. Some of Burge's challenges are technical. For instance, because thehealth of the books depends on theright environmental conditions, Burgeis working with the medical school'sheating and ventilation experts. Theirdream: air temperature at 65 degreesFahrenheit, humidity at 40 percent, no fluctuations. Other challenges aremore abstract: Burge has helped draft policies to allow students andscholars to use the collection while protecting it from damage or the kindof theft that occurred at Yale's BeineckeRare Book and Manuscript Library in 2005, when dealer E. Forbes SmileyIII stole several rare maps from thecollection. Paradoxically, many of Burge's chal- lenges result from the rise of literacyin the 1830s, when advances in paper-making put books in the hands of ordinary people. New steam-poweredmachines and a scarcity of linen trans-formed the paper industry. For the rsttime, paper was made primarily fromwood pulp rather than cotton or linenbers. And wood-pulp paper doesn 'tlast; it becomes brittle as a result ofacid decay through a process known as slow re. \"The brittle-book problem is what I'm ghting with our 19th-centurymaterials,\" said Burge, who studiedbook University ofIllinois at Urbana- Embrit- tlement can be halted by a processcalled deacidication, while books toofragile for public use can be digitizedor microlmed. \"The historical library'slong-standing mission includes theunderstanding that library materialswill be used, and with use comes wear and tear,\" said Burge. \"Our goalis to keep our collections safe and in useable condition through preserva-tion and conservation measures.\" Cathy Shufro is a contributing editor of Yale Medicine . 17 right Among the tasks facing preservation librarian Sarah Burge is preserving books madeof wood pulp that becomes brittle with age.She triages the books according to damage,value and their importance to the collection. far right Burge uses a powder made of crumbled rubber erasers to clean the surfaces of the pages of Catoptrum Microcosmicum , a (2)yale medicine winter200818 On the wards in Uganda Story and Photographs by John CurtisFor Yale physicians and medical students, a few weeks at Mulago Hospital in Kampala become a life-changing experience. 19yale medicine winter200820 On the wards in Uganda In the infectious disease ward at Mulago Hospital in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, a woman in her early 20s lieson a bed with only a thin sheet to ward off the morning chill.Alone, suffering from complications from aids, her few possessions in a cardboard box at her bedside, she has nofamily to bathe her, bring her food or give her medicine.These are what doctors here call poor \"blanket signs.\" Themere presence\u2014or absence\u2014of a blanket speaks volumes. Even before they measure the blanket signs, however, the doctors know several things about their patients. Theyknow that as a national government-run referral hospital,Mulago receives the sickest of the sick. They know that morethan half the patients in the hospital are infected with hiv. They know that two-thirds of their patients will die in thehospital or within two months of leaving it. And they knowthat most of their patients are too poor to afford more thanthe most basic tests and treatments. Blanket signs will tell them more. The hospital pro- vides patients with a bed. Patients must bring sheets, blanketsand pillows, as well as \"attendants\"\u2014family members whocare for them. The doctors have learned that just having ablanket reveals much about a patient's economic status. Ofnecessity, the patient's ability to pay will drive the treatmentregimen. If the patient has no resources, the doctors will prescribe only the drugs that come free from the pharmacyand order only the tests that the hospital provides at no cost. \"Medicine is not all about what you have learned in medical school,\" said Robert Kalyesubula, m.d., a Mulago resident. \"You prioritize. In the context of the limitationsyou have, what can you best do for this person? What isgoing to help my diagnosis best? You talk to them so theyfind a way to get the money, sacrice a few things. You save the most expensive tests for last, when you reallyneed them.\"Making an impact on the globe Improving patient care in New Haven as well as in Kampala is the goal of a collaboration that began in August 2006, when Majid Sadigh, m.d., associate professor of medicine, arrived at Mulago with a team of Yale residents. Since then Yale has maintained a constant presence at the hospital,with Yale residents and attendings in monthlong rotationsalongside colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine atMakerere University and Uganda's Ministry of Health. In the summer of 2007 Yale expanded its presence to includethree medical students on new international fellowships (See sidebar, p. 29); a physician from Russia; two DownsFellows; two public health students pursuing research proj-ects; and students from the Physician Associate Program in addition to three Yale residents. The collaboration grew out of Sadigh 's visit to Uganda in 2002 to lecture and teach about infectious disease. Why,he wondered, was the extraordinary clinical, medical and epi-demiological research taking place at Makerere not ndingits way literally across the street to improve care at MulagoHospital? Yale, he felt, could help. \"It is one of the best uni-versities in the world,\" he says. \"It has a vision of having animpact on the globe. It has the most talented individuals.\" In the face of despair and crushing poverty Sadigh has implemented several ideas, large and small, that have madethings better for people in Uganda. In the shing village of Kasensero, the home of the earliest-known AIDS case in Uganda, Sadigh has helped patients at the local clinic andraised money to provide an education for orphans. At thenearby Holy Family Nazareth School, a boarding high schoolwhere most of the 250 students have been orphaned by aids , he has raised money for bunk beds and solar panels to provide lighting. And at Mulago he has kept the exchangegoing for more than a year with support from Yale'sDepartment of Internal Medicine and the Yale/Johnson &Johnson Physician Scholars in International Health pro-gram, which funds residents' trips to Mulago. When Sadigh rst contemplated the collaboration in 2002, he and Asghar Rastegar, m.d., vice chair of medicine, had already launched a successful program between Yale andthe state medical school in Kazan, Russia. Residents fromboth countries have traveled back and forth for clinical rota-tions for several years. With support from Rastegar and previous page With an atten- dant nearby and blankets, sheetsand a pillow on her bed, this patienthad what doctors at MulagoHospital call good \"blanket signs.\"What the patients bring with them gives doctors clues to theirfinancial resources and helps doctors tailor their treatment plans. 21 On the cardiology ward, Jos\u00e9 Evangelista, a third-year Yale resi-dent, rounded with CarolineBwango, a resident, and SimonEleku, a medical registrar, or juniorfaculty, at Mulago Hospital lastsummer. Evangelista returned toNew Haven with a stronger appre-ciation of the physical exam.\"Before jumping to a test I goback to the physical exam to see if I missed anything,\" he said.\"I don't order labs nearly as much as I used to unless there is a rationale.\" In a laboratory at Mulago Hospital, technician Samson Omongotshowed the Yale residents how totest for malaria in a blood sample.Throughout their time in Uganda,the residents saw diseases orstages of disease that are rare inthe United States. \"They areextremely good at what they do,\"said Yale resident Mike Lee,left, describing his Ugandan col-leagues. \"They can show us somany things in working with lim-ited resources. Their knowledge of tropical medicine is amazing.\" yale medicine winter200822 On the wards in Uganda David L. Coleman, m.d., hs'80, interim chair of internal medicine, Sadigh laid the groundwork for the Ugandaexchange. By the summer of 2006 both sides had signed a memorandum of understanding. Both Yale and Makerere, they believed, could benet from an exchange that would not, in the words of Rastegar,be an exercise in \"medical tourism.\" Yale doctors wouldlearn more about tropical and infectious diseases, whileUgandan doctors would gain access to the latest medicalstandards and methods. In practice, however, the lessons that Yale students, residents and attendings learn from their Ugandan col-leagues go much deeper than improving clinical skills andacquiring knowledge. The Mulago rotations bring into ques-tion basic notions about medicine and the very concept of what it means to be a doctor. This soul-searching beginson the rst encounter with the wards at Mulago. At the 1,500-bed hospital Yale physicians have few of the tools they take for granted in the United States. Patientsin Mulago are often in a hospital for the rst time in theirlives and little or no medical history is available. They arrivein an advanced stage of disease. The hospital pharmacy mayhave run out of basic medications. No one is available to takea patient downstairs for an X-ray. Test results may take daysto arrive. One Yale student took to carrying a blood pressurecuff with her on rounds since none was available. During ateaching session the students wandered the wards in searchof a working light box so they could look at X-rays. And it'snot always clear who's in charge of a patient, making surethat tests are done and medications are administered. \"When people come here they can really feel bewil- dered,\" says Sam Luboga, m.d., deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Makerere University. \"They nd a hospital fullof patients without drugs, without supplies.\" That brings them to a new appreciation of the basic skills of medicine, says Christophe K. Opio, m.d., an internist at Mulago. \"You have to make a diagnosis from the little information you have,\" he says. \"You become an investigator. You use all of your senses to identify a prob-lem and then know what to do about a problem.\" From their Mulago colleagues Yale doctors learn to rely on the most basic tools of medicine\u2014a rigorous physi-cal examination, whatever history can be gleaned from thepatient and their own knowledge of disease. And that is This patient, a 75-year-old mechanic with diabetes and hypertension,kept a notebook detailing hismedical condition over the previ-ous 10 years. \"He needs moreinsulin,\" said Peter Ellis, an attend-ing at Yale-New Haven Hospital,after looking over his records. \"Hissugars are too high.\" Ellis sug-gested a higher dose of insulin atlunch to cover the heaviestmeal of the day. 23 During their stay in Uganda, Yale attendings and students went onhouse calls on the outskirts ofKampala. Traveling with a teamfrom St. Stephen's Hospital,a private facility in the suburb ofMpererwe, they made follow-up visits to patients. The hospitaltreats about 10,000 patients ayear from a catchment area thatincludes Mpererwe and adjoin-ing neighborhoods. Malariaaccounts for more than a third ofthe cases at the small hospital,which operates on fees and withsupport from charities in theUnited Kingdom. Sam Luboga,the deputy dean at MakerereUniversity's Faculty of Medicine,started the hospital about 20years ago. Hospital administra- tor Charles Mugume explainedthe importance of the housecalls. \"They come, we treat, wedischarge. Then we follow up,\"he said. Majid Sadigh led house calls in July, accompanied by his son,Kaveh, a medical student at Tulane,and Matt Cook, who graduated in October from Yale's PhysicianAssociate Program. The team fromSt. Stephen's Hospital included the hospital administrator, a mid-wife, a social worker and an attendant. The catchment area is not a suburb like any in theUnited States. Few roads are paved and the houses, often of brick or cinder block, are surroundedby plantain trees or small pastures for grazing goats or cows. top left Sadigh tended to an 85-year-old woman with multipleproblems, including hyperten-sion and cataracts that could leadto glaucoma. bottom left Charles Mugume, administrator of St. Stephen'sHospital, took a patient's bloodpressure. top right Peter Ellis led house calls with medical students AllisonArwady and Lily Horng.

Uganda is a poor country; annual percapita income is about $280. Foreign aid accounts for halfthe national budget revenues. The country has dismal healthindicators\u2014life expectancy, 52 years; infant mortality, 67 per 1,000 live births. The risk of bacterial diarrhea, hepatitisA, malaria and African sleeping sickness is very high. And the country is still recovering from the turmoil that followed independence from Great Britain in 1962.Nine years later, when General Idi Amin seized power in acoup, Ugandans welcomed him as a relief from the auto-cratic President Milton Obote. Within a year Amin began toexpel the country's Asian population\u2014brought to Africa as civil servants by the British\u2014who, Ugandans felt, unfairlydominated the economy. The Asians also made up a sig-nicant portion of the medical school faculty. \"I had just started medical school when Amin came to power,\" said Nelson Sewankambo, m.d. He is the sixth Ugandan dean of the Faculty of Medicine, a post he has heldfor almost a decade. \"We saw the exodus of expatriate staff at the time. Ugandans and Africans also left.\" As Amin targeted his enemies, real and perceived, Sewankambo said, academics \"became suspect.\" Several doc-tors at the medical school were murdered, including onewho was snatched from the operating room. By 1979, whenneighboring Tanzania invaded Uganda over a border disputeand Amin fled to exile in Saudi Arabia, Mulago Hospital hadno working X-ray machines, no running water, no refrigera-tion in the morgue and no sewage system. The GeneralMedical Council of the United Kingdom no longer recog-nized Makerere medical degrees. This loss of recognition was a stunning reversal for both the medical school and the university that had beenknown as the Harvard of East Africa. Makerere Universityopened in 1922 as a technical school. Over the next fewyears it added courses in agriculture, veterinary medicineand teacher training. In 1924 the precursor to the medicalschool, the School for Senior Native Medical Assistants,opened at Mulago Government Hospital. Even the school's Mulago resident Robert Kalyesubula, 31, comes from Luwero, a town about60 kilometers north of Kampala,where he spent part of his residency.\"When I practiced in my hometown I realized that there were so manypatients so far from doctors,\" he said.His experiences during the civil warthat followed the overthrow of IdiAmin led to his decision to help peo-ple by becoming a doctor. His fatherdied in the fighting and Kalyesubulawas separated from his mother. Healso lost siblings to war, disease andstarvation. Sponsored by a Canadiancharity, Friends in the West, he wasraised in an orphanage and as a child toured the United States as amember of the African Children'sChoir. Later he went to McMasterUniversity in Canada as part of a medical exchange. \"There is a lot to learn between the two ofus,\" he said of the Makerere-Yale collaboration. \"We know a lotabout infectious diseases. Theyknow a lot of modern medicine.We exchange at that level.\" Hismain lesson for Yale medical students was, \"how you can actu-ally manage patients by having a very good clinical exam.\" 25 name reflected the colonial view that Africans were inca- pable of becoming doctors. By 1929, however, the school formedical assistants had become the Faculty of Medicine,graduating not assistants but fully qualied physicians. Theuniversity advanced in other areas after it afliated with theUniversity of London in 1949. By 1962 Makerere was EastAfrica's leading educational institution, producing severalpresidents of new African nations, including Julius Nyerereof Tanzania. In 1963, following Uganda's independence,Makerere joined with universities in neighboring Kenya andTanzania to form the short-lived University of East Africa. Makerere, like the rest of the country, fell on hard times during the Amin era and the civil war that followed.Fighting ended in 1986, when Yoweri Museveni's guerrillaband took power. Museveni has ruled ever since, providingstability in Uganda if not true democracy or transparency. As peace came to the country Makerere University sought to regain its former prestige. An opportunityemerged for the Faculty of Medicine in the early 1980s onthe shores of Lake Victoria, where a mysterious ailment wasplaguing the shing village of Kasensero, about 60 milessouthwest of Kampala. In 1982 people in the village began dying of a disease the locals called \"slim \" because of its wasting effect. Thedisease was aids but no one knows how it reached the vil- lage. hiv had made the leap from monkeys to humans years earlier in Cameroon on Africa's western coast. Somespeculate that the AIDS virus crossed the continent with the construction of a trans-Africa highway. Others blame its arrival in Uganda on the invading Tanzanian army.However the virus arrived, it turned this village and itsbrothels into the epicenter of the Ugandan AIDS epidemic. Since then much of the leading research on aids in Africa has been done at Makerere. \"From the beginning the medical school has been the flagship of Makerere University. There is good research on hiv. There is groundbreaking research on malaria as well. Burkitt's lymphoma was described by a professor here,\" saidSewankambo, a prominent aids researcher. Yet problems persist. \"Makerere continues to struggle in raising resources.... The salaries are awful, for example. Laboratories are run-down. The equipment is old.\" The medical faculty at Makerere has long enjoyed help from abroad. Before implementing a new problem-based cur-riculum in medicine, faculty members visited 14 universities around the world. And international collaborations don 't endthere. Makerere's medical school has many foreign partners\u2014Case Western Reserve University; Johns Hopkins University;the University of California, San Francisco; the University ofMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey; McMaster University in Canada; the University of British Columbia; the University of Dublin; and the University of London. The Yale-Makererecollaboration, however, stands apart. \"Other universities say, 'Let's collaborate on research.' Yale is interested in improving the quality of health care services and the education of physicians,\" says Sewankambo.\"By improving education we are training health workers toprovide quality services within the context of limited resources.\" \"That is how we survive.\" In resource-poor Mulago Hospital, the Yale residents and stu- dents rotating through the wards last summer incurred a debtto their Ugandan hosts that they doubted they could repay. Asthey worked side by side with Ugandan colleagues their physi-cal examination skills soared; they learned about tropical diseases; and they saw what were for them uncommon casesof advanced disease. The three medical students agreed thatMulago provided their best clinical rotation by far. But they all wondered how much they were helping Mulago Hospital in return. How could they repay the hospital for all that theywere learning? If Yale residents and even attendings strugglein the absence of resources that are second nature to them,what can they teach physicians who lack those resources? \"You can always help, even when the facilities are not as good as where you are from,\" says Edward Ddumba, m.d., executive director of Mulago Hospital. Echoing Sadigh, he adds, \"You cannot be paralyzed by different institutions.People adapt.\" Ddumba has no trouble imagining where he'd spend more money if he had it. He'd like to double the number of physicians on staff from 400 to 800 and increase thenursing staff as well. Among his other goals are \"to get theinfrastructure repaired ... to get hospital furniture, hospitallinens, improve laboratory services, improve emergencydrug supplies and emergency response infrastructure usingcapital budget.\" Most of his $15.6 million annual budget comes from the Ugandan government. Private wards on the sixth floor yale medicine winter200826 On the wards in Uganda generate additional income and the hospital also relies on international donations of supplies, money and drugs.\"That is how we survive,\" Ddumba says. Sadigh believes Yale doctors also provide a signicant contribution to the hospital. In the rst year of the program,said Sadigh, Yale residents provided 90 weeks of coverage atthe hospital and attendings provided 60 weeks. They set anexample by modeling different attitudes and ways of practic-ing medicine and interacting with patients. \"If we have anyimpact on Mulago, we have an impact on the whole coun-try,\" Sadigh says, \"because Mulago is setting the standard forcare and education for the country.\" Among the tangible benefits are the medical sup- plies that Yale visitors bring from Recovered MedicalEquipment for the Developing World ( remedy) , a Yale- based organization that salvages surgical supplies andother unused materials that can 't be used in the UnitedStates. The visitors also bring journals and textbooks. From his office at Yale, librarian Mark Gentry has madeonline medical resources and textbooks available toMakerere students and faculty in Kampala. \"Through this program we have been able to get a lot of reading materials, which I think makes us better able tolook up issues and treat our patients,\" said Mulago residentFred Semitala, m.d., a graduate of Makerere. Semitala would like to see more Ugandans train at Yale. So far, threehave traveled to New Haven. \"If we train a hematologist or a nephrologist, then that person is going to train ve ormore,\" he says, adding a caveat. \"Training without the facili-ties to use doesn 't help. A cardiologist couldn 't do a betterdiagnosis if he doesn 't have ekg.\" Ali Moses, one of three Ugandan trainees to come to Connecticut, spent four months at Waterbury Hospital andYale-New Haven Hospital learning about evidence-basedmedicine, diagnostic skills and patient management proto-cols. \"The Yale elective provides an opportunity to appreciatethe practice of 'ideal' clinical medicine, which can be used as a standard or benchmark for and basis for improvementin general clinical care,\" he said in an e-mail from Kampala. Other benets are intangible yet no less important. A Yale second-year resident, Michael X. Lee, m.d. , who was in Uganda last summer, tried to introduce evidence-basedmedicine while on the wards. Evidence-based medicine, aconcept that emerged more than 25 years ago, applies thelatest and best evidence to make medical decisions. \" A lot of things are practiced because that is the way it has beenpracticed for years,\" Lee said. \"I try to ask the Ugandan resi-dents, 'What is the evidence for what you just said?'\" \"I think where we can really help is in role modeling,\" said Jos\u00e9 Evangelista, m.d. , a third-year resident who was at Mulago last summer. \"It is my role to help by teaching.\" All the visitors at times felt overwhelmed by the hospital. \"You are frustrated on so many levels,\" said Samit Joshi, m.d., a third-year resident. \" At a system level you wish the hospital had more free services and more basic tests or bet-ter nursing care or better doctor care. At a public health levelyou wish there were enough prevention campaigns so that peo-ple don 't come in with hivor malaria or schistosomiasis.\" \"It is easy to walk into a situation and be over- whelmed. There is also a different way of looking at it,\" saidLee. \"They save a lot of lives in Mulago. They have treatedmany people successfully. We have a lot of respect for thepeople that work here.\" Life at the Edge If the Mulago experience caused the residents and students to question what it means to be a doctor, the living arrange-ments altered the traditional hierarchy of students, residentsand attendings. Residents and attendings don 't usually sharebedrooms and bathrooms or see each other in shorts and T-shirts every evening. Nor do residents typically see anattending ironing his shirt in the morning. The Mulago set-ting also made for a round-the-clock learning experience\u2014the talk around the house was usually about medicine. Home for the Yale team was the Edge Guest House on the 300-acre campus of Makerere University. The walleduniversity, sitting on a hill of the same name, is a haven ofcalm against the bustle of Kampala, where the air lls withthe exhaust of countless matatus \u2014minivans that provide public transport\u2014motorcycles and taxis. And the Edge, acomplex that includes a six-bedroom house and two smalleroutbuildings enclosed inside a wall, provides further insula-tion from the city. In the house was a revolving cast of characters that included Sadigh, four residents, two public health students, a physician associate student, a resident from ColumbiaUniversity, a resident from New York University, and Sadigh 'sson, Kaveh, a medical student at Tulane University. A few 27 blocks away most of the team 's female contingent\u2014ve medi- cal students\u2014shared an on-campus apartment. Mornings at the Edge began around seven o'clock as residents and students prepared hot water for tea and atebreakfast\u2014avocado sandwiches were one resident's favorite\u2014before heading for Mulago Hospital. The 25-minute walk took the residents and students through the green lawns and crumbling sidewalks of the university to the eastern gateon busy Bombo Road. Trafc lights are almost nonexistent inKampala. Trafc circles called roundabouts control the flow ofvehicles at intersections. Frequent speed bumps on busy roadsslow down trafc enough for pedestrians to scurry across. From Bombo Road the path to Mulago follows a dirt track into a shantytown called Katanga. Although Katanga issafe during the day, the Yale team is advised to avoid theOne of the goals of the collaboration is to offer Yale attendings, residentsand medical students a chance tounderstand not just Ugandan healthcare, but also the country's cultureand politics. One field trip tookmedical students to the Patiko-AjuluInternally Displaced Persons Campnear Gulu in northern Uganda nearthe Sudanese border. This camphouses about 10,000 people forcedto leave their homes by the Lord'sResistance Army, a rebel group thatopposes the Ugandan governmentand is known for kidnapping chil-dren to serve as soldiers.above left Children wandered about the Patiko-Ajulu camp on a weekend in July. left A young woman of 17, a day after giving birth to her son in thecamp's clinic. above The Yale group also visited Kasensero, a fishing village on Lake Victoria, and the epicenter ofUganda's aids epidemic.

The path descends into the Katanga valley, past a soccer eld, past grazing cows and goats, past a small brick factory, up the dirt track and across another busythoroughfare to the back entrance of Mulago Hospital. At the hospital residents and students started the day with morning report. \"We nd out how the patient is doing.Together we come up with a management plan for the dayfor the patient. Interspersed with that is the opportunity todo peer teaching,\" said Lee. During one day's rounds through the infectious dis- ease ward, Joshi worked with Patrick Komakech, m.d., a Mulago intern, and Rasikh Tuktamysvhov, m.d., from Kazan, Russia, who was in Uganda at Sadigh 's invitation. Joiningthe team was Rachel Smith, a fourth-year medical studentfrom the University of California, San Francisco. yale medicine winter200828 On the wards in Uganda The patients included a woman who looked to be a teenager but was 24. She lay on a bed covered only by a sheet, with no attendants to look after her. hiv-positive and anemic, she had been vomiting. The next patient was a 40-year-woman complaining of vomiting, fever andheadache. The differential diagnosis suggested malaria andthe doctors administered quinine through an IV. Anotherpatient had good blanket signs\u2014a suitcase for her belong-ings and an attendant sitting at her bedside with a cup of tea. The patient's diagnosis was cryptococcal meningitis, a common infection in patients with low CD4 counts. Among the day's patients was a 20-year-old woman with aids who had been abandoned by her husband. He had made it clear to the hospital that he didn 't want herback. Although she was not sick enough to remain in the hospital, she was too sick to be on her own. A social worker intervened and the husband took her back. By noon, rounds are usually over and the medical teams break for lunch in the hospital canteen on the second floor.Lunch can be snacks\u2014small pizzas or fried meat pies\u2014or abuffet that offers a heaping plate of rice, sweet potatoes and matoke (mashed plantain) covered by a bean, beef or goat stew. After lunch the residents may perform tasks that usu- ally fall to nurses in the United States, such as drawingblood for tests or removing fluid from patients' abdomens.On-call days are the same, except that between 4 and 5 p.m.they go to the casualty ward and evaluate new patients,determine the primary problem, and triage them to such different services as gastroenterology, infectious diseases,renal, pulmonary, cardiology or neurology. Two or three evenings a week, Sadigh set up two lap- tops in the living room of the Edge Guest House for histalks on infectious diseases. He also arranged for classes inLuganda, one of the country's principal languages, talks on Ugandan history by a political scientist and weekend tripsto sites of historical and cultural signicance. A transforming experience Their experiences in Uganda have already had an effect on the doctors and students. For the students, it has conrmedor altered their career choices\u2014all three medical studentshave chosen to specialize in internal medicine\u2014and their sense of what is important to learn. And residents nd themselves taking a different approach to medicine. \"I think my physical exam skills went through the roof,\" said Joshi, the third-year resident, a few weeks afterhis return to Connecticut. \"My ordering of tests has prob-ably gone down by 40 percent. If I get this test, X-ray or CTscan\u2014which is hard to come by in Mulago\u2014is it going to give me some new insight that I can 't get by putting mystethoscope on the patient's chest?\" And it's not just students and residents starting out in their careers who are affected by the experience. \"What doesit really mean to be an effective clinician?\" asked MerceditasVillanueva, m.d., an infectious disease specialist at Yale- afliated Waterbury Hospital who spent three weeks atMulago. In October she addressed a reception to open anexhibit of photographs and essays about Uganda. \"Fromwhere does a clinician 's power ultimately derive? Clearly, werely on our technical expertise, our knowledge of patho-physiology, our ability to use evidence to make diagnosesand formulate treatment plans. ... But beyond this, I believeour power derives from our ability to listen, examine care-fully, synthesize data and draw on our previous experiences.\" For Sadigh it's not enough that Yale students, residents and attendings learn how to practice medicine with limitedresources. He also wants to purge them of prejudices or pater-nalism. \"We shouldn 't be making judgments about a com-munity that is overwhelmed at every level,\" he says. Heexpects that the young Yale doctors will learn from the experi-ence, and he acknowledges the difculties they face\u2014linguis-tic and cultural barriers as well as patients who have nomoney for medicines or no one to fetch them a glass of water. \"It is a kind of shock therapy,\" says Mulago's Opio. \"Most people do not know what happens in the developingworld. ... Many of them are going to become great people intheir lifetimes, but I think their experience here will makethem better people.\" That is also the hope that drives Sadigh. \" At the end of the trip they will be different people,\" he says. \"I can 't measure that, but I think they will be differ-ent people. ... If they become better people, in the future I think Uganda is going to gain a lot from this. That is along-term investment.\" John Curtis is the managing editor of Yale Medicine .29 but at their own expense. For the first time, the medical school isoffering financial support. Angoffbelieves the experience in a for-eign hospital will have a lastingand positive influence on the stu-dents' development as doctors. Arwady, Horng and Laff joined an existing medical exchange led by Majid Sadigh, m.d ., associ- ate professor of medicine. Thiswas the first time that theexchange, which has broughtYale residents to Uganda sincethe summer of 2006, hostedmedical students. \"It was hard,\" said Arwady, who had previously been in SouthAfrica and Botswana, working on projects as a medical student.\"It was also one of the mostintense and thought-provokingexperiences I have had in years. Uganda clerkships inaugurate a new foreignelectives program After six weeks in Uganda last sum- mer, fourth-year medical studentsAllison Arwady, Lily Horng andRachel Laff said the clinical rotationat Mulago Hospital was the bestthey'd had in medical school. Thethree were the first students totravel abroad with support fromthree new fellowships endowed byalumni donations. The fellowshipsmarked the beginning of an ambi-tious program to support interna-tional clerkships for students. \"This is different from anything that has ever happened before,\"said Nancy R. Angoff, m.p.h. '81, m.d. '90,hs'93, associate dean for student affairs. Students havelong traveled abroad for clerkships,You are out of your comfort zone in every way.\" \"I learned a lot, thanks to the residents and most of all to Dr.Sadigh,\" said Laff, who had previ-ously spent three months in Gabon.She said her time in Uganda rein-forced her decision to pursueinternal medicine. \"I want thatbroad training,\" she said. \"It was the best rotation I've had, hands down,\" said Horng,who had previously traveled toChina and Chile. On Mulago's wards they saw the limitations of medicine in a devel-oping country and marveled at theskills and knowledge of their Ugan-dan colleagues. They came awaywith a heightened appreciation ofthe importance of the physicalexam, which they saw their Ugan-dan and Yale colleagues relying on for diagnoses. \"It's somethingthat we don't do that well here,\"said Arwady. Also in Uganda was Matthew S. Cook, pa'07, then in his final year of the Physician Associate Program,which provided partial support forhis rotation. Like the medical stu-dents, he said his experience inUganda left a lasting impression.\"I definitely have a commitmentto do medicine overseas,\" he said.Cook began a two-week rotationon the Community Health CareVan on his return to New Haven.Coming on the heels of his Ugandaclerkship, the van rotation madehim more aware of health dispari-ties in this country. \"The healthcare system is broken and flawed.The problems are so widespreadthere is no easy fix,\" said Cook,who is now on the hospitalistservice at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Robert M. Rohrbaugh, m.d. , associate professor of psychiatry,and administrator for the clini-cal elective program that hasbrought foreign students to Yalefor electives, said the success of the Ugandan program bodeswell for future foreign electives.\"Despite the difficulties that every- one that goes there encounters,it was confirmatory for them thatthis is what they want to do,\"he said. Foreign electives will be open to students who have completedtheir third year. In addition to thesix-week clerkships, students canapply for the year-long Yale-ChinaMedical Chapman, executive direc-tor of the Yale-China Association,said the fellows going to Chinawould teach medical English andstudy Mandarin, the official mod-ern spoken language of China.They would also have clinical andresearch opportunities. The asso-ciation will pay travel expensesand provide a stipend and housingat the Xiangya School of Medicinein Changsha, Hunan. Wherever they go, students would be expected to learn aboutthe host country and learn some-thing of the language. \"They have to be prepared,\" Angoff said.\"They will also have an opportu-nity to debrief afterwards, as these experiences can be emotion-ally charged.\" Rohrbaugh said students will benefit in several ways. \"They'll be able to practice what they'velearned at Yale in different set-tings. They'll be seeing patientswith different presentations of illness. They'll develop an aware-ness of the social and political factors in health and disease,\"he said. \"There is a basic cultural competency that you learn.\" \u2014 John Curtis A podcast of Robert Rohrbaugh speaking on this subject can befound on the Yale page on iTunes U.Visit itunes.yale.edu or launchiTunes, then select Yale from theofferings under iTunes U.

John Elefteriades , head of cardiothoracic surgery, and Lawrence Cohen , the former special assistant to the dean, recently published Your Heart: An Owner's Guide , which explains cardiac problems and how to treat them. Lawrence Cohen When Jeffrey R. Bender, m.d., hs '83, met Lawrence S. Cohen, m.d., hs '65, in the early 1980s, Bender was a resident in internal medicine and Cohen introduced Yalemedical students and residents to cardiology. Deliberate,concise and impeccably dressed in a blazer, collared shirtand cuff links, never a crease out of place, Cohen was one of those professors whom students honor with a nickname. \"He was known as 'Larry the Heart,' \" recalls Bender, now the Robert I. Levy Professor of Preventive Cardiologyand professor of medicine and immunobiology, \"and he was the consummate teacher.\" At 74, Cohen, the Ebenezer K. Hunt Professor of Medi- cine, is still the expert from whom every Yale medical student learns how to listen for and interpret heart sounds.He estimates that he's taught some 3,000 students over thepast 35 years. But that facet of his academic life representsjust a fraction of his contributions to Yale, to medicine John Elefteriades The walls of his office are lined with a variety of \"Best Doctor\" magazine covers and plaques from profes-sional societies.

Elefteriades has done groundbreaking research on aor- tic aneurysms\u2014weakened areas in the wall of the heart's mainartery\u2014and is sought out by millionaires and royalty for hissurgical skills. But Cohen says patients are just as often movedby \"his gentleness.\" Patients like Carmela Kolman. Kolman was 32, an artist who knew that she had an aortic aneurysm and that it meant surgery at some point inher future. The future came crashing down on her, however,one Saturday morning in 1993 when the three layers of tis-sue comprising her aorta were forced apart by the pressureof the blood inside the vessel and the aneurysm dissected.She crawled to the telephone and whispered to the 911 oper-ator, \"Pain. In my chest.\" Elefteriades repaired her aorta and became a \"calm, reassuring presence\" in the weeks that followed, both for Kolman and her husband, John A. Rizzo, ph.d ., a health economist then on the faculty of the Department of Epidemi-ology and Public Health. Together Rizzo and Elefteriadesembarked on a course of research that continues to improvecare for patients like Kolman. Despite the danger of aortic aneurysms, physicians balk at performing open-heart surgery unless the aneurysmis at immediate risk of dissecting or bursting. But if theaneurysm does dissect or burst, mortality skyrockets. Thekey is determining the right moment to operate. There werefew tools to predict when an aneurysm would reach a crisisstage until Elefteriades and Rizzo developed the largest aor-tic aneurysm database in the world, with 3,000 cases. In thepast 15 years, their research has identied the risk factorsthat put patients with aneurysms in imminent danger. Rizzo, now at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, jokes that Elefteriades is \"the only person I'veever worked with for an extended period of time who hasnever lost patience with me.\" But he goes on to say thatElefteriades never loses patience, period. When the data areperplexing or a journal imposes an impossible deadline,Elefteriades maintains perfect composure, Rizzo says, andthe calm is contagious. \"That's what I call a leader,\" he adds. Elefteriades also collaborates with the Celera Group, the private rm that engaged in a scientic race with thegovernment's Human Genome Project. Together they'veidentified genetic alterations associated with aneurysmsand, by examining a patient's rna, can predict whether a patient will develop an aneurysm. (Their findings werepublished in the October 17 issue of PLoS ONE .) The test is 85 percent specific and close to 100 percent accurate,meaning that positive results accurately predict the devel-opment of aneurysms while about 15 percent of thepatients on track for an aneurysm will test negative. dna analysis that could complement the rna findings is under way, and Elefteriades hopes the test will be widelyused in high-risk patients. His research has also taken him into the twilight zone where patients hover on life's threshold. To operate on theaortic arch\u2014the area usually clamped off when a patient isput on a heart-lung machine\u2014blood circulation is sus-pended by inducing hypothermia. When a patient's bodycools to 18 degrees Celsius (about 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit)and the metabolic rate slows to 12.5 percent of normal,Elefteriades has 30 to 60 minutes to repair an aneurysm onthe aortic arch. His patients have neither blood pressure nor pulse; they are \"for all intents and purposes, dead,\" saysElefteriades. They awake with no apparent loss of memoryor cognitive function. \"I've done [the operation] probably as much as anyone has done it,\" says Elefteriades. \" And I don 't understand it.I'm awed by it.\" He wants to know why these patients thrive after a brush with death. He has an undergraduate interviewing 75patients and their spouses in search of \"subtle aberrations\"in the patient's behavior after the surgery. The patientsselected for the study have varied but mentally demandingoccupations: there are lawyers, doctors, artists and nancialanalysts in the sample. The study found no decline what-soever in their functional state after deep hypothermicarrest, Elefteriades said. Elefteriades continues to publish on the health risks of an exercise he enjoys himself, weight lifting. He has seen patterns in sudden deaths among high school and college ath-letes who lift weights, an exercise Elefteriades rst took up as a high school wrestler. He reviewed cases of 31 young menwho had died when their undetected aortic aneurysms dis-sected. He is recommending echocardiograms for all weightlifters to screen for aneurysms. Elefteriades acknowledges that the recommendation drives up health care spending butsays, \"I don 't know any other way to keep these kids safe.\" Elefteriades continued from page 3133 His research tends to spring from clinical questions, so in a sense the surgeon 's own heart never quite leaves theoperating room. \"The operating room is like a drug,\" hesays. \"If I'm away for a week, I feel I haven 't contributed tohumanity.\" Ironically, the career that inspires such passion in him was the result of happenstance. A top student and serious wrestler on the high school team in Lansdowne, Penn., Elefteriades had been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was plan-ning to be an engineer, much to the pride and delight of hisimmigrant parents, who had not gone to college themselves.One day a Yale recruiter walked into his classroom anddeclared, \"Young man, you're going to Yale.\" Elefteriades says he does not know what piqued the recruiter's interest\u2014perhaps a chat beforehand with thefriendly principal. Whatever the reason, he is grateful thatfate steered him to New Haven. At Yale, his horizons widened. \"I think it's the best place to go to college that there is,\" Elefteriades remembers.Yale allowed him to follow his varied interests: French litera-ture, physics, psychology. It wasn 't fashionable to have acareer path in mind in the early seventies, he recalls. So hebegan taking exams for various graduate and professionalprograms. He ended up in medical school because the mcat s were the rst set of results he got back. He explains his choice of surgery as motivated by \"a love of the beauty of the body, and the body really is beauti-ful\u2014internally, externally.\" He remembers the world of car-diothoracic surgery in the 1970s being relatively new andfull of challenges. While much of his work involves expand-ing the discipline's knowledge base, he is equally satisedperforming bypass surgery, though he's done the procedurethousands of times. \"Each case is a little different. Everyblood vessel is a little different,\" he says. In addition to his scholarly work, Elefteriades writes for the lay public, a pursuit he nds \"relaxing.\" He co-authored Your Heart: An Owner's Guide with Cohen, a work that explains cardiac problems and their treatment. Bothwriters said the book is in part a response to the time pres-sure exerted by health management organizations that fre-quently robs patients and families of the chance to askdetailed questions of their physicians. A second book, The Woman 's Heart: An Owner's Guide ,is in press. Elefteriades,who co-authored the book with Teresa L. Caulin-Glaser, m.d., hs '91,fw '95, a clinical associate professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University, hastens to explainthat he's demystifying the female heart from a medical perspective, not a poetic one. \"If I could understand thewoman 's heart, that would be great,\" he says. \"I think women are much more complex and interesting than men\u2014emotionally and in nearly every other way.\" He also has a book on cardiac fitness in the pipeline and another ofpatient stories, titled Extraordinary Hearts . He attributes his productivity to a \"phenomenal\" sup- port staff and a changing corps of students and residentswho do much of the heavy lifting in his research. \"My role as a mentor is to identify a topic that is an important openquestion,\" says Elefteriades, and then to offer guidance on how to write a scientic paper. He nds that students\"usually exceed any expectations I could have for them.\" Elefteriades received the Socrates Award for Excellence in teaching and mentoring of residents from theSociety of Thoracic Surgeons in 2006. He calls his impact asa teacher his proudest achievement and points to the formerYale residents who are now directing cardiac centers. It is especially gratifying to bring a medical student into the operating room for the rst time and hear, \"This is the greatest day of my life!\" That was how Elefteriades felthis rst day in surgery. The feeling has lingered. Colleen Shaddox is a freelance writer in Hamden, Conn.\"The operating room is like a drug. If I'm away for a week I feel like I haven't contributed to humanity.\" yale medicine winter200834 A tale of two doctors and to the advancement of cardiac care during a career that began with his graduation from New York UniversityMedical School in 1958. It's advancement of patient care that lls Cohen with sat- isfaction and even a sense of wonder when he thinks back tothe early days of his academic career. \"The number one dif-ference between then and now is that someone practicingnow has the tools to prevent heart disease,\" he says. That wehave this armamentarium at all is in part thanks to Cohen.The Brooklyn-born cardiologist was a key player in the majorstudies that established the efcacy of clot-busting medica-tions to stop heart attacks and slow the hardening and clog-ging of the arteries that usually precipitate coronary disease.Cohen was the principal investigator at Yale of a series ofmulticenter trials of thrombolytic drugs, including streptoki-nase and tissue plasminogen activator, or t -pa. These drugs dissolve blood clots by harnessing an enzyme called plasminto break down brin, the protein that helps platelets bind to form a clot. These early Thrombolysis in MyocardialInfarction ( timi ) trials in the late 1980s proved that throm- bolytics would help patients who were experiencing an acutemyocardial infarction, an interruption of blood flow to theheart muscle. Since the mid-1970s, Cohen has overseen some two dozen trials of heart disease treatments, some ofthem ongoing. Because of his wide experience and calm, effective approach to decision making, Cohen 's advice has been sought for years.Students, residents, fellows, colleagues in cardiology anddeans trust his judgment, and not only about medicine. In1991, then-Dean Leon Rosenberg, m.d., hs'63, asked him to serve as his deputy dean. Cohen continued in that roleunder Robert Donaldson, m.d., and Gerard Burrow, m.d. '58, hs '66. For the past 10 years he has been the special advisor to three deans, David A. Kessler, m.d., Interim Dean Dennis D. Spencer, m.d., hs'77, and current Dean Robert J. Alpern, m.d., Ensign Professor of Medicine. Cohen 's focus has ranged from overseeing faculty appointments and pro-motions to raising money for endowed professorships toinvestigating scientic misconduct and fraud. Of the latter,Cohen says, \"It doesn 't happen very often, but when it doesthe university takes it very seriously.\" With his colleague Merle Waxman, m.a., the medical school's ombudsperson, Cohen took a preventive approachto research misconduct. They developed a seminar seriestitled \"The Responsible Conduct of Research,\" which has been presented to more than 1,000 postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and faculty since 1996. Mostallegations, Cohen believes, can be avoided by taking a few precautions, and he advises faculty to be open andcommunicative about their research from the earlieststages of a project. Meticulous and transparent data re-cording, frequent meetings with collaborators and famili-arity with all aspects of a project, not just one's own part in it, he says, are the keys to avoiding problems down the road. After 16 years, Cohen stepped down from his role as the dean 's advisor last July, but he is continuing as a full-timefaculty member and practicing cardiologist. \"I'm not retir-ing,\" he told colleagues and acquaintances in the weeks lead-ing up to a May 1 reception in his honor in the MedicalHistorical Library. As word of the reception spread, Cohenfound himself explaining again and again that he was notleaving Yale. \"I hear you're retiring,\" Don McNulty, a maintenance worker that Cohen has known for 30 years, said a few daysbefore the ceremony, which was attended by more than 100 colleagues, family members and friends, including YalePresident Richard C. Levin and Yale-New Haven Hospital ceo Marna P. Borgstrom, m.p.h. '79. \"I'm not retiring,\" Cohen said for the umpteenth time, his face betraying not a hint of impatience. \"I'm just leavingthe dean 's ofce. I will still be here.\" That's good news for the medical school, says longtime collaborator John A. Elefteriades, m.d. '76, hs'81, fw'83, the section chief and William W.L. Glenn Professor ofCardiothoracic Surgery. Elefteriades, who learned fromCohen to listen to the heart as a medical student, calls hismentor \"the cardiologists' cardiologist.\" \"When any of us is ill, we go to him,\" he says of Cohen. \"Both my parents see him. Whenever there's a tremendouslydifcult or complex case that requires exceptional judgment,cardiologists from all over the region will send their patientsto him.\" In 2007 Elefteriades and Cohen published their second book together, Your Heart: An Owner's Guide (Prometheus Books), with a foreword by articial heart inventor RobertJarvik, m.d. It is Cohen 's fourth book\u2014he has also published 34 book chapters and 136 papers.Cohen continued from page 3135 Cohen is married to Jane A. Cohen, m.s.w ., a psychiatric social worker in private practice, and has two daughters andfour grandchildren. He grew up in the Flatbush section ofBrooklyn, N.Y ., the youngest of three children. His grand-parents were emigrants from Poland and Russia; his fatherowned a chain of men 's clothing stores. Cohen attendedMidwood High School in Brooklyn and then Harvard College,graduating in 1954 with a degree in social psychology. Aftermedical school at nyu, he came to Yale in 1958 as an intern in medicine and stayed for a second year as a resident beforejoining the U.S. Public Health Service as a research fellow ininfectious diseases. After two years as a research fellow in cardiology at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, hereturned to Yale as a senior resident in 1964-65. His mentors were Paul B. Beeson, m.d.; Eugene Braunwald, m.d.; and Donald W. Seldin, m.d. '43, hs'46. Cohen remembers Beeson, a legendary chair of medicine atYale who conducted research on fever and discovered the classof signaling molecules called cytokines, as \"a quiet, charis-matic man who led by making you want to do your very best. \"You never wanted to disappoint Paul Beeson. He really cared about the care of the patient and would sit down on thebed and talk directly to the patient, which was very unusual inthat day,\" Cohen says. Braunwald, author of the leading cardi-ology text, Heart Disease , and chair of the timi Study Group at Brigham and Women 's Hospital, recruited Cohen to the cardi-ology branch of the National Heart Institute, where Cohenserved as chief of the clinical service. He would go on to workwith Braunwald on the rst three timi studies, which proved that heart attacks are caused by the rupture of plaque from thewall of an artery, followed by clotting. \"It was the clot that stopped the blood flow and caused the death of heart muscle,\" says Cohen. \" timi proved that if you could dissolve the clot in a timely fashion and therebyre-establish blood flow to the heart muscle, you could limitor prevent the effects of a heart attack completely.\" Seldin, who left a comfortable teaching post at Yale to build a research powerhouse at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical School, recruited Cohen to Dallas.After two years, Cohen was lured back to Yale in 1970 aschief of cardiology. Trained by giants in medicine, Cohen has himself men- tored dozens of influential cardiologists and leaders in aca-demic medicine, including Kim A. Eagle, m.d.,hs '83, directorof the Cardiovascular Center at the University of Michigan; and John M. Lasala, m.d.,ph.d ., fw'90, director of interventional cardiology at Washington University in St. Louis. Lasala, who came to Yale as a cardiology fellow in 1986, remembers being impressed by Cohen 's ability to nd themost salient and critical details in a mass of complex infor-mation. \"He obviously knew quite a bit, but the most amaz-ing thing was his ability to synthesize great amounts ofinformation into simple and factually correct assessments,\"says Lasala. He recalls examining a patient who had beenseen in the practice 20 years previously. \"Whose notes doyou think were in the chart?\" Whereas some of the noteswould run to two or three pages, he says, \"Larry's notes werethree lines\u2014but much more informative. They were so pithy and to the heart of the matter\u2014no pun intended\u2014thatyou couldn 't fail to be impressed. He could say an awful lotwith very little.\" Eagle recognized this ability as well, along with Cohen 's penchant for relating to patients. \"He's brilliant,\" Eagle says.\"He doesn 't go through the motions but focuses entirely on each patient, and he nds things that other doctors don 'tnd. He's meticulous, not only in his speech, dress andmanner, but in his physical examination. He's like a laser-guided missile when it comes to nding a problem.\" Cohen is looking forward to his continued work with patients, students and trainees and his work on the medicalschool's admissions committee, on which he has served forthe past six years. He'll continue teaching for the satisfactionof inspiring young people and watching them grow, he says,and he'll remain active academically because of the stimula-tion it provides. \"The collegiality and contact with peoplewho are pushing the frontiers of science\u2014that is a very goodfeeling,\" he says. But his voice takes on a tone of reverence when he speaks of his work in the clinical realm. \"Being able to make a difference in patients' lives,\" Cohen says, \"is a privilege.\" Michael Fitzsousa is director of communications in the medical school's Office of Institutional Planning and Communications.\"He doesn't go through the motions, but focuses entirely on each patient and he finds things that other doctors don't find.\" yale medicine win ter 200836 faculty Benjamin Bunney Erol Fikrig Robert Alpern Harlan their extra- and intracellular functioning.Disruptions of the dopamine sys-tem have been linked to schizo-phrenia, Parkinson's disease,attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and drug abuse. Much ofBunney's career was spent prob-ing the dopamine-schizophrenialink; and his work, combined with the contributions of others,helped lead to a new generationof antipsychotic drugs. Paul Greengard, ph.d ., the Vincent Astor Professor atRockefeller University, winner ofthe 2000 Nobel Prize in physi-ology or medicine for his dopamineresearch, a former professor ofpharmacology and psychiatry atYale and early collaborator withBunney, led off the day with a dis-cussion of his work. Greengard hasshown that dopamine and otherneurotransmitters can activate akey protein known as darpp -32, which in turn influences the func-tioning of nerve cells. At the end of the day, Bunney spoke modestly of his own career,calling every symposium speaker\"a pioneer in their own area.\" \"I'm going to miss being a sci- entist and I'm going to miss beingat Yale enormously,\" said Bunney.The audience responded withthunderous applause and a stand-ing ovation. \"You can never repayyour own mentors enough,\"Bunney said, \"but you can passalong what you've learned to the next generation.\"Retiring chair of psychiatry honored Measuring the legacy of a scientist with a 38-year career can takemany forms\u2014tallies of awards,peer-reviewed publications or cita-tions of papers. But to grasp hisimpact as a leader, colleague andmentor, one need look no furtherthan his students. On July 12, students and col- leagues of benjamin s. bunney, m.d. , the Charles B.G. Murphy Professor of Psychiatry and profes-sor of pharmacology and neurobi-ology, showed that Bunney'slegacy will live on at universitiesaround the world long after hisretirement from Yale this year. Bunney, known to colleagues as Steve, has spent 40 years atYale, the past 20 as chair of psy-chiatry. One of the world's leadingauthorities on the neurotransmit-ter dopamine, he has made funda-mental contributions to the studyof the regulation of dopamineneuronal systems and the effectsof antipsychotic drugs on thebrain. The July symposium inBunney's honor brought togetherstudents and colleagues who carryon the themes of his research. \"You can't mention the dopamine system without men-tioning his seminal work,\" saidTony Grace, ph.d ., the first gradu- ate student to work in Bunney'slab and now a professor of neuro-science, psychiatry and psychologyat the University of Pittsburgh.

Silverman said the school received 4,056 applicationsfor 100 slots, the highest number inthe school's history and a 9.7 percentjump over last year. As always, the Yale system remains a big attraction for incoming students.According to a survey Silverman con-ducted, students said it was theirmain reason for choosing Yale. Theyalso cited the school's reputation,research opportunities, the quality offaculty and students and the require-ment to write a research thesis. \"High school was very competitive,\" said George Hauser. \"I wanted to learnfor the sake of learning.\" above Forrester Lee helped Kofi-Buaku Atsina don his white coat at the annual ceremony inHarkness Auditorium. right Among the top reasons for choosing Yale, a survey of the 100 incoming studentsfound, were the Yale system, the school's repu-tation and the quality of faculty and students.above After the ceremony students posed for a group photograph outside the SterlingHall of Medicine.terry dagradi (3)\"I fell in love with the vibe,\" said Melanie Johncilla. \"The lack of compe-tition.

John A. Barrasso , m.d. ,hs '83, the new Republican U.S. senator from Wyoming,recalls that when he was a resident atYale from 1978 to 1983, his professorsstressed the importance of having aplan before going into surgery. \"Theywould tell us that if you don 't have aplan to begin with on how to solve theproblem, you'll have a much toughertime halfway though the operation,\" he said. This advice has served Barrasso well both as an orthopaedic surgeon and as apolitician and civic activist. Early in hiscareer, Barrasso's plan was to providehealth care for as many people as possi-ble inside and outside the operatingroom. That plan culminated on June 25,when he was appointed by Gov. DavidFreudenthal to ll the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the late Craig Thomas.\" Affordable and available health care is a big issue in Wyoming,\" he said. \"It's a rural state, and people are spread out.I want to help nd ways to get healthcare to them.\" As a medical student at Georgetown University, Barrasso was already think-ing about ways to broaden his impacton the public's health care needs. Hejoined the American Medical StudentAssociation, where he worked onissues related to preventive medicineand health care access. He produced television and radio reports and newspaper articles onhealth and tness for more than 20years, and served as the medical director of Wyoming Health Fairs, a series of programs on preventive medi-cine held across the state. He presentlywrites a monthly series of articles onpreventive health care for elders called\"Caring for Wyoming's Seniors.\" Hehas also served as a rodeo physicianfor the Professional Rodeo CowboysAssociation and as a sports team physi-cian for Casper College. In 2002 heran for a seat in the Wyoming StateSenate. \"I knew I could help patientsone-on-one in the ofce,\" he said, \"butI felt I could do more to help morepeople working legislatively.\" Barrasso, now 54, won the seat and was re-elected in 2006. His greatestaccomplishment as a state senator, hesaid, was co-sponsoring the HathawayScholarships program, which gives eli-gible students scholarship money toattend the University of Wyoming orany state community college. \"It wassponsored by two Republicans and twoDemocrats and ultimately was signedby a Democratic governor and namedfor Republican governor [StanleyHathaway],\" Barrasso said. \"It was thebest of bipartisan support for a worthypublic policy.\" An ongoing desire to broaden the scope of his influence compelledBarrasso to seek the vacant U.S. Senateseat. \"I wanted to do on the nationallevel what I had been doing on thestate level,\" he said, \"provide qualityeducation for kids, quality jobs forcommunities and health care accessi-bility for everyone.\" Gary E. Friedlaender, m.d., hs'74, the Wayne O. Southwick Professor andchair of orthopaedics, met Barrassoduring his training at Yale and hasstayed in touch over the years. WhatAs a resident in orthopaedic surgery at Yale, John Barrasso learned the importance of planning ahead, a lesson that has served himwell in medicine and politics. In 2002 theRepublican won a seat on Wyoming's state senate and last fall he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate. u.s.senate pho to studio41 The physiological and the psychological: how and men different Louann Brizendine '81, never sus- pected psychiatryrotation would lead to her becoming abest-selling author. Recalling that rota-tion, she said, \"I was stunned by thetwo-to-one female/male ratio. No oneknew why so many patients were suici-dally depressed women.\" Over the past 25 years Brizendine, director of the Women 's Mood andHormone Clinic at the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco ( ucsf ), has developed many theories aboutwomen 's psychological issues. Shenally explained them in The Female Brain (Morgan Road Books, 2006), which sold 80,000 copies in its rstfour months and has been translatedinto 18 languages. Brizendine believesthat \"the hormone of inti-macy,\" causes women to crave socialcontact far more often than men. Her interest in women 's mental health continued during a psychiatryresidency at Harvard and on into herprivate practice. Recruited by ucsf in 1988, Brizendine taught psychiatry.\"Then I got pregnant, and had all thepostpartum hormones,\" she said.\"Phases of a woman 's life were nolonger theoretical.\" She began working with ucsf neuroendocrinologists to explore whether fluctuating hormones couldtrigger women 's mood disorders. \" Aprogesterone metabolite the literature about hor-mones, estrogen and neurochemicalbrain changes in mammals. \" Animalmodels aren 't adequate\u2014you can 't aska mouse how its mood is today.\" Her new perspective led to an innovative course at ucsf in 1993, \"Hormones in Psychiatry,\" whichquickly evolved into her mood and hor-mone clinic. The clinic now treatsabout 600 women annually. Brizendine's research into hormones led her to a startling conclusion. \"It hitme like a lightning bolt\u2014testosteronecauses sexual desire. No one everthought the problem of frigidity mightbe biological! I started measuring testos-terone and correlating it with sexualinterest in females. Levels were oftenlow. Watching patients suffer, knowingother psychiatrists weren 't seeing it thesame way, I felt a passion to clarify biological aspects of women 's mentalhealth and hormonal issues,\" she said. Surprisingly, some patients wanted to stay on the antidepressant Prozac, even though one of its side effects isdecreased libido. They were choosingbetter moods over better sex. In earlyProzac trials, manufacturer Eli Lillyand Company had found (but not pub-licized) women 's orgasmic difculties.\"Female sexual problems are treated as just ho-hum,\" Brizendine said, \"buterection or ejaculation problems aretreated as a medical emergency.\" Her book's provocative claims\u2014 including the contention that oxytocingives females so much pleasure thatthey crave connections like gossip withfriends to get that \"rush \"\u2014are criticizedcharacterized Barrasso as a resident, he said, was his \"strong intellect andhighly capable technical skills. As ahouse ofcer, he was a great physicianwho had compassion, commitmentand ethical moral character.\" Barrasso says he supports \"lower taxes, less spending, traditional familyvalues, local control and a strongnational defense.\" In the state senatehe received an \" A \" rating from theNational Rifle Association, voted forprayer in schools, voted against gaymarriage and sponsored legislation toprotect the sanctity of life. \"In today's world, his views would earn him a conservative label,\"Friedlaender said, \"but John is notinured to the needs of people, espe-cially in terms of health care. I woulddescribe his politics as thoughtful.\" In his new job as a U.S. senator, Barrasso serves on the Senate Energyand Natural Resources Committee, the Environment and Public WorksCommittee and the Indian AffairsCommittee. The senate seat Barrasso filled doesn 't come up for re-election until2012, but Barrasso must run as the incumbent in a special electionduring the 2008 general election. Friedlaender calls Barrasso's ability to combine a health care mindset withhis political skills a \"powerful part-nership. He'll do more with it than theaverage individual,\" he predicted. \u2014 Jennifer Kaylin yale medicine win ter 200842 alumni faces for exaggerating gender differences or oversimplifying research. Some socialscientists say her unflattering, dubiouspresentation of female behaviors weakens crusades for equal pay andopportunities. Other colleagues remain unruffled. Bruce McEwen, ph.d. , head the of Neuroendocrinology atRockefeller University, conrmed differences inbrain and behavior. \"Sex hormonesand experiences interact over the entirelifespan and alter brain structure andfunction in both men and women.Brizendine perhaps has not empha-sized [these ongoing interactions] asmuch as she might have.\" He appreciates Brizendine's efforts to \"elucidate biological bases of howmany men and women behave. Whethershe's contributed to more prejudice, inspite of the best intentions to educate... is to me the almost inevitable priceof writing about this topic.\" Brizendine, ruefully aware of the controversies, had aimed to precludethem. In a mass-market book, she dis-covered, \"you can 't go into details ofhow and where a study was done. Iwrote a more sophisticated section forpeople in science, so that anyone want-ing to know more could go to those 45pages of notes at the back.\" However,determined to shorten the length of The Female Brain , the publisher deleted all of Brizendine's painstaking explana-tory notes during nal editing. How does she endure the negative reactions? \"I just breathe deeply,\"Brizendine said. \"Some days, I needovaries of steel.\" \u2014 Carol MilanoPolicy expert finds answers to large health problems comefrom diverse teams In the 30 years that Darryl E. Crompton , j.d.,m.p.h . '76, has worked as a public health lawyer, nothing prepared him for the moment he held a 4-month-oldSouth African girl dying of aids . As she wheezed and shivered in his arms,all he could think about was how gov-ernments, nonprot organizations andreligious groups had failed her and the nearly 1 million other aids orphans in Africa. \"This was the rst time I had held someone who was dying,\" Cromptonsaid. \"It made me more sensitive and committed to make a contribu-tion to social change related to aids and poverty.\" Crompton spent a month in South Africa in 2005 as a consultant for thehumanitarian organization chf Inter- national. His assignment was to deter-mine how well the country's socialinfrastructure supports aids orphans, some of whom have aids themselves. South Africa was one of many stops on a professional journey dedicated to improving the health of the poor and uninsured, especially children.Crompton, who received his law degreefrom the University of California, Davis,and his master's degree in public healthfrom Yale, has taught health law, policyand bioethics at the University ofAlabama; trained Siberian physicians inhealth care policy; and studied pediatricpatients' rights in Scotland, Englandand Denmark. He is now director of the Institute for International PublicPolicy of the United Negro CollegeFund Special Programs Corporation in Louann Brizendine believes that psychological differences between men and women have theirroots in physiological differences.

He is also a lawyer and policy, management and organi-zation development consultant inWashington. Crompton became sensitized to the plight of the poor as a boy. His parentswanted their children to have a multi-cultural education, so when Cromptonwas 11, the family left their home in LosAngeles to spend a year in Morocco. \"Isaw other 11-year-old children who haddropped out of school and were workingin various and sundry jobs,\" he said.\"People were living in mud huts withno running water.\" Crompton 's father worked as an architect, a profession that provided thefamily with opportunities for international travel. Their next movewas to Copenhagen, where Cromptonexperienced socialized medicine for the rst time. When he or members ofhis family got sick, they received high-quality health care\u2014for free. Growing up in the political crucible of the civil rights movement and theVietnam War, Crompton knew hewanted to contribute to social change.He considered becoming a dentistbecause of his interest in science, butinstead chose a career in public healthand health policy. \"When I looked athow I could make a contribution tosocial change in health, it wasn 'tthrough the practice of medicine, onepatient at a time, but through publicpolicy,\" he said. After graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles, he decided tostudy law. As a law student Cromptontook courses in public health. Thoseclasses, combined with an internship inthe Washington ofce of U.S. Rep.Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, a Democratfrom Los Angeles, convinced him to work for an m.p.h . as well. At Yale, Crompton was pleasantly surprised by the varied backgrounds ofhis classmates. \"We had teachers, musi-cians, nuns, priests, mathematicians,people with philosophy backgrounds. It was very exciting for me.\" In fact, that multifaceted learning environment informs his approach topublic health to this day. \"I don 't have a magic bullet, but I know the only way you can achieve transformationalchange is through interdisciplinaryteams of people.\" He notes that if apatient with hivor aids is homeless or can 't afford food, antiretroviral drugsalone aren 't going to offer much help. Crompton saw the complexity of health issues when he was hired in1988 by the Florida commissioner ofeducation to evaluate drug preventionprograms for adolescents. \"There arelots of drug and alcohol preventionmodels, but basically very few are effec-tive,\" he said. \"It's an example of theinterconnection between public healthcare and a whole range of broadersocial, political and cultural issues.\" Crompton is also interested in diver- sity of another sort. There should bemore diversity and minority representa-tion in health care, he says. He wouldlike medical and public health schools,such as Yale's, to identify, nurture andsupport talented minority middle andhigh school students to prepare themfor careers in public health. It's all part of his lifelong goal of pro- viding universal access to health care. \"I don 't see a lot of caring in the healthcare system,\" he said. \"How can weimprove the caring part of health care?\" \u2014 Lori Ann Brass Darryl Crompton first thought of becoming a dentist, but chose public health policy as acareer in order to contribute to social change.His ultimate goal is to see universal access to health care. tom radcli ffeyale medicine win ter 200844 alumni notes Cargill Alleyne Jr .

'35,hs'37, attending morn- ing report, reading journal arti-cles in the library and going tointernal medicine grand rounds.Retired since 1982, Kushlan, now95, still drives almost every dayto the hospital where he hasworked for 70 years and contin-ues to be a role model foryounger colleagues. Kushlan has received many honors throughout his distin-guished career. In November hereceived the 2007 Yale Medal in recognition for his years ofleadership. The medal, the high-est award bestowed by theAssociation of Yale Alumni, isgiven annually to five alumni in honor of outstanding serviceto the medical school and theuniversity. Born in New Britain, Conn., in 1912, Kushlan was so inspiredby his local doctor that by theage of 10 he knew he wanted tobe a physician. After graduat-ing from the School of Medicine,he completed his residency at what was then New HavenHospital, earning a salary of $25 a month. \"Medicine wasvery primitive 70 years ago,\"he recalled. His main diagnostictools were taking a medical history and doing a physicalexam\u2014X-rays were the onlyimaging technique available;and in medicationsare listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference . Except for a brief stint at Harvard in 1938, Kushlan spenthis entire career at Yale. He established the first endoscopyclinic in Connecticut in 1942 andwas the sole member of the gas-troenterology section from 1938until 1955. From 1967 until his retire- ment, Kushlan served as theassociate physician-in-chief atYale-New Haven Hospital and asa clinical professor of medicine.When he retired, one of the hos-pital's medical services wasnamed for him, although he saidhe feels out of place among theother legendary physicians\u2014Elisha Atkins, m.d .; John P . Peters, m.d .; Gerald Klatskin, m.d .; Allan Goodyer, m.d .; and Robert Donaldson, m.d .\u2014with whom he shares this honor. Although he says he does more learning than teachingthese days, Kushlan still has somewisdom to impart from the dayswhen the practice of medicinerelied more on observation thanon diagnostic tests. He advisescolleagues to use such simplediagnostic methods as having apatient with back pain lie downto determine its source: if thepain goes away, it's muscular; if itdoesn't, it's internal. \"I sort of tossin a pearl from time to time topay my way,\" he said. In addition to his activities at the hospital and the lectures and concerts he regularly attendswith Ethel, his wife of 73 years,Kushlan also remains an activemember of the executive com-mittee of the Association of YaleAlumni in Medicine. \"I enjoy theopportunity to be busy,\" he said. harold shapi ro45 Stephen Vindigni Andrea Humphrey send alumni news to Claire M.

Five years later, adjusting to the 80-hour week In July 2003, when the national council overseeing medical education limited residents' work hours to no more than 80 per week, medical school faculty and hospital staff around the country saw the intervention as a mixed blessing [See\"Recreating the Residency,\" Fall/Winter 2004]. On the onehand, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educationwas responding to public fears that overworked residentsmight make poor medical decisions; on the other hand, fewerhours on duty carry the risk of less continuity of care. At the School of Medicine, balancing these two con- cerns has called for flexibility. \"We've had to adapt continually,and we're still adapting,\" said Rosemarie L. Fisher, m.d.,hs'75, associate dean for graduate medical education. Peter N.Herbert, m.d. '67, chief of staff and senior vice president for medical affairs at Yale-New Haven Hospital, acknowledgedthat sticking to an 80-hour week has been difficult for someprograms, particularly those in intensive care units. The hospi-tal has redistributed the workload by taking on more physi-cian assistants and advanced-practice registered nurses. Still,some faculty and administrators worry that residents may feelobliged to do as much work as before\u2014as much consultingwith patients, analyzing as many lab results\u2014in fewer hours.Fisher looks to further fine-tuning of the regulations\u2014forinstance, pilot programs that incorporate a mandated restperiod\u2014to address this potential problem. In response to the new work rules, some specialties have created more positions for residents: neurosurgery, forexample, has expanded from six residency positions to 12. Evenin the midst of a long in-hospital shift, evidence of the newrulings is apparent. Areas have been set aside for residents torest undisturbed, and such arrangements have \"probablyworked out better for everyone\" than the marathon-like condi-tions that prevailed earlier, said Herbert. \"I think the system as a whole has acclimated very well.\" \u2014Sandra J.

Theschool quickly outgrew the facili-ties offered by these premises, andabout 1890 an additional structurewas erected in the rear of the build-ing. As the growth of the schoolcontinues, new facilities wereacquired, including the Anthony N.Brady Memorial Laboratory (1917),and the original building was usedentirely for anatomy. \"The building at 150 York Street was occupied by the school until1922 and will be remembered bymany alumni as the original medi-cal school building. Although it wasno longer a part of the school, thebuilding continued to stand untilDecember of 1957, when it wasdemolished as part of the city's OakStreet Redevelopment Project.\"School's Building Projects Earn Recognition \u2014Yale Medicine Spring 1983 \"Two recent School of Medicine building projects have receivedawards. The New Haven Preser-vation Trust presented a MeritAward to the School for its sensi-tive rehabilitation and creativereuse of the historic Jane EllenHope Building. The oldest buildingon the School's campus, the redbrick and rough stone building wasbuilt in 1902 as a clinic building.Renovations by architectsAlexander Purves and Allan DeharAssociates for its use as a teachingfacility were completed last fall. \"First prize for excellence in consulting engineering in the cate-gory of mechanical and electricaldesign was awarded the School bythe New York Association ofConsulting Engineers for fosteringexcellence in engineering of itsnew chilled water thermal storagesystem.

Hamilton, ph.d. , is asking faculty and other leaders on campus for their ideas on the best use of the property\u2014the 136-acre former BayerHealthCare complex that straddles the neighboring towns of WestHaven and Orange. Its 17 buildings have 1.5 million square feet ofspace for laboratories, offices and storage. In comparison, themedical school campus occupies 2.5 million square feet. \"There will be a focus on a number of different areas for planning,\" Hamilton said. \"The first, of course, is science. The number one priority for the university at West Campus is theopportunity that it gives us to do things in biomedical sciencethat we have not been able to do for lack of space.\" Other ideas under consideration include using the space for storage; displays of collections belonging to university museums,galleries and libraries; and outreach programs to local schools. \"Planning is for the long-term integration of the West Campus into the life\u2014scholarly, scientific and medical\u2014of YaleUniversity,\" Hamilton said. \"It is not going to be an overflow cam-pus. It is not going to be a place where we put things that don'tfit at the university.\" \u2014 John Curtisend note Yale's new West Campus includes 550,000 square feet of laboratory space for both biological and chemical research. Medicalresearch is a high priority for use of the new campus.robe rt lis ak (2)yalemedicine 300 george street, suite 773, new haven ct 06511 yalemedicine.yale.edu winter 2008Non-Profit Org. U.S. "}
