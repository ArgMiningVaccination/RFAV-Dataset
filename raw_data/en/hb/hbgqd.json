OKLAHOMA State Plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund U.S. Department of Education Issued: April 21, 2021 OMB Number: 1810- 0754 Expiration Date: October 31, 2021 2 Introduction The American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief ( \"ARP ESSER \") Fund, authorized under the American Rescue Plan (\"ARP\") Act of 2021, provides nearly $122 billion to States to support the Nation's schools in safely reopening and sustaining safe operations of schools while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (\" COVID -19\") pandemic. It is particul arly important that ARP ESSER funding will enable States and local educational agencies ( \"LEAs \"), and more directly schools, to support students who have been most severely impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic and are likely to have suffered the most because of longstanding inequities in our communities and schools that have been exacerbated by the COVID- 19 pandemic. The U.S. Department of Education ( \"Department \") is committed to working in partnership with States so that these unprecedented resources are quickly put to work to ensure students have sustained access to in -person instruction and that the resources are used to provide the effective support students need as they persist through and recover from the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. The thoughtful and timely use of these funds will have a lasting impact on our Nation's schools and help to address the inequities in resources, services, and opportunities available to our students. This template presents an opportunity for States to share their plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds with the public. The Department must approve a State educational agency's (\"SEA's \") plan in order to make the State's remaining ARP ESSER allocation availa ble for use. Please note that the Department intends to issue ARP ESSER reporting requirements separately. Instructions Each SEA must provide descriptions and other information that address each requirement listed below. An SEA may use this template or another format as long as every item and element is addressed in the SEA's response . Throughout this document, questions that refer to an SEA's ARP ESSER funding are referencing the total allocation to be received by the SEA , including that which it allocates to its LEAs. Each SEA must submit to the Department by June 7, 2021, either: (1) its ARP ESSER plan or (2) the S tate requirements that preclude submission of the plan by that date and a date by which it will be able to submit its complete ARP ESSER plan . To submit the SEA's plan , please email the plan to your Program Officer at [State] .OESE @ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov ). In order to ensure transparency, the Department will post each plan on the Department's website when it is received and will indicate each plan's approval status . This template also allows States to fulfill the requirement of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (\"CRRSA\") Act ESSER II 6-month reporting requirement in section 313(f) of the CRRSA Act. 3 Cover Page Grantee and Contact Information ARP ESSER PR Award Number (e.g ., S425U2100XX): S425U210024 SEA (405) 522- 3520 Email address: Carolyn.Thompson@sde.ok.gov By signing this document, I agree to each of the assurances listed in Appendix C and further assure that: To the best of my knowledge and belief, all information and data included in this plan are true and correct. Chief State School Officer or Authorized Representative (Printed Name) Joy L. Hofmeister Signature of Authorized SEA Representative Date: 6/7/2021 4 A. Describing the State's Current Status and Needs The Department recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by States, LEAs, and educators to support students during the COVID -19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARP ES SER funding decisions, and their current and projected operating status. 1. Progress and Promising Practices : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 strategies that have been most effective in supporting the needs of students in your State during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially for students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Please include, if applicable, how your State will submit and encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs . Continuity of Instruction al Services . After a temporary two-week cessation of all school operations and instructional services , from March 16 to April 5, 2020, t he Oklahoma State Board of Education (OSBE) took action on March 25, 2020, to continue instructional services throughout the remainder of the school year. In return for LEAs submitting assurances of continued instructional delivery and other assurances, the OSBE granted LEAs flexibilities from a number of operational requirement s that were otherwise applicable outside of the time of declared emergency. Further, anticipating Oklahoma LEAs would be providing full -time or hybrid virtual instruction during the 2020- 21 school year, the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE or SEA) and OSBE established requirements for virtual delivery of instruction during the continuing declaration of emergency related to COVID -19. While anticipating disruptions and hybrid schedules, the OSDE de signed Oklahoma School Safety Protocols for schools, which were voted on by the OSBE on July 25, 2020. Developed in collaboration with public health officials , OSBE members and other stakeholder input, these recommendations were aligned with the Oklahoma State Department of Health's (OSDH) weekly COVID- 19 Alert System and reflected a tiered approach to reopening schools as safely as possible. Both the OSDE and OSDH systems were based on a color -coded sys tem that graduates in recommended protocols and safeguards - from Green to Yellow, Orange and Red - as community spread of coronavirus increased in each of Oklahoma's 77 counties. Color categories assigned to counties changed on a weekly basis to reflect m itigation or escalation in community spread of COVID -19. Counties experienced a cycling back and forth among designations as public health indicators improved or worsened. While these protocols were not required, a large number of districts across the stat e adopted them as their own and followed them throughout the 2020- 21 school year. Beginning with the opening of the 2020- 21 school year, the SEA continued to lead by pivoting to model guidance and advisories. Knowing Oklahomans value the principle of local control - and with that value codified in state law - often the best approach to influencing behavior is strong, well -vetted guidance. Here , the OSDE unveiled Return to Learn Oklahoma: A Framework for Reopening School . Built with significant input from state and national health officials and various education stakeholders, Return to Learn was a framework with considerations district and school leaders utilized as they planned 5 for a challenging 2020- 21 school year. Districts leveraged the considerations in the OSDE's Return to Learn plan to craft their own plans for safely conducting school in the 2020- 21 school year. As the nation and world learned more about COVID -19 and the many issues surrounding it, the Return to Lear n guidance and the planning of districts evolved throughout the summer and fall of 2020. Continuity of C hild Nutrition Services . In Oklahoma , where 1 in 5 children suffers food insecurity and nearly 60% of all students qualify as eligible for f ree- or reduced - price lunch, schools have consistently ensure d students had access to meals throughout the pandemic. Utilizing flexibilities provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oklahoma program sites served more than 1.7 million meals to students in a nine -day period during the cessation of school operati ons in late March 2020. Additionally, these sites served 13.4 million meals in summer 2020 compared to 1.6 million the year before. During periods of school closures, s chool districts used buses to deliver meals and instructional materials to student homes and bus stops statewide . Schools also provided grab-and-go meals for students and families at the school site. Continuity of Communication and Information Sharing . Throughout the course of the pandemic, the OSDE provided, and regularly updated, a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and held weekly virtual meetings with LEAs to listen and help guide districts as they made decisions to keep school communities safe and operational . To keep school communities safe and share information with stakeholders , the OSDE worked closely with officia ls of the OSDH and school districts to devise an easy- to-use COVID- 19 reporting tool for districts to report the numbers of positive cases , close contacts, quarantines and COVID -19 test results in their schools to OSDH daily . The reporting tool, which went online at the start of January 2021, resulted from weekly meetings of the OSDE and OS DH leadership. Prior to developing the reporting tool and continuing through its use to date, the OSDE, OSDH and the Office of the Attorney General looked to current Oklahoma laws and existing USDE guidance regarding privacy protections to ensure the disclosure of inform ation wa s limited and only to the extent necessary under the circumstances. As an additional measure of information sharing and understanding, the OSDE will require districts to make periodic repo rts regarding the impact of disruptions created by COVID- 19 and planned uses of ESSER funds. In carrying out these obligations, the OSDE will cr eate a template for schools and districts to submi t best practices and lessons learned through a portal and/or to the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse. The OSDE will make this information available in its weekly newsletter and bi -weekly \"all -district\" calls. Additionally, the OSDE's Office of School Support will work across the agency to collect ideas fro m the field through TeleEDGE (virtual professional development through case -based, real -time learning) , administrator panels and other stakeholder groups in order to contact schools and districts to encourage and assist in submission. 2. Overall Priorities : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 issues currently facing students and schools across your S tate as a result of or in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic including, to the extent possible, data illustrating why these are the most critical and/or most widespread issues facing schools and students. 6 Many Oklahoma students experienced disruptions to learning due to loss of face -to-face instruction . Some school districts did not offer in- person instruction until the second semester of the school year ; other s that offer ed in -person instruction were forced to alternate between in -person and distance learning due to large numbers of students and staff impacted by COVID. The loss of face -to-face instruction made it difficult for some students to make expected academic gains . In many cases, teachers were un able to maintain traditional pacing guide schedules , causing students to lack exposure to essential concepts that serve as building blocks in subsequent years. Teachers will be faced with addressing more pronounced student learning gaps between students who were able to keep pace ( or even excel ) during the pandemic and those who had little interaction with teachers or struggled to learn in a hybrid environment. Even students who attended school in person in 2020- 21 experienced interrupted learning due to quarantines and the toll of social -emotional stress brought on by the pandemic . The upcoming school year will likely be particularly challenging for both veteran and new teachers , requiring all teachers - including pre -service teachers - to reimagine their roles . It will be critical to match those who have expertise in virtual instruction with those who need professional development that emphasizes student engagement in a virtual setting . Additionally, focusing on a team approach when meeting students' needs will be important , beginning with team meetings to ensure collective understanding of student data to accurately assess students' status and to inform future instruction. Many students are facing a multitude of traumatic stressors resulting from the pandemic - the illness or loss of friends or family, c hild abuse and neglect, food and income insecurities and more. It is more important than ever to remember that students must \"Maslow before they can Bloom.\" This means that their basic needs - including food, rest, emotional safety and sense of belonging - must be met before effective learning can occur. This hierarchy of needs applies equally to adults in the school setting. Social and emotional learning (SEL) and mental health are strengthened with a combined approach of building relationships with students and caring for the well -being of everyone in the school community during summer programming and the traditional school year. SEL helps support student mental health needs by fostering a sense of safety and security, building positive relationships with others and providing equitable support to learning. The combined impact is a strengthened school community. Unfortunately, Oklahoma students and families faced higher incidences of crises during the COVID -19 pandemic. According to the Oklahoma Department o f Mental Health and Subs tance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS), the state saw the following results regarding children and youth: o 35% increase in calls to ODMHSAS from l aw enforcement o 30% decrease in calls to ODMHSAS from the state D epartment of H uman Services (indicating a lower level of reporting/oversite due to closure of school buildings) o 15% increase in family conflict as the precipitating event leading to the initial call o Increases in mental health -related emergency department visits among children under the age of 18 beginning in March 2020: Increase of 24% among children ages 5- 11 Increase of 31% among adolescents ages 12 -17 7 3. Identifying Needs of Underserved Students : Describe your State's 2-3 highest priority academic, social, emotional, and/or mental health needs for the re mainder of the 2020- 2021 school year (if applicable) and for the 2021- 2022 school year related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on each of the following student groups : i. Students from low -income families, ii. Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity ), iii. Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender) , iv. English learners, v. Children with disabilities (including infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( \"IDEA \")), vi. Students experiencing homelessness, vii. Children and youth in foster care , viii. Migratory students , and ix. Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , and LGBTQ + students ). To the extent possible, this description should include data on indicators such as estimates of the academic impact of lost instructional time , 1 chronic absenteeism, student engagement , and social -emotional well- being. Complete the table below , adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Table A 1. Student group Highest priority needs Students from low -income families The OSDE will be better equipped to respond to this question once data from state and federally required testing can be analyzed. Perhaps unlike other states, Oklahoma expects to have sufficient participation in the assessments such that the data they yield should provide useful information regarding current and future needs. 1 For the purposes of the plan, \"academic impact of lost instructional time \" refers to \"learning loss\" experienced by students as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act . 8 Student group Highest priority needs Students from each racial or ethnic background used by the State for reporting purposes - please add a row for each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race/ethnicity ) The OSDE will be better equipped to respond to this question once data from state and federally required testing can be analyzed.

Perhaps unlike other states, Oklahoma expects to have sufficient participation in the assessments such that the data they yield should provide useful information regarding current and future needs. 4. Understanding the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on student learning and student well -being, including identifying the groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. Where possible, please identify the data sources the SEA will sug gest its LEAs use in thoughtfully diagnosing areas of need, including data on the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of lost instructional time . Impact on Student Learning. Beginning in July 2021, the OSDE will provide LEAs with a fre e Early Learning Inventory Assessment tool to be utilized the first 30 days of school for kindergarten and grade 1 students . This tool will enable educators and families to determine the needs of students in areas such as reading and mathematics in the earliest grades. A companion virtual professional development module will provide training on use of the tool. The OSDE recommend s that districts continue to utilize beginning, middle and end- of- year reading sufficiency screening tools to determine if and how students are meeting grade -level benchmarks for reading in grades K -3. The OSDE will develop suggested models and templates to support local analysis efforts using large -scale assessment data tied to potential contextual or conditional data. For example, the state can conduct initial examinations of participation rate s by student group, school , district and state to help flag potential areas of non- repres entation to which LEAs should attend. In cases where missing data may yield non- representative 10 participation, it will be particularly important for LEAs to examine alternative sources of data available through both statewide and local collections. Additionally, the state can help support collaboration across LEAs that have similar participation rates, demographic compositions or performance trends to promote the sharing of best practice s. To support English learner (EL) equity in the classroom and equip teachers with the tools necessary to ensure EL student success, the OSDE will focus on three LEA main initiatives in the 2021 -22 school year: o First, the agency has clarified the state EL identification process to ensure all EL students are identified and receiving the appropriate classroom supports. This initiative includes printed guidance as we ll as live and stand -alone support webinars for LEA and relevant state staff to ensure compliance in the EL identification process. o Second, the OSDE is developing a series of professional development modules to examine the recently released WIDA ELD (Engl ish Language Development) standards. This initiative will explore how the WIDA standards align with state content standards and can be leveraged to increase EL access to learning. o Finally, the OSDE is developing a professional learning and support initiat ive focused on assisting smaller, rural LEAs in developing effective EL intervention strategies and processes. This initiative will focus on best practices when primary instruction is expected to address both English language development and student acquis ition of standards -based content, effective use of EL -specific assessment data and administrative support. Impact on Student Well -Being. The OSDE will launch new Social & Emotional Learning Competencies (PK -grade 12 and adult) in summer 2021. These competenci es are based on the Collaborative for Academic, Social & Emotional Learning (CASEL) five evidence -based competencies: self -awareness , self -management , responsi ble decision -making, relationship skills and social awareness. This competencies guide is accompanied by two implementation guides (one for PK -grade 5, the other for grades 6- 12 and adult ) and consists of strategies, benchmarks and relationship to the Oklahoma Academic Standards. Initial roll -out and training will be provided during the OSDE's free summer professional learning conference, EngageOK, in June 2020. The OSDE's Office of Student Support has developed a tool that allows LEAs to quickly scan the differences among evidence -based SEL screeners. Links are provided to the screeners so that LEAs do not have to search for information on each screener, but have easy access with a graphic organizer to take notes and determine which screener best meets the needs of their students. A draft of the tool is available here . The OSDE has launch ed a School Counselor Corps grant to allow LEAs to apply for funding to increase the number of school counselors , licensed mental health professionals , licensed recreational therapists and/or mental health contract services . The grant application opened on May 26, 2021, and will close on June 11, 2021. Schools will be notified of funding by July 1, 2021, in order to conduct interviews and onboard these new staff members prior to the start of the 2021- 22 school year . The School Counselor Corps grant will assist school districts in lowering the student- to- school counselor ratio. Research indicates that lower student -to-counselor ratios result in better student outcomes. The American School Counselor Association- recommen ded student -to-counselor ratio is 250:1. Currently, Oklahoma's average student -to-school 11 counselor ratio is 411:1. Additional school counselors and school -based mental health professionals can also assist with student needs caused by the high incidence of childhood trauma in Oklahoma and the impact of the pandemic on students. Additionally, t he OSDE will employ five student s upport s pecialists to provide training, technical assistance and coaching to all counselors hired under th is initiative and any other counselors w ishing to attend. Trainings will be provided to these new employees in order to best meet the academic, college and career, and social and emotional needs of students. Data will be collected at each LEA that was awarded a grant in order to determine effectivenes s of the initiative. 5. School Operating Status : It is essential to have data on how students are learning in order to support the goals of access and equity, especially for student groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Des cribe the current status of data collection on operational status and mode of instruction of all schools in your State . This description must include: i. A description of to what extent, and how frequently, the State collects now and will collect in the future data for all schools in your State on: a. Mode of instruction: The number of schools in your State that are offering fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid model); and/or full-time in -person instruction; b. Enrollment: Student enrollment for all students and disaggre gated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of instruction; and c. Attendance: Student attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of instruction. The OSDE collects student -level information daily from schools' student information systems (SIS). Data codes that correspond to modes of instruction (i.e., distance, virtual, blended) were first implemented in fall 2020 and are undergoing reviews for validity at the time of submission of this plan. Therefore, the OSDE can off er only a preliminary understanding of mode of instruction data at this time until final certification of the Annual Statistical Report (ASR) on June 30, 2021. Following district completion and certification of the ASR, the OSDE will be able to provide specific information about these markers with greater confidence. This data will not be complete, certified and ready for publication until fall 2021. I n advance of school year 2021- 22, the OSDE will further support schools in creating calendars in their SIS that reflect their various instructional modalities, and further encourage s chools to utilize student -level attendance codes , collected daily , that correspond to students' current mode of instruction. Mode of I nstruction . Of the Oklahoma public schools from which student data has been collected to date for school year 2020- 21, the OSDE can provide the following school - level data: 12 o Virtual. Seven Oklahoma public schools exclusively offered instruction that was fully online for the entirety of the 2020- 21 school year. All seven of these schools are Statewide Virtual Charter School s and regularly conduct all instruction virtually. As of April 1, 2021, all but one non- statewide virtual charter school had provided students and families with an in- person instructional del ivery option for the 2020- 21 school year. o Virtual, Blended and In -Person. A total of 1,677 of 1,783 Oklahoma public school sites offered virtual, in -person or blended (some in- person and some virtual) instruction . 359 Oklahoma public schools offered all four learning environments (blended, distance, virtual and traditional in- person) at some point during the 2020- 21 school year . o 84 schools offered only a traditional in -person mode of instruction during the 2020- 21 school year . o NOTE: Data reflects what has been p reliminarily reported to date and should not be considered complete or comprehensive. Enrollment . Due to COVID -19 learning disruptions , most schools and student information system (SIS) vendors lagged in their ability to adopt the OSDE's new, desired (i.e., not required) learning environment, enrollment and attendance codes during the first quarter of SY 2020- 21. Although the data qualit y improved over time, waves of student quarantine s and isolations statewide resulted in thousands of students being moved - in the local SIS - from one learning environment (e.g., virtual) to an on- site, in- person learning environment or the opposite without a concomitant update to their enrollment to reflect this change. These student -level data quality issues prevent disaggregat ion of each ins tructional mode by the desired student groups at this time . Completion and certification of the ASR will allow the OSDE to further examine student- level data and disaggregate by student group, when practicable. Attendance . At this time, the OSDE cannot provide student -level attendance data for each mode of instruction for each student group, but final certification of the ASR should allow for greater accuracy of student -level attendance and learning environment data. The OSDE is optimistic that fu rther emphasis on these optional attendance data codes will result in better daily data submissions from school data officials and SIS vendors. Recognizing this, the OSDE will support school leaders in reviewing student -level attendance data and absenteeis m rates. Focusing on students with high absenteeism rates and exploring these students' learning environments in SY 2020- 21 may allow for engagement strategies and other supports that are tailored to each learner. o NOTE: Data reflects what has been prelimin arily reported to date and should not be considered complete or comprehensive. ii. The data described in A. 5.i.a. and b. using the template in Appendix A (and to the extent available, the data described in A.5.i. c.) for the most recent time period available . Please note that this data can be submitted separately within 14 calendar days after a State submits this plan. The SEA must also make this data publicly available on its website as soon as possible but no later than June 21, 2021, and 13 regularly provide updated available information on its website. The Department will periodically review data listed i n A.5.i on SEA websites . The OSDE collects student -level information daily from schools' student information systems (SIS). With the onset of the pandemic and knowing disruptions would continue through the 2020- 21 school year, t he OSDE created data codes to correspond to modes of instruction (i.e., distance, virtual, blended). At this time, as is true with other data sets, these data points are u ndergoing reviews for validity and reliability . The OSDE does, however, ha ve an initial understanding of the number of Oklahoma public schools in the 2020- 21 school year that offered fully remote or online -only instruction, both remote/online and in- person (hybrid, or what the OSDE has in -person instruction. Once schools certify their Annual Statistical Report, the OSDE will have a higher degree of confidence in analyzing and reporting the number of schools that offered various modes of instruction, as well as data specific to enrollment and attendance. iii. To the extent available, a de scription of the planned operational status and mode of instruction for the State and its LEAs for Summer 2021 and for the 2021 -2022 school year. Given that the vast majority of LEAs in Oklahoma provided some form of in- person instruction for students ( whether full -time, on an A/B schedule or for certain student populations such as students with disabilities) in the 2020- 21 school year, the OSDE expects that all districts will provide in -person instruction in summer 2021 and full -time in-person instruction in the 2021- 22 school year. B. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining their Safe Operations The Department recognizes that safely reopening schools and sustaining their safe operations to maximize in -person in struction is essential for student learning and student well -being, and especially for being able to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID -19 pandemic . In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in this vital area. 1. Support for LEAs : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in safely returning to in- person instruction and sustaining the safe operation of schools . This description must include : i. How the SEA will support its LEAs implementing , to the greatest extent practicable, prevention and mitigation policies in line with the most up- to-date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( \"CDC \") for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff ; 14 Complete the table below, adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Table B1. Mitigation strate gy SEA response Universal and correct wearing of masks Beginning July 1, 2021, Oklahoma Senate Bill 658 prohibits a school district from implementing a mask mandate unless the district is under a current state of emergency declared by the Governor. As of May 4, 2021, such emergency order has expired. Prior to this law, mask -wearing was a decision left to local school boards and in accordance with established health guidance and protocols . As a result, the OSDE regularly encouraged and shared information regarding the need for universal and correct wearing of masks. (ex: OSDE's Return to Learn guidance , School Safety Protocols, FAQs , weekly Zoom ca lls with school administrators statewide, OSDE social media platforms , etc. ). Physical distancing ( e.g., including use of cohorts/podding) While physical distancing is a decision left to local school boards, the OSDE has regularly encouraged and shared information regarding the need for physical distancing. (ex: OSDE Return to Learn guidance, School Safety Protocols, FAQs, weekly Zoom calls with school administrators statewide , OSDE social media platforms ). Handw ashing and respiratory etiquette While issues of handwashing and 15 Mitigation strate gy SEA response respiratory etiquette are decision s left to local school boards, the OSDE has regularly encouraged and shared information regarding the need for these important safeguards. (ex: OSDE Return to Learn guidance FAQs , weekly Zoom calls with school administrators statewide, OSDE social media platforms ). Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation While issues of cleaning and maintaining health y facilities are decision s left to local school boards, the OSDE has regularly encouraged and shared information regarding the need for these important safeguards. (ex: OSDE Return to Learn guidance , FAQs , weekly Zoom calls with school administrators statewide , OSDE social media platforms ). Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments The Oklahoma State Department of Health and its county offices coordinated contact tracing with school districts, although the OSDE provided how -to information on contact tracing through the Return to Learn guidance , FAQs, and other routine OSDE communications platforms. Further, the OSDE worked with OSDH to coordinate and establish guidance concerning quarantine responsibilities, duties and authority of public health authorities with respect to students and school personnel. 16 Mitigation strate gy SEA response Diagnostic and screening testing While diagnostic and screening testing programs are decision s left to local school boards, the OSDE has regularly encouraged and shared information regarding the need for these important safeguards. (ex: OSDE Return to Learn guidance, weekly Zoom calls with scho ol administrators statewide ). The OSDE has assisted in connecting LEAs with state and local health departments that have helped many set up such programs . The COVID -19 Reporting Tool, developed by the OSDE in conjunction with the Oklahoma State Department of Health, facilitates reporting of test results to necessary healthcare entities. Efforts to provide vaccinations to educators , other staff, and students, if eligible The OSDE worked with Oklahoma's Governor and other state officials in stressing the need for teachers to be prioritized in the order of vaccine availability. On Dec . 17, 2020, the Governor announced that teachers could receive the vaccine in Phase 2 of the vaccine roll - out; the OSDE shared this information with LEAs through its regular communications . On Feb. 22, 2021, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister and Oklahoma Teacher of the Year finalists promoted teacher vaccinations in a high- profile news conference that coincide d 17 Mitigation strate gy SEA response with the first week of teacher vaccinations. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to the health an d safety policies The OSDE has encouraged LEAs to include reasonable accommodations and exemptions for those who cannot wear face coverings due to medical reasons in their district policies so those students can still participate safely in educational act ivities . Exemptions must be allowed for adults and students who are physically unable to wear face coverings. Some students with disabilities will require unique supports that may make it challenging to practice social distancing. Additional information regarding safety and health concerns for students with disabilities can be found in Special Education & Related Services During the 2020 -2021 School Year . ii. Any Statewide plans, policies, estimated timelines, and specific milestones related to reopening and operation of school facilities , including any mechanisms the SEA will use to track, monitor, or enforce their implementation ; The OSDE will continue to post, maintain and modify (as needed) its Return to Learn framework, which incorporates a wide range of guidance for the safe opening and operation of schools during the pandemic. T he OSDE will also continue to provide guidance in regular communications with district administrators statewide. The agency's regional a ccreditation officers will monitor LEAs' plans related to safe openings of schools. To track and monitor the continuing response and recovery from COVID -19 and its disruptive impacts on school communities , the OSDE will require districts to make periodic report s concerning school operations and uses of ESSER funds. As mentioned 18 herein, OSDE will also continue to implement multi- layered monitoring of LEA operations and plans with uses of ESSER funds. iii. To what extent the SEA and its LEAs consult with Federal, State, and local health officials. This description should include, if available, whether the SEA and its LEAs have received support for screening testing from their State or local health department based on funding awarded by the CDC ; and The OSDE quickly established weekly Zoom meetings with state health officials to share information about the spread of COVID -19 statewide an d discuss strategies for containment. These meetings with the Commissioner of Health, the State Epidemiologist and other health officials informed guidance that OSDE shared in its weekly \" all-district\" Zoom calls with school administrators. Additionally, t hese calls helped ensure that the same message was being distributed to county health departments and school districts across the state. These calls have continued since March 2020. Beginning in November 2020, t he Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) and its satellite offices have worked to ensure BinaxNOW antigen test ing is available for LEAs interested in providing test s for student s and staff. The OSDE partnered with OSDH and health departments in Oklahoma's two largest counties (which operate autonomously from OSDH ) to promote the importance of BinaxNOW testing and assist in scheduling testing pods throughout the state. iv. Any guidance , professional learning , and technical assistance opportunities the SEA will make a vailable to its LEAs. The OSDE will continue routine communications with districts in Zoom conference calls , webinars, weekly administrator e -newsletters and similar platforms to update LEAs on best practices related to COVID -19 mitigation , response and recovery . 2. Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plans : Describe how the SEA will ensure that its LEAs that receive ARP ESSER funds meet the requir ements in section 2001(i) of the ARP Act and the requirements relating to the ARP ESSER funds published in the Federal Register and available at an-rescue- to either: (a ) within 30 days of receipt of the funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services, or (b) have developed and made publicly available on the LEA's website such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, including: i. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan includes , or will be modified to include, the extent to which it has adopted policies and a description of any such policies on each of the strategies listed in table B1 ; 19 ii. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services including but not limited to s ervices to address the students' academic needs , and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which may include student health and food services ; iii. How the SEA will ensure that the LEA periodically review s, no less frequently than every six months for the duration of the ARP ESSER grant period (i.e., through September 30, 2023) , 2 and revises as appropriate, its plan, and how the SEA will ensure that the LEA seeks public input , and takes such input into account on (1) whether revisions are necessary and, if so, (2) the revisions to the plan; and iv. Describe, to the extent the SEA collects it, information about LEA implementation , to the greatest extent practicable, of each element of the most up- to-date C DC guidance listed in t able B1 and its LEAs' needs for support and technical assistance to implement strategies consistent , to the greatest extent practicable, with relevant CDC guidance . The OSDE will require all LEAs to post their return to in -person instruction plan on their website by June 22, 2021 . This applies to LEAs that already have a compliant plan a nd to those deve loping such a plan. When submit ting their application s for ARP ESSER funds, LEA s will be required to provide proof of posting to the ir website along with their plan to demonstrate compliance with the statutory and rule requirements as listed in Table B1 . LEA s will also be required to provide the consultation agenda and sign- in sheets as proof of stakeholder engagem ent in the development of the plan. To begin draw ing down ARP ESSER funds, each LEA will be required to agree to a set of assurances, to include that the LEA assures the SEA that: o The LEA, as a recipient of funds under section 2001 of the ARP, agrees to develop and comply with the requirements for a safe return to in -person instruction as required in section 2001(i) of the ARP. o The LEA plan will include how the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements, including but not limited to those implemented under section 2001(e)(1) [20% set -aside], will respond to the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of students, and particularly those students disproportionately impacted by COVID -19, including students from low -income families, students of color, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children in foster care and migratory students. o The LEA will provide to the OSDE and make available to the public within thirty (30) days of receiving ARP ESSER funds: (1) the URL(s) where the public can readily find data on school operating status; and (2) the URL(s) for the LEA websites where the public can find the LEA plans for a) the safe return to in - person instruction and continuity of services required under section 2001(i) of the 2 ARP ESSER funds are subject to the Tydings amendment in section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U .S.C. 1225(b), and are therefore available to SEAs and LEAs for obligation through September 30, 2024. Review and revisions of these plans, if necessary, are not required during the Tydings period. 20 ARP Act, and b) use of ARP ESSER funds. LEAs should consider ensuring a standardized URL format in all cases (e.g., xxx.gov/COVIDplan). Every six months, the OSDE will require LEAs to upload plan changes or assure the OSDE that they have no changes and provide evidence of the stakeholder involvement that has taken place. The OSDE will conduct consolidated monitoring throughout the duration of the relief funds , and the agency's regional accreditation officers will continue making on- site visits and investigations . While the OSDE does not collect data regarding each district's implementation of each item in B1, the OSDE has worked with LEAs throughout the 2020- 21 school year as they have returned to in- person learning. Specifically, the OSDE published and continued to update its Return to Learn: A Framework for Reopening Schools guidance document to assist districts in implementing the mitigation efforts that best fit their loc al context. The OSDE will continue to share the most up- to-date CDC guidance with districts through its normal communication channels, including weekly emails and bi -weekly \" all-district\" Zoom calls. The OSDE recognizes there are a multitude of regulations that LEAs must adhere to regarding ESSER funding. With that in mind, the OSDE will create a multi- layered monitoring and reporting process involving ESSER requirements. The OSDE 's oversight and monitoring may include how districts engaged stake holders on the development of the plans and thoroughness of plan requirements. C. Planning for the Use and Coordination of ARP ESSER Funds The Department recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholder s is essential to developing plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families, and educators. In this section, SEAs will describe their plans for consultation and for coordinating the use of ARP ESSER funds with other resources to meet the needs of students. 1. SEA Consultation: Consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements , describe how the SEA engaged in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, and incorporated input into its plan, including, but not limited to : i. students; ii. families; iii. Tribes (if applicable); iv. civil rights organizations ( including disability rights organizations ); v. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); vi. superintendents; vii. charter school leaders (if applicable); viii. teachers, principals, school leaders , other educators, school staff, and their unions; and ix. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated , and other underserved students . 21 The description must include how the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan, a summary of the input (including any letters of support) , and how the SEA took such input into account . From the beginning of the pandemic, Oklahoma has maintained focus on collaboration and consultation with many stakeholder groups. Listed below is a summary of just some of the various groups with which OSDE collaborated. The OSDE facilitated several focus group meetings with diverse stakeholder s in January - February 2021 to determine needs of students, families and educators due to the impact of COVID -19. P articipants were asked what they saw as the greatest needs for students, families and educators. They were also provided a list of possible focal areas for which the OSDE could prioritize support starting in t he summer of 2021. Supporting the mental health of students and educators was a high priority for all focus groups. Supporting students with unfinished learning was another priority shared by al l focus groups . High school students indicated that a top priority w as support st ructures to assist students with college preparation . Each of these priorities is being address ed with the OSDE's planned use of ARP ESSER f unds. Focus group d etails: o Students. The State Superintendent's Student Advisory Council, comprised of nearly 60 11 th and 12th grade students across Oklahoma, provides a forum for these students to provide feedback and opinions on how to improve Oklahoma's public school system and policy. Throughout the pandemic and continuing forward, Superintendent Hofmeister seeks input from t hese students on their schools ' instructional format, challenges for students and families, and other issues as they may arise. o Educators and School Leaders . Superintendent Hofmeister routinely engages with the Superintendent's Teacher Advisory Council, comprised of nearly 30 PreK -12 teachers across Oklahoma and which includes current and former State Teachers of the Year. The State Superintendent's Superintendent Advisory Council, representative of school leaders, inclusive of those in charter schools, convenes monthly, at a minimum, or more often as necessary to solicit feedback and opinions from school leaders around the s tate. Furthermore, the OSDE convenes a n Educator Quality & Diversity Advisory Council, comprised of 15 educators, education organization representatives and community stakeholders. The State Superintendent also has convened a School Board Advisory Council, comprised of school board members of LEAs statewide, to solicit and receive feedback from the perspective of local school board member s. o Stakeholders Representing the Interests of Children with Disabilities. On May 28, 2021, the OSDE met with members of the IDEA Part B State Advisory Panel, representing educators of special education, administrators of special education programs, community stakeholders and parents of students with disabilities. o Tribes and Other Community Stakeholders. The OSDE is deeply committed to its 39 tribal nations and the thousands of families and school -aged children who are among its members. As a part of the OSDE's fulfillment of obligations under ESSA, the OSDE regularly consults w ith representatives of tribal nations. 22 Additionally, to achieve equity in our schools (see section herein), the State Superintendent regularly convenes with the state Equity Advisory Council. o On May 3, 2021, the OSDE launched a website to provide curated , evidence- based guidance to educators, families and community members on t opics to support student academic and social -emotional needs brought on by the pandemic. In addition to providing information on agency -led initiatives to support student needs , the website (readytogether.sde.ok.gov ) enables the public to provide feedback and will continue to guide Oklahoma's plan to support students, families and educators in the coming years. o The OSDE continues to promote curated, evidence -based guidance through the agency's Facebook and Twitter spaces as new guidance and resources are made available. The social media platforms - with 75,000 and nearly 15,000 followers respectivel y - have been an effective tool for statewide dissemination of such materials and for updating the public on OSDE initiatives to support students with academic and social needs resulting from the pandemic. 2. Coordinating Funds : Describe to what extent the SEA has and will coordinate Federal COVID -19 pandemic funding and other Federal funding. This description must include: i. How the SEA and its LEAs 1) are using or have used prior to the submission of this plan and 2) plan to use following submission of this plan , Federal COVID -19 funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and the CRRSA Act to support a safe return to and safely maximize in -person instruction, sustain these operations safely, and address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on individual student groups (including students from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, racial or ethnic minorities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care , and migratory students ); Complete the table below or provide a narrative description. Table C1. Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) ESSER I (CARES Act) The OSDE provided a number of opportunities using its state set -aside funds to support sustained student learning. Those The OSDE will use its remaining set -aside to provide an opportunity for students grades 10 -12 to take the ACT or SAT in fall 2021. 23 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) opportunities included a statewide purchase of Edmentum's Exact Path , using $2,625,000 of ESSER I funds, which combines adaptive diagnostics with individualized instruction and learning pathways to promote growth in math, reading and language arts. Exact Path may be used in classrooms, with blended learning or during periods of distance learning. Exact Path also links with existing district information from NWEA MAP Growth Assessments or Renaissance Star Assessments. Additionally, the OSDE provide d 50,000 free Wi -Fi hotspots to low - income students across the state, using $3 million of ESSER I funds . On July 31, 2020, the OSDE announced hotspot grants to 175 districts. Districts had the opportunity to purchase additional hotspots for students not considered low income and for Oklahoma students missed the opportunity to take these assessments as part of the state testing program in spring 2020, putting many at a disadvantage for pursuing postsecondary opportunities. Providing this offering in the fall is expected to specifically benefit student groups disproportionately impacted by COVID- 19. 24 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) teachers and staff at the same cost and rate secured by the OSDE for the grant. Finally, the OSDE implemented a competitive incentive grant for use of ESSER funds (see GEER I for more information). GEER I (CARES Act) In partnership with Governor Stitt, t he OSDE awarded $8 million in GEER funds, combined with $8 million in ESSER I funds, for an incentive grant program to 150 districts that committed to using their own ESSER I funds in five priority areas that targeted student groups disproportionately impacted by COVID- 19. These priority areas included connectivity, learning/content management tools, mental health, compensatory services and professional development for teachers in the science of reading. The OSDE awarded an additional $2.9 million to districts that received less than $550 per pupil in ESSER II funding to serve as foundational funding. ESSER II (CRRSA Act) The OSDE awarded $49 million of its state set -aside to support 88 districts receiving a minimal The OSDE will combine remaining ESSER II funds with ESSER III funds to 25 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) amount of federal relief funding per student. These districts have been similarly impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic, yet their limited relief funds put them at a disadvantage in responding with additional safeguards and supports to safely return to in -person instruction. fund the programs listed in Section D. GEER II (CRRSA Act) The OSDE is not aware of any GEER II funds available to the SEA or LEAs at this time , with the exception of EANS. The OSDE is not aware of any GEER II funds available to the SEA or LEAs at this time , with the exception of EANS. ii. To what extent ESSER I and ESSER II funds have been awarded to LEAs and, if funds have not yet been made available to LEAs , when they will be . In addition, please provide any available information on the total dollar amounts of ESSER I and ESSER II funds that have been obligated but not expe nded by the SEA and its LEAs , including whether the SEA is able to track LEA obligations . The OSDE has awarded 90% (i.e., $144,855,428) of the ESSER I (CARES Act) grant funds to LEAs , of which all but $53.6 million has been expended. The remaining amount ($53.6m) has been obligated but not expended as of May 31, 2021. From the ESSER I s tate set -aside of $15.3 million, the OSDE has expended all but $3.6 million as of May 31, 2021. The remaining amount has been obligated for expenditure . The OSDE has awarded 90% (i.e., $598,534,878) of the ESSER II (CRRSA Act) to LEAs (with the exception of $500,000 withheld for new and signi ficantly expanding charter schools) . Of this total amount, $57.2 million has been expended and the remaining $541.3 million has been obligated as of May 31, 2021. From the ESSER II s tate set -aside of $63.2 million, the OSDE has awarded $49 million to LEAs, of which $46.8 million has not been expended as of May 31, 202 1. The OSDE uses its Grants Management System to track and monitor LEA budget s, obligations and expenditures . 26 iii. In supporting LEAs as they plan for the safe return to and continuity of in-person instruction and for meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the COVID- 19 pandemic , the extent to which the SEA is also using other F ederal funding sources including but not limited to under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( \"ESEA \"), IDEA, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( \"WIOA\" ), funding for child nutrition services, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and the funds to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness provided by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act. 3 LEAs have been confronted with formidable fiscal and programmatic challenges to maintain student instruction and student services. As LEAs expand their safe return to (and continuity of ) in-person instruction plan, t hey are again faced with the daunting task of deliver ing additional and enhanced services for instruction, and must assemble a plethora of resources to address students' academic, social -emotional and mental health needs. Students from impoverished backgrounds, students with food insecurit y, students with disabilities , migratory or homeless students , English learner s, students in f oster c are, students with low academic performance, Native American students, students from other racial and ethnic groups and other underserved student populations require additional supports and services. Since the onset of the pandemic, students returning to in- person instruction may have experienced negative social an d emotional impact from isolation or other residual consequence s. The fragile state of returning to in- person instruction requires the OSDE and LEAs to be reliant on relief funds and resourceful in how they are spent to best benefit students . The OSDE has numerous programs benefiting LEAs , including federal programs grants and state and local revenues . The OSDE's Office of Federal Programs ( OFP) provides LEAs many levels of support , including webinars, professional development trainings, Zoom meetings and other forms of communication to help LEAs leverag e federal financial resources, including existing access to Title programs as authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, flexible reimbursements for c hild nutrition programs, s pecial e ducation services, 21st Century Community Learning Center programs, s chool s upport resources, c ounseling grants and supplemental funds from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. The use of funding sources - such as braiding existing federal funds, including ARP, with s tate and l ocal funds, grants, donations, etc. - will extend the broad scope of services and opportunities for LEAs to address the well -being of students in all areas of the school environment. Outreach programs in the community may also serve as a valuable funding source for LEAs to sustain fiscal and programmatic 3 Please note that the needs of students experiencing hom elessness must be addressed (along with the other groups disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic) through the use of the ARP ESSER SEA reservations and the required LEA reservation for the academic impact of lost instructional time; the fundin g provided to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act is in addition to the supports and services provided with ARP ESSER funds. 27 responsibility to continue operations for safe return to and continuity of in- person programs for students and educators. The OSDE's collaborative partnership with community organizations and s tate agencies include s the Department of Human Ser vices, Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy, Regional Food Bank, Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, Latino Community Development Agency, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Hunger Free Oklahoma and other community entities w ith fiscal and programmatic resources that blend well with federal, state and local funds for the purpose of supporting all students. The OSDE 's access to financial resources and community partnerships provides LEAs the opportunity to develop programs to meet the academic, social -emotional and mental health needs of students as a result of the COVID pandemic. Oklahoma schools will serve all meals free under the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) in the 2021- 22 school year, reimbursed at the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) rate , which is the highest USDA reimbursement. Several of the flexibilities will still be in place for those schools that have a virtual option at their district for students who choose not to return to in- person learning. Schools can also continue gra b-and-go meal service, giving more than one meal at a time in a gra b-and-go setting and allowing parents to pick up meals when students are not in the car. D. Maximizing State -Level Funds to Support Students The Department recognizes that States have an extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the ARP Act's required State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs, and provide comprehensive afterschool programs. In this section, SEAs will describe their evidence -based strategies for these resou rces. 1. Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP Act ( totaling not less than 5 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) on evidence -based interventions to address the academic impact of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or e xtended school year programs, and ensure that such interventions respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those interventions on an ongoing basis to understand if they are working; Math Tutoring Corps - In partnership with Oklahoma colleges and universities, the OSDE will invest in a Math Tutoring Corps to help address middle and high school 28 student learning disruption caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. This effort will begin in summer 2021 and continue thr ough end of school year 2023- 24. o An Annenberg Foundation brief demonstrates the research base for high -dosage tutoring. o A National Bureau of Economic Research report shows intensive math tutoring in Chicago public schools improved math performance of grade 9 and 10 students . o In Brown University's National S tudent Support Accelerator , university/college students provide free tutoring to ensure equitable student access to high- quality tutoring. o National education policy officials analyze the effectiveness of intensive, research -based tutoring to reduce learni ng loss in this story on The 74 Million news website. School Cou nselor Corps - The OSDE will provide funding to LEA s to hire new school counselors , new l icensed mental health professionals and/or new licensed recreational therapists . The OSDE has reserved approximately $35 million in order to fund approximately 50% or more of the salary of 150 s chool counselors and 150 l icensed mental health professionals (LMHPs) to serve LEAs. o The American School Counseling Association recommends a 250:1 student -to- school -counselor ratio. Oklahoma's current ratio is 411:1. The Colorado State Department of Education implemented a grant -driven s chool c ounselor corps in 2008 that continues today. A study by WestEd and RMC Research Corporation showed schools that received funding for this initiative saw increases in graduation rates and concurrent enrollment and a decrease in dropout rates. Science of Reading Professional Development Course - The OSDE intends to provide sustained , job- embedded professional development on the s cience of r eading to 10,000 teachers who provide instruction in kindergarten through grade 3. The two-year professional development course of study will include evidence -based instructional practices on how students learn to read in areas such as phonics, phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension, plus support for implementing those evidence - based practices beginning in the 2021- 22 school year. The training will cost $1,299 per teacher and result in teachers receiving a micro -credential in early reading instruction. o The science of reading is a vast, interdisciplinary body of scientifically based research about reading and issues related to reading and writing that spans many languages and shares the contributions of experts from relevant disciplines such as education, special education, literacy, psychology and neurology. When examining student achievement, teacher quality has been found to be one of the most consequential school variables affecting students' learning (Callahan, Griffo, & Pearson, 2009). By providing training in the science of reading, teachers will better understand how students learn to read and how to provide effective instruction to learners with a variety of needs and abilities. 29 o The LETRS (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) training meets ESSA's \"Promising\" evidence criteria. Math Ready Professional Development - The OSDE will invest in a suite of professional development opportunities for mathematics teachers in the state to address unfinished learning for students in mathematics. Grade K -5 teachers will receive training in evidence -based instructional practices related to foundational mathematics content and skills. Teachers in grades 6 -8 will receive professional development on high- quality free and open middle s chool mathematics units that can replace existing curriculum and accelerate student learning. Teachers who teach transitional mathematics courses (middle school to high school and high school to college) will receive training on the Southern Regional Education Board's Math Ready High School and Math Ready College free and open curriculum . o A growing body of evidence shows the pairing of curriculum adoption with strong professional learning designed around the materials yield tremendous outcomes (Wiener and Pimental, 2017 ). The middle school mathematics professional development will be designed to mirror the se evidence- based practices . o Students who participated in Math Ready coursework, in all student groups, made significant gains on the ACT math test . Among students who s aw improvement , the typical gain was 2.1 points ( SREB, 2019 ). Paid Student Teaching - As Oklahoma's already severe teacher shortage is expected to worsen amid the stresses of the 2020- 21 school year, the OSDE will work with c olleges of education in universities across Oklahoma to compensate pre -service teachers for their work as student teachers. Approximately $12.7 million will be used to pay a stipend to 1,300 student teachers each year for the next three years - a total of 3,900 student teachers. Student teachers will receive compensation of $3,250, half of which will be paid no later than the first week of student teaching and the remainder upon completion of student teaching and signing a contract to teach in an Oklahoma public school. o Required student teaching time can be a barrier to entr y to some teaching candidates - the time consumed can prevent them from holding down another paid job at the same time. Educator preparation programs report that many teaching candidates do not complete their programs due to the burden of student teaching. Candidates seeking comprehensive preparation are often urged not to teach or encouraged to enter the profession through an alternative pathway, since the pay and certification are ultimately identical. However , teachers who are fully prepared through educ ator preparation programs are more likely to stay in the profession (DeAngelis, Wall, & Che, 2013; Ingersoll, Merrill, & May, 2014, as cited in Kim & Corcoran, 2017), are more confident in their practice (Darling-Hammond, 2006, as cited in Kim & Corcoran, 2017) and are better rated by employers (Patterson & Bastian, 2014, as cited in Kim & Corcoran, 2017). (\" The Value of Comprehensive, University -Based Teacher Education Programs (TEPs) 30 for Oklahoma Children,\" Oklahoma Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (OACTE)) First -Year Teacher Induction - To support 800 new teachers, t he OSDE will invest $2,478,250 over three years to provide these components : $300,000 toward a virtual coaching platform; $1,406,250 toward stipends for coaches ; $42,000 toward training facilitation for coaches ; $400,000 toward stipends for mentors (160 m entors will be designated as building level and not one -to-one; a one -to-one virtual coaching model will be implemented using other funding sources ); $75,000 toward first -year teacher facilitation; $ 240,000 toward a program specialist and $15,000 toward program evaluation. The OSDE's Educator Quality and Diversity Advisory, formerly the Teacher Shortage Task Force, provides recommendations on recruitment and retention efforts in the state. Recognizing the need to diversify the teacher talent pool to better reflect Oklahoma's racial and ethnic student population, the Advisory supports programs that provide equitable access to teacher preparation, teacher licensure/certification and embedded and ongoing professional development once in the profession. o Research indicates that teacher retention is positively influenced when a well - established induction program is in place for new teachers. ( S. Glazerman, E. Isenberg, S. Dolfin, M. Bleeker, A. Johnson, M. Grider & M. Javobus (2010) Impacts of C omprehensive Teacher Induction: Final Results From a Randomized Controlled Study (NCEE 2010- 4027). Evidence- Based Programs Grant - Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis to vendors to provide evidence -based programs for supporting students in regaining lost learning. Several one -year awards will be made from $10 million with the option to renew for an additional year if funds are available and the program shows successful outcomes. Awards are likely to range from $250,000 to $1 million. o Vendors will be requi red to share their evidence base as a part of their application and align it with the three tiers of evidence described under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) . All in terventions will have evalu ative measures applied through one or more of the following: internal process es, collaboration with education partners and/or contractual arrangements with th ird-party evaluators. ii. How the evidence- based interventions will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to determine the impact of lost instructional time ; and Math Tutoring Corps - The OSDE will invest in Algebra I tutoring for up to 1,500 grade 7 -12 students per year. The program will include up to 500 current college and 31 university students annually as tutors. Tutors wil l provide 100 hours of free tutoring to each student on a virtual platform. The student -to-tutor ratio will be no more than 3: 1. Tutors will be supervised and coached by up to 50 college and university mathematics faculty per year. Based on state mathematics assessment scores, students will be identified and notified as recip ients of free tutoring to enhance their math potential. School Counselor Corps - Many of the highest -need schools in Oklahoma have a high student -to-school counselor ratio that diminishes a school counselor 's ability to meet the needs of all students, especially in the wake of the COVID- 19 pandemic . This initiative will enhance academic, social and emotional learning and provide additional mental health supports for PK -12 students. Science of Reading Professional Development Course - Teachers from s chool districts with the highest percentage of vulnerable student populations will receive priority for enroll ing in the two -year science of r eading professional development c ourse. The highest -need districts will be determined from end -of-year reading sufficiency screening data submitted to the OSDE and through the use of state -level assessment result s. Math Ready Professional Development - Teachers from school districts with the highest percentage of vulnerable student populations will receive priority for enrolling in the Math Ready suite of professional development opportunities. The highest -need districts will be determined from state -level assessment results. First -Year Teacher Induction - It is well documented that racial and ethnic diversity among educators has a number of academic and non- academic benefits for all students and the community as a whole. Preliminary data to be included in the Oklahoma Educator Supply & Demand report (2021) suggest the racial and ethnic distribution of public school students in Oklahoma has continued a trend observed in recent years. Enrollment of Hispanic students and those who are of two or more races has grown from over 116,000 and 60,000, respectively, in fall 2016 to close to 130,000 and 82,000, respectively, in fall 2020. During that time period, Hispanic students went from making up 17% to 19% of public school enrollment; students of two or more races went from making up 9% of school enrollment to 12% of school enrollment. In fall 2016, public school enrollment in Oklahoma shifted for the first time to a majority of nonwhite students. Recent data show that, despite the critical change in the demographics of the state's classrooms, 99 % of schools have a higher percentage of students of col or than teachers of color. During the 2020- 21 school year, approximately 85% of teachers were White, 6 % were American Indian/Alaska Native and 4% were Black. Those who were Hispanic or of t wo or more races each made up 2 % of public school teacher s, and those who were Asian or Pacific Islander made up 1 % or less than 1 % of public school teachers . While the percentage of teachers of color was higher in 2020- 21 than in 2016- 17 (15% vs. 14% ), the percentage of students of color continues to grow at a faster pace (53% vs. 51% ), further widening existing racial and ethnic gaps . Evidence- Based Programs Grant - As part of the competitive grant, applicants will be asked to provide how they will target progr ams to prioritize those student groups listed in question A.3.i.- viii. 32 iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . The OSDE will leverage daily attendance data from school years 2019- 20 and 2020- 21 to identify students who missed the most in- person instruction. During the 2019- 20 school year, no students were present for in -person learning after March 12, 2020; as a result , the OSDE can utilize school calendars to determine the number of instructional days missed due to the initial COVID -19 disruption. These days will be added to the number of days students missed from August 2019 through March 2020, as measured through chronic absen teeism. For the 2020- 21 school year , the OSDE will utilize daily attendance and enrollment data to determine specific learning environments that did not allow for in- person instruction (i.e., those in distance or virtual environments only) . As noted in section A.5.i., the s tate has only a preliminary understanding of these data at the time of this submission, but the OSDE will be able to utilize certified da ta later in summer 2021 to identify and engage these students. As previously described , the Math Tutoring Corps will be offered to students identified as having the highest need for services and will leverage the data for students who lost instructional time. Many other academic s upports - including science of reading and Math Ready professional development and first-year teacher supports mentioned above - will target teacher professional development to support students in general , knowing that students who have missed in- person instruction will be in teachers ' classrooms across the state. As part of the Evidence -Based Programs Grant , priority points will be awarded to applicants who showcase how services will target students who have lost instructional time or provide teachers with support structures or resources to help them support such students . 2. Evidence -Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f )(2) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs , including those that begin in Summer 2021, and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs that address the academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs of students (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3. i.--viii. 33 When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs ; and iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . As required, the OSDE will spend 1% of its total ESSER III allocation for evidence - based summer learning and enrichment programs. In summer 2021, t he OSDE invested $5,782,731 in s ummer l earning via partnership s with the Oklahoma Alliance of YMCAs and the Oklahoma Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs to expand and enhance summer learning across the state. Both organizations provide evidence -based programs , have a broad reach in multiple counties and communities, and target the most at- risk youth. The YMCA is hosting 63 s ummer youth development programming s ites across the state to support holistic youth- development programming designed to support student success by providing social -emotional skills training, academic enrichment programs, mental health support, health and nutrition programming and family engagement activities at highly subsidized pr ogramming outreach sites with a strong emphasis on school district partnerships. The Boys & Girls Clubs will provide supports for academic recovery, social and emotional support and access to technology. Half of club members are living in rural - designated areas , while 25% are in suburban areas; 34% of club members live in single - parent households, and 78% of the children served in the clubs qualify for free - or reduced -price lunches. The Boys & Girls Clubs will offer an evidence -based , holistic strategy program that supports student learning, complements and reinforces what youth learn during the school day, and creates experiences that invite children and teens to be engaged in learning. The Boys & Girls C lubs will enhance services at 78 existing program sites and will establish an additional five locations to serve more students statewide this summer. The combination of both alliances will serve 11,030 students in 146 locations in rural, urban and suburban areas across Oklahoma. Remaining funds, just over $9.1 million, will be distributed via a competitive grant process to allow for additional summer programs across the state in 2022 and 2023. The OSDE anticipates evaluating the effectiveness of programs funded in 2021 -22 to best understand return on investment t hat will inform the use of remaining set -aside funds , thus providing an evidence base for effective programs in 2022- 23 and 2023- 24. The OSDE will provide priority points to applicants who are planning to serve students who were disproportionately impacted by COVID and did not engage consistently in school during closures. In addition to evaluations specific to these opportunities, OSDE may use its accountability system to identify schools and students most in need of support and make this information available through its accountability dashboard. The accountability system uses assessment data, student academic growth, graduation rate, a ttendance data and opportunities available to students such that it may be effective to determine high performance and those most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs. 34 3. Evidence -Based Comprehensive Afterschool Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f )(3) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based comprehensive afterschool programs (including, for example, before -school programming) , and ensure such programs respond to student s' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs (e.g., including partnerships with community -based organizations) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impa ct of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of comprehensive afterschool programming; and iii. the extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . As required, t he OSDE will spend 1% of its total ESSER III allocation for evidence - based comprehensive afterschool programs. Currently, 52 21 st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) grantees provide afterschool programming at 102 sites across the state. These programs will continue and be supplemented in services by additional OSDE investments with community partners. Though opportunities are made available to all Oklahoma students, for purposes of these grants, t he OSDE will work with Boys & Girls Clubs and YMCA Clubs of Oklahoma to enhance evidence- based afterschool programs. O ther community partners will also have an opport unity to write for grant funding to begin or enhance afterschool programs. This grant opportunity is expected to be released in early July 2021 so grantees can be prepared for the 2021- 22 school year. P riority points will be given to applicants that serve the most underserved populations and those that had their learning most disrupted during the COVID -19 pandemic. The OSDE will ensure that applicants describe the evidence- based best practices they will use to help meet students' academic, emotional and soc ial learning needs. The OSDE anticipates evaluating the effectiveness of programs funded in 2021- 22 such that remaining set -aside funds can be used for the most effective programs in 2022- 23 and 2023- 24. In addition, OSDE may use its accountability system to identify schools and students most in need of support and make this information available through its accountability dashboard. The accountability system uses assessment data, student academic growth, 35 graduation rate, attendance data and opportunities available to students such that it may be effective to determine high performance and those most in need of comprehensive afterschool programs. 4. Emergency Needs : If the SEA plans to reserve funds for emergency needs under section 2001( f)(4) of the AR P Act to address issues responding to the COVID- 19 pandemic , describe the anticipated use of those funds, including the extent to which these funds will build SEA and LEA capacity to ensure students' and staff's health and safety ; to meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs ; and to use ARP ESSER funds to implemen t evidence- based interventions . The OSDE intends to reserve and use a portion of its ESSER III funding for emergency needs under section 2001(f)(4) of the ARP Act to address issues responding to and recovering from t he COVID -19 pandemic to ensure students' and staff's health and safety and to meet students' academic, social -emotional and mental health needs. Examples of these uses include: Imagination Library - The Dolly Parton Imagination Library aims to provide age- appropriate books to all childr en, birth to 5 years old, in the state on a monthly basis. Authorized by state law in 2020 under S enate B ill 1803, this state -level program was designed as a 50/50 match of state investment and private funds. The OSDE intends to provide $2.6 million to fund the state match for three years. This level of funding would allow for 25% - or 68,750 children - to be enrolled in the program. o Participants in the Imagination Library performed better on letter identification, word and letter concepts within text tasks than those who did not participate (Waldron, 2019). Participants and their families also indicated social and emotional benefits associated with participation in the program, helping families build traditions and routines for reading (Neyer, Szmula, and Vaughn, 2018). Administrator Supports and Professional Development - The OSDE will invest $1.7 million over three years to build a leadership pipeline providing support to administrators through the enhancement of their knowledge and skills. Moving Up supports assistant principals with a focus on collaborative leadership, collective efficacy and equity. The Principal Induction Academy provides training to early- career principals in the areas of instructionally focused interactions with teachers, building a productive school climate, facilitating collaboration and professional learning communities ( PLCs ), and managing personnel and resources. The Data Institute cultivates the school leader's abilities in collecting, analyzing and utilizing data to build effective schools and improve student achievement. o During the 2020- 21 school year, public schools in Oklahoma employed 1,827 full- and part -time principals, including about 1,038 elementary school principals, 813 secondary school principals and 212 virtual charter school principals. Although the great majority of Oklahoma public schools have a principal, about 36 3% of schools statewide at all levels did not have one during the 2020- 21 school year. From 2016- 17 to 2020- 21, the rate of schools with no principals that had mid- to high levels of poverty increased from 44% to 50% . o Racial and ethnic diversity among school principals is critical for many reasons, including enhancing the academic opportunities for students of color , increasing acceptance and trust across racial and ethnic groups , and improving the working environment of educators of col or, which in turn can contribute to both recruitment and retention of a more diverse educator workforce. While the percentage of school principals who were White decreased over the last four years, (from 86% to 85% ), there was an increase in the percentage of the student population who were students of color, from 51% to 53% - which more than compensated for the drop in the workforce participation of White principals - leading to an overall widening of the racial and ethnic gap .

External entities have submitted proposals for use of federal relief funds to provide additional support for student learning and well -being. These proposals are being carefully vetted by an internal team. The OSDE established a vetting rubric to include the following criteria: justification of allowable use, alignment to emergency relief, impact of investment, identification of evidence -based and/or research/based support, alignment of practice/program and process for monitoring effectiveness. E. Supporting LEAs in Plann ing for and Meeting Students' Needs The Department recognizes that the safe return to in -person instruction must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students ' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, and by addressing the opportunity gaps that existed before - and were exacerbated by - the pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in developing high- quality plans for LEAs' use of ARP ESSER funds to achieve these objectives. 1. LEA Plans for the Use of ARP ESSER Funds : Describe what the SEA will require its LEAs to include in LEA plans consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements for the use of ARP ESSER funds , how the SEA will require such 37 plans to be made available to the public , and the deadline by which the LEA must submit its ARP ESSER plan (which must be a reasonable timeline and should be within no later than 90 days after receiving its ARP ESSER allocation) . The LEA plans must include, at a minimum: i. The extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies that are, to the greatest extent practicable, in line with the most recent CDC guidance, in order to continuously and safely operate schools for in- person learning; ii. How the LEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 20 percent of the LEA's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds) to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; iii. How the LEA will spend its remaining ARP ESSER funds consistent with section 2001(e )(2) of the ARP Act ; and iv. How the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements , including but not limited to the interventions under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , will respond to the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students, and particularly those students disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including students from low -income families, students of color, English learner s, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds provide LEAs an opportunity to plan and create evidenced -based academic, social and emotional, and healthy programs to meet student needs. From passage and enactment of the ARP, the OSDE has worked to support school districts in understanding requirements and authorized use s of ARP ESSER funds, including releasing FAQs and holding trainings on the ESSER application, requirements of the ARP and authorizations. With these actions to properly allow LEAs to plan for strategic investments of the ESSER funds, and in consultation wi th stakeholders, the OSDE released the LEA ARP ESSER application to school districts on May 19, 2021. As a part of the LEA ESSER application, t he OSDE requires LEAs to submit ARP ESSER Use of Funds Plan. The LEA plan must include the four required components in the ARP as listed in E1. The LEA will develop a framework in the plan for ensuring schools will conduct and manage in- person learning in a safe and healthy environment for students and educators. The LEA plan will establish responsible checks and bal ances to maintain and update the latest CDC protocols. LEAs must describe how ARP funds will support programs and intervention strategies to address learning loss across all spectrums of the student population as a result of the challenging circumstances L EAs encountered due to the pandemic. 38 A minimum of 20% of the LEA's allocation funds are required to target learning loss with an emphasis on specialized intervention programs. Each school community is unique; therefore, the LEA must assess student needs a nd plan for academic , social - emotional and mental health issues accordingly. The LEA is required to have a clear and intentional roadmap in the ARP ESSER Plan, targeting underserved student populations to support learning loss and the complexity of learning gaps for students. The LEA will also provide in the plan how ARP funds will be used and implemented to support authorized activities in section 2001(e)(2) of the ARP. Funds not specifically earmarked for learning loss can be used to supplement other necessities as authorized in the ARP. The authorized a ctivities for using the ARP funds are broad and flexible for supplementing LEA educational initiatives. These funds must support, expand and enrich the overall educational landscape for student learning to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID. The OSDE provides professional development to LEAs through webinars, Z oom meetings and organizational meetings, and disseminates communication through newsletters and the agency' s website to support LEAs in the ARP planning process. The OSDE published an informational document for LEAs, American Rescue Plan, Elementary and Secondary Education Relief Fund FAQs , as a guide for LEAs as they prepar e the ir ARP ESSER plan. LEAs are required to upload their ARP ESSER plans in GMS, and must include supportive documentation for posting the plan on the LEA website and additional documentation for engaging stakeholders in the planning process. The OSDE is a collaborative, interactive working partner with LEAs to provide support for creating a well -thought -out plan for the use of ARP funds. The OSDE established a timeline for LEAs to submit the ARP ESSER plan by August 19, 2021, which allows LEAs to develop the ARP ESSER plan, seek stakeholder participation and submit the plan to the OSDE within a 90 -day window. 2. LEA Consultation: Describe how the SEA will, in planning for the use of ARP ESSER funds, ensure that , consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements ], its LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to: i. students; ii. families; iii. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and iv. teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions . The LEA must also engage in meaningful consultation with each of the following to the extent present in or served by the LEA: i. Tribes; ii. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and iii. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, chi ldren and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. 39 The description must also include how the SEA will ensure that LEAs provide the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the LEA's plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds and take such input into account. ESSER Communication and T raining . The OSDE has identified multiple methods to ensure LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders . These methods focus on the importance of a well -thought -out plan that requires consultation from a variety of stakeholders whose perspective must be taken into consideration for understanding the consequences the pandemic has had on the lives of students, families and community. These opportunities include professional development , webinars, Zoom meetings and organizational meetings and communication through newsletters and the agency's website to support LEAs in the ARP planning process. The OSDE published an informational document for LEAs, American Rescue Plan, Elementary and Secondary Education Relief Fund FAQs , as a guide for LEAs as they prepare their ARP ESSER pla n, and the FAQs specifically address meaningful consultation requirements. LEAs are required to upload their ARP ESSER plans to OSDE , which will review them to ensure consultation requirements have been met. Additionally, The OSDE's Office of Federal Programs collaborates within the agency - with departmental support from the offices of Special Education, American Indian Education, and Curriculum and Instruction, in addition to programs devoted to students who are homeless, in foster care, English learners, migrant and other underrepresented student populations - to provide information to assist LEAs in understanding the importance of consulting with constituents served by the LEA. LEA ARP ESSER Application. The OSDE will ensur e LEAs complete a comprehensive ARP application that provides the framework for budgeting and using ARP funds as a result of the consultation process. An essential component of the ARP application requires LEAs to provide evidence by submitting supportive documentation that consultation with stakeholders contributed to the development of the plan. The evidence must also include a stakeholder participation list and representation to include families , students, school district personnel, tribes and the Native American population, civil rights organizations and other populations within the LEA demogra phics. ESSER Monitoring. The OSDE recognizes there are a multitude of regulations that LEAs must adhere to regarding ESSER funds. With that in mind, OSDE has established, and will review and update, a multi- layered monitoring process. M onitoring will include a review of how LEAs engaged and will continue to engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders. 3. Describe how the SEA will support and monitor its LEA s in using ARP ESSER funds. The description must include: i. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs' implementation of evidence -based interventions that respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs , such as through summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs - including the extent to which the SEA will collect evidence of the effectiveness of interventions employed; 40 ii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii; and iii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in using ARP ESSER funds to i dentify, reengage, and support students most likely to have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, such as: a. Students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; b. Students w ho did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures; and c. Students most at -risk of dropping out of school. The OSDE's Office of Federal Programs (OFP) staff receives in -depth training on programmatic and fiscal requirements to ensure LEAs meet compliance requirements for use of ARP ESSER funds. OFP staff, grants a ssociates and program s pecialists perform a thorough review of the LEA ARP ESSER application and expenditure reports to monitor LEAs' use of funds to support evidence -based intervention programs and activities. OFP's extensive, ongoing training opportunities for LEA staff for application, budget and expenditure reviews provide an additional layer of support to ensure LEAs are implementing effective programs to meet student academic, social -emotional and mental health needs. The training provides staff knowledge of the ARP ESSER requirements to extend technical assistance services to LEAs for the monitoring of ARP funds. The OFP staff is responsible for ensuring evidence documentation is provided in the ARP application and funds are accurately expended to target support for under served student populations and intervention programs to address learning loss. The OFP provides technical assistance to LEAs through in- person consultation meetings in the OFP office and/or in person at the LEA, Zoom meetings, emails, phone conferences and other forms of communication to sustain a supportive partnership. The collabor ation process engages the OFP and the LEA to address specific concerns regarding student data and the need to supplement the ARP funds in areas where student learning has most been impacted due to the pandemic, such as students who received intermittent in struction, at -risk students and student populations disproportionately impacted by COVID who may already have been in jeopardy prior to the pandemic. Professional development is another facet of technical support from OFP to provide LEAs guidance in the use of ARP funds, planning and resources for systemic change to meet the challenges of the pandemic, and to communicate how LEAs will be monitored and the process for monitoring ARP funds. In addition, the OSDE holds departmental meetings, of which OFP is a part, to determine if further monitoring or technical assistance is needed in areas of concern. These include meetings with s pecial e ducation, 21st Century Community Learning Centers , curriculum and i nstruction departments , etc., to address support for LEAs in the use of ARP funds for such purposes. 41 Supporting LEAs through professional development, technical assistance and monitoring from OFP will give the LEAs programmatic and fiscal responsibilities to ensure evidence -based interventions ar e implemented. OSDE will request districts collect evidence of the effectiveness of the interventions and report them in a manner and frequency to be determined by OSDE. 4. Describe the extent to which the SEA will support its LEAs in implementing additional strategies for taking educational equity into account in expending ARP ESSER funds, including but not limited to: i. Allocating funding both to schools and for districtwide activities based on student need, and ii. Implementing an equitable and inclusive return to in- person instruction. An inclusive return to in- person instruction includes, but is not limited to, establishing policies and practices that avoid the over-use of exclusionary discipline measures (including in- and out - of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students . The need to address equity has been at the forefront of education for many years . Under the No Child Left Behind Act, each state submitted a state equity plan in 2015. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) , all public schools are required to report per -pupil federal and non- federal costs, and states are required to collect this information and publicly report i t. In Oklahoma, the \"School District Transparency Act\" requires that the OSDE publish Oklahoma LEA expenditures, cost descriptions, amounts of funds spent, types of transactions and current per -pupil expenditure figures on its website . The law also requires the OSDE to report each category of expenditures as described in the law as well as aggregate expenditures when reporting the per -pupil expenditure for any purpose. As such, under both federal and state laws, Oklahoma is reinforcing the importance of financial tra nsparency and equity. The new maintenance of equity provision outlined in the ARP Act will also help protect funding levels for districts and schools that have high percentages of students living in poverty. This reporting requirement will further financia l transparency while helping schools make decisions to promote fairness, equity and academic success for all students. Further, p art of the OSDE's Ready Together Oklahoma : An Action Plan for Supporting Students Through the Pandemic and Beyond includes a website with five interactive tabs, one of which is \"Ensuring Equity for All.\" This tab will provide schools, educators and communities resources related to positive school climate and culture, utilizing data to identify equity gaps for historically under served students , support for English learners and Indian Education resources. Additionally, all five tabs on the website house guidance documents , each of which includes a n \"Attending to Equity\" section which aligns the specific initiative to educational equity supports, research and access. The OSDE believes a collaborative partnership approach is paramount for building a relationship with LEAs to cultivate best practices for meeting student needs and ensuring educational equity for all students. The ARP funds provide LEAs flexibility to appl y innovative strategies to implement conditions for effective learning and a focus on authentic competencies for student learning . 42 The OSDE provides guidance to LEAs through professional development to demonstrate how the authorized activities allowed unde r the ARP can be utilized districtwide to serve all students and to target specific student population needs. Leveraging ARP funding along with other available resources is an important strategy LEAs can use to their advantage to ensure equity for all students. After LEAs identify student needs by analyzing comprehensive local data and p olicies, school site data, assessments and stakeholder comments, the distribution of ARP funds provides LEAs an opportunity to make a systemic transformation in the school climate for effective student learning. LEAs are required to submit a Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plan to include LEA policies for meeting the Interim Final Requirements (IFR) as a part of their ARP application. The Office of Federal Programs provides technical assistance to help LEAs establish an all -inclusive strategy for educational equity for students and to ensure evidence -based programs produce positive results. The OSDE offers a broad range of available resources and opportunities for LEAs to participate in building an all -inclusive ARP plan which will lead to the creation of necessary standards and rigor to accomplish a positive outcome for student academic success. The OSDE's mission and objective is to support LEAs when using ARP funds by providing guidance and encouraging responsible choices f or students when incorporating resources and strategies to create a school climate that is academic ally rich, healthy, safe and nurturing for the well -being of the whole child while sustaining educational equity for all students. F. Supporting the Educator Workforce The Department recognizes the toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has taken on the Nation's educators as well as students. In this section, SEAs will describe strategies for supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce and for making staffing decisions that will support students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. 1. Supporting and Stabilizing the Educator Workforce : i. Describe the extent to which the State is facing shortages of educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools, and the extent to which they vary by region/type of school district and/or groups of educators (e.g., special educators and related services personnel and paraprofessionals ; bilingual or English as a second language educators ; science, technology, engineering, and math ( \"STEM \") educators ; career and technical education (\"CTE\") educators; early childhood educators). Cite specific data on shortages and needs where available. Complete the table below , changing or adding additional rows as needed, or provide a narrative description. Table F 1. 43 Area Data on shortages and needs Narrative description Special educators and related service personnel and paraprofessionals Irregular/ Emergency/ Alternative ( IEA) Full-time equivalent (FTE) as a percentage of total FTE 7.2% Bilingual educators No data available English as a second language educators IEA FTE as a percentage of total FTE 11.1% STEM educators IEA FTE as a percentage of total FTE 9.8% CTE educators IEA FTE as a percentage of total FTE 7.0% Early childhood educators IEA FTE as a percentage of total FTE 5.8% School counselors IEA FTE as a percentage of total FTE 8.0% Social workers No data available Nurses No data available School psychologists No data available Additional areas of shortage Advanced Placement 12.6% Business & Computer 14.4% English Language Arts 7.4% Additional priority areas Shortage of educators and the cultural/racial/ethnic mismatch of teachers Student -to-teacher racial and ethnic gaps persist across all non- White groups. While the gap for 44 Area Data on shortages and needs Narrative description the majority of non -White categories is slightly improving over time (e.g., 10% in 2020- 21 vs. 11% in 2016- 17 for American Indians/Alaskan Natives), the gap for Hispanic students is highest and keeps worsening (14% in 2020- 21). Racial and ethnic gaps are highest in high- poverty schools and decrease as the school poverty level improves, e.g., the gap for Hispanics in 2020- 21 is 21% in high- poverty schools vs. 8% in low-poverty schools. The racial and ethnic gaps vary by school locale classification, e.g., the gaps for Hispanics and Blacks in 2020- 21 are highest in schools located in cities (32% and 8%, respectively) while the gaps for American Indians/Alaskan N atives are highest in rural schools (13%). Shortages of educators by school poverty concentration and geographic location 85% of all schools without a counselor in 2020- 21 are either high or mid- high poverty schools. 76% of all schools without a princ ipal in 2020- 21 are either high or mid- high poverty schools. ii. Describe how the SEA will assist its LEAs in identifying the most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages, with particular plans for individual LEAs facing the most significant needs (e.g., by avoiding layoffs, providing high- quality professional learning opportunities , and addressing the impact of stress or trauma on educators) . Include a description of how other Federal COVID -19 funding (e.g., ESSER and GEER funds under the CARES Act and 45 CRRSA Act) have already been used to avoid layoffs during the COVID- 19 pandemic . Currently , Oklahoma has 18 teaching shortage areas approved by the U.S. Department of Education. Preliminary data in the Educator Supply & Demand report (to be published later this year) indicate school enrollment projections a re crucial for estimating the demand for teachers in upcoming years. Gra de progression ratios and enrollm ent rates indicate a drop between school years 2019 -20 and 2020- 21, arguably due to the COVID - 19 pandemic. The largest estimated enrollment/grade progres sion drop occurred for prekindergarten (10%) and kindergarten (5% ), with the remaining grades experiencing more commonly a 1% drop. Regarding middle and high school l evel class size during the 2020- 21 school year , the top three with the highest pupil load are science & STEM, social studie s and language arts. For all but one of the primary positions examined, the average number of pupils a teacher has in a class was larger in middle than in high schools. For example, the pupil load in MS industrial arts and technology education, MS arts & humanities and MS science & STEM in 2020- 21 was nearly double the size as that of the same classes in high schools. Efforts to better prepare teache rs for these challenges include high- quality , embedded and networked professiona l growth via the OSDE's virtual learning platform, OKE dge. The OSDE continues to offer relevant and practical sessions at its annual professional development conference , EngageOK . Additionally, a partnership with Project ECHO/O klahoma State University affords teachers the opportunity to connect with other educators via TeleEDGE, a venue to improve educational practice through case- based learning a nd rich discussions . TeleEDGE offers participants a real -time option to learn and share with fellow educators across the state. Throughout the course of the pandemic, the OSDE provided, and regularly updated, a set of FAQs to help guide districts as they made decisions regardi ng use of fund s, student learning and adapting the normal school environment and activities to a virtual space. Within th e FAQs, the OSDE included guidance on employment and salaries for school personnel in order to help districts avoid layoffs . The OSDE regularly reminded districts that in order to receive federal relief funds, they assured the OSDE that they would to the greatest extent practicable continue to pay employees and contractors during any disruption or closures related to coronavirus. Additionally, the OSDE worked with Governor Kevin Stitt to amend an Executive Order allowing districts to continue to pa y support employees for their contract ed time even as those employees may not have been able to fulfill their contracted duties. o The Executive Order read: \"All local educational agencies s hall to the greatest extent practicable, continue to pay their employees and contractors for the remainder of the contracted period of the 2019 -20 fiscal year, and in furtherance of this intent the State hereby authorizes accredited public school districts to pay support staff for the remainder of their contracted period for the 2019 -20 fiscal year and waives any statutory or rule -based time limitations on which support personnel (as defined in 70 O.S. \u00a7 1- 116) may accumulate or receive leave for the 2019- 20 fiscal year.\" (Paragraph 33). Additionally , Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt took action to extend occupational licenses that had been potentially disrupted with COVID closures. Further, State Superintendent Joy Hofmeiste r presented proposals to the OSBE to extend emergency certifications for 46 one yea r to those who had sustained disruptions from COVID -19. A dditionally, Superintendent Hofmeister presented proposals to the OSBE to extend temporary or provisional certificates for individuals who were unable to complete competency examinations or required credit/clock hours due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Both proposals were unanimously adopted by the OSBE. iii. Describe the actions the SEA will take to fill anticipated gaps in certified teachers for the start of the 2021- 2022 school year and to what extent the SEA will further support its LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity while addressing the immediate needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (e.g., recruiting teaching candidates to provide high-dosage tutoring or implementing residencies for teacher candidates ). Paid Student Teaching - The OSDE will invest approximately $12,675,000 in state set - aside federal relief dollars to compensate pre -service teachers for their work as student teachers. The program will equitably fund Oklahom a student teachers annually, beginning in school year 2021- 22 and continuing through school year 2023 -24. Through a partnership with the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) and the OSDE, payment will be made available for up to $3,250 per individual student teacher approved by the Educator Preparation Program (EPP). Funds are expected to benefit 1,300 student teachers annually, totaling 3,900 student teachers throughout the program. Certification Test Scholarship - The OSDE will invest up to $1.9 million in state set - aside federal relief dollars over a three -year period to pay for certification exam fees for 5,000 teacher candidates per year, totaling 15,000 teachers throughout the duration of the program. This program addresses teacher shortage recruitment and retention challenges by removing the accessibility to testing sites barrier and the financial barrier of exams costs. 2. Staffing to Support Student Needs : Describe the extent to which the SEA has developed or will develop strategies and will support its LEAs in increasing student access to key support staff within school buildings , including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social workers, and psychologists (e.g. hiring additional personnel or freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students) . As previously described, Oklahoma will use approximately $35 mi llion to provide funding to LEAs to hire new school counselors and/or new licensed mental health professionals. The se funds are expected to help LEAs hire an additional 150 school counselors and 150 licensed mental health professionals (LMHPs). As part of this grant opport unity, LEAs may hire, or provide enhanced contract services for, any of the following positions: o Certified School Counselor 47 o Licensed School Psychologists o Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC) o Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselors (LADC) o Licensed Marriage & Family Therapists (LMFT) o Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW) o Licensed Recreational Therapists (CTRS/L) G. Monitoring and Measuring Progress The Department recognizes that transparency on how ARP ESSER funds are used and their impact on the Nation's education system is a fundamental responsibility of Federal, State, and local government . In this section, SEAs will describe how they are building capacity at the SEA and LEA levels to ensure high- quality data collection and reporting and to safeguard funds for their intended purposes. 1. Capacity for Data Collection and Reporting: It is important for an SEA to continuously monitor progress and make adjustments to its strategies , as well as to support its LEAs in making adjustments to LEA strategies, based on impact . Describe how the SEA will ensure its capacity and the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on reporting requirements, including but not limited to the examples of reporting requirements described in the SEA's Grant Award Notification ( listed in Appendix B ). Describe the SEA's capacity and strategy to collect data from its LEAs (disaggregated by student group, where applicable) , to the greatest extent practicable, including any steps the SEA will take to build its capacity in the future (which may include the use of ARP ESSER and other Federal COVID -19 pandemic funds at the SEA and LEA levels) , on issues that may include the following: i. Student learning, including the academic impact of lost instructional time during the COVID- 19 pandemic ; ii. Opportunity to learn measures (e.g., chronic absenteeism ; student engagement ; use of exclusionary discipline; access to and participation in advanced coursework; access to technology, including educator access to professional development on the effective use of technology; access to high -quality educators ; access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists; and results from student, parent, and/or educator surveys ); iii. Fiscal data that is comparable across the State (e.g., per -pupil expenditures at the LEA and school levels) ; iv. Jobs created and retained (by position type ); v. Participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources (e.g., summer and afterschool programs ); and vi. Other reporting requirements reasonably required by the Secretary (please refer to Appendix B of this template; final requirements will be issued separately ). 48 The OSDE collaborates with in agency departments, including the offices of Comptroller, Financial Services and Education Data Management , to ensure accurate data set collections are readily available upon request. The Grants Management System ( GMS ) platform hosts LEA data and information for ARP ESSER funds and is accessible to retrieve data collection and reports. Communication and team meetings with agency departments provides transparent interchange of information. Strategically executed, the communication among the OSDE 's departments serves as a valuable resource for quality data. At the onset of the pandemic, the OSDE and OSBE took action to ensure instructional service delivery continued, and these actions continued throughout the 2020- 21 school year. As a part of the statewide cessation of in -person school operations in March 2020 and move to virtual instructional delivery, LEAs were required to submit distance learning plans to the OSDE, including information and data relating to curriculum and interim assessments used by the LEA. In addition, the OSDE administered statewide student assessments in the 2020- 21 school year , which will be used to analyze the students and student subgroups who did not test or whose performance was significantly and disproportionately impacted as compared to others and their prior benchmarks. 2. Monitoring and Internal Controls : Describe how the SEA will implement appropriate fiscal monitoring of and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds (e.g., by updating the SEA's plan for monitoring funds and internal controls under the CARES and CRRSA Acts ; addressing potential sources of waste, fraud, and abuse; conducting random audits ; or other tools ). In this response, please describe the SEA's current capacity to monitor ARP ESSER ; steps , if needed, to increase capacity ; and any foreseeable gaps in capacity , including how the SEA will provide its LEAs with technical assistance in the anticipated areas of greatest need . As noted above, the OSDE has established monitoring and internal controls and procedures, and will regularly review and update them to include additional requirements under ESSER. The OSDE's grants a ssociates and program s pecialists perform a thorough review of the LEA ARP ESSER applications and expenditure reports. The Office of Federal Programs (OFP) provides extensive training for its staff on the process for monitoring district applications and expenditure reports. The OFP has established internal controls through verbal and written communications, a s well as other technical assistance strategies to its staff for the fiscal and programmatic monitoring of ARP ESSER funds. The OFP provides technical assistance to LEAs through in- person consultation meetings in the OFP office and/or in person at the LEA, Zoom meetings, emails, phone conferences and other forms of communication. The OFP engages in j oint f ederal programs team m eetings to discuss and share information for supporting LEAs. The OFP leadership team and staff meet to determine services for LEAs that may be struggling in fiscal and programmatic areas. The OFP performs a risk assessment of all LEAs to analyze which dis tricts are at high risk for not meeting federal compliance, and then proceed s with a formal desk or site monitoring. 49 Appendix A: School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data Template Indicate the date or time period represented by the following data. Table 1 In the most recent time period available, how many schools in your State offer ed each mode of instruction or learning model described below ? Each row should account for all schools in your State, so that , for each row, the sum of t he numbers in the \"offered to all students,\" \"offered to some students,\" and \"not offered\" columns is equal to the number in the \"all schools\" column. Add or change rows as needed The OSDE collects student -level absence data from schools' student information systems each night. By using data collected on June 3, 2021, we can provide the following preliminary data. T he OSDE can offer only a preliminary understanding of mode of instruc tion data at the time of this submission until final certification of the Annual Statistical Report (ASR) on June 30, 2021, as outlined in sections A.5.i. through A.5.iii, which prevents us from being able to provide data within the \"Offered to...\" columns within Table 1 at this time. Again, the data reflects what has been reported to date and should not be considered complete or comprehensive. To be included in the analysis below, a school must have had a student labeled as absent (a required data element) or present (a non -required data element) within 15 calendar days of the school's final instructional day. For instance, a school w hich had one student labeled absent from their hybrid (i.e., distance or blended) learning environment on March 1 but noted no other absences from March 2 until the end of the academic year was likely no longer offering a hybrid learning environment - that is, becaus e at least one student absence would be expected within a school during the final weeks of the academic year. We anticipate a more accurate analysis and reporting of this data in fall 2021 after completion of the Annual Statistical Report (ASR), as not all of Oklahoma's public schools are included in this preliminary analysis. 50 Number of schools All schools Offered to all students Offered to some students Not offered Remote or online only 7 # # # School buildings open with both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid) 1,284 # # # School buildings open with full-time in-person instruction 401 # # # To the extent data are available, please complete the above table for 1) all schools in the State, and 2) separately for each instructional level (e.g., pre -kindergarten/elementary schools, middle schools, high schools).

The OSDE's Office of Data and Information Systems has used the October 1 Report collection to report the numbers below because Annual Statistical Report (ASR) is still being finalized. The Annual Statistical Report will give the OSDE a clearer picture of the enrollment and mode of instruction for schools in our state as noted in Section A(5) of this document .

These non-discrimination obligations arise under Federal civil rights laws, including but not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, s ection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. In addition, the SEA must comply with all regulations, guideline s, and standards issued by the Department under any of these statutes ; The SEA will comply with all ARP Act and other ARP ESSER requirements and all requirements of its Grant Award Notification, including but not limited to: o Complying with the maintenance of effort provision in section 2004(a)(1) of the ARP Act, absent a waiver by the Secretary pursuant to section 2004( a)(2) of the ARP Act ; and o Complying with the maintenance of equity provisions in section 2004(b) of the ARP Act , and ensuring its LEAs comply with the maintenance of equity provision in section 2004(c) of the ARP Act (please note that the Department will provide additional guidance on maintenance of equity shortly) ; The SEA will allocate ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the SEA receives ARP ESSER funds (i.e., 60 days from the date the SEA receives each portion of its ARP ESSER funds). An SEA that is not able to allocate such funds wit hin 60 days because it is not practicable (e.g., because of pre- existing State board approval requirements) will provide an explanation to the Department within 30 days of receiving each portion of its ARP ESSER funds (submitted via email to your Program O fficer at [State].OESE@ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov)) , including a description of specific actions the SEA is taking to provide ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and the SEA's expected timeline for doing so; The SEA will implement evidence -based interventions as required under section 2001(f) of the ARP Act and ensure its LEAs implement evidence -based interventions , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; The SEA will address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity) , gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender ), English learners, children with disabilities, students experienci ng homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required under section 2001(f) of the ARP Act, and ensure its LEAs address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups, gender, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and 55 youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; and The SEA will provide to the Department : (1) the URL(s) where the public can readily find data on school operating status and (2) the URL(s) for the SEA and/ or LEA websites where the public can find the LEA plans for a) the safe return to in -person instruction and continuity of services required under section 2001(i) of the ARP Act , and b ) use of ARP ESSER funds . SEAs should consider ensuring a standardized URL format in all cases (e.g., xxx.gov/COVIDplan). 56 Appendix D OMB Control No. 1894- 0005 (Exp. 06/ 30/2023) NOTICE TO ALL APPLICANTS The purpose of this enclosure is to inform you about a new provision in the Department of Educations General Education Provisions Act ( \"GEPA\" ) that applies to applicants for new grant awards under Department programs. This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103- 382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State -formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State - level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally-assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: ge nder, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access to, or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable t o your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve high standards. Consis tent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. 57 What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following exam ples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. (4) An applicant that proposes a project to increase school safety might describe the special efforts it will take to address concern s of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students, and efforts to reach out to and involve the families of LGBT students . We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in re sponding to the requirements of this provision.
