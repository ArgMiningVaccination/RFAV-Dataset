Hahnemanndeveloped the dilutional method called succussion, wherein veryprecise dilution of the drug would be measured, and the containerwith the dilution would be pounded gently with afelt pad in apreciseway, and then that solution would again be precisely diluted again,and pounded again. This method would activate the water or alcoholsolution, which was being used as the diluent. If there was asubstance that was not soluble in liquid, itcould be ground up withmilk sugar, (which was considered an inert substance) and that iscalled trituration. For every substance, the observers noted that themore dilute itbecame, the more potent itbecame. So in homeopathy,dilution is the equivalent of potency, and the act of dilution is calledpotentization, or potentiation. This is the opposite of what conventional medical doctors usually think of as \"potency.\" In homeopathy, higher potencies are considered to be more powerful and ableto stir up the body's \"vital force.\" In classical homeopathy, patientscan only get the extremely dilute (potent) medicines from alicensedpractitioner and can't buy them over-the-counter.Labeled homeopathic medicines denote two Europe, is denoted by thesymbol \"c\" and is used America. It starts with lc= 1:100, andeach successive dilution is 1part to 99 parts diluent, so 2c is 1:10000,adding two zeros with each additional dilution.Hahnemann and his colleagues thought through the mathematics,and realized that there is a point where the dilution is likely tobecome pure water, with a very high likelihood that there are nomolecules of the original drug left in the solution. When this pointis reached it is called ultramolecular dosing. This happens at 12cor 24x, where one can be almost 100% sure that there will be nothingof the original substance left in the homeopathic remedy. Thisbecame asource of controversy, and some people who practicedhomeopathy thought that efficacy at ultramolecular doses defiedlogic, and chose to use only the lower potencies. Today, mosthomeopathic practitioners agree that high potencies do work betterthan low potencies, even at ultramolecular doses.In classical homeopathy, it is considered ideal to use only oneindividualized, single simillimum in the treatment of an illness.Much of the \"art of homeopathy\" is that of choosing the correctsimillimum. This is accomplished by means of avery careful historyand exam, as well as incorporating knowledge of the type of personthe patient is (body type and personality type). The practitioner thenpicks the one salient symptom of their illness to match with asimillimum. In classical homeopathy, asingle individualized remedy is chosen, but in modern homeopathy treatments are oftencombined, especially in lower-potency OTC proprietary borneopathic remedies. There is some ongoing controversy within thehomeopathic community about whether multiple remedies are effective or not.Individualization is ahallmark of classical homeopathy, and thishas been aproblem when it has come to developing randomizedtrials. Many homeopathic practitioners will not accept trials withoutindividualization as valid tests of the efficacy of what they do, sinceall their practice involves individualized remedies. The same criticism applies to the use of multiple remedies, which have commonly been used in clinical trials. Hahnemann described one situationwhen individualization was not used and that was for epidemics.During ascarlet fever epidemic, he used belladonna as a remedyepidemicus, and gave it to all patients for both treatment andprophylaxis, reportedly very successfully.In practice, homeopaths use two main types of references: a materia inedica, or book that lists the symptoms that drugs cancause, and arepertory, or index of symptoms and what remediesmight match. The selection of the potency to use is part of the \"art\"of homeopathy, but there are several principles involved. Treatments for mental symptoms are usually prepared using higherpotencies than those for organic symptoms. Treatments for olderpatients are usually made with lower potencies, since older patientscan't tolerate the stirring up of the vital forces produced by highpotencies. Children usually are treated with higher potencies.If patients are not improving with homeopathic remedies, practitioners will often review the remedy they chose. In particular, thehigher potencies must be well selected and are only supposed to beeffective if the right simillimum is used. So, if apractitioner findshis/her patient is not finding symptom relief, they will review thehistory again and perhaps start anew remedy. Also, in homeopathy,treatment will classically produce a \"homeopathic aggravation\"before the illness starts to improve. Practitioners have often supported patients through the aggravation period with placebo use andthis is an accepted practice. Of interest, one aspect of homeopathyis that practitioners tend to campaign against fluoridation of municipal water supplies, with the belief that small doses of fluoride addedto the city water can become naturally succussed as the water travelsthrough the city's pipes. This would, in turn, lead to mass exposureto apotentially toxic potency of homeopathic fluoride. So, homeopathy enthusiasts be active in anti-fluoride citizen's actiongroups in metropolitan areas.In order to clarify what homeopathic remedies are, the followingare examples of afew common remedies dispensed to patients:(1) Allium this is used for neuralgia pain, illnesseswith weepy eyes.(2) Apis (ground up honeybees): this is used for stinging pain,blisters, and fever with dry skin.(3) Arnica (toxic flowering herb): used for shock, pain, bruising, and injuries (arnica is used topically in herbal medicine for injuries).(4) this is used to preventltreat vomiting.(5) Belladonna (herb): for illnesses that mimic anticholinergicsymptoms, like flushing, hot fever, and dilated pupils.Now that we have reviewed the underlying beliefs and practice ofhomeopathy, the question for conventional practitioners is clear:does homeopathy work? There is abody of clinical investigation onhomeopathic remedies.An excellent overview of homeopathic research is found in anarticle by three researchers from the Netherlands2 and published inthe British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1991. Their conclusions led toahuge controversy, and the BMJ received more mail in response tothis overview than they ever received from any prior article. It is ameta-analysis and overview of clinical trials of homeopathic treatment. The investigators reviewed 107 trials, but 2 of these werecomparing one homeopathic treatment with other horneopathictreatments, leaving 105 trials that compared homeopathy with HAWAS MEDICAL JOURNAL, VOL58,FEBRUARY RESORTS ourherbs or dietary supplements is capable of having apatent on them(a patent would make the investment worthwhile in future profits),no company would be willing to try to meet that FDA standard. So,unless the U.S. derives aseparate category for herbs/dietary supplements or any non-patentable health products, to allow for aless-rigorous (and economically feasible) standard of efficacy, thesethings will never receive the funding for the research necessary tobecome FDA-approved. Hence, they will lack standardization,federal controls, or even testing to see if they are safe or effective.Many sources of information about herbs recommend that prior tousing an herb, the patient should discuss its use with their physician,making it important for physicians to know about common herbsused and their safety and efficacy.In general, Western herbalists will use medicinal herbs eithersingly, or mixed in combinations. In Asian cultures, it is veryunusual to see asingle herb prescribed; usually prescriptions are forherbal mixtures. There tends to be acommon belief among herbalists that the \"naturalness\" of the product makes itbalanced, and safe.Many patients will not take any purified extracts of herbs, with thebelief that if asubstance is purified, then itwill take away its naturalbalance and it may destroy its positive attributes. The scientificstudies on herbs are in general small in number, and most of them arenot well done. Many of them are tested only on animals, or usingvery small numbers of patients, or are not randomized or controlledor blinded adequately, or are only in vitro, and many of them aren'tavailable in English.The following is avery brief review of some of the commonestherbal remedies and dietary supplements being used by patientstoday: St. John's Wort, or Hypericum. This is awidely used herbalremedy for mild to moderate depression, and possibly for anxiety(there is atrial ongoing regarding its efficacy for anxiety). There aresome well-designed small clinical studies on St. John's Wort, unlikemany of the other herbal products used. A large long-term NationalInstitute of Health (NIH) trial is ongoing. In the studies to date, ithasdemonstrated efficacy equivalent to imipramine in some.3'4 It's beensafe in the studies to date, much safer than the tricyclic antidepressants, and with far fewer side effects. In the German commission Ereport monograph on St. John's Wort, it is described as having anmonoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor-like mechanism of action,based on two older studies. Subsequently there has been moreresearch produced about itand ithas been shown to have only traceMAO inhibitor effects at clinically relevant doses. There is somerecent evidence that it acts as acombined seratonin, epinephrine,and dopamine reuptake inhibitor.5 Because of the wise not to combine itwith MAO inhibitor use. Hypericumis very popular, and is receiving considerable coverage in the laypress, but long-term studies are needed. It is the most commonlyused anti-depressant in Germany, where itis prescribed three timesmore than any of the antidepressants used in the U.S.A. The BritishMedical Journal published an overview and meta-analysis in 1996entitled, \"An Overview and Meta-Analysis of St. John's Won forDepression\".3'5 They reviewed and combined data from 13 trialscomparing Hypericum with placebo, and demonstrated apositiveeffect on depression, with 55% response to the herb compared to22% responding to placebo. Then they compared it with tricyclics,specifically imipramine, 64% responded to Hypericum with 58% responding to the imipramine. So, it appears to be at least asefficacious (and possibly more efficacious) than the tricyclic antidepressants. It has not been compared to the SSRI antidepressants inclinical trials. Side effects were very similar to placebo, and significantly less than those taking trycyclics. The main side effect documented for Hypericum is photosensitivity, which can occur withlarge doses, though this appears unlikely at usual doses. The timeframe for these studies was short, with only eight weeks maximumfollow-up. Echinaceae. Echinaceae was reported to be the most commonlypurchased herb in the U.S. in 1996-7, There are three differentspecies of Echinaceae sold: E. angustifolia, E. purpurea, and E.pallida. It's available as aroot extract or tincture, and very popularfor use to treat viral URI's. It is used as an \"immune booster\" and totreat colds and other viral and bacterial infections. There are severalpublished studies on Echinaceae, but with apaucity of large randomized controlled blinded clinical trials. Animal and in vitro studiesdemonstrate increased cell-mediated immunity, enhanced macrophage activity, increased phagocytosis, and one Echinaceae species seems to have antistaphylococcal and antistrep activity. Theherbal literature advises it for short-term use only, because it mayactivate the immune system. So, most lay sources advise against itslong-term use, for fear of inducing autoimmune illness, and againstits use at all in patients who have any autoimmune illnesses such asSLE, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis. However, there areno controlled studies to indicate that autoimmune flares have beenaproblem with the use of Echinaceae. Toxicity is reported to be rareand most evidence to date suggests that Echinaceae seems safe.Uva Ursi or bearberry, This is an evergreen shrub, found in theforest of North America. It is an old Native American herb, used totreat and prevent urinary infections. The leaves are chewed andeaten, and are available as pills. This herb appears likely to be safe,with no reported toxicities, but the paucity of good data on safety andefficacy make it difficult to recommend.Saw Palmetto (Seranoa repens). Commercial extract of sawpalmetto (including one called Permixicon) is increasingly used bymen who take it to relieve benign prostatic hypotrophy (BPH)symptoms. The farmers in the southern U.S. are happy about this: theplant is aweedy little palm which takes over the fallow fields, andfarmers must pull the plants out before they can replant their crops,but now they can sell their erstwhile weeds on the market. There issome data to indicate that itmay help relieve symptoms of prostatism, and toxicity in trials to date has been negligible. It contains amixture of chemical compounds and has activity on several levels:there is slight 5-alpha-reductase activity, but likely too little to beclinically significant, and in trials there has been no effect on PSAlevels, which should drop if there is significant 5-alpha-reductaseaction.6 It has been shown to block binding of dihydrotestosteroneto prostate cells' androgen receptors, and this is the most popularcurrent theory for its mechanism of action. One European trialshowed the extract to have similar efficacy to finasteride, and smalltrials comparing it to alpha-blockers have shown no significantdifferences in efficacy.7 All trials are hampered by the presence oflarge placebo effects consistently found in trials about treatment forHAWAII MEDICAL JOURNAL, VOL 58, 1999 Chiropractic was started by afellow named Daniel David Palmerin the late l800s. He had apprenticed to be aM.D., which was acommon method used to become aphysician before they revised themedical education system and started to make students go toaccredited schools. Mr. Palmer thought that there was aflow ofInnate Intelligence through the body (which is alot like ch'i, and the\"vital force\" of the other alternative disciplines). If there wasinterference with the flow, patients would fall sick, and cure couldonly ensue if the practitioner could eliminate the interference. Thisis accomplished by fixing \"subluxations of the spine.\" This is thebasic tenant of chiropractic.To become achiropractor, students must go through four years ofchiropractic education after at least two years of college and thenthey are eligible to get aD.C. degree. Chiropractors are licensed inHawaii. They also have specialization, with the addition of up tothree years of additional training. Chiropractic students can specialize in internal medicine, radiology, sports medicine, orthopedics,neurology and nutrition.There are different kinds of Chiropractors. There are two nationalorganizations and they are called \"Straights\" and \"Mixers\" and thereis ahistory of considerable conflict between the two types. Straightsmake up about 15% of chiropractors, and they are of the more old-fashioned school with the philosophy that all illness is caused byspinal subluxations. They consider themselves as primary carephysicians, they treat all diseases and promote health with chiropractic manipulations. There are even colleges that include thedesignation \"Straight Chiropractor\" in their name to distinguishthemselves from \"mixers\". The Mixers treat mostly back andmusculo-skeletal pain, and sometimes may also use diet, herbs,homeopathy, and other treatments and are not purists who will onlytreat with spinal manipulation. The mixers are amuch bigger groupand they include the practitioners whojust treat back problems withspinal manipulation, and refer everything else to other practitioners.There is fellow from Hawaii named Kurt Butler who is aquack-exposer. He wrote abook about the dangers of alternative medicine,and he relates the following anecdote: In 1989, he went to twelvechiropractors who advertised free initial evaluations in the Honolulunewspaper. When he saw them, he indicated to each of them that hehad symptoms of pressure-like chest pain when he walked withassociated shortness of breath, and that he had epigastric abdominalpain at night that woke him up, which was relieved when he atesomething and came on when he was hungry. So, he presented tothem with symptoms of peptic ulcer disease and coronary arterydisease, and yet none of them referred him to adoctor. All of themindicated aplan to treat him with chiropractic manipulation alone.24Studies on the efficacy of spinal manipulation are conflicting, andmost of them are of poor methodological quality. But there havebeen enough studies that have had positive results that the Agencyon Health Care Policy and Research in the U.S. has recommendedmanipulation for acute low back pain, and the British version of ouragency did the same.Koes, et al., in Spine 1996, did asystematic review of randomizedcontrolled trials of spinal manipulation for low back pain.25 Theypointed Out in this review that this is one of many, and there areprobably more reviews than there are actual studies about spinalmanipulation for low back pain. They viewed 36 randomized controlled trials and compared spinal manipulation with othertreatment. They used acomplex methodological scoring system,with 100 being the best and 0being the poorest. The study with thehighest methodological score of all (which happened to be astudyby Koes himself) was rated only 60 out of a 100. So, the quality ingeneral is very poor. Of these studies, 53% or 19 of those studiesshowed favorable results for spinal manipulation. Of the 5studiesthat had the top methodological scores (between 50 and 60), 3werepositive and 2were positive in the subgroup only. There was no clearrelationship between the methodology score, and whether the results were positive or negative. For acute low back pain, 5 werepositive, 4were negative and 3were positive in the subgroup only.For subacute or chronic low back pain, 5 were positive, 2 werenegative and 1was questionable. So there is atendency for manipulation to appear efficacious. In long term follow-up studies, 6of 16had apositive effect after 3 months. The conclusion was that wedesperately need better trials.There have been concerns about the safety of spinal manipulation,especially after afew case reports in the orthopedic journals of spinaltransection from manipulation.2627 However, the data availableshow arelatively good safety record for low back manipulation.There have been some cases of severe adverse effects from cervicalmanipulation that caused serious concern. However, the rate ofadverse effect is low: most sources estimate 5to 10 adverse eventsout of every 10 million spinal manipulations. The concern is that ifadverse effects do occur, it could be to induce paraplegia, anobviously disastrous effect. One review of cervical manipulation'ssafety efficacy vs. NSAID-use safety and efficacy concluded thatNSAID's efficacy for cervical neck pain has never actually beenstudied, so there is no efficacy data at all. Cervical manipulation,however, has been studied, and there is some evidence that it isefficacious. When risks were compared, even for serious life-threatening complications, NSAID use is statistically much riskier,probably a 100 times riskier than using cervical manipulation.26Advice about Advising PatientsWhen advising patients about the use of alternative medicine,there are some opinions that can be given without concern aboutbeing inaccurate: one is that conventional medicine's ability todiagnose is clearly superior to any known alternative methods andshould be utilized whenever the diagnosis is in question. Second,complementary treatments may have avery useful role when allopathic treatment is insufficient to relieve patients suffering, andwhen the patient won't accept any conventional treatment that hasbeen recommended. Eisenberg, et al. in Annals of Internal Medicine,28 published an article on how to advise patients on alternativemedicine. He states that practitioners should ask non-threateningquestions about \"other\" treatments used to treat illness or to maintain health, and to avoid the words \"alternative\" or \"complementary,\" or other more pejorative terms (e.g., \"unproven\"). Only afteracomplete conventional medical diagnostic evaluation has beendone and advice has been given about conventional treatmentoptions, should a detailed discussion about alternative medicaltreatments be initiated.Dr. Eisenberg considers the following therapies likely to beeffective: spinal manipulation for low back pain, acupuncture fornausea, and relaxation therapy for chronic pain and insomnia.
