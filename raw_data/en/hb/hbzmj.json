On August 13 he was convicted in the Wyong Court, after pleading guilty to offences including intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm. Nilsson is a prolific antivaxxer, deluging unlucky politicians, journalists, health officials, etc with emails containing misinformation about vaccines and warning of the dire consequences to come to anyone involved in vaccination programs. He has been known to harass and threaten. Usually recipients have better things to do than engage with a crank, but he has been known to go too far. As the Sydney Daily Telegraph reported on 14 August 2021: \"Anti-vaccine activist Richard Nilsson pleads guilty to sending death threats.\" \"A Central Coast anti-vaccine campaigner who sent death threats to The Sunday Telegraph journalist Jane Hansen has pleaded guilty to the charge of using intimidation to unlawfully influence a person. \"Richard Nilsson, 66, from Wyongah, sent an email to Ms Hansen's work email address on the evening of February 27. \"The subject of the email was \"WHEN IS A MURDER WARRANTED? YOURS, YES?\" The contents of the email read: 'I am proposing that your murder might well be a celebration of not life but death! And what a celebrated and glorious one at that! 'I know ten thousand that would do it, but of course it only needs one and you will never know until it is too late! 'I expect you might meet your maker, maybe in the near future ... the sooner the better, yes?' \"Ms Hansen has reported widely on vaccination since 2013 when The Sunday Telegraph launched the No Jab No Play campaign, and more recently has reported on the vaccine rollout for Covid-19. \"On February 27, the evening the email was sent, Sky News re-ran a documentary made by Ms Hansen called Big Shots, which looked at anti-vaccine activity in relation to the pandemic and the vaccine rollout. \"Mr Nilsson followed up his email with another with the subject line: \"WHEN IS SLUT NOT A SLUT AND IS A SELECTIVE SLUT STILL A SLUT?\" before launching into a barrage of abuse. \"Mr Nilsson, who runs a business selling colloidal silver, faced Wyong Court on August 11 and pleaded guilty to a charge of use intimidation/violence to unlawfully influence a person. \"He received an 18-month Community Corrections Order to be of good behaviour. \"Ms Hansen said threats to journalists who write on the subject of vaccination were not unusual but Mr Nilsson's emails were unsettling in their violence. 'All journalists get abused on occasion, especially on the currently highly emotive topic of vaccination, and mostly it is best ignored but this email was next level and no one should have to put up with such vile abuse,' she said. \"Mr Nilsson is well known by politicians, who have also received numerous emails from him suggesting all manner of conspiracies, including that Covid vaccination is a mass depopulation exercise.\" Nilsson appeared before His Honour Ian Guy in case number 2021/00159728, R V Richard Michael Nilsson. He was convicted of stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm, an offence under section 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). This attracts a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and/or $5,500. He could also have been convicted of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence, an offence under section 474.17 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Commonwealth of Australia). That carries a maximum penalty of 3 years imprisonment. He was sentenced to a Community Corrections Order requiring him to be of good behaviour. A rational person would have thought themselves lucky that they had avoided years of a high-fibre low-calorie diet of porridge and baked beans, but we are not dealing with a rational person here. Hardly was the ink dry on the Court file, than on the 15th, two days after he was found guilty, Nilsson pounded his foam-flecked keyboard and sent another rant in an email to 130 people and organisations, including politicians, Skeptics groups, a Radiation Oncologist, government departments, doctors, political parties, people in the horse-racing industry, scientists, journalists, lobby groups including climate and conservation organisations, mental health groups, the National Security Hotline, and a coal mining company. It reads: \"Subject: FW: The Hidden Victims of the Covid Vaccine and why I included you all in this email... \"When will it be that enough lives have been ruined and enough have been murdered? And when will the maiming and the killing end? \"My hope is that some of you here own up and confess (I know who among you are in this group and I suspect in time you will all pay a heavy price for your crimes and transgressions), while others it is incumbent upon you to inform all those you purport to represent that the maiming and killing that has transpired and of course is inevitably and scheduled to transpire will continue until such time we say: f_ ck you! \"I know, and some of you know too, who the traitors are. Scott Morrison is just one and Greg Hunt is another and of course Jane Halton, Brendan Murphy and Paul Kelly are other worthless humans and are included and we know they are just tools - plasticised and fake as they are. \"I have an incomplete list of those who need to answer for their crimes and it does not include all I have included in this email. \"Add a Mr Skerrit. His evilness is seen in his face and in his utterings and communications and his connection with Jane Halton and the WHO and the so-called, Australian Health (sickness proliferation) Dep't and Event 201 should not be lost on anyone with brain cells that still operate and are able to coordinate. \"Wake the f_ _k up!\" All emphases and redactions above are as in Nilsson's email. Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister, Greg Hunt the Commonwealth Minister for Health, Brendan Murphy is a former Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Australia and now Secretary of the Department of Health. Paul Kelly is the current Chief Medical Officer, the \"Mr Skerrit\" he refers to is Adjunct Professor John Skerritt, Deputy Secretary, Health Products Regulation Group, Therapeutics Goods Administration. \"Jane Halton\" is a former Secretary of the Commonwealth Dept of Health, now Council Member of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The \"Event 201\" that Nilsson refers to was a tabletop exercise conducted in October 2019 by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (CHS), the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in New York City. According to the CHS, \"\u00aehe exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences\". Event 201 simulated the effects of a fictional coronavirus originating in bats but passing to humans via pigs. Claims that Event 201 was a rehearsal for the COVID-19 pandemic have been debunked by fact-checking outlets such as USA Today and FullFact, but facts have never matter to antivax conspiracy theorists and other assorted cranks. All emergency response authorities and health bureaucracies conduct exercises to identify threats and to develop and improve response plans. There was nothing unusual in \"Event 201\" except in the fevered imaginations of nutters and fruitloops. Does Nilsson, with no qualifications whatsoever, really think that he knows more about emergency response and immunology than those distinguished experts, and all the scientists researching Covid19 and vaccines? How does 20 minutes reading email conspiracy theories trump PhDs, professorships and Nobel Prizes? How conceited does someone have to be to imagine that? Where is the boundary between conceit and dementia? So does accusing honourable people of 'crimes and transgressions,' 'maiming and killing,' being 'traitors,' are evil tools, 'who need to answer for their crimes' constitute the good behaviour that the Court imposed? And coming within hours of the Court hearing? Watch this space. "}
