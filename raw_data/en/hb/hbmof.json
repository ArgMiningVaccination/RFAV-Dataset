Consortium members are leaders from stakeholder communities brought together by their common commitment to steward advances in science, value, and culture necessary for a health system that continuously learns and improves in fostering healthier people. It has been known for some time that a small percentage of patients with complex health and social needs use a disproportionate share of medical care at significant cost to them, the healthcare system, and broader society. There is also substantial evidence that the standard of care provided to these individuals, while costly, often does not meet their expectations. That said, there exists a number of successful programs and models in health systems and communities across the country that are providing excellent care and producing positive results. To date, they have remained positive exceptions to the norm rather than become the standard of care. Beyond the inherent challenges of scaling and spreading promising care models, there is a growing recognition that some federal and state health policies and payment models inhibit rather than facilitate the delivery of more effective and lower cost care and services for high-need patients. NAM hosted three public workshops exploring high-need patients in more depth to inform future policy and practice. Through our inquiry, we found that bold policy action and care delivery reform is needed to improve care for high-need patients and reduce costs. The high-need patient population is diverse, complex, expensive, and dynamic. Addressing their needs will require the appropriate balance between standardized and customized approaches to care. Segmenting high-need patients into smaller homogeneous subgroups using a \"taxonomy\" represents one promising tool to inform and target care and should be rapidly tested in real-world settings in conjunction with care models that have been shown to work. It is clear that effective tools, care models, and policies must extend beyond strictly medical approaches to address social and behavioral factors. In order to be actionable, policy solutions must account for xiv | Effective Care for High-Need Patients existing system constraints and complexities such as the integration of medical and social approaches and the financing of care models. I want to recognize the Peterson Center on Healthcare, who funded these activities at the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) in order to advance our knowledge and actions around this critical issue. The Center also supported associated research projects at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the Bipartisan Policy Center to provide quantitative and policy analysis used to inform these work - shops. Those teams provided invaluable input and shared important perspectives throughout the process, as did Melinda Abrams from The Commonwealth Fund. Thanks also to the hundreds of individuals who participated in the three public workshops. In particular, I want to recognize the patients and caregivers who shared their personal stories at the beginning of each workshop. Their stories provided a powerful reminder why this effort is so important and focused our attention on improving outcomes from their perspectives. Thank you to the planning group, who remained committed, curious, and engaged throughout the process. The process produced a publication that is both comprehensive in its scope and focused on practical policy solutions. Beyond planning the three workshops, two subgroups addressed specific issues that were raised as gaps in our knowledge. The taxonomy and policy workgroups greatly enhanced the utility of this publication. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the leadership demonstrated by the dedicated staff at the NAM (Elizabeth, Katie, Maria, Danielle, Gwen, Emma, Michelle, Marianne, Michael, Daniel Bearss of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Research Center, and Joe Alper) who shepherded this project from its inception through the release of this publication. They organized the three public workshops, supported the working groups, and assisted in the drafting of this publication. As our nation once again debates health care financing approaches that could fundamentally alter people's access to health insurance coverage and medical care, it is critical to focus attention on those individuals who are the heaviest users of health care and commit to improving their outcomes while reducing spending. There are currently major policy barriers to broad implementation of what we already know does work. Future policies and funding proposals that either ignore what we know works or inhibit us from implementing effective care models will be detrimental to the health of these vulnerable populations. If our goal is to improve the health of our most vulnerable neighbors, we must take effective actions now. \u2014Peter V.

Improving care management for this population while balancing quality and associated costs is at the forefront of national health care goals, and reaching this particular goal will require active involvement of a broad range of stakeholders at multiple levels. To advance insights and perspec - tives on how to better manage the care of this population and to stimulate actions on opportunities for improving outcomes and reducing the costs of health care, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), through its Leadership Consortium for a Value & Science-Driven Health System (the Leadership Consortium), in partnership with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), The Commonwealth Fund, and the Peterson Center on Healthcare\u2014which funded this initiative\u2014has undertaken a collabora - tive assessment on strategies for better serving high-need patients.

This publication reports and reflects on the following issues: (1) key character - istics of high-need patients; (2) the use of a patient categorization scheme\u2014or a taxonomy\u2014as a tool to inform and target care; (3) promising care models and attributes to better serve this patient population, as well as insights on \"match - ing\" these models to specific patient groups; and (4) areas of opportunity for policy-level action to support the spread and scale of evidence-based programs. The publication concludes by exploring common themes and opportunities for action in the field. KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH-NEED PATIENTS To date, little has been written about the characteristics of high-need individuals using empirical data, and, as a result, there is not yet a consistent definition of need. Since understanding the characteristics of high-need patients is the first step in determining how to improve care, chapter 2 explores candidate criteria used to identify high-need patients along with key demographic and experiential characteristics. While the high-need patient population is diverse, a synthesis of analyses reported in the literature identified three criteria that could form a basis for defin - ing and identifying this population: total accrued health care costs, intensity of care utilized for a given period of time, and functional limitations. Functional limitations include limitations in activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing or showering, ambulating, self-feeding, grooming, and toileting, or limitations in instrumental activities of daily living that support an independent lifestyle such as housework, shopping, managing money, taking medications, using a telephone, or being able to use transportation (Hayes et al., 2016b). In terms of demographics, recent literature demonstrates that high-need individuals are disproportionately older, female, white, and less educated (Cohen et al., 2014; Hayes et al., 2016b; Joynt et al., 2017). They are also more likely to be publicly insured, have fair to poor self-reported health (Hayes et al., 2016c), and be sus - ceptible to lack of coordination within the health care system (Sarnak and Ryan, 2016). Their needs extend beyond care for their physical ailments to social and behavioral services, which are often of central importance to their overall well- being. As a result, addressing clinical needs alone will not improve outcomes or Summary | 3 reduce costs for this population. Rather, it will also be necessary to address an individual's functional, social, and behavioral needs, largely through the provi - sion of social and community services that today are not typically the province of health care delivery systems (Blumenthal et al., 2016). THE PATIENT TAXONOMY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CARE DELIVERY Understanding how to effectively care for high-need patients requires knowing which factors drive health care need. Because this patient population is het - erogeneous, those factors will differ for different segments of the population. Therefore, a taxonomy that segments individuals in a health system's population based on the care they need as well as how often they might need it can help determine how to serve that population more effectively. Drawing on recent taxonomies developed by two organizations, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and The Commonwealth Fund, as well as the workshop series, the assessment of an expert taxonomy working group, and the published literature, chapter 3 provides guidance on the adoption and application of key elements of a patient taxonomy in practice. Both the taxonomy developed by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the one developed by The Commonwealth Fund segment high-need individuals based on medical characteristics because this is a feasible starting point for most health care systems. Recognizing that a taxonomy focused on medical characteristics may neglect other factors that are key drivers of need, the taxonomy working group built on these efforts to offer a conceptual starter taxonomy that incorporates functional, social, and behavioral factors into a medically oriented taxonomy, not as independent segments but as factors that influence the care model or care team composition most likely to benefit par - ticular patient segments (Figures S-2 and Table S-1). This starter taxonomy can provide guidance for health system leaders and payers on how to embed social risk factors, behavioral health factors, and functional limitations in a taxonomy for high-need patients. Patients would first be assigned to a clinical segment, with follow-on assessment of behavioral health issues and social services needs to determine the specific type of services that are required. Key behavioral health factors most likely to affect care delivery decisions include substance abuse, serious mental illness, cognitive decline, and chronic toxic stress and key social risk factors include low socioeconomic status, social isolation, community deprivation, and house insecurity.4 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Children w/ complex needsMultiple ChronicMajor complex chronicFrail elderlyAdvancing illness1.

One challenge to achieving this is that most health information technology systems do not support integrated and streamlined data collection of patient's physical and behavioral conditions, their care utilization, and their social challenges. Additionally, multiple payers and varied benefits packages pose administrative and operational hurdles for the implementation of a taxonomy. CARE MODELS THAT DELIVER The purpose of taxonomies is to align high-need patients with the care models that target their specific needs. For taxonomies to be actionable, successful care models for different segments of high-need patients must exist. Chapter 4 draws on the workshop series and a review of evidence syntheses and other literature to produce a list of attributes of successful care models and to map successful models to different high-need patient segments. While the success of even the best care model will depend on the particular needs and goals of the patient group a model intends to serve, which varies for different segments of high-need patients, all successful care models should fos - ter effectiveness across three domains: health and well-being, care utilization, and costs. Care models that have been shown to be successful share a number of common attributes, which can be organized in an analytic framework with the following four dimensions: focus on service setting, care attributes, delivery features, and organizational culture. With respect to service setting, generally, the most successful programs for managing high-need individuals focus on either a targeted age group with broad combinations of diagnoses or individuals classified as high-utilizers. Models tend to fall into several broad, nonmutually exclusive categories related to service settings: enhanced primary care, transitional care, and integrated care (Bleich et al., 2015; Boult et al., 2009). Care and condition attributes and delivery features that are common across many successful care models are described in Boxes S-1 and S-2, respectively. Finally, features of organizational culture identified by various authorities that can contribute to the success of care models include the engagement of leadership across levels, customization of the model to the local context, strong team relationships, including patients and care partners, the implementation of appropriate training, continuous assessment with effective metrics, and the use of multiple sources of data (Hong et al., 2014b).6 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients BOX S-1 Care and Condition Attributes of Successful Care Models Assessment .

Chapter 5 explores areas in which policy initiatives could accelerate the spread and scale of care models for high-need patients\u2014particularly the programmatic integration of social supports and medical care\u2014through expanding and realign - ing payment policies, improving the organization of care, developing a workforce to deliver comprehensive health care, and improving the data infrastructure.

SOURCE: Models of Care for High-Need Patients Planning Committee, National Academy of Medicine 8 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Perhaps the most prominent barrier to the adoption of successful care models is payment policies that misalign financial incentives\u2014particularly those that reimburse providers on a fee-for-service basis for discrete medical interven - tions at the expense of a broader assessment and engagement of medical and social needs. While many insurers, including states and the federal government, are starting to embrace value-based purchasing that includes paying for care delivered outside of the traditional medical silo (Bachrach et al., 2014), further progress could be made by combining Medicare and Medicaid funding streams for dual-eligible patients1 into an integrated benefit and care delivery struc - ture that allows flexibility in benefit design to address the full range of patient needs (Hayes et al., 2016a). Virtually all high-need patients have challenging social support needs that determine the success of their care management. To be effective, value-based payment models for high-need patients require sup - porting and rewarding the seamless integration of medical, behavioral, and social services including, where appropriate, support for the delivery of these services in home and community settings (Barnett et al., 2015). This is the aim of shared savings approaches structured to ensure that any savings from the implementation of successful care models accrue to both payers and providers (Hong et al., 2014a). To improve the organization of care, federal and state governments, work - ing with their local partners, will need to engage in a strategy coordinated to incentivize the provision of evidence-based social support services in conjunction with the delivery of medical services. State efforts may be informed by a policy framework developed by McGinnis and colleagues at The Commonwealth Fund to help states establish the infrastructure necessary to support ongoing integration of health and social services, particularly for Medicaid beneficiaries (McGinnis et al., 2014). It is also necessary to prepare the workforce to deliver team-based, comprehensive health care. To accomplish this, academic health centers and professional societies should collaborate on developing new training and certi - fication opportunities that focus on the treatment and social support needs of high-need patients, including training on team-based care and care coordina - tion across health and social sectors (Thomas-Henkel et al., 2015). In addition, credentialing programs, particularly for nontraditional health workers such as community health workers and peer support providers, could be developed. Finally, reliable monitoring and continuous improvement of effective models of care for high-need patients depend on high-quality data and analytics that 1 Dual eligible patients are low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.Summary | 9 can be used to match high-need individuals with specific interventions (Bates et al., 2014; Bradley et al., 2016; Dale et al., 2016; Rajkumar et al., 2015). High- quality data are also required for quality measurement to determine the impact that care models are having on care coordination, utilization, and cost. Currently, there are many disparate systems that cannot easily share information, making it difficult to assess the requirements of high-need individuals and whether they are getting appropriate care. Coordinated federal, state, and local government initiatives must identify barriers that currently inhibit data flow among the clini - cians and organizations treating high-need populations and work to minimize those barriers while respecting patient privacy and data security. COMMON THEMES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION Common to the presentations and discussions among workshop participants was the notion that improving the care management of high-need patients will require bold policy action and system and payment reform efforts by a broad range of stakeholders at multiple levels. Chapter 6 describes important lessons from this initiative and opportunities for action for each relevant stakeholder group: health systems, payers, providers, patients and family or unpaid caregiv - ers, and the research community. Three key care requirements stem from the fact that the population of high- need patients is diverse: segmenting patients based on factors that drive health care need is essential for targeting care; effective care models must address the social and behavioral factors in play for a given patient; and finally, policy action should focus on addressing the existing constraints and complexities preventing the integration of medical, behavioral, and social services and with the way the United States finances care models. Based on these lessons, overarching opportunities for action include: Refining the starter taxonomy based on real-world use and experience to facilitate the matching of individual need and functional capacity to specific care programs; Integrating and coordinating the delivery of medical, social, and behavioral services in a way that reduces the burdens on patients and caregivers; Developing approaches for spreading and scaling successful programs and for training the workforce capable of making these models successful; Promoting payment reform efforts that further incentivize the adoption of successful care models and the integration of medical and social services;10 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Establishing a small set of proven quality measures appropriate for assessing outcomes, including return on investment, and continuously improving programs for high-need individuals; and Creating road maps and tools to help organizations adopt models of care suitable for their particular patient populations. While each stakeholder sector individually may impact a patient's life, a com - munity, or even a regional health delivery system, one of the most expensive and challenging populations for the current health care system will remain underserved until there is a unified effort\u2014rather than small, incremental steps\u2014to improve care for the nation's high-need patients and to reduce the cost of delivering that care.

This population of high-need individuals includes an increasingly hetero - geneous group of people with multiple chronic diseases, members of an aging population, and patients with varying levels of medical, functional, social, and behavioral complexity. Today, 1 percent of patients account for more than 20 percent of health care expenditures, and 5 percent account for nearly half of the nation's spending on health care (Mitchell, 2016). Improving care management for this population while balancing quality and associated costs is at the forefront of national health care goals, and reaching this particular goal will require the active involvement of a broad range of stakeholders at multiple levels. Health care systems have implemented several successful strategies with the hope of improv - ing health outcomes, improving the patient experience, and lowering costs, but a \"best practice\" for high-need patient management has proven elusive; the majority of care remains fragmented, uncoordinated, reactive, and often poorly matched to individuals' circumstances. The nation needs a better understanding of how to best utilize its resources to care for this growing population. To advance insights and perspectives on how to better manage the care of high-need patients and to stimulate actions on opportunities for improving outcomes and reducing the costs of health care for these vulnerable populations, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), through its Leadership Consortium for a Value & Science-Driven Health System (the Leadership Consortium), in partnership with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), The Commonwealth Fund, and the Peterson Center on Healthcare\u2014which funded this initiative\u2014has undertaken a collab - orative assessment on strategies for better serving high-need patients. The project activities were overseen by an independent planning committee and included (1) planning three workshops to explore the state of knowledge and action; 14 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients (2) conducting a literature review of the key studies on the care of high-need patients; and (3) synthesizing the work and proceedings that reflected critical needs and common themes on effective approaches, care models, and possible policy actions to address those needs. This publication synthesizes information and insights gleaned from the workshop presentations and discussions, as well as concurrent and supplemental work led by the partnering organizations, the workshop planning committee, and other external experts and stakeholders, to move the field forward. Partner Organizations The five-way partnership involving the Leadership Consortium, the HSPH, the BPC, the Peterson Center on Healthcare, and The Commonwealth Fund has driven this project, with each partner taking on a specific role. The Peterson Center on Healthcare is dedicated to identifying proven solutions that improve care quality, lower costs, and accelerate the adoption of these solutions on a national level. With the aim of identifying programs that successfully serve the growing number of high-need individuals and potential policy solutions to bring these models to scale, the Peterson Center initiated and provided support for the contributions of the NAM, the BPC, and the HSPH. The BPC examined different policy approaches that might address barriers and accelerate the adoption of proven models for improving care and reducing costs for high-need patients. Its work culminated in a report that was presented at the final workshop and contained draft policy recommendations and areas of opportunity to improve care and outcomes for high-need patients (Hayes et al., 2016a). These recommendations aimed to better align financial incentives, specifically those targeting care for dual-eligible 2 high-need patients. HSPH's role in this project has been to provide an analysis of data to define both clinically and socially meaningful segments of this heterogeneous group of people as a means of identifying subgroups that might benefit from specific types of programs (Joynt et al., 2017). This analysis addressed three key ques - tions relevant to controllable costs: What are the specific characteristics associated with high-need, high-cost patients within these segments? 2 Dual-eligible patients are low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.Introduction and Overview | 15 How do utilization patterns differ between these segments and within the segments? What proportion of the spending and utilization might be reduced for each segment? HSPH's project team has attempted to identify characteristics of providers and health systems that are more effective at caring for high-need, high-cost patients and reducing the costs associated with preventable health care issues. The project team, with the help of The Commonwealth Fund, examined data from the Medicare population and a set of commercial patients. The team has also worked with colleagues at the Peterson Center on Healthcare to examine data on the dual-eligible population. The Commonwealth Fund has placed a primary emphasis on these issues and has served as a strategic adviser and contributor throughout the initiative, lever - aging its extensive portfolio of work focused on improving care for high-need, high-cost patients. A research and funding institution that aims to promote a high-performing health care system, particularly for the most vulnerable, The Commonwealth Fund is also part of a consortium of five national foundations along with the John A. Hartford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Peterson Center on Healthcare, and The SCAN Foundation\u2014all focused on furthering efforts to improve care for high-need patients. The collaboration works to develop resources to understand the diverse high-need population, to identify evidence-based programs that offer high-quality integrated care at a lower cost, and to accelerate the adoption of these programs nationally.3 The National Academy of Medicine As the convening body for this initiative, the National Academy of Medicine\u2014 through its Leadership Consortium for a Value & Science-Driven Health System\u2014brought together experts and stakeholders to reflect upon the key issues for improving care for high-need patients, synthesize the information and insights gathered, and summarize the presentations, discussions, and literature for publication. Broadly, the Leadership Consortium convenes national experts and exec - utive-level leaders from key stakeholder sectors for collaborative activities to 3 For more information on this consortium, see www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/ newsletters/the-commonwealth-fund-connection/2016/aug/aug-2-2016/whats-new/five-health- care-foundations (accessed December 21, 2016). For an example of resources pulled together, see \"the Playbook,\" at http://www.bettercareplaybook.org (accessed December 21, 2016).16 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients foster progress toward a continuously learning health system in which science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for enduring improvement and innovation; best practices are seamlessly embedded in the care process; patients and families are active participants in all elements; and new knowledge is cap - tured as an integral by-product of the care experience. Priorities in this respect include advancing the development of a fully interoperable digital infrastructure, the application of new clinical research approaches, and a culture of transparency on outcomes and cost. Participants in the Leadership Consortium have set a goal that, by 2020, 90 percent of clinical decisions will be supported by accurate, timely, and up-to- date clinical information and reflect the best available evidence. The Leadership Consortium's approach to meeting this goal is to serve as a forum to facilitate the collaborative assessment and action around issues central to achieving its vision and goal. To address the challenges of improving both evidence development and evidence application, as well as improving the capacity to advance progress on each of those dimensions, Leadership Consortium members (all leaders in their fields) work with their colleagues to identify the issues not being adequately addressed, the nature of the barriers and possible solutions, and the priorities for action. They then work to marshal the resources of the sectors represented on the Leadership Consortium to work for sustained public-private cooperation for change. A common commitment to certain principles and priorities guides the activities of the Leadership Consortium and its members. These include the commitment to the right health care for each person; putting the best evidence into practice; establishing the effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of medical care delivered; building assessment and accountability into care; advancing clinical data as a public resource for health improvement; shared responsibility distributed equitably across stakeholders, both public and private; collaborative stakeholder involvement in priority setting; transparency in executing activi - ties and reporting results; and individual stakeholder perspectives subjugated to the common good. Scope and Activities The independent planning committee organized the three workshops (see Appendix B for the agendas) in accordance with the procedures of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The planning committee's members were Peter V. Long, Chair (Blue Shield of California Foundation), Melinda K. Abrams (The Commonwealth Fund), Gerard F. Anderson (Johns Introduction and Overview | 17 Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health), Tim Engelhardt (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), Jose Figueroa (Harvard Medical School), Katherine Hayes (Bipartisan Policy Center), Frederick Isasi (National Governors Association), Ashish K. Jha (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health), David Meyers (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), Arnold S. Milstein (Stanford University), Diane Stewart (Pacific Business Group on Health), and Sandra Wilkniss (National Governors Association). The workshops brought together national experts and stakeholders to explore commonalities and differences among the subpopulations of high-need patients, to consider the lessons learned from targeted intervention activities, to discuss and inform the approach of the ongoing study by the HSPH on the high-cost Medicare population, and to review policy issues and options, including those suggested by the BPC. The first workshop, held in July 2015, laid the groundwork for this project and the subsequent workshops. The presentations and discussions identified the key characteristics of high-need patient populations and subgroups of these heterogeneous populations that offer the greatest opportunity for impact. This workshop also examined the factors that are most important in determining which care models are most effective for particular subgroups of high-need patients; the types of active care coordination and providers of social and behavioral health services and supports in different circumstances; and the lessons from past experiences with high-need patients that can inform efforts to spread and scale successful care models. The second workshop, convened in January 2016, built on the insights from the first workshop and further explored specific issues. The presentations and discussions in the second workshop focused on the use of a patient segmenta - tion strategy to inform which care models are most appropriate for specific sub - population of high-need patients. They also reviewed sources of data to drive segmentation strategies, efforts to build a taxonomy of high-need patients, and specific design elements of a successful care model. Sessions at this workshop also discussed specific replication strategies to spread and scale those models, the barriers to scaling new delivery models, and essential elements for a policy framework that could mitigate those barriers. The third workshop, held in October 2016, discussed the implications of the findings of HSPH's study and the policy strategies identified by the BPC. The presentations and discussions at the third workshop examined tools to improve care delivery for high-need patients, including a taxonomy that matches patient needs to care models with the most potential to improve outcomes and lower costs of caring for high-need patients. This workshop also discussed policy-level 18 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients approaches to support and accelerate the spread and scale of effective care mod - els. An independent rapporteur prepared factual summaries of what occurred at the workshops. Statements, recommendations, and opinions expressed at the workshops were those of individual presenters and participants and have not been endorsed or validated by the NAM. In addition to the three workshops, the planning committee initiated several important supplementary activities. A taxonomy workgroup reviewed existing approaches and developed guidance on adaptation and application of a taxonomy in practice. Chapter 3 includes the findings from the workgroup's efforts and supporting research. A review of care models examined in the literature identi - fied promising types of care models and key attributes for success. This review informs a four-part framework described in Chapter 4, as well as how successful care models might map to different high-need patient segments. A subgroup of the planning committee also examined policy options most likely to reduce the barriers to the spread and scale of successful models. Those deliberations, together with the work of the BPC and others, provided much of the content for Chapter 5. Recurring Themes Informed by discussions, presentations, and concurrent work throughout the course of the project period, this publication reports and reflects on the follow - ing issues: (1) key characteristics of high-need patients; (2) the use of a patient categorization scheme\u2014or a taxonomy\u2014as a tool to inform and target care; (3) promising care models and attributes to better serve this patient population, as well as insights on \"matching\" these models to specific patient groups; and (4) areas of opportunity for policy-level action to support the spread and scale of evidence-based programs. Each of the main chapters begins with a fictional patient vignette highlighting a main point discussed in the chapter. The publication concludes by exploring common themes and opportunities for action in the field. Recurring themes throughout the initiative include those related to: Functional status. Functional status is a central determinant of the nature and level of health care needs. Cost. Patients with complex needs are often high-cost patients, but some high-cost patients do not necessarily have complex needs\u2014for example, those with conditions effectively treated by high-cost interventions. Social circumstances. Accommodation of social circumstances is key to addressing individuals with high needs.Introduction and Overview | 19 Social services. Improving care for high-need patients usually requires engaging services outside of the care system and creating patient- and care- partner-specific care plans. Service linkages. Coordination of care is critical for high-need patients, and success depends on alignment and cooperation between the health care system and services delivered through social, economic, and behavioral programs. Targeting specificity and timeliness. Health care systems with effective and efficient approaches to sustaining and improving levels of function of high-need patients are those most deliberate and active in identifying and targeting needs early on. Payment alignment. Payment models segmented according to individual services offer incentives counter to successful models of care for high-need patients, including those of certain Medicare and Medicaid payment policies. Duration. The nature and level of needs can change over time. A significant number of high-need patients are only transiently high-need. Variability. High-need patients are heterogeneous and no single care model can provide all the services required by high-need patients; relevant approaches must therefore be guided by a taxonomy that matches intervention options with the specific needs of different categories of high-need patients.

Many days he was reliant on a wheelchair to get around because of chronic pain. His job didn't allow him to telework, yet it was difficult to get to the handicap entrance in the back of the building and his schedule was firmly fixed at 9 to 5. As a result, Mark spent more than an hour a day commuting in his car (public transportation wasn't readily available). Everyday tasks like running errands and getting groceries were difficult. Between his pain and his heavy work schedule, he was left with little time to visit with other people, both friends and family, and it had left him feeling incredibly isolated and alone. He really missed having a pet, but he'd had to give his cat, Felix, away because Mark could no longer take care of him properly. Mark felt he wouldn't mind his disease so much if it didn't impact his life and relationships so heavily. Who are high-need patients? A simple definition describes them as indi - viduals with complex conditions and circumstances requiring multiple services that, for the most part, are not currently delivered easily or effectively by the health care system. This definition is impractical, however, for the task of identifying a population. In general, high-need individuals are the most costly patients, but not all high-cost individuals are also of high-need (Zodet, 2016). Many high-need patients are seniors, but younger adults with disabilities, chronic mental illness, and/or substance abuse disorders also require extensive care (Blumenthal et al., 2016b). Some individuals are of high-need for an extended time because they have multiple chronic conditions that may be stable with treat - ment but persist for years while other individuals, such as those treated for certain cancers or complex orthopedic surgeries, may be high-need only temporarily 22 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients (Johnson et al., 2015b). In addition to their formal diagnoses, many high-need patients have functional limitations that affect their ability to get care or engage in activities of daily living. Others may have severe, persistent behavioral health issues, or their conditions may be exacerbated by such nonmedical factors as a lack of housing, food, and supportive personal relationships (Johnson et al., 2015a; Kansagara et al., 2011). This chapter explores candidate criteria used to identify high-need patients along with key demographic and experiential characteristics. The next chapter will consider taxonomic approaches to categorizing this heterogeneous population into subgroups with shared management characteristics as a means of developing strategies to inform planning and delivery of targeted and more effective care for specific subgroups. Identifying High-Need Patient Populations In her presentation at the first workshop, Melinda Abrams from The Commonwealth Fund noted that, to date, little has been written about the characteristics of high-need individuals using empirical data, and, as a result, there is not yet a consistent definition of need. Most studies have examined people who have a specific disease, have multiple chronic conditions, frequently use emergency department services, annually have high individual health care costs, have a disability, or have a mental illness. At some point, noted Abrams, the field will need to settle on a definition. Health care systems and researchers have used several approaches to identify - ing high-need populations. One common and direct approach\u2014which focuses on those patients who accrue the largest annual expenditures on health care\u2014is based on the well-established observation that a small percentage of patients account for a large percentage of the nation's health care expenditures (Cohen, 2015; Cohen and Uberoi, 2013; Stanton and Rutherford, 2006; Zodet, 2016). In 2014, for example, the top 1 percent of spenders accounted for more than 20 percent of total health care expenditures, and the top 5 percent accounted for about 50 percent of the nation's health care costs (Mitchell, 2016) (see Figure 2-1). On the other hand, focusing exclusively on cost provides an incomplete picture of high-need patients. A substantial percent of high-cost individuals incurs those costs for only a limited time (Cohen and Yu, 2012). Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data show, for example, that only 42 percent of individuals who accounted for the top 10 percent of medical expenditures had persistently high spending over a 2-year period. Approximately 30 percent had some reduction Key Characteristics of High-Need Patients | 23 in spending in the second year, while 28 percent had episodic high spending, with lower spending in the second year. Top 1% of spenders account for more than one-fth of all spending Top 5% of spenders account for half of all spending Top 10% of spenders account for two-thirds of all spending Bottom 50% of spenders account for only 3% of all spendingCumulative Percent of Total Spending100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Percent of Civilian Noninstitutionalized Population Ordered by Health Care Spending, 20140.0 0.1 0.5 1.3 2.85.49.917.933.849.577.2100.0 99 95 95 FIGURE 2-1 | Distribution of personal health care spending in the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, 2014. SOURCE: Dzau et al., 2017. Profiling chronic or complex conditions, including behavioral health issues, offers another approach that, on the surface, seems sensible. Ashish Jha from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Jose Figueroa from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, together with colleagues, conducted an analysis of Medicare data to segment the high-cost patient popu - lation into clinically meaningful subgroups (Joynt et al., 2017). 4 As part of this analysis, they developed a list of complex and noncomplex chronic conditions that could be used to help determine level of patient need (see Table 2-1) from key chronic disease groups included by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in its measure for unplanned admission for patients with multiple chronic diseases (RTI International, 2015). The nine complex chronic diseases in Table 2-1 were differentiated by Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues because they account for the majority of spending and morbidity. In fact, an analysis of MEPS data conducted by The Commonwealth Fund (Hayes et al., 2016c) identified approximately 79 million people age 18 or older 4 More details about the segmentation work are discussed in Chapter 3.24 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients (i.e., 30 percent of the population) with three or more chronic conditions,5 indicating\u2014as was mentioned in the article\u2014that simply counting conditions is an oversimplified approach, and additional factors must be taken into account. TABLE 2-1 | Complex and Noncomplex Chronic Conditions COMPLEX CHRONIC CONDITIONS NONCOMPLEX CHRONIC CONDITIONS Acute myocardial infarction disease NOTE : Complexity designation is based on spending and morbidity. SOURCE: Reproduced from Joynt et al., 2017 The most basic identifiers of high need are functional limitations. These include limitations in activities of daily living\u2014self-care tasks that include dressing, bathing or showering, ambulating, self-feeding, grooming, and toileting\u2014or instrumental activities of daily living that support an independent lifestyle, such as housework, shopping, managing money, taking medications, using the tele - phone, or being able to use transportation (Hayes et al., 2016c). If high-need populations are defined as individuals who have three or more chronic condi - tions plus functional limitations, roughly 11.8 million individuals age 18 or older (i.e., approximately 5 percent of the US adult population) would be classified as high-need individuals (Hayes, 2016). Also relevant to the consideration of functional limitations and the way they are best managed is the interplay of physical capacity and mental or emotional status. 5 For this study, chronic diseases were identified using an approach that assigns ICD-9 diagnosis codes (first three digits) to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Clinical Classification System (Hwang et al., 2001; Paez et al., 2009).Key Characteristics of High-Need Patients | 25 For example, the following six circumstances represent compelling limitations and needs: Recovery from acute injury or surgery Intensive therapeutic interventions Chronic addiction-related impairment Long-term mobility impairment Long-term cognitive impairment Needs at the end-of-life Any of these may represent a very high degree of functional impairment or limitation at any given time, but the nature, intensity, and combination of interventions required may vary considerably. Determining an ideal definition for a high-need patient requires a delicate balance. A highly constrained definition will risk missing people, potentially depriving them of needed resources. On the other hand, casting an overly broad definition might include people who are not high-need and do not need addi - tional resources. Abrams noted that basing identification of high-need patients exclusively on cost will miss many people, and if the focus is exclusively on chronic conditions, a large number of people may be identified whose chronic conditions are under control. The Overlap of High-Need and High-Cost Definitions Regardless of which definition is used to identify a high-need patient popula - tion, many of the characteristics of other definitions emerge from the analysis. For example, Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues analyzed Massachusetts claims data, looking broadly at high-cost patients in three categories: the non-Medicare population under age 65, the Medicare population, and the dual-eligible population (Joynt et al., 2017). The analyses of these data reveal that high- cost individuals have more chronic conditions than non-high-cost individuals (see Figure 2-2). Moreover, the number of chronic conditions increases when moving from the non-Medicare under 65 to the Medicare and dual-eligible populations. High-cost patients are also more likely to have a higher number of frailty indicators (see Figure 2-3), which attempt to capture an individual's ability to engage in activities of daily living or their functional limitation status.26 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients FIGURE 2-2 | Mean number of chronic conditions among three groups of Massachusetts residents.

Out-of-pocket expenses for high-need adults averaged $1,669 per person per year, approximately three times higher than for the average US adult ($702) and 44 percent higher than for adults with three or more chronic conditions ($1,157). Annual spending by the top 5 percent of high-need individuals in terms of yearly expenditures exceeded $73,000 compared to nearly $27,600 by the top 5 percent of those with three or more chronic conditions and just under $21,000 by the average adult (see Figure 2-4).

Finally, the high-need adults were more likely to incur and maintain high health care spending over a 2-year period than were either adults with three or more chronic conditions but no functional limitations or US adults overall. It is necessary to use major characteristics identified and validated through various studies to develop a consistent and reliable definition of high-need. For example, taken together, total accrued health care costs, intensity of care uti - lized for a given period of time, and functional limitations could form a basis for defining and identifying a high-need population.28 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients FIGURE 2-5 | High-need adults have more emergency department visits and hospital stays.

According to analyses by The Commonwealth Fund and by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Cohen, 2015), high-need adults are disproportionately older, female, white, and less educated. Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues found the high-cost Medicare population to be disproportionately older, female, and nearly twice as likely to be dual-eligible (Joynt et al., 2017). Hayes and colleagues (2016) reported similar findings (see Figure 2-6). As a group, high-need patients are also more likely to be publicly insured (83 percent were insured under Medicare, Medicaid, or both), have fair to poor self-reported health, and have a behavioral or substance abuse condi - tion. The average median household income for high-need adults ($25,668) was less than half of that of the overall adult population ($52,685), which was only slightly higher than the median household income for adults with three chronic conditions but no functional limitations ($52,499). Functional limitations are key drivers of need. Adults with functional limitations tend to have higher health care expenses than adults with no such limitations (Olin and Dougherty, 2006; Zhang et al., 2015). Studies have also shown that adults with functional limitations are more likely to require care in a nursing home or assisted living facility (Foley et al., 1992; Gaugler et al., 2007). Functional limitations are also one type of patient-reported outcome that researchers believe represents an accurate assessment of an individual's health status and need for services (Wolinsky et al., 2011). A substantial literature shows that, for the population as a whole, medical care influences only a relatively small portion of overall health (McGinnis et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2015b) and that social services expenditures significantly impact population health outcomes (Bradley et al., 2011). Similarly, the importance of social services to the well-being of high-need patients also has a disproportionate impact relative to medical care. Inadequate availability of social services, such as a lack of stable housing, a reliable food source, or basic transportation, can clearly worsen health outcomes in high-need patients (Taylor et al., 2015b). A reality for high-need patients is that their needs often go beyond care for their physical ailments. For example, a study of high-need patients in Washington State who are frequent users of the emergency department for their health care needs found that a majority of these individuals had an alcohol or a substance abuse disorder and mental illness (Mancuso et al., 2004). In fact, for some high-need individuals, alcohol and substance abuse disorders can be 30 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients important contributors to chronic physical and behavioral health conditions, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, depression, anxiety, and other mental and physical disorders (Mertens et al., 2003; Mertens et al., 2005). Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues also found that a mental health diagnosis and an alcohol or a substance abuse diagnosis were both predictors of high-cost status (Joynt et al., 2017). The results of a series of The Commonwealth Fund surveys further illustrate some of the challenges high-need individuals face in receiving adequate care. A 2014 survey, in which high-need individuals were defined as those 65 years or older with three or more chronic conditions or functional limitations, found that high-need individuals are particularly susceptible to a lack of coordination within the health care system (Sarnak and Ryan, 2016). Lack of coordination was determined to be in evidence when test results or records were not available at a medical appointment; there were duplicate tests orders; conflicting information was received from different providers; or a specialist lacked a patient's medical history or the patient's primary care provider was not informed about specialist care. Some 44 percent of high-need individuals reported a care coordination problem over the preceding 2 years compared to 27 percent of other older adults (Sarnak and Ryan, 2016). Additionally, more high-need adults reported that they thought a medical mistake was made in their treatment or care (13 percent) compared to the overall population of older adults (6 percent) and, despite the high level of insurance among this population, some 22 percent reported cost- related problems accessing care compared to 16 percent of the overall population of older adults. A subsequent study by The Commonwealth Fund (Salzberg et al., 2016), based on an analysis of the 2009-2011 MEPS data, also found that being a high-need individual had a substantial impact on the care experience. According to this analysis, high-need adults were more likely to report having an unmet medical need\u2014defined as forgoing or delaying needed medical care or prescription medi - cation in the prior year\u2014and less likely to report having good patient-provider communications compared to all adults or those with multiple chronic illnesses but no functional limitations. Unmet needs were greatest among high-need adults with private insurance and Medicaid. Easy access to specialists did not differ appreciably among the three groups, with approximately 50 percent of the individuals in each group reporting they had no trouble getting referred to a specialist when they believed they needed to see one. One troubling finding from this analysis was that, although 93 percent of high-need adults have a usual source of care, only 46 percent of high-need adults reported that they had a usual source of care meeting the definition of a medical Key Characteristics of High-Need Patients | 31 home in providing care that is comprehensive, accessible, and responsive to the patients' needs. This finding is important, the authors wrote, because medical homes benefit all patients and may especially help high-need patients improve outcomes and reduce spending. They also noted that, while low, the proportion of high-need patients receiving care in a medical home model was greater than the 36 percent of the general adult population who have a usual source of care meeting the definition of a medical home. The most recent survey by The Commonwealth Fund included adults with two or more major chronic conditions, with or without functional limitations; individuals under 65 with a disability; and elderly individuals with multiple functional limitations (Ryan et al., 2016). The findings reiterated many of the conclusions from previous studies, but they also provided a focus on nonmedi - cal aspects of care. For example, Ryan and colleagues (2016) stressed the social isolation and unmet social needs expressed by high-need patients, with nearly two-thirds articulating concern about such material hardships as housing, meals, or utilities. Additionally, of those high-need patients who reported a need for assistance with activities of daily living, only slightly more than one-third (38 percent) responded that they usually or always had someone available. Emotional counseling services were also cited as difficult to access, with less than half of those who may have needed them in the past 2 years able to set up an appoint - ment in a timely fashion. As Blumenthal and his colleagues stated in a discussion paper for the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care Initiative (Blumenthal et al., 2016a), addressing just the health care needs\u2014or, for that matter, the social and behavioral health needs\u2014of high-need patients in isola - tion is likely to be inadequate. As the authors of this paper concluded, \"Health- system leaders, payers, and providers will need to look beyond the regular slate of medical services to coordinate, integrate, and effectively manage care for behavioral-health conditions and social-service needs for functional impairments to improve outcomes and lower spending.\" They also noted that the heterogeneity of the high-need population speaks to the implausibility of finding one delivery model or one program that meets the needs of all high-need patients, stating, \"Payers and health systems may need to divide these patients into groups that have common needs so that specific complex care-management interventions can be targeted to the people who are most likely to benefit.\" Addressing clini - cal needs alone will not improve outcomes or reduce costs. Rather, it will also be necessary to address an individual's functional, social, and behavioral needs, largely through the provision of social and community services that today are not typically the province of health care delivery systems.32 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients References Blumenthal, D., G.

She was having a lot of trouble not only adjusting to her new reality but also navigating all of her new health care needs. Sarah had been a regular runner before the accident, and she had always been in good health, so she was largely unfamiliar with the ins and outs of doctors' offices. She turned to Nora for advice because it seemed as if this family friend was always either coming from or going to one doctor or another. Nora was in her mid-sixties and had been living with diabetes and heart disease for almost 20 years. Nora talked about how her nutritionist had helped her manage her diet, and how helpful her general practitioner was. Sarah was really hoping Nora would be able to help her understand how to navigate appointments with specialists and to recommend a way to get mental health care that wasn't readily covered by insur - ance. Even though Nora had tried to help, Sarah left their conversation feeling more confused. It was apparent that even though she and Nora each had a severe illness, their health care needs were incredibly different. The 12 million high-need patients in the United States are members of a diverse group of individuals affected by a range of medical, behavioral, and functional conditions and limitations (Hayes et al., 2016). Adding a layer of complexity to the effective care of high-need patients is the disproportionate impact of social circumstances\u2014isolation, unemployment, lack of permanent or safe housing, and food insecurity, for example\u2014on this population's health and well-being. Because of the varying needs and preferences of high-need patients, multiple tools and approaches are necessary to ensure that they receive the most appropriate care, with individual patient characteristics and preferences informing 36 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients selection from among care models. Therefore, serving this heterogeneous popu - lation more effectively and efficiently requires construction of a taxonomy that has groupings based on shared characteristics and functional needs. Drawing from discussions and common themes throughout the workshop series and the published evidence, this chapter reports on current approaches in\u2014and evidence for\u2014the application of taxonomies to the management of high-need patients as a means of improving their care. In particular, it provides an overview of the taxonomies used by two organizations, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and The Commonwealth Fund, and guidance on the adoption and application of their key elements in practice. Given the profound role of social risk and behavioral health factors on the health of high- need patients, the intersection of these factors with the clinical domain receives particular attention. This chapter has been informed by two main sources: the insights gleaned from the workshop series presentations and discussions, and the assessment of an expert group of researchers, clinicians, and policy experts on the state of the evidence around the use of a patient taxonomy and their insights on how to advance its utility and adoption. Purpose and Operation of Patient Segmentation Segmenting target populations is not a novel concept. Marketing agencies divide populations and target potential strategies based on shared characteristics. In health care, triage has long been a foundational concept for ensuring that patients with the most urgent needs are given priority for treatment (RobertsonSteel, 2006), and it is an increasingly common protocol to sort cancer patients, for example, based on genomic characterization and various molecular markers to better inform therapeutic strategies (Konecny et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014). Health system leaders can use a taxonomy to better understand their systems' patient populations and inform program planning, care team compositions and work flow, training, and infrastructure investments\u2014leading to improved health and well-being outcomes and reduced costs. Patient stratification strategies can take several forms. For instance, whole population risk stratification segments a health care system's entire patient popu - lation based on a projected risk of requiring care. Health systems create these risk profiles using various risk prediction algorithms that group their patients according to their utilization of services or specific health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Health systems have developed whole popula - tion risk stratification methods to predict the anticipated costs for their specific patient populations. This approach, however, captures only a small fraction of Patient Taxonomy and Implications for Care Delivery | 37 the patients who could benefit from greater oversight or help in managing their conditions (Kansagara et al., 2011), in part because any technique based on the presumption of homogeneity is structurally limiting, and in part because it does not account for the socioeconomic characteristics and behaviors that affect health outcomes. For example, patients with diabetes have highly varied treat - ment requirements, and those with social challenges face still other requirements (Hostetter and Klein, 2015). One of the earliest stratification systems was developed by Kaiser Permanente's cofounder Sidney Garfield, whose parsimonious categorization system comprised four groups for all patients: sick, well, worried well, and early sick (Garfield, 1970). These categories have since been revised: no chronic conditions, one or more chronic conditions, advanced illness, and extremely frail and near end of life (Zhou et al., 2014). The \"Bridges to Health\" model, first proposed by Lynn and colleagues at Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, divides the entire population into eight groups, from healthy to failing health near death (Lynn et al., 2007). Patient segmentation using a taxonomy of the sort described in this chapter is driven by the goal of grouping the individuals in a health system's population by the care they need as well as how often they might need it. Segmentation involves separating the highest-risk patients (as determined using whole population risk stratification) into subgroups with common needs. A key operational concept for a useful taxonomy for patient segmentation is that it should account for the unique factors that drive an individual's health care needs. Patient targeting goes one step further by looking within each segment to identify which patients need the highest intensity of complex care management. Both the literature and discussions with providers indicate that most successful care models, such as those discussed in Chapter 4, use targeting to refine further how they allocate resources more efficiently among their high-need patients. Developing a Taxonomy The need for greater precision is a natural product of the move toward value-based care, the emphasis on patient-engaged care, and the better insights emerging on what works best under different circumstances. While a general consensus exists on the benefits of segmenting high-need patients to target care (Vuik et al., 2016), work is still in progress on the optimal definitions of patient groups. For high-need patients in particular, we know that any taxonomy must take into account social risk and behavioral health factors at play\u2014areas that need much elaboration (Johnson et al., 2015a; Kansagara et al., 2011).38 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Developing and implementing any taxonomy to guide service delivery to high-need patients requires solving numerous challenges. Segmenting high-need patients into meaningful subgroups requires access to information about their physical and behavioral conditions, their care utilization, and their social chal - lenges. Most health information technology systems, however, do not support this type of integrated and streamlined data collection. The most readily avail - able source of information is claims-based data, but these data offer a limited, condition-based perspective of patients and are not available in real time. Electronic health records (EHRs) can serve as a key source of data, but the design of many EHR systems does not enable them to collect data on behavioral issues, social challenges, or functional limitations (Institute of Medicine, 2014a, 2014b). The burden on health systems to collect, store, and properly use data are additional practical and logistical considerations. A patient taxonomy that is effective in driving more productive treatment strategies for the high-need patient pool requires a delicate balance between precision and generalization. It is impractical to assume that every relevant feature can be captured and characterized for each patient. Although defining patient subgroups and sub-subgroups introduces more precision into categoriz - ing patients, a taxonomy that contains too many subgroups is not feasible to implement. On the other hand, having too few groups is an oversimplification and does not meaningfully inform care planning and management. In addition, multiple payers and varied benefits packages pose administrative and operational hurdles for the implementation of any taxonomy. Medicaid is of particular con - cern because a disproportionate number of high-need patients are covered\u2014at least in part\u2014by the program, yet coverage varies widely from state to state. Chapter 5 covers this subject in more detail. Identifying Segments To address the challenge of creating an actionable stratifying tool, the taxonomy workgroup developed a conceptual starter taxonomy. In the third workshop, Melinda Abrams, vice president for delivery system reform at The Commonwealth Fund and chair of the taxonomy workgroup, explained that the medical aspects of this taxonomy build largely on the work of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health group, led by Ashish Jha and Jose Figueroa. Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues conducted a set of analyses of Massachusetts claims data to empirically derive mutually exclusive subpopulations of high- need patients in three distinct populations: the non-Medicare population under age 65, the Medicare population, and the dual-eligible population (Joynt et al., Patient Taxonomy and Implications for Care Delivery | 39 2017). While claims data are often maligned, said Jha in the second workshop, in his opinion they are currently the best way to draw a picture of high-need, high-cost individuals in the United States. Through a yearlong iterative process, with input from clinical leaders and working closely with a group led by Gerard Anderson at Johns Hopkins University, the Harvard team defined the subpopu - lations with a noniterative, hierarchical categorization that assigned patients to groups of increasing complexity. The resulting six subpopulations, in the order in which individuals are classified, are listed as follows: under-65 disabled who are not included in the non-Medicare under-65 population; frail, with two or more frailty indicators; major complex chronic, with two or more chronic condi - tions from a list of nine major chronic diseases that account for the majority of spending and morbidity; minor complex chronic, with one chronic condition from the list of nine major chronic diseases; simple chronic, which includes less severe conditions such as hyperlipidemia; and relatively healthy. Individuals are assigned to no more than one of these groups by first determining whether the patient is under 65 or 65 or older. Individuals under 65 are assigned to the first category. Of those individuals age 65 or older, those with two or more frailty indicators are assigned to the frail elderly group. Last, the remaining individuals are assigned to one of the final four categories based on the number of chronic conditions they have (Joynt et al., 2016). Jha noted that this may not be the ideal way to segment the population, but he believes it is a reasonable approach. One limitation is that it does not specifi - cally address patients with advanced illness or those patients at the end of life. Jha added that it would be important to examine other populations, particularly children, and try to understand the characteristics of providers that do better with one subpopulation as compared to another. Building on the Harvard group's work and an analysis of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data by Anderson and colleagues at Johns Hopkins (Roberts and Anderson, 2014), Abrams and collaborators at The Commonwealth Fund looked at how to characterize some of the issues and challenges facing high-need and high-cost patients. As explained by Melinda Abrams during the second workshop, the Commonwealth Fund team examined segmentation and programmatic literature, such as program evaluations and case studies, as a \"reverse engineering\" strategy to identify patient groups based on how existing programs identified and segmented patients. The team also conducted interviews with health system leaders, program experts, and payers, and they collaborated with an advisory group to define 11 specific patient groups, including a stand- alone segment for individuals with social risk and behavioral health factors. After further consideration and analysis, Abrams and colleagues merged some of these 40 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients segments into six subpopulations: under-65 disabled, advancing illness, frail elderly, complex chronic conditions, multiple chronic conditions, and children with complex needs.6 At any given time, patients are assigned to just one of these six segments and their designation is determined by their medical needs that are driving their health care costs. For example, a frail elderly individual with multiple chronic conditions would be assigned to the frail elderly segment because the frailty indicators are what is driving medical needs and ultimately costs. However, over time, as their medical needs change, patients may shift between segments. In her presentation at the second workshop, Abrams explained some of the logic behind merging categories and settling on these six subpopulations. For example, for people with functional limitations, it did not matter whether they were under or over age 65. The two larger subcategories that made more sense practically were under-65 disabled and frail elderly. With regard to Jha's subcategories of major complex chronic, minor complex chronic, and simple chronic, Abrams said those were based on elegant work, but for practical purposes, those were too finely divided. As a result, The Commonwealth Fund team merged them into two categories: complex chronic conditions and multiple chronic conditions. Additionally, the stand-alone category of patients with social risk and behavioral health factors actually spanned all of the medical categories. Abrams noted that while the segmentation literature is small and greatly variable in terms of qual - ity and rigor, it did suggest some additional segments beyond Anderson's and Jha's work, including advanced illness, end-of-life, and children with complex conditions (Lynn et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2014). Addressing some of the limitations of this work, Abrams said there are mul - tiple plausible segmentation strategies, and the approach taken depends on the audience and the purpose. In addition, this work was based on limited data sources. \"We need more information from patients, social services agencies, and interoperable systems,\" said Abrams during the second workshop. She noted, too, that segmentation is, at this stage, inherently imprecise, and she emphasized the need for more comprehensive data on patients that would be more informative than claims data, as was stated in a 2014 Institute of Medicine report (Institute of Medicine, 2014a). 6 This taxonomy was presented by Abrams at the second workshop.

Behavioral and social assessmentBEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACTORS SOCIAL RISK FACTORSNon- elderly disabled A Conceptual \"Starter\" Taxonomy While still theoretical, taxonomies such as the ones Jha and Abrams laid out are medically oriented approaches. Given the availability of data, grouping patients according to medical characteristics is a feasible starting point for most health systems: the patient groups are clinically meaningful and carry implications for care delivery, and health systems can access information needed to identify and assign patients to groups via claims and EHR data. Assigning a patient to one of these groups tells only part of the patient story, however, and may neglect other characteristics and factors that are key drivers of functional limitations and health care spending. Here, the taxonomy workgroup offers a conceptual \"starter\" taxonomy for high-need patients (see Figure 3-1) that builds on the ones Jha and Abrams described to illustrate the incorporation of functional, social, and behavioral factors into a medically oriented taxonomy, not as independent segments but as factors that infl uence the care model or care team composition most likely to benefi t a particular patient in one of the segments. Fundamentally, this starter taxonomy aims to be actionable to inform care and workforce decisions and to refl ect the reality of the data that are available to health system leaders. Table 3-1 describes the criteria for each group. Because the segments were based largely on the work of both the Harvard and The Commonwealth Fund teams, there are limitations to clinical grouping that arise from the fact that the categorization was informed by the structure of limited datasets. For example, while children with complex needs are included, other high-risk groups worth further consideration, such as high-risk pregnan- cies, adolescents, and those who have suffered a traumatic event such as a brain or 42 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients spinal injury, were not specifically designated as a segment. In addition, because identification of functional impairment is intrinsically tied to the clinical segments, the segments may not capture the complete diversity of functional limitations. TABLE 3-1 | Clinical Group Features CLINICAL GROUP FEATURES Children with complex needs Have sustained severe impairment in at least four cat - egories together with enteral/parenteral feeding or sustained severe impairment in at least two categories and requiring ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure A Non-elderly disabled Under 65 years and with end-stage renal disease or dis - ability based on receiving Supplemental Security Income Multiple chronic Only one complex condition and/or between one and five noncomplex conditionsB,C Major complex chronic Two or more complex conditions or at least six noncom - plex conditionsB,C Frail elderly Over 65 years and with two or more frailty indicatorsD Advancing illness Other terminal illness, or end of life A Categories for children with complex needs are: learning and mental functions, communication, motor skills, self-care, hearing, vision B Complex conditions, as defined in (Joynt et al., 2016), are listed in Table 2-1. C Noncomplex conditions, as defined in (Joynt et al., 2016), are listed in Table 2-1. D Frailty indicators, as defined in (Joynt et al., 2016), are gait abnormality, malnutrition, failure to thrive, cachexia, debility, difficulty walking, history of fall, muscle wasting, muscle weakness, decubitus ulcer, senility, or durable medical equipment use. This starter taxonomy can, however, provide guidance for health system leaders and payers on how to embed social risk factors, behavioral health factors, and functional limitations in a taxonomy for high-need patients. Patients would first be assigned to one clinical segment based on what medical needs are driving their health care costs, with follow-on assessment of behavioral health issues and social services needs to determine the specific type of services an individual requires. For example, the major complex chronic conditions patient segment would include patients who simultaneously have diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, suggesting that a care team should include a complex care manager. If some of the patients also have severe depression, bipolar illness, or other behav - ioral health conditions, their care team would require someone with training in behavioral health issues. If the patient subpopulation also has unstable housing and sources of food, the care team would require personnel with expertise in addressing housing and food security. The model also assumes that the medical, Patient Taxonomy and Implications for Care Delivery | 43 behavioral, and social needs of patients will change. For example, an individual patient could move from frail elderly to advancing illness, which would suggest shifting resources from medical care to hospice care. High-Impact Social Risk and Behavioral Health Variables Two important components of this starter taxonomy are the social risk and behavioral health factors that affect a patient's health and influence the spe - cific needs of each individual in a particular segment defined by medical and functional status. A review of the literature on social domains that affect care, insights from planning committee members and outside experts, and a survey of available resources (such as the National Association of Community Health Center's Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences [PRAPARE], a tool for assessing their patients' social determinants of health),7 produced a list of four high-impact variables in the social services domain which were determined to be the most likely to affect care delivery decisions (see Table 3-2).

Salzberg also found that high-need individuals with behavioral health condi - tions made 27 percent more visits to hospital emergency departments, used 35 percent more home health care days, were more likely to have unmet medical needs, and were less likely to have easy access to specialists or have good patient- provider communication compared to high-need individuals who did not have a behavioral health condition. Moreover, 34 percent of high-need adults with a behavioral health condition remained in the top 10 percent of spending over a 2-year period compared to 23 percent of high-need adults without a behavioral health condition. The subpopulation of high-need adults with a behavioral health condition is relatively younger; is more likely to be white, female, and less educated; is more likely to have lower income and fair or poor health status; and is more likely to be insured by Medicaid, either alone or in combination with Medicare. A list of four high-impact behavioral variables, which were determined to be the most likely to affect care delivery decisions (see Table 3-3), was developed by a review of the literature, insights from planning committee members and outside experts, and a survey of available resources.

Some variables, such as race and ethnicity (Jackson et al., 2016; Larney et al., 2016; Morton et al., 2016; Segal et al., 2016) and incarceration (Wang et al., 2013), can affect health but are rooted in deeper systemic issues that are beyond the scope or purpose of this taxonomy. A vari - able such as health literacy can have a significant effect on health (Baker et al., 2007; Bennett et al., 2009; Institute of Medicine, 2004; Schillinger et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2016), but the inventory of effective care models discussed in Chapter 4 does not directly address health literacy. As Abrams explained, the committee thought about the process of selecting the four social and the four behavioral health variables in terms of the taxonomy and its ability to match with the care model exemplars. FIGURE 3-2 | A framework for health with all of the factors that would go into an ideal taxonomy. NOTE: SES = Socioeconomic status.

In the third workshop, Abrams described an ideal patient taxonomy\u2014one not yet achieved\u2014that could provide a holistic assessment of how care should be targeted and delivered to improve the health of high-need individuals (see assessment of a patient's medical, behavioral, functional, and social characteristics to inform Figure 3-2). Developing such an approach for each patient segment, however, requires the integration of systems that capture physical, behavioral, and social information. Currently, this level of systems integration is only just starting to take place. FIGURE 3-3 | Differences in the proportion of high-cost patients in six patient categories for three distinct payer groups. SOURCE: Adapted from Jha Minor Complex ChronicFrail Simple ChronicMajor Complex Chronic with the proposed conceptual models, though, it is possible for health system leaders and payers to determine practical information about their high- need population segments. In the second workshop, Jha provided an example Patient Taxonomy and Implications for Care Delivery | 47 of the type of useful indicators a medically grounded taxonomy could produce. When Jha, Figueroa, and colleagues analyzed spending patterns among the three payer groups and six subpopulations of patients used in their taxonomy, the analysis revealed some surprises (see Figure 3-3), Jha said. For example, in the commercially insured, under-65 non-Medicare population, the majority of spending is by individuals in the minor complex chronic and simple chronic seg - ments. Spending in the Medicare population differs greatly, he noted, with the frail and under-65 disabled accounting for the bulk of the high-cost patients. In the dual-eligible population, the under-65 disabled segment accounts for nearly half of the high-cost patients. FIGURE 3-4 | Preventable spending by patient group in the Medicare population. SOURCE: Reproduced from Jha Chronic Relatively HealthyPREVENTABLE SPENDING BY PATIENT CATEGORY Percentage of population Percentage of preventable spending The Harvard team also examined preventable spending among all of the Medicare patients included in the Massachusetts dataset (see Figure 3-4). For a definition of preventable, they looked at ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. For ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, most of the spending is by the frail elderly, who account for 10 percent of the total Medicare population and 45 percent of all hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. Jha discussed another analysis showing the mean distributional spending among high-cost patients (see Figure 3-5). For example, average annual inpatient 48 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients spending by a high-cost under-65 disabled individual is $15,947, and outpatient spending accounts for another $13,344, but the biggest cost for these individuals is Medicare Part D spending on drugs, which is $23,003 (Joynt et al., 2016). In contrast, Part D spending by the frail elderly represents a small proportion of total spending, with inpatient care and postacute care and long-term care being the big-ticket items for this group (Joynt et al., 2016). FIGURE 3-5 | High-cost Medicare patients' distributional mean spending by patient category. NOTE: = Durable Medical Equipment; PAC = Post-Acute Care; LTC = Long-Term Care SOURCE: from al., 2016.Under-65 DisabledFrail of distributional analysis, Jha explained, highlights the different spending profiles of the subpopulations and the need for health system leaders and payers to think carefully about how to address the expense of caring for these different types of high-cost patients. Segmentation offers opportunities for payers to more effectively target finite resources and improve outcomes, which ideally will reduce the total cost of care. In this way, a formal taxonomy can ideally inform the development of care plans and the allocation of resources to the interventions, assisting in a threefold aim to improve the care match with patient goals, improve patient outcomes, and improve the efficiency of care delivery. Highlighting the needs and use profiles Patient Taxonomy and Implications for Care Delivery | 49 of the various subpopulations, a taxonomy can help health care system leaders and payers make informed investments in a program, care team composition, work flow, training, and infrastructure. In Chapter 4, we discuss some models\u2014 many focused on specific segments of the high-need population\u2014that health care system leaders can implement or look to for best practices. For a taxonomy to serve those purposes, however, it is necessary to align efforts across health systems and payers to ensure that payment structures incentivize, rather than hinder, effective care\u2014a subject discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.

Gloria had steadily advancing dementia, and she wouldn't be able to take care of herself after surgery, which meant that wound care and other recovery duties would fall on Raphael and his wife, Maria. When Gloria first returned home, Raphael and Maria struggled. Neither had any medical background beyond Maria's CPR training, and they weren't sure how to tell if Gloria's surgery site was healing correctly. Their insurance offered to pay for a visiting home nurse, however, who came twice a day to change Gloria's bandages and to check on her. When Gloria began to show signs of infection, the nurse recognized it before Raphael even knew something was wrong, and she was able to have it treated quickly. She also taught them about community resources\u2014which their insurance would cover\u2014that would help them handle Gloria's dementia symptoms. Raphael was incredibly thankful for the service and unsure how they would have managed without it. For a patient taxonomy to be actionable, it needs to inform the care of high- need patients by identifying key care elements that align with the needs for specific patient populations. At the same time, providing effective and sustain - able care for high-need individuals within those populations requires identify - ing attributes and features of care models shown to improve the experience and outcomes of the patients and reduce the cost for individual patients and the communities in which they live (Berwick et al., 2008). To examine how these two critical components relate, speakers at the first and second workshops dis - cussed the intersection of models of care and taxonomies. Additionally, a review of evidence syntheses and other literature on care models for high-need patients identified promising models, classified areas of convergence, and produced a list of attributes holding the most potential to improve outcomes and to lower costs.56 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Characterizing Successful Models Defining a successful care model starts with the goals of the stakeholders involved. In general, successful care models foster effectiveness across three domains: health and well-being, care utilization, and costs. The success of even the best care models depends on the particular needs and goals of the patient a model intends to serve, and those will vary even within segments of the high-need population. Dual-eligible patients, for example, are often considered a high-need group or segment as a whole, but as Randall Brown from Mathematica Policy Research explained at the second workshop, nearly 40 percent of this population does not need extensive services (see Figure 4-1). Even among those dual-eligible individuals who have severe chronic illnesses, only some require long-term sup - port services that need to be integrated and coordinated. Each of these different dual-eligible subpopulations benefits from different managed care models or fee-for-service models. FIGURE 4-1 | Variations in the needs of dual-eligible individuals. SOURCE: Adapted from Brown presentation, January 19, 2016Percentage of Dual-Eligible Individuals In nursing homes (18%) In community, using long-term support services (18%) Severe chronic illness, no long-term support services required (26%) Less severe or no chronic illness (38%)18% 18% 26%38% Different high-need segments will require different services and workforce competencies. A patient taxonomy may help define the competencies needed in the workforce, noted David Atkins from the Department of Veterans Affairs during workshop 2, but there are likely to be generalizable aspects that cut across the different segments. \"As we look at these segments and map successful programs to the different populations, we may find [that] two segments that look different from a program perspective are actually served by similar looking Care Models That Deliver | 57 programs or that there are common elements in each of the programs that address the needs of these segments.\" At the third workshop, Arnold Milstein of Stanford University noted the profound changes that models of care have undergone over time. \"It wasn't that long ago that there were five boxes that defined America's care models. You could either end up in the office of a surgeon, a medical doctor, or an internist, or you could end up in a hospital general surgical ward or a hospital general medical ward, and maybe an OB ward, but that was it. Over the last 100 years, as medical knowledge and health care delivery science have begun to advance, there has been a lot of evolution and customization, most of it with very good results.\" Milstein's statement is borne out by the increasing abundance of care mod - els available for high-need patients. As the number of models has grown, researchers have reviewed and classified these models and their attributes to determine how and why different models realize success (Anderson et al., 2015; Berry-Millett and Bodenheimer, 2009; Bleich et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2015; McCarthy et al., 2015; Nelson, 2012; Salzberg et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2015a; Zurovac et al., 2014). These reviews and syntheses span the heterogeneous populations and settings for which the models are designed. Synthesizing areas of convergence in the evidence base for the wide variety of models, attributes, and implementation techniques in the third workshop, Milstein outlined four dimensions or areas of focus that constitute a possible analytical framework for identifying successful care models: (1) focus of ser - vice setting; (2) care and condition attributes; (3) delivery features; and (4) organizational culture. In the remainder of the chapter, a selection of the sup - porting research for each dimension of this framework is provided, together with a summary of a conceptual mapping exercise to illustrate how a patient taxonomy may inform care or care model selection. In addition, the chapter presents an example of implementing a population health approach to deliver - ing primary care. Focus of Service Setting The first dimension of the framework categorizes the service setting of models. In general, the most successful programs for managing high-need individuals focus on either a targeted age group with broad combinations of diagnoses or individuals classified as high-utilizers. Models tend to fall into several broad categories related to care settings: enhanced primary care, transitional care, and 58 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients integrated care. In a synthesis review they conducted in 2009 (Berry-Millett and Bodenheimer, 2009), Berry-Millett and Bodenheimer found a similar cat - egorization of care management by setting. Their categories included primary care, vendor-supported care, integrated multispecialty groups, hospital-to-home systems, and home-based care. A review of evidence for successful models of comprehensive care for older adults with chronic illness identified 15 types of models, including compre - hensive patient care, pharmaceutical care, and preventive home visits (Boult et al., 2009b). Each type of model had different levels of supporting evidence for measures of success such as quality of care, increased functional autonomy, and use or cost of health services. A separate study by Brown and colleagues found the strongest evidence for reductions in hospital use and cost of care from select interdisciplinary primary care models, care coordination programs focused on high-risk patients, chronic disease self-management programs, and transitional care interventions (Brown et al., 2012). Grounded primarily in the typology of successful care models for older adults with chronic conditions (Boult et al., 2009b) and The Commonwealth Fund's evidence synthesis of care models for high-need patients (McCarthy et al., 2015), the framework presented lays out nonmutually exclusive categories of promising care models (see Box 4-1). The primary and transitional care settings are the two key categories because of strength of the evidence base and potential for spread and scale in today's clinical practices. Additionally, interdisciplinary and enhanced primary care\u2014two care model categories that are often distinct in the literature\u2014are combined because overlapping and indistinguishable definitions suggest a single category for primary care models. The three subcategories of primary care\u2014interdisciplinary primary care, care and case management, and chronic disease self-management\u2014are highlighted but are not mutually exclusive. For example, Care Management Plus is a successful example of an interdisciplin - ary primary care model, but there is clear overlap with a care management approach (Brown et al., 2012). Furthermore, there is a specifically emphasized category for models that fea - tures the integration of medical, social, and behavioral services because of the importance and impact that engaging factors outside of the medical care system has on improving care for high-need patients. Meaningful care often requires alignment, coordination, and cooperation by the care system with social and behavioral health programs and services. For example, during the first workshop Robert Master, of Commonwealth Care Alliance, explained that a challenge BOX 4-1 Service Setting and Focus of Successful Care Models Enhanced primary care .

Interventions are usually led by a nurse, known as a \"transition coach,\" who provides patient education about self-care, coaches the patient and caregiver about com - municating with providers, performs a home visit, and monitors the patient (e.g., Naylor Transitional Care Model).

For many segments of high-need patients, these highly integrated models can be the most effective, especially for populations with high levels of social or behavioral health needs. Care AND CONDITION Attributes While the details of any given model will be guided by specific conditions, suc - cessful care models share many common care attributes\u2014the second dimension of the framework. Research has identified attributes that lead to successful models. For example, in their evidence synthesis McCarthy and colleagues (McCarthy et al., 2015) found several attributes to be widespread in successful models, includ - ing targeting patients likely to benefit from the intervention; coordinating care and communication among patients and providers; promoting patient and fam - ily engagement in self-care; comprehensively assessing patients' risks and needs; providing appropriate care in accordance with patients' preferences; relying on evidence-based care planning and patient monitoring; and facilitating transitions from the hospital and referrals to community resources. Targeting patients who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, based on a comprehensive patient assessment and subsequent segmentation, is a key common attribute of successful programs (Boult et al., 2009b). Reviews of exist - ing care models have indicated that comprehensive assessments should include multiple dimensions such as medical diagnoses, physical functioning, social risk factors, and behavioral health concerns (Boult and Wieland, 2010; Hong et al., 2014b). The factors that determine who is most likely to benefit include both the conditions that cause them to need a high level of care (Brown et al., 2012) and the patient's amenability to complying with treatment protocols and change behaviors (Hibbard et al., 2016; Hibbard et al., 2015). With a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of needs of the patient, care providers can select a suitable care plan. Another common attribute among successful models is that a dedicated care coordinator\u2014usually a social worker or registered nurse\u2014located in the physi - cian's office coordinates care for patients. One important role for the care coor - dinator is to develop an ongoing working relationship with the patient, family members, and other informal caregivers, as well as with the physicians caring for that patient (Berry-Millett and Bodenheimer, 2009; Bodenheimer and Berry- al., 2012; Hong et al., 2014b). An analysis of program design in Medicare's demonstration projects on disease management, care coor - dination, and value-based payment found that the nature of interactions among care managers, patients, and physicians was the strongest predictor of success in Care Models That Deliver | 61 reducing hospital use (Nelson, 2012). These interactions occurred in a variety of ways, such as meeting patients in the hospital or occasionally accompanying patients on visits to their physician. Effective care communication, through coaching and education, can play an important role in engaging the patient and family in sharing decision making, actively managing care, and developing a care plan that best reflects a given patient's goals and desires\u2014all common attributes of successful care models. When describing Minnesota's Health Care Home (HCH) program at the first workshop, Bonnie LaPlante, HCH interim director and capacity building and certification supervisor in the Health Policy Division at the Minnesota Department of Health, explained that care coordinators develop relationships with the patients while physicians identify their panel of patients and commit to helping each one understand that better care results from choosing a primary care provider. Patient monitoring, strategic use of data to provide timely feedback to the care team, and facilitating transitions between inpatient and outpatient or nursing home care are other important attributes of successful programs. Transitional care interventions have been shown, for example, to reduce hospital readmissions by as much as one-third (Englander et al., 2014; Feltner et al., 2014; Kansagara et al., 2015). On the whole, there is convergence in the literature around many common care attributes. The eight attributes highlighted in the framework (see Box 4-2) are based on McCarthy and colleagues' (2015) synthesis, as well as other pertinent literature.

Seamless transitions across time and settings SOURCES: (Anderson et 2015; Bodenheimer and 2012; McCarthy et al., 2015; Nelson, 2012)62 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Delivery Features The third dimension of the framework addresses delivery features. As with the evidence supporting common care attributes, there is substantial overlap in the indications supporting specific features. In the second workshop, for example, Brown highlighted two managed care plan models that show some evidence for improvement and that share many of the same features. The first model, Geisinger Health System's Patient-Centered Medical Home (ProvenHealth Navigator) (Maeng et al., 2015), embeds care managers with primary care providers to identify and work with the truly high-risk cases that are identified on a list the case managers receive. The care managers have links to physicians at other care sites and serve as the communication hub. The second model Brown discussed, the Comprehensive Care Physician model (Meltzer and Ruhnke, 2014), has eliminated hospitalists to improve the continuity of care for all of its high-risk patients and instead allocates these patients to specific physicians who have limits to their panel size to increase their interaction with their patients. This model uses interdisciplinary teams and data-driven meetings to improve care and care coordination. Both of these programs achieve meaningful shared savings. Brown and colleagues' analysis of the Medicare Care Coordination Demonstration identified six practices of care coordinators that were common among the more successful programs for high-need individuals (Brown et al., 2012): Care coordinators had monthly face-to-face contact with patients; they built a strong rapport with physicians through face-to-face contact at the hospital or the office; and they acted as a communications hub for the many providers involved in the care of these patients and between the patient and those provid - ers. In addition, the care coordinators used behavior-change techniques, not just patient education, to help patients adhere to medication and self-care plans; they also had reliable information about patients' prescriptions and access to phar - macists or medical directors. Finally, the care coordinators knew when patients were hospitalized and provided support for the transition home. In his presentation at the second workshop, Rahul Rajkumar, deputy direc - tor at the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), noted that after 5 years of studying various approaches for change, CMMI has developed an abstract understanding of some of the common delivery features of success - ful models. Among those features are using team-based approaches, providing enhanced access to providers, proactively using continuous data to improve care, working across the medical neighborhood with a very select group of medi - cal subspecialists, engaging patients in shared decision making, and stratifying patients based on risk.Care Models That Deliver | 63 The common delivery features highlighted in the framework (see Box 4-3) represent these more granular activities that are required to realize the common attributes. BOX 4-3 Delivery Features of Successful Care Models Teamwork . Multidisciplinary care teams with a single, trained care coordina - tor as the communication hub and leader Coordination . Extensive outreach and interaction among patient, care coor - dinator, and care team, with an emphasis on face-to-face encounters among all parties and collocation of teams Responsiveness . Speedy provider responsiveness to patients and 24/7 availability Feedback . Timely clinician feedback and data for remote patient monitoring Medication management .

Prompt outpatient follow-up after hospital stays and the imple - mentation of standard discharge protocols SOURCES: (Anderson et al., 2015; and Berry-Millett, 2009; McCarthy et al., 2015; Nelson, 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2014) Organizational Culture McCarthy and colleagues' (2015) synthesis of common attributes, in which they separate the feature content (i.e., the what) and the method (i.e., the how), inspired the fourth dimension of the framework: the incorporation of organi - zational culture. A study of 18 successful complex care management programs for high-need, high-cost patients with multiple or complex conditions\u2014often combined with behavioral health problems or socioeconomic challenges\u2014recommended a number of operational approaches (Hong et al., 2014b). In particular, this study highlighted the success of programs that adapted and customized their approaches and teams to the local context and caseload. Success often involved structuring the size of the program to better facilitate communication and adapting the program as local circumstances changed or evolved (Anderson et al., 2015). During the first workshop, LaPlante described an example of a clinic in Minnesota's HCH that might start with a care plan in which a registered nurse 64 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients serves as the care coordinator, but over time the plan adapts to changing cir - cumstances and adds a social worker or a community health worker as a care coordinator and involves other health care team members to contribute their talents to care coordination. She noted that some of the state's small, rural, solo-practice clinics do not have the resources to hire a care coordinator and have just started assessing their population and identifying what would be best for that population. In addition, because care management programs are highly specialized, customized training for team members enhances success. This may involve offering specialized education and training for providers and team members (American Geriatrics Society Expert Panel on the Care of Older Adults with Multimorbidity, 2012; Hong et al., 2014b) or using care managers who have already received specialized training (Bodenheimer and Berry-Millett, 2009; McCarthy et al., 2015). The Health Resilience Program (HRP) in Oregon, which was a 4-year-old program at the time of the first workshop, is a care program for high-need, high- cost patients that marries a nontraditional workforce with a safety net of primary care practices. The program's primary workforce, explained Rebecca Ramsay, director of community care at CareOregon, consists of master's degree-level community outreach specialists paired with culturally specific peer-support spe - cialists and addiction recovery mentors to work intensively with CareOregon's highest-risk and highest-need patients. These specialists focus primarily on the social determinants of health, but they are embedded in practices and function as part of a primary care team. \"We have hired skilled behaviorists and peers with community outreach capacity and excellent engagement skills who spend 60 to 70 percent of their time in the community going to shelters, hospitals, park benches, and single-room occupancy housing, the places where our clients are living their lives,\" said Ramsay during the first workshop. She continued, \"They are trained in trauma-informed care, and they are learning evidence-based trauma-recovery interventions.\" Those interventions include seeking-safety methods (Najavits, 2001) and eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), both of which have proven effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse. Behavioral health clinicians provide clinical supervision, with dotted-line supervision provided by a primary care champion. Ramsay also discussed the strong operational relationships that have developed among HRP program staff, and McCarthy and colleagues' (2015) synthesis of care models cites effective interdisciplinary teamwork as of one of the execution methods of successful models. Boult and Wieland, however, noted that, for many primary doctors, the inability to effectively treat complex chronic patients was Care Models That Deliver | 65 exacerbated by not having the proper training or experience to work in a team setting (Boult and Wieland, 2010). Molly Coye, social entrepreneur in residence at the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation, explained in the second workshop that some programs have seen substantial changes in workforce roles, highlighted by the inclusion of social workers, licensed professional counselors, behavioral health specialists, and pastoral professionals as principal members of the integrative care teams who serve to coordinate a broad range of behavioral health and social services, including help with housing and financing. Embedding case managers in the practice to facilitate access and build trusting relationships with both patients and primary care providers can help solidify complex networks (Hong et al., 2014b; Nelson, 2012). The workforce is not the only adaptive feature of successful care models. Effective use of data access, sources, and application can vary considerably and have a significant impact on the construction and responsiveness of a program (Hong et al., 2014b; McCarthy et al., 2015). Data sources themselves range from qualitative in-person assessments to such sophisticated health information technologies as interoperative electronic health records and patient-generated outcomes data from wearables and trackers\u2014all of which care programs could use to assess outcomes or attribute value. Health systems can also use metrics gathered by the care team to evaluate and improve care models and their perfor - mance (American Geriatrics Society Expert Panel on the Care of Older Adults with Multimorbidity, 2012; McCarthy et al., 2015). As an example of how metrics can inform care, John O'Brien, vice president of public policy at CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, explained how CareFirst gives providers access to a suite of data and analytic reports, called SearchLight, that uses clinical claims and other information to help them hot-spot across their population. If these analytic tools identify a patient who needs additional services, SearchLight provides a link to the iCentric service request hub for referrals or requests for additional services, such as a medication consult with a pharmacist. To help the providers use and make sense of the SearchLight data, CareFirst employs 22 program consultants. In addition, CareFirst uses 300 nurse care coordinators as the interface between the patient, the provider, the care plan, and the community at large. O'Brien said a care coordinator who senses something is missing from someone's care can request a consult from a regis - tered nurse, who will go into the home to look for fall risks, gaps in care, lack of medication adherence, and lack of a caregiver. The information from that consult then feeds back to the care team. Informed by these practices, and with grounding in recommendations from Hong et al., 2014, Anderson et al., 2015, and others, the six elements of 66 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients organizational culture included in the framework reflect the strong convergence of common operational approaches to successful care models (see Box 4-4). BOX 4-4 Organizational Culture of Successful Care Models Leadership across levels Customization to context Strong team relationships, including patients and care partners Training appropriate to circumstances Continuous assessment with effective metrics Use of multiple sources of data SOURCES : (Anderson et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2014; McCarthy et al., 2015) Care Models that Deliver and the Patient Taxonomy A Conceptual \"Crosswalk\" Exercise Examples of health care systems that use validated care models to success - fully address the high-need and high-cost patients abound (see Appendix A for examples). Indeed, the lack of models is not a significant barrier for any delivery system that truly wants to improve care delivery for this population (Anderson et al., 2015; Boult et al., 2009; Brown et al., 2012; McCarthy et al., 2015). Specific characteristics of a given system's patient population will influence the requirements, as Brown discussed during the second workshop: a patient in the community is going to have different care delivery requirements than is a patient in an institution, while individuals with a fee-for-service Medicare plan may have different needs than are individuals who are in a managed care plan. To demonstrate the utility of the starter taxonomy described in Chapter 3 for selecting appropriate care models, the committee performed the following con - ceptual mapping exercise on a sample of 14 successful care models that highlight many of the attributes, delivery features, and operational practices described in the framework Milstein proposed. Selected programs span the range of potential models, including interdisciplinary primary care (e.g., Guided Care, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly [PACE]); care and case management (e.g., Integrated Care Management Program at Massachusetts General Hospital); transitional care (e.g., Naylor Transitional Care Model); and programs with strong integration of medical, social, and behavioral services (e.g., Improving Mood: Promoting Access to Collaborative Care Models That Deliver | 67 Treatment [IMPACT]). The sample programs were chosen in part due to the available evidence to support effectiveness across three domains: health and well-being, care utilization, and costs.9 Using the targeted populations described by the selected models, the committee determined which segment or segments proposed in the taxonomy would be served by that care model. The committee also determined whether the selected models were designed to specifically target individuals with complex behavioral or social factors. An illustration of the resulting \"crosswalk\" is shown in Figure 4-2. This diagram shows that there are successful care models that apply to each of the 9 An exception was made for pediatric-specific programs because of a dearth of evidence.FIGURE 4-2 | A sample of 14 care models which have evidence of success, matched to the six population segments identified in the taxonomy showing that each segment has been matched to at least one program.

Additionally, the diagram shows that there are areas of overlap, with some programs being applicable to multiple segments in the taxonomy and some segments being served by multiple programs. Even with this limited selection of care models, the range of available options enables targeting of individual care models to specific patient groups based on characteristics and needs. Consequently, this crosswalk demonstrates that, with a patient taxonomy and \"menu\" of evidence-based care models that incorporate many of the care attributes, delivery features, and operational practices identified in the framework laid out in this chapter, health systems would be better equipped to plan for and deliver targeted care based on patient characteristics, needs, and challenges. This crosswalk was performed solely as a conceptual mapping exercise to illustrate how a patient taxonomy can inform care: it is not an exhaustive crosswalk of all evidence-based care models. The intent of this exercise was to demonstrate the practicality of matching specific care models (e.g., GRACE or Hospital at Home) to identified patient groups (major complex chronic with social risk and/or behavioral health factors or advancing illness, respectively) to guide practical translation of this knowledge. In addition, many models could be matched or adapted to multiple patient groups, which Figure 4-2 suggests but may not fully reflect. Similar to the taxonomy, this is one approach\u2014a starting approach\u2014and is intended only to be illustra - tive. Theoretically, such a mapping exercise could also identify programs that are needed to meet the needs of specific segments otherwise lacking in targeted care models. An Example from the Crosswalk As a specific example of a well-served segment, Milstein highlighted two populations during his presentation at the second workshop: the frail elderly, and the frail elderly with social risk and/or behavioral health. He then dis - cussed those programs that he and his colleagues identified as favorably impacting health and well-being, measures of utilization, or cost (net of the cost of the program itself). He noted that although a range of interventions improved the health and well-being and cost domains, much of the research used to evaluate the programs was completed before the field recognized the growing importance of patient experience. He expressed confidence, how - ever, that \"some of these programs would have also moved the needle on patient experience.\"Care Models That Deliver | 69 For the frail elderly population,10 Milstein described two potential programs as appropriate matches. The two programs were the Transitional Care Model, developed by Naylor and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania (Bradway et al., 2012; Hirschman et al., Wieland, 2010; Hirth et al., 2009; Lynch et al., 2008), which was developed to serve elderly in San Francisco's Chinatown-North Beach neighborhood (Ansak and Zawadski, 1983; Zawadski and Ansak, 1983). In reviewing the two programs, Milstein explained that the Transitional Care Model has a target population of hospitalized, high-risk older adults with chronic conditions. Key components of this intervention include multidisciplinary provider teams, led by advanced practice nurses that engage in comprehensive discharge planning; 3-month post- discharge follow-up that includes frequent home visits and telephone availability; and active involvement of patients and family members in identifying patient and family goals and building self-management skills. Research has demonstrated that this program is effective at reducing rehospitalizations and patient health care expenditures (Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, 2017). The target population for PACE includes adults age 55 and older who are publicly insured, have chronic conditions and functional and/or cognitive impairments, and live in the service area of a local PACE organization. Many PACE participants are dual-eligible individuals. Each PACE site provides com - prehensive preventive, primary, acute, and long-term care and social services, including adult day care, meals, and transportation. An interdisciplinary team of health professionals provides PACE participants with coordinated care that for most participants enables them to remain in the community rather than receive care in a nursing home. Patients receive all covered Medicare and Medicaid ser - vices through the local PACE organization and at a local PACE center, thereby enhancing care coordination. Clinical staff are employed or contracted by the local PACE organization, which is paid on a per-capita basis and not based on volume of services provided. Several research groups have evaluated PACE programs around the country (Boult et al., 2009b; Eleazer, 2000; Gross et al., al., 2008; Meret-Hanke, 2011; Pacala et al., 2000; Weaver et al., 2008). These evaluations have found that participants in PACE programs are hospitalized less frequently but make more frequent use of nursing homes; Milstein noted, however, there is also evidence that PACE programs may be more effective than 10 Frail elderly is defined as over 65 and with two or more frailty indicators, as defined in (Joynt et al., 2016) (gait abnormality, malnutrition, failure to thrive, cachexia, debility, difficulty walk - ing, history of fall, muscle wasting, muscle weakness, decubitus ulcer, senility, or durable medical equipment use). For more information, see Chapter 3.70 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients home- and community-based waiver programs in reducing long-term nursing home use, especially for those individuals with cognitive impairments. PACE program enrollees have lower mortality rates and experience better quality care on some measures, such as pain management. The program appears to be cost neutral to Medicare and may have increased costs for Medicaid, though Milstein said more research is needed on this facet of the program. Another subcategory, frail elderly with social risk and/or behavioral health problems,11 benefited from a different set of programs, including the IMPACT program developed at the University of Washington (Callahan et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2003; Unutzer et al., 2002; Unutzer et al., 2008; Van Leeuwen Williams et al., 2009), and the Maximizing Independence at Home (MIND at Home) program developed at Johns Hopkins University (Black et al., 2013; Johnston et al., 2011). The IMPACT program targets older adults with depression and includes collaborative care and a care manager. Each individual's primary care physician works with a consulting psychiatrist and a depression care manager\u2014who can be a nurse, social worker, or psychologist supported by a medical assistant or some other paraprofessional\u2014to develop and implement a treatment plan, including antidepressant medication and/or short-term counseling. The care manager also educates the patient about depression and coaches the patient on self-care techniques. Providers use ongoing measurement and track outcomes validated through use of a depression screening tool, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and adapt care to changing symptoms. Once a patient improves, the care manager and patient jointly develop a plan to prevent relapse. A randomized, controlled trial of 1,801 adults over age 60 with depression or dysthmic disorder or both revealed that half of patients had a greater than 50 percent reduction in depressive symptoms compared to 19 percent of patients in the control group (Unutzer et al., 2002). Net of intervention costs, the total cost of health care was $3,363 less per patient than for patients in the control group (Unutzer et al., 2008). The MIND at Home program targets elderly patients with memory disorders. It is a home-based program that links individuals with dementia and their caregiv - ers to community-based agencies, medical and mental health care providers, and community resources. An interdisciplinary team, comprising trained nonclinical community workers and mental health clinicians, delivers individualized care planning, implementation, and monitoring for both patient and caregiver based on comprehensive in-home dementia-related needs assessments the clinicians 11 High-impact social risk variables are low socioeconomic status, social isolation, community deprivation, and housing insecurity. High-impact behavioral health variables are substance abuse, serious mental illness, cognitive decline, and chronic toxic stress. For more information, see Chapter 3.Care Models That Deliver | 71 conduct. In addition to ongoing monitoring, assessment, and planning for emergent needs, the team uses six basic care strategies: resource referrals, atten - tion to environmental safety, dementia care education, behavior management skills training, informal counseling, and problem solving. Each component of the intervention is based on best practice recommendations and evidence from prior research, and the components are combined for maximum impact. The team also provides education, skills training, and self-management support for patients and families. An 18-month trial of MIND at Home, involving 303 people age 70 and older with memory disorders\u2014primarily dementia\u2014and mild cognitive impairment, found that those individuals in the MIND at Home program were able to stay in their homes an average of 288 extra days over the subsequent 2 years compared to individuals who received no special care. Participants who met regularly with care coordinators were less likely to leave their homes or die than were those in the control group, and they had fewer unmet care needs, particularly with regard to safety and legal and advance care issues (Samus et al., 2014). The researchers reported that the caregivers of individuals in the MIND at Home program also seemed to benefit in terms of reducing the amount of time they needed to spend with the individuals in their care (Tanner et al., 2015). While these care models share many of the care attributes, delivery features, and organizational characteristics outlined in the framework presented in this chapter and include a variety of different service settings, in order to be suc - cessful, they need to be tailored to the health system, the community, and the unique patient characteristics that drive health care need. For example, in the case of the frail elderly segment, the characteristics that drive the need for health care relate to the frailty indicators that must be managed by interdisciplinary teams, often with social supports including family members and community social services, where available. When these individuals also have mental health issues, specialized coordination with appropriate mental health care providers becomes important. Denver Health: A \"Real-World\" Application Denver Health represents one example that pulls together the use of whole popu - lation risk stratification, the practical use of a patient taxonomy, targeted care, and many of the care attribute and delivery features of successful care models. Simon Hambidge, chief ambulatory officer at Denver Health and professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado, spoke about the program at the sec - ond workshop. Referring to Denver Health as \"unusual,\" Hambidge explained 72 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients that it combines a safety net hospital, a large federally qualified health center (FQHC), a public health department, an emergency 9-1-1 call center, and several school-based health centers. Though the work he discussed in his presentation took place in Denver Health's FQHC, it impacted the rest of the organization. The goal of this CMMI-funded project was to improve the experience of care, improve the health of populations, and reduce per capita costs of health care. To meet that goal, however, a fourth goal should be added: improving provider engagement and creating healthier and happier providers. Some $9 million of the $19.8 million CMMI award was spent on redesigning health teams; another $9 million was spent on health information technology to enable population segmentation and patient risk stratification; and the remaining funds were spent on rapid-cycle evaluation to enable design iteration. Patient Risk Stratification Denver Health's risk stratification approach uses clinical risk groups (CRGs), a clinically based classification system originally developed by 3M to measure a population's burden of illness (Hughes et al., 2004). This approach uses input from clinicians and data analysts to assign every CRG-classified patient to one of four tiers of increasing complexity and risk (see Figure 4-3), with additional criteria used to override a CRG designation.12 As an example, Hambidge explained that a child on Denver Health's special health needs registry or individuals with certain mental health diagnoses would receive increased care coordination regardless of what their CRGs would normally warrant. Similarly, a family history of prema - ture birth would result in a pregnant woman being targeted for more intensive interventions no matter where she fell on the CRG stratification scale. He also noted that different stratification algorithms are used for adults and children. Matching Care Delivery to Tier Level For healthy adults (i.e., those assigned to Tier 1), standard panel management techniques, including a heavy reliance on Denver Health's eTouch text mes - saging program, have produced good clinical outcomes, Hambidge said. These outcomes include decreased no-show rates, higher immunization rates, and higher well-child appointment rates. Individuals in Tier 2 start to get increased care management for chronic diseases. For children, Tier 2 care management involves lay patient navigators, some nurse care coordination, and some home visits and environmental scans for children with asthma. For adults, Tier 2 care 12 NOTE: This risk stratification does not directly map on to the taxonomy described in Chapter 3. However, it is an example of a system that could be used to assist in care delivery.Care Models That Deliver | 73 includes more pharmacotherapy management and emphasizes transitions of care to reduce readmissions.

Integrated behavioral health assessments and care are standard for patients in these two tiers, as is the involvement of nurse care coordinators, clinical pharmacists, and clinical social workers. For Tier 4 patients, which Hambidge said is where the biggest cost savings and clinical benefits are realized, Denver Health relies on specialized intensive outpatient clinics for adults and multidisciplinary special needs clinics, similar to those prevalent in children's hospitals, for its highest-risk pediatric patients. The intensive outpatient clinic is targeted to adults with multiple, potentially avoidable, inpatient admissions within 1 year, and it serves as the patient's medical home. Panel sizes in this clinic are smaller, and the care teams include a dedicated social worker and navigator. This clinic also works closely with the Mental Health Center of Denver. Outcomes Hambidge said the total number of \"super-utilizers\" is stable, but individual turnover is high, which creates a dynamic population (Johnson et al., 2015b). A population- and individual-level analysis of Denver Health's data showed that over a 2-year period only a small number of superutilizers continuously met the criteria to be considered a superutilizer, and a slightly larger number went 74 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients back and forth between meeting and not meeting those criteria. This analysis, he said, shows the importance of developing a population-based stratification system even though individuals are getting care. \"You have to step back and look across the population to see who is coming into and going out of your system.\" These data also show the importance of taking a population-based, actuarial approach when conducting financial analyses. As Hambidge explained, the natural tendency for high-utilizing patients to become less so over time would lead to an overestimation of cost savings based on individual results. Denver Health's data at the individual patient level, for example, showed that charges were reduced by 44 percent and admissions fell by 53 percent without any clinical intervention simply because of this natural tendency for individuals to move out of the high- utilization group. When the financial analysis was conducted using population- based cost avoidance as the metric, however, the true savings were approximately 2 percent, or $6.7 million, over a 1-year period, which Hambidge characterized as significant and important. \"Even though programs such as this have significant clinical impact and significant impact on family and provider satisfaction, they are going to be sustainable based on financial performance.\" Most of the savings, he added, came from Denver Health's adult population, but some 15 to 20 percent of the savings were realized from its Tier 4 pediatric population. The demonstrated success of models of care such as those being implemented by Denver Health and other forward-thinking health systems to improve the care of high-need patients and perhaps reduce the cost of care raises an obvious question: why are more health systems not adopting these models of care? Chapter 5 discusses some of the barriers to the wider spread and scale of successful models of care and raises some possible policy solutions to address those barriers.

He has frequent doctor appointments, and he feels lucky that between his Medicare and Medicaid benefits, most of his costs\u2014for his general practitioner, pain management specialist, psychiatrist, and cardiologist\u2014are covered. Often, the most difficult part of his health care routine is trying to figure out what is covered under Medicare and Medicaid, and by whom. Even though the staff at his various doctors' offices are willing to help him, Andy still spends hours trying to figure out what he is eligible for, and whether Medicare or Medicaid or both will pay for it. Andy doesn't understand why his Medicare and Medicaid coverage are so separate. They're both part of the federal government, aren't they? While a range of programs have been shown to improve care for high- need patients, a variety of barriers have prevented successful programs from expanding beyond a single site or led them to be discontinued after an initial trial. These barriers are complex and span a range of factors: health sys - tem fragmentation, high implementation start-up costs with uncertain returns on investment; the challenge of integrating (and paying for) social and other nonmedical services with medical care; the difficulty of replicating care models developed in one setting across disparate settings; workforce training issues; and the need for appropriate quality measures and a data infrastructure to inform those measures. A number of barriers, however, have actionable solutions, with the key foundational issue often being federal-, state-, and health-system-level policies that exacerbate the challenges of caring for high-need patients. This chapter explores areas in which policy initiatives could accelerate the spread 80 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients and scale of care models for high-need patients\u2014particularly the programmatic integration of social supports and medical care\u2014through developing a workforce to deliver comprehensive health care, expanding and realigning payment poli - cies, reexamining quality measurement, and improving the data infrastructure. Although the committee recognizes that prevention of the chronic conditions associated with high-need patients\u2014through both public health and medical interventions\u2014is a critical pursuit, this publication does not address policies that focus on population health and prevention. Many elements central to population health strategies (e.g., integration of social services and medical care) are relevant to the issues in this publication, however, and considering steps to increase pre - vention efforts could perhaps be the focus for future work by those concerned with improving the lives of high-need patients. Spreading and Scaling Successful Care Models In his presentation at the second workshop, Arnold Milstein from the Clinical Excellence Research Center at Stanford University noted that an important barrier to spreading and scaling care models is the complexity of health care delivery systems. In Milstein's experience, system leaders are interested in adopt - ing a new care model if the model would affect only one area of operations, such as primary care or neurology. Any idea for lowering the cost of providing better care that required cooperation among and across multiple departments, however, was typically rejected by system executives. \"We are still in a situation where systems are challenged by the complexity of the job they face simply in delivering care, let alone improving it,\" he said. He also noted the challenge and cost of adapting a model developed to serve one particular subpopulation of high-need patients in one specific setting to another subpopulation in a dif - ferent health care setting. One approach Milstein suggested to dealing with these challenges would be to create a network of improvement communities that would bring together parties interested in scaling models of care to chart what does and does not work for various settings. Creating a network of improvement communities could accelerate the transfer of insights about better care methods and scaling approaches, and he credited organizations such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement for starting to engage in these types of learning activities. Milstein also suggested that spreading and scaling efforts might benefit from a research effort to apply simulation modeling, using continuously generated patient data, to identify actions to improve care and lower cost. The resulting simulation models would then be available as a national asset.Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 81 Though the challenges to spreading and scaling models of care are signifi - cant, research has identified helpful tactics for spread and scale. During the first workshop, Deborah Peikes from Mathematica Policy Research discussed some of the factors for successful scaling that she and her colleagues found in stud - ies conducted for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The identified success factors included substantial financial incentives; support from multiple payers, such as coordination and aligning spending, technical assis - tance, data feedback, staff support, and reporting requirements; adapting data and technical assistance to reflect the considerable diversity of practices, health systems, markets, and patients; and monitoring or auditing, particularly if the funder bears risk, to ensure that programs are implemented as intended (Dale et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2015a). Despite Milstein's observation that health system leaders are reluctant to adopt models that require widespread changes in a health system, Peikes and colleagues found that practices that spread a model broadly throughout the practice were the most successful at implementing the model. Strong and consistent leadership is also critical for successful model adoption, and technical assistance on leader - ship and teamwork may help spread interventions. She noted that implementing a care model piecemeal in an organization puts too much burden on clinician champions, leads to unclear roles and responsibilities, and does not encourage the development of a learning health system. At the first workshop Lisa Mangiante from the Pacific Business Group on Health (PBGH) discussed lessons learned from efforts to spread the Intensive Outpatient Care Program (IOCP) model that Milstein and Alan Glaseroff developed for high-need patients in California's Health Homes program. Between May 2012 and July 2015, this high-touch, care-coordinated, patient-involved, and team-based care model (see Appendix A) has been spread to 23 delivery system partners in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington, and it encompasses some 500 practices and 15,000 patients. Of the 23 health system partners who partici - pated in this CMS-funded scaling project, 20 are sustaining this model in their operations by integrating the model into their overall population health strategies. Mangiante explained that there is a great deal of payment and organizational variation among the partners, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program, Pioneer accountable care organizations (ACOs), Medicare Advantage Plans, and fee-for-service operations. Partners included independent practice associations, medical foundations, and both integrated and nonintegrated systems. When discussing what was involved in scaling the IOCP model, Mangiante said PBGH started with what it called the A List of medical groups in California: those that already had track records of innovation, did well with innovation, 82 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients had an infrastructure in place to implement this model, and had supportive leadership. Those A List groups had IOCP operational within 10 months. Once Mangiante and her colleagues had successful experiences working with the A List groups, they added less aligned and less sophisticated providers who required ongoing support. Mangiante noted the following key characteristics that enable this model to scale and launch successfully at new sites, many of which overlap with the framework of attributes for successful care models described in Chapter 4: provider-hospital integration and integration into a larger population health strategy; adapting to the local environment after meeting core requirements; a strong analytical capability enabling aggressive patient monitoring with regular feedback; hir - ing effective care coordinators; identifying physicians and nurses who welcome disruptive innovation; training staff in didactic, interactive, and peer-to-peer learning; giving physicians a role in patient selection; developing intensive local patient outreach with close contact between physician and patient; ensuring strong support from senior leadership; having dedicated physician champions; and targeting those most likely to benefit from this program. With regard to sustaining the model once it is operational, she said it is critical for the programs to involve multiple payers as a means of creating a solid revenue stream. Given these types of lessons, an important consideration for spreading and scaling successful models of care for high-need patients could be having payers and health systems work both separately and in tandem to more aggressively implement these models. Gerard Anderson from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reported at the third workshop that payers could help foster success by tying payments to improving the patient experience, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita cost of care; they could also target resources to populations most likely to benefit from these models as well as in a manner consistent with best practice. Health systems, meanwhile, could work with peers to identify promising models and work with payers to develop alternative contracts that pay for services not covered by fee-for-service arrange - ments (see page 86 for more on payment policies). Health systems could also commit to adequate investments in training, practice redesign, and information technologies. Working together, payers and health systems could explore the use of the patient taxonomy as a tool to match patient groups to tailored care models that better meet individual characteristics, needs, and challenges. Anderson also pointed to the need for more research on developing programs that can be adopted widely in a variety of settings. To help inform efforts to spread and scale effective models of care, he suggested more research in areas such as identifying people at high need in actual practice settings, identifying Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 83 individuals who are likely to be high-need patients in the future, identifying the best methods of care coordination, developing cost-effective implementation practices, and developing methods for effectively integrating medical and social services. As he noted, the importance of integrating social services and medical care is embedded in the other four policy areas\u2014workforce development, pay - ment policy, quality measures, and data infrastructure. Integration of Social Supports and Medical Care A recent analysis by McCarthy and colleagues found that comprehensive tran - sitional care and case management involving patients and their caregivers after hospitalization is an important integrative feature of successful care models for high-need patients (McCarthy et al., 2015). As part of an effort to provide a framework for understanding the nature and extent of integration in programs that integrate long-term services and supports (LTSS) with medical care and behavioral health, the Long-Term Quality Alliance concluded that a critical element of a fully integrated model includes having a plan for health systems to accept responsibility for integrating medical care, postacute care, behavioral health care, pharmaceutical care, transitional care, and LTSS, including transportation and housing (Long-Term Quality Alliance, 2016). As noted in Chapter 2, functional limitations are an important contributor to the disproportionate share of health care spending in the United States associ - ated with high-need patients. In his presentation at the first workshop, Bruce Chernof from The SCAN Foundation noted that addressing a person's medical needs without also addressing functional limitations will have little impact on the cost or quality of care for these high-need patients. He also pointed out that social determinants of health,13 which have been largely considered beyond the purview of the medical system, can have the biggest effect on ameliorating functional limitations. This is why successful models for improving care for high- need patients, such as those described in Chapter 4, often include the integration and delivery of social services in addition to better coordinated medical care. Enacting policies to facilitate the integration of social services and medical care is crucial for obtaining better outcomes for high-need individuals. 13 The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion defines social determinants of health to be social, economic, and physical conditions of an individual's life and surrounding environment, such as income, house, and nutritional fac - tors, that impact the health outcomes of individuals (Secretary's Advisory Committee on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 2020, 2010). 84 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients A report prepared by Taylor and colleagues for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation (Taylor et al., 2015b) points to the extensive scientific literature showing that nonmedical factors can play a substantially larger role than medical factors in health and health outcomes. On page 3, the report states there is \"strong evidence that increased investment in selected social services as well as various models of partnership between health care and social services can confer substantial health benefits and reduce health care costs for targeted populations.\" Hayes and colleagues at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) recently made a similar observation with regard to high-need Medicare patients and dual-eligible patients who receive care from both Medicare and Medicaid programs (Hayes et al., 2016). As an example, Hayes and colleagues (2016) noted that a recent evaluation of the Minnesota Senior Health Options program, which coordinates care for dual-eligible patients, found that this program increased the use of home- and community-based LTSS while decreasing hospitalizations for treatment of chronic illnesses and days spent in nursing homes (Anderson et al., 2016). Two studies from Bradley and colleagues at the Yale School of Public Health further emphasize the importance of providing social services to improve health outcomes. The first study compared national spending on health services and social services among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and found that a larger ratio of social expenditures to health expenditures was significantly associated with better health outcomes (Bradley et al., 2011). OECD data used in this study (OECD, 2009) show that, compared to the United States, most highly developed countries spend a greater percentage of gross domestic product on social support and a smaller percentage on health care. In the second study, a state-to-state comparison of spending on social services and health care between 2000 and 2009 found that states with higher ratios of social service spending to health care spending14 had better health outcomes and fewer days with functional limitations (Bradley et al., 2016). This team's analysis of 74 studies examining the impact of various health outcomes and health care costs found that three types of services were particularly important: supportive housing, nutritional support such as in-home meals for older adults, and case management and outreach programs. While these and other studies reveal the important role social supports play in achieving the best health outcomes for high-need patients, it can be difficult to integrate social service and medical care programs into a seamless system, often because there are separate funding streams that hinder integration. For 14 This ratio was calculated as the sum of social service spending and public health spending divided by the sum of Medicare spending and Medicaid spending.Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 85 example, for the 10.3 million dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014many of whom are also high-need patients\u2014Medicare is the primary payer for acute and postacute care services, while Medicaid covers services not included in Medicare benefits, such as case management services, transportation to medical appointments, personal- care services to help patients with functional limitations, and other LTSS. Too often, according to the work from Hayes and colleagues (2016), the separation of Medicare and Medicaid benefits and the \"carving out\" of certain Medicaid benefits from managed care contracts can lead to a fragmented care model in which the beneficiaries and their family caregivers must navigate multiple plans or payers depending on the type of service provided (Hayes et al., 2016a). While this chapter addresses the negative effect that current payment policies have on integration in more detail below, one step the federal government, states, and payers could consider taking would be to revise financial incentives and organizational systems in a manner that recognizes the importance of provid - ing social supports in conjunction with medical care. Currently, said Anderson, health systems and payers invest money for social services primarily when doing so saves money for the medical care system, even though providing social ser - vices for high-need patients has importance aside from cost savings. Moreover, savings accrued from social service investment are often not reinvested in social services, missing an opportunity to provide even better care. One caution to exercise when integrating social services and medical care is to not \"medicalize\" social services by making them the responsibility of health care systems. Doing so would create the risk that all services aimed at improving outcomes for high- need patients become \"health care\" and therefore subject to the administrative and payment rules that govern health systems. While there are many system constraints to integration, there are opportunities nonetheless to better link medical and social services. For example, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation could take the lead in overseeing integration efforts, perhaps in conjunction with an interagency task force involving the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Urban Development that would work to embed health in all policies.15 The federal government will likely need to engage in a strategy coordinated with state leadership to incentivize provision of evidence-based social support services in conjunction with the delivery of medical services. In addition, the nation would be well-served if the federal government studied the 15 Health in all policies is a strategy for addressing the complex factors that influence health and equity, including educational attainment, housing, transportation options, and neighborhood safety.

State governments, which control Medicaid spending, can also play a role in fostering the integration of health and social services. McGinnis and colleagues at The Commonwealth Fund developed a policy framework to help states move beyond isolated pilot efforts and establish the infrastructure necessary to sup - port ongoing integration of health and social services, particularly for Medicaid beneficiaries (McGinnis et al., 2014). Their framework focuses on creating a statewide integrator to assume responsibility for ensuring coordination and communication across state-level services, establishing a robust set of tools to measure health outcomes and costs and share data among health systems, and developing long-term financing sources and payment models with incentives to encourage ongoing integration. Expand and Align Payment Policies As multiple speakers at the first two workshops noted, payment policies that misalign financial incentives\u2014particularly those that reimburse providers on a fee-for-service basis and that fail to pay for social services benefiting high-need patients\u2014are perhaps the most prominent barrier to the widespread adoption of successful models of care for high-need patients. Many workshop partici - pants stated the need for new payment policies that incentivize integration of social services and medical care and improved outcomes for high-need patients: Melissa Abrams from The Commonwealth Fund; Alan Glaseroff from Stanford Coordinated Care and Stanford School of Medicine; Bruce Chernof from The SCAN Foundation; Lisa Iezzoni from Harvard Medical School and the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital; Robert Master from Commonwealth Care Alliance; John O'Brien from CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield; Peter Long from the Blue Shield of California Foundation; and Rahul Rajkumar from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation. A research synthesis compiled by The Commonwealth Fund also concluded that a lack of reimbursement under fee-for-service payment policies for providing care coordination and social supports is a major obstacle to spreading and scal - ing patient-focused care models for high-need patients (McCarthy et al., 2015). Significant improvements have been made in paying for care coordination, and there is an increasing recognition that social supports are important com - ponents of effective care plans for high-need patients. Many insurers, including Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 87 states and the federal government, are starting to embrace value-based purchas - ing that includes paying for care delivered outside of the traditional medical silo (Bachrach et al., 2014; Hamblin et al., 2011). In a recent perspective on the urgency of caring for high-need, high-cost patients, Blumenthal and colleagues point out, for example, that the Affordable Care Act catalyzed the formation of 838 ACOs covering more than 28 million people (Blumenthal et al., 2016b). At least some of these ACOs have allocated independent resources\u2014not reimbursed by Medicare\u2014toward providing short-term housing upon hospital discharge as a means of reducing hospital readmissions for vulnerable patients and keeping Medicare per-member spending below predetermined spending benchmarks (Viveiros, 2015). They also note that under the Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (MACRA), physicians will face strong incentives to participate in alternative, value-based payment models. Fee-for-service Medicare Advantage Plans now pay for care coordination, and Medicare managed care plans have recognized the importance of care coordinators for high-need patients. In addition, CMS has granted an increas - ing number of Medicaid demonstration waivers for states that want to provide greater flexibility in covering community-based services as a means of reduc - ing health care costs. Anderson noted that state and local public agencies are developing programs and task forces to support integration of social service and medical care programs. Examples include housing-related interventions such as the National Governors Association's Housing as Health Care program16 and state-led Balancing Incentives Program and no wrong door approaches to provide access to LTSS for all populations and payers.17 The analysis conducted by Hayes and colleagues at the BPC and the recom - mendations they developed were intended to accelerate delivery system reform (Hayes et al., 2016a). Their analysis focused on the 10.3 million dual-eligible patients. Though only 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries and 14 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible individuals, they account for 35 percent of Medicare spending and 33 percent of combined federal and state spending on Medicaid. According to BPC's analysis, some 87 percent of dual-eligible beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, 54 percent have at least one behavioral health condition or cognitive impairment, and 29 percent have two or more limitations affecting activities of daily living. BPC's team noted that provider organizations seeking to improve care integration for high-need patients 16 For more information, see https://www.nga.org/cms/home/nga-center-for-best-practices/ center-publications/page-health-publications/col2-content/main-content-list/housing-as-health- care-road-map.html (accessed on July 31, 2017). 17 For more information, see http://www.balancingincentiveprogram.org (accessed on July 31, 2017).88 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients frequently run into the complex maze of federal and state reimbursement rules that preclude payment for, and in some cases coverage of, services that health providers believe could avert costlier emergency or hospital inpatient visits, which are major driving forces for the high costs associated with high-need patients. To best appreciate the challenges arising from dual-eligible status, it is neces - sary to understand how dual-eligible patients receive their benefits from these two distinct programs. Although both Medicare and Medicaid are authorized under the Social Security Act, the federal government administers Medicare, while federal and state governments jointly finance Medicaid. States cover cer - tain mandatory benefits under Medicaid, while other services are optional and coverage is determined on a state-by-state basis. As Hayes explained in her pre - sentation at the third workshop, Medicaid covers LTSS, including many services that deal with functional limitations. As of June 2015, only some 20 percent of dual-eligible individuals were enrolled in the type of organized systems of care that blend social services and medical care, such as Medicare managed care plans, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs). In their report, Hayes and colleagues (2016) state that the specific care delivery model and state implementation of the model will likely determine whether full integration of Medicare and Medicaid services will improve quality and lower the total cost of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries. There is mounting evidence, however, that integration does improve quality and value. As noted earlier in this chapter, for example, dual-eligible patients enrolled in Minnesota's Senior Health Options program had fewer hospitalizations and emergency department visits and increased use of home- and community-based LTSS compared to individuals receiving benefits through Medicare fee-for-service plans (Anderson et al., 2016). BPC's team pointed out that there is much to learn about integrating care for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Hayes and colleagues (2016) explained that only a relatively small number of states have more than a few years of experience fully integrating Medicare and Medicaid services for dual-eligible beneficiaries over age 65. Even fewer states have experience with the under-65 population, which has higher-than-average rates of untreated behavioral health issues and/ or prevalence of homelessness according to Medicare managed care sponsors. Summarizing BPC's recommendations, Hayes explained that they include changing existing reimbursement structures, consolidating regulatory authority for dual-eligible programs within the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office at CMS, and building on lessons learned through implementation of existing programs and demonstrations to develop a consolidated framework for programs serving dual-eligible beneficiaries. Critical to that framework is the ability to Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 89 combine Medicare and Medicaid financing streams into an integrated benefit structure that allows flexibility in benefit design to address patient needs. See Box 5-1 for selected excerpts of BPC's recommendations. While BPC's recommendations aim to harmonize Medicare and Medicaid benefits to improve care of dual-eligible individuals, other efforts are under way to take advantage of Medicare and Medicaid programs that enable providers, payers, and state agencies with opportunities to test delivery system innovations that improve outcomes and patient experiences while increasing the value of care. Health Homes, Patient-Centered Medical Homes, Community Health Teams, and Transition Care Models are among the many programs using value-based strategies to replace traditional fee-for-service payment models. Recently, the Center for Health Care Strategies outlined approaches to value-based payments (Houston, 2016), some of which supplement fee-for-service payments, and others that replace them. Foundational payments, for example, are a flat or per-member per-month (PMPM) fee to reimburse providers for upfront investments they make to better coordinate care. Meaningful-use payments from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, which aim to reim - burse practices for installing electronic health record systems, are an example of a foundational payment. Pay-for-performance models supplement fee-for-service payments by rewarding providers with performance incentive payments linked to outcomes and patient satisfaction metrics. The Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration is an example of this type of value-based payment model. Other approaches include bundled payments for a set of services for a specific care intervention, a common mechanism that state Medicaid programs use; shared savings programs that manage the total cost of care based on risk, such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program and state Medicaid ACOs; and capitation and global payments that pay a single PMPM fee to a provider to cover all of an individual's care, a model used by Oregon's Coordinated Care Organizations. These types of payment methodologies can incentivize care investments in evidence-based best practices for high-need individuals and reduce the incentives that lead to ineffective and uncoordinated care. To increase their effectiveness, however, such payment models could be constructed to account for the increased financial risk associated with caring for high-need patients (Barnett et al., 2015). Health systems that focus exclusively on high-need patients can be at a market disadvantage and may be financially unstable. They may be further disadvantaged by value-based purchasing arrangements that do not recognize the unique requirements of the high-need population. It may also be the case that capital markets would be less likely to finance organiza - tions to better serve high-need patients because of the potential for competitive 90 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients BOX 5-1 Selected Excerpts from the Bipartisan Policy Center's Recommendations to Align Programs and Integrate Care for Dual-Eligible Beneficiaries Special-Needs Plans (SNPs) : Permanently authorize Medicare Advantage Dual-Eligible SNPs. However, all plans fully integrate clinical health services, behavioral health, and LTSS by January 1, 2020. [Additionally], the combined Medicare and Medicaid ben - efits offered through all SNPs [should be] seamless to the beneficiary and to providers. Streamlining and aligning of SNPs : For ongoing demonstrations, CMS should revise contracts to ensure that rates reflect unanticipated costs of infrastructure invest - ment or significant differences in cost associated with serving certain special-needs populations, such as those with previously untreated mental illnesses or homeless indi - viduals. [CMS should also] work with states to develop unique state-specific quality and access measures, and permit states to share in a greater percentage of [applicable] savings or permit added flexibility in the scope of covered benefits [as appropriate]. [Moreover,] CMS should establish additional demonstrations to integrate Medicare and Medicaid for dual-eligible beneficiaries based on findings from the evaluations of the first-round demonstrations. Expanded PACE eligibility : CMS should test [variations of the Program of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) including] an expansion to individuals, regard - less of age, who meet all other PACE criteria and who do not require a nursing home level of care; an option that permits individuals to enroll in PACE, but opt out of adult day services; and an option that includes both Medicare-covered services and a beneficiary \"buy-in\" of a limited LTSS benefit. Streamlined dual-eligible beneficiary services : Regulatory authority for reimburse - ment structures serving dual-eligible beneficiaries should be consolidated into a single office or center within CMS, such as the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office. CMS, states, plans alignment : Policymakers should build on lessons learned from existing programs and demonstrations to develop a contractual model similar to the innovative \"three-way\" contract between CMS, states, and plans under the financial alignment demonstration. A new model three-way contract should be uniform with respect to basic structure, beneficiary protections, quality requirements, care coor - dination, and continuity of care requirements. At the same time, it should be flexible enough to permit variation in delivery, provider, and reimbursement models, as well as state-level decisions, such as eligibility for optional populations. SOURCE: Adapted from Hayes et al., 2016a.Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 91 disadvantage compared to organizations that do not serve large numbers of high-need patients. One issue, addressed by Blumenthal and colleagues in a discussion paper from the National Academy of Medicine's series of discussion papers Vital Directions for Health and Health Care (Blumenthal et al., 2016a), is that most ACOs and performance- and risk-based plans still pay clinicians on a fee-for- service basis (Bailit et al., 2015). The authors of this discussion paper note that if individual providers or practice sites do not feel accountable for health outcomes, population health, and value, the diffusion of promising practices and models of care will be slow. Another concern the authors of this paper noted is the misalignment between investment and savings: too often, the savings realized by a successful care model accrue to payers, even though it is the providers who are expected to cover the up-front costs of staff training and other investments a program requires (Hong et al., 2014). Even if savings are shared with providers, the time for these complex delivery system reforms to produce savings can be several years (Jones et al., 2016), which can discour - age providers from making the necessary initial investments. Ashish Jha from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health noted at the third workshop that realizing a return on investment with even good models is a long process. Google, he pointed out, took 8 or so years to become profitable, and to expect these models to yield large returns in 2 to 3 years will lead to disappointment. Similarly, Peikes and colleagues stated, \"The providers we speak to report that it takes a year and a half or longer for interventions to really click.\" In the third workshop, David Atkins of the Department of Veterans Affairs underscored the need for support for the long-term experiments to demonstrate meaning - ful returns on investments, particularly given the reluctance of health system administrators to maintain programs that are not yielding short-term benefits. When discussing payment policies, Anderson said in the third workshop, it is important to remember that just as there is not one kind of high-need patient, corresponding flexibility will be needed when it comes to payment models that incentivize high-value care for high-need patients. In particular, reimbursements for care coordination will have to reflect the different levels of patient need that require different levels of care coordination and that entail different degrees of risk. One issue that a breakout group in the second work - shop raised was the need to allow organizations to have some flexibility in the benefits they offer as long as they can demonstrate that they are providing high-quality care for all of the high-need individuals in their care, not just a selected few. Flexibility could allow providers and health care organizations to target individuals who are most likely to benefit from particular delivery 92 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients models if the focus is on improving quality of care rather than squeezing cost savings out of the system. In that regard, said John O'Brien from CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, payment models should incentivize targeting patients who are most likely to benefit from the right interventions. Workforce For Comprehensive Health Care Both Peikes and Mangiante noted the importance of education and training in successful scaling efforts and the integration of services. Many clinicians, how - ever, are not well trained to address the needs of high-need patients. Anderson commented that medical schools tend to emphasize \"body parts\" instead of the whole person and that nurses, who are often the care coordinators in these model programs, have little training in care coordination. In fact, he pointed out, care providers of all types\u2014physicians and nurses, medical paraprofessionals, social workers, and housing and employment professionals\u2014need to receive training on caring for and interacting with high-need individuals. Thomas-Henkel and colleagues, in a study commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Thomas-Henkel et al., 2015), noted that barriers to the spread and scale of care models for high-need patients include gaps in the training of current and newly graduated clinicians, a lack of interprofessional education among team members, low reimbursement rates that may limit recruitment efforts, and the need to develop more effective models for preventing and managing staff burnout given the professional and emotional challenges this work can entail. They highlighted the opportunity for academic health centers and professional societies to collaborate on developing new training and certification opportuni - ties, particularly those that encompass team-based approaches and training in behavioral health, substance use disorders, and complex psychosocial factors. They also raised the point that there are new models of supervision involving the entire spectrum of traditional and nontraditional health care team members that care models are drawing upon to better serve high-need patients. There is, therefore, a need and an opportunity for education and training to be integrated into the process of spreading and scaling any given model. Many models that have proven successful at improving care for high-need patients already put an emphasis on social supports, a trend noted by Molly Coye from the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation. As mentioned in Chapter 4, adoption of these models can lead to substantial changes in workforce roles as evidenced by assigning important roles in the care teams that integrate the broad range of social and behavioral health services high-need patients require to professionals who are often not considered key members of a health care team.Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 93 Credentialing programs, particularly for nontraditional health workers such as community health workers and peer support providers, could be developed to encourage workforce development to support high-need patients. Research has shown that properly trained community health workers can play a unique role in helping high-need patients navigate the health system, obtain necessary supportive resources, and build self-efficacy and health literacy; by doing so, they can improve patient experiences and outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions (Adair et al., 2012; Adair et al., 2013; Davis, 2013; Kangovi et al., 2014). For example, an Oregon program for high-need Medicaid patients, in which care teams were led by a nurse and two community health workers, reduced emer - gency department utilization from 78 percent in 2011 to 59 percent in 2013 (Takach and Yalowich, 2015). Academic institutions, health systems, and other educators could develop cur - ricula on the treatment and social support needs of high-need patients, includ - ing training on team-based care, patient engagement, care coordination across health and social sectors, and the social determinants of health. Key workforce sectors in need of training would include clinicians, nurses, physician assistants and other medical paraprofessionals, mental health professionals, social work - ers, pharmacologists, substance abuse providers, community health workers, peer providers, law enforcement officers, and housing and employment service providers. In particular, anyone involved in case management would benefit from special training that would include field training to observe delivery of evidence-based practices. Rajesh Davda from Cigna noted that physicians and nurses participating in Cigna's model program for high-need patients were generally poorly informed about care coordination when the program started. Once staff members were trained on matters of care coordination, they became the most effective instructors for training additional team members. This result prompted Cigna to develop learning collaboratives to foster workforce training. Anderson commented that high-need patients would also benefit from improved training for students in health care fields, which he believes would reduce the stigma associated with people with complex illnesses among clinical trainees, active professionals, and health system administrators, and produce a culture shift in the world of health care. Reexamine Quality Measurement As value-based purchasing becomes more common, it will be essential to use quality measures\u2014and the data that inform those measures\u2014to improve care and offer incentives for providers to treat high-need patients. As Shari Ling from 94 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients CMS noted in her presentation at the third workshop, the proper use of measures creates transparency on cost and quality of care. Most quality measures currently in use, however, focus on specific conditions and whether methods of care for those conditions are effective. Ling pointed out that meaningful quality measures are too often setting-specific rather than being aligned with patient-centered outcomes that span various settings (Conway et al., 2013). Discussion during the second workshop noted that the current system of metrics is not designed in a way that encourages providers to organize care in the most effective manner. While condition-specific measures are important, high-need patients are more than the sum of their individual diseases, and they have additional concerns beyond the appropriate care for each specific condition. To better reflect this reality, measures for assessing the performance of care models for high-need patients could indicate the degree of care coordination, quality of life, independence, and overall mental and physical health status. In her presentation at the third workshop, Helen Burstin from the National Quality Forum highlighted the need for measures based on patient-reported outcomes, patient involvement in the decision-making process regarding their care, and the quality of home and community-based services. In his remarks at the third workshop, Rick Kronick from the University of California, San Diego, added that measures should assess whether systems are stinting on some aspects of care, whether patient preferences are elicited and respected, and whether the communication between clinician and patient is of adequate quality. During the same workshop, Richard Frank from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield wondered if it would be possible to measure patient behavior in some manner that would provide a better understanding of engagement and motivation to change. The Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has undertaken a study of the relationships between social risk factors and performance measurement (National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2016a, 2016b), which will also inform metrics focused on the social determinants of health for the high-need population. According to Burstin, the availability of more appropriate measures of care relevant to high-need patients will enable health care financing to move beyond reliance on claims-based risk adjustment and instead enable differentiation of risk within clinical conditions and risk-based grouping of multiple chronic conditions. Such measures could also better account for unmeasured clinical complexity, such as patient frailty, disability, poor functional status, and multiple chronic conditions. Among existing measures, recent evidence suggests that because reliable case mix accommodation approaches are still evolving, hospitals caring for a higher proportion of patients with complex medical problems tend to fare worse on certain quality measures, Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 95 such as readmissions (Joynt, 2013, 2017), and may experience high penalties under value-based purchasing programs, potentially creating a disincentive to caring for these individuals. Burstin and other participants at the third workshop voiced their concern that the proliferation of measures and \"measurement for measurement's sake\" has become a burden to providers. A 2016 National Academy of Medicine Perspective, Observations from the Field: Reporting Quality Metrics in Health Care (Dunlap et al., 2016), offered the same concern. As David Dorr from the Oregon Health & Science University noted, it takes discipline to be parsimonious with measures. It is important for payers and health systems to choose measures that reflect realistic quality and accountability goals and to understand that programs may not demonstrate marked improvements for several years. Kronick remarked that measures should not be the only means used to improve quality of care. In his opinion, public policies related to quality improvement should emphasize methods of enhancing professional intrinsic motivation while recognizing the role of organizations to promote and facilitate that motivation by providing systematic feedback to physicians, technical assistance, and opportunities for providers to collaborate on projects to improve care. Improve Data Infrastructure Research shows that high-quality data and analytics are an essential component of effective models of care for high-need patients in that they are used to match high-need individuals with specific interventions (Bates et al., 2014; Bradley et al., 2016; Dale et al., 2016; Rajkumar et al., 2015). High-quality data are also needed to inform the types of measures discussed in the previous section. One major challenge Anderson noted is that there are many disparate systems that cannot easily share information, making it difficult to assess the requirements of high-need individuals and whether they are getting appropriate medical and social care. During the first workshop, Lisa Iezzoni from Harvard Medical School and the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital said that reliable data are needed when identifying high-need patients to overcome the limitations of the diagnostic data by which chronic conditions are identified. International Classification of Diseases-Clinical Modification diagnostic codes may not fully capture disability, functional limitations, or frailty, while other measures of frailty and disability can carry biases, including cultural ones, or have gaming potential once reimbursements start being based on a particular measure. In addition, diagnostic claim codes may fail to capture the health of persons who have not received adequate care.96 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Iezzoni illustrated the problem of trying to use diagnostic claim codes to cap - ture the health of persons who have not yet received adequate care by recounting the experience of the One Care program in Massachusetts, a dually capitated program begun on October 1, 2013, for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees ages 21 to 64. Capitation for Medicaid payments was set using rating categories that were initially assigned based on prior year MassHealth Medicaid claims for the program's participants. As soon as the One Care program started, it became obvi - ous that many enrollees had higher needs than were indicated in their assigned rating category, in large part because they had not had Medicaid claims from a prior year since they had not received services in that prior year. Program administrators went to MassHealth and explained that they were not able to provide needed services because the capitated payments were too low because of the improper ratings. The solution was to conduct a functional status assessment once a person was enrolled in the One Care program and upgrade the rating based on that assessment. Before the upgrade, 59 percent of the enrollees had the lowest rating\u2014a minimal care level for this high-need population\u2014while after the upgrade only 40 percent of the enrollees fell into that category. At the same time, the percentage of independently living individuals in the highest- need categories rose from 19 percent to 35 percent. At the time of the second workshop, reimbursements were matched closely to costs, allowing One Care to provide the services its clients required. Electronic health record (EHR) data, combined with claims data, can provide some additional insights about high-need patients that can help with manag - ing complex patient populations. At the second workshop, Paul Bleicher from OptumLabs, a division of UnitedHealth Group, described how his organization uses these combined data sources to characterize the natural history of disease and identify specific issues and conditions associated with the biggest costs. Researchers at OptumLabs have also been using these data to examine patient clustering. They created a model that identifies patients who are at the highest risk of hospitalization and uses machine-learning clustering technologies to segment the top 10 percent of these patients. This analysis, he said, can support efforts to personalize care based on specific patient profiles. Data from EHRs can provide a finer-grained picture of different groups of patients. For example, EHR data analysis reveals a substantial difference between prescriptions written and prescriptions filled. In the case of patients with hyperten - sion who are not following established guidelines, this type of analysis can show whether the problem rests with the patient or the physician. Natural language processing of EHR data can create structured variables that provide detailed pictures of laboratory test results as they relate to care management, leading to Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 97 the identification of possible drivers of hospital readmission, said Bleicher. He noted that significant amounts of granular information can be extracted from the EHR with natural language processing and used to gain a better understanding of patient outcomes. This value-added information includes clinical findings that are not available in claims data, such as preadjusted diagnostic and procedure information and temporal data about a patient's stay in the hospital. In addition, clinical notes can be mined for details, such as the risk of falling, that are not available in the EHR's structured data. OptumLabs has been using this type of data analysis and mining to create predictive models that can help reduce hospitalizations. For example, a congestive heart failure predictive model uses a patient's prior health care use and clinical findings such as blood oxygenation, laboratory results, and vital signs to predict the risk of future hospitalization over the following 6 months. Individuals in the 95th percentile of risk were contacted and brought into the clinic for further assessment and treatment, with the result that hospital admissions for all patients with congestive heart failure were reduced by 60 percent from a year earlier. Bleicher explained that with claims data alone, the model was inadequate. There are policy impediments\u2014particularly with regard to sharing behavioral health and substance abuse information\u2014that act as barriers to coordinating care for high-need individuals. Bleicher noted that standardizing EHR data across different systems is a major challenge, as is the fact that individual physicians capture and record data differently, and coders will code records and turn them into claims differently. For example, Bleicher stated that his team found from mining EHR data that between 11 and 31 percent of patients who had no bill - ing code for diabetes over a 3-year period were in fact being treated for diabetes based on EHR-recorded laboratory results and prescriptions for diabetes medica - tions. Jha added that claims data are limited when it comes to identifying which individuals either use or have used long-term care. Medicare data, for example, do not include long-term care; there is not a good national dataset with any granularity on long-term care services and supports and social services for the Medicare population. Federal, state, and local governments could identify barriers that currently inhibit data flow among the clinicians and organizations treating high-need populations and work to minimize those barriers while respecting patient privacy and data security. In her presentation at the second workshop, Sandra Wilkniss from the National Governors Association said that access to data is one of the main challenges that states face in crafting effective policies to support better care for high-need, high-cost patients. In fact, some states have difficulty accessing even their own claims data to conduct necessary analyses, in part because state laws are barriers to 98 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients effective data sharing. For the most part, explained Wilkniss, governors are taking a data-driven strategy to identify target populations primarily using Medicaid claims data, pharmacy data, and other types of high-level data to segment patient populations. A significant piece of this strategy involves what Wilkniss called \"geospatial hot-spotting,\" or identifying communities with a disproportionate share of high-need, high-cost patients. She noted that high-value health care systems with which she has interacted are using data to conduct rapid-cycle evaluations of their programs' performance to continuously improve care and reduce costs. In their work toward defining a state policy framework for integrating health and social services, McGinnis and colleagues at The Commonwealth Fund sug - gest that state- and community-level data-sharing tools could include integrated claims databases that link and share information across payers, service sectors, and provider networks (McGinnis et al., 2014). One example of such a tool is the Predictive Risk Intelligence System (PRISM) that Washington State developed to support care management for high-risk Medicaid patients (Court et al., 2011). Integration of medical, behavioral, and social data, along with improved data sharing, is paramount to improving care for high-need patients. Integration and data sharing, however\u2014whether across health and social services systems or within different components of the health care system\u2014is a challenge that federal, state, and local partners could work together to address. One possible first step would be to identify the barriers to data flow among and within agencies and providers and then invest in activities to optimize information exchange. As noted at the third workshop, some of those barriers include federal confidential - ity regulations (42 CFR Part II) that restrict sharing information about patients' history of alcohol and substance abuse; misinterpretation of data sharing rules in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA); and integration of EHRs and Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data. Data could inform the strategic deployment of health care and social services resources. Toward that end, public and commercial payers could lead efforts to identify and share information about target populations and the potential for different models to positively affect the care of those populations. Incorporating screening tools for social risk and behavioral health variables into EHRs could serve as a source of data on patients that could be used to inform program target - ing. Other sources of data could include claims, administrative data, data from patient encounters with health and social services systems, and patient-related geographical information. Medicare data, collected by CMS, could serve as a rich source of information about patients and program effectiveness. If these disparate sources of data could be integrated, they could be used to align targeting strate - gies across payers and to inform benefits, care delivery, and payment models.Policy to Support Spread and Scale of Care Models | 99 As multiple speakers over the course of the three workshops noted, achieving the type of policy changes discussed here will not happen without the involve - ment of all stakeholders\u2014federal, state, and local governments; providers; payers; and patients and caregivers. Moreover, changing policies and allowing organiza - tions to adapt to those changes will not happen quickly. As Mary Anne Sterling from Connected Health Resources said at the conclusion of the third workshop: \"I think what we are doing is culture change on a grand scale, probably [on a scale] that has never been done before in this country. I think we all need to encourage our peers that it is going to take some patience, maybe one or two do-overs, maybe a left or right turn along the way, but it is definitely doable.\" References Adair, R., J.

Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), and The Commonwealth Fund\u2014was to advance our understanding about how to better manage the health of high- need patients through the exploration of patient characteristics and groupings, of promising care models and attributes, and of policy solutions to spread and scale models of care. Since the launch of this project, the pace of change in the field\u2014from the demonstration of new models of care for high-need patients to state and federal governments launching initiatives aimed at better coordinating care for this patient population\u2014has created an encouraging new dynamic that offers promise for addressing the challenge of caring for high-need patients and reducing the outsized cost of providing that care. The key themes and lessons from the workshops, the workgroups, and the committee as a whole are summarized below, along with areas of opportunity for various stakeholders. Given that high-need patients often face challenges in receiving adequate care, including a lack of care coordination within the health care system, and that caring for these individuals is currently a key driver of health care spending, a notable theme voiced throughout the discussions was the call for bold policy action and system and payment reform efforts. The com - prehensive team-oriented services required are not currently available in most settings, yet the potential gains to health care systems are considerable. Over the past 2 years, a number of promising innovations in care delivery have emerged, but there are systemic barriers to replicating and sustaining the key practices. The research and activities of this partnership have shown how essential it is to create a policy and regulatory environment built around payment models that incentivize coordinated care and support the integration of clinical care and social services. In addition, health systems would benefit from a \"taxonomy\" to 104 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients segment high-need patients and match the appropriate interventions as well as from a set of key measures to support value-based payment. Main Themes and Lessons The first important lessons from this initiative are that the high-need patient population is diverse, complex, expensive, and often transient, and the hetero - geneity of this population suggests that a similar diversity of care models will be needed to address the range of problems these individuals experience. At the same time, there is a need to strike a balance between standardized and customized approaches to care. In that regard, segmenting patients can be a useful tool for targeting care, but there is need for more real-world testing and refinement of approaches for segmenting patients in conjunction with care models demonstrated to work with certain subpopulations of high-need patients. Another key lesson from this initiative is that just improving medical care for high-need patients will not address all of the challenges they face, nor will it lower the cost of care. To be successful, as the examples cited in Chapter 4 and in Appendix A demonstrate, care models for high-need patients will often need to address the social risk and behavioral health factors that play an outsized role in the lives of these individuals. Going forward, care models, policies, and assess - ment tools need to address social services and behavioral health needs in addition to those services normally considered the purview of health care systems. The final overarching lesson is that to be actionable, policy solutions must account for existing constraints and complexities arising from the lack of integration of medical, social, and behavioral services and with the way the United States finances care models. In addition to those overarching lessons, a number of important themes emerged from the presentations and discussions in the three workshops and deliberations among the committee members. These included: Segmentation and Taxonomy The high-need patient population comprises a heterogeneous group of indi - viduals that have a diverse array of conditions, making segmentation of this population into a finite number of subpopulations an important consideration when attempting to match patients with appropriate models of care. With a patient taxonomy and menu of evidence-based care models, health systems would be better equipped to plan for and deliver targeted care based on patient characteristics, needs, and challenges and to identify gaps in their ability to deliver care for specific subgroups within their patient populations. Models of Common Themes and Opportunities for Action | 105 care for high-need patients must balance the need for standardized approaches for diverse populations with the need for personalization around individual patients' conditions, needs, and characterization. In that regard, having too many seg - ment groups becomes too complex and impractical for broad implementation, but having too few segments makes groupings less meaningful and undermines the objective to be able to target care effectively. The purpose and utility of segmentation must guide the development of a taxonomy for high-need patients and reflect the fact that a taxonomy will be a dynamic and interactive tool and that a single individual can move between taxonomic segments as their health\u2014and therefore their care needs\u2014change over time. Starting a taxonomy from a medical perspective has limitations, but it is a feasible starting point for most health systems, given the availability of data. Additionally, functional status can be \"baked in\" to the various medical segments in a taxonomy, with social risk factors and behavioral health consid - erations spanning all clinical/functional segments. Barriers around data collection and use, particularly among smaller clinics and providers who lack a sophisticated and interoperable health information technology infrastructure, limit the use of patient segmentation. There is a need to improve our understanding of the transient nature of the high-need patient population and how health systems need to account for it when developing care delivery models. Tailored Care and Care Coordination In the 2 years since the germination of this collaborative project, understand - ing and approaches to care delivery for high-need patients have evolved, with the demonstration that multiple care models can improve care. A successful care model is designed to respond to the goals and needs of patients, and an essential tool for standardizing and centering care around patient needs and goals\u2014as well as for assessing patient needs across disease groups\u2014is measuring functional status. Understanding patient needs and goals also requires better measurement of patient priorities, and meeting these goals will require flexible models of care. Care coordination is critical for high-need patients, and improving care coordi - nation will require the development of new workforce and training efforts. Such efforts are often costly, so special consideration should be given to potential care coordination approaches that help control costs. Additionally, improving care for high-need patients requires aligning the care system with social, economic, and behavioral programs and services, a task that will be difficult because of the fragmentation that exists in these fields.106 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients While more research is needed to bolster the evidence base for care models and care model attributes that work for specific subpopulations of high-need patients, there is a broad consensus on universal attributes common to successful care models. There is broad agreement that the predominant location for delivering care for high-need patients should be in the home and community rather than in the hospital or nursing home whenever possible. Health systems can work with payers to better identify and target high-need patients and to test new practices, including the use of a taxonomy. A matching exercise demonstrated that individual care models can be targeted to specific groups based on characteristics and needs. Payment Models Current economic and payment models oriented to individual conditions lead to inefficiencies and deficiencies in care processes that have particular impact on high- need patients, who often have a diverse array of conditions. Moreover, care models for high-need patients incur high, ongoing costs, and the long-term financing of these models must be considered when identifying policy solutions. Payers can actively support the adoption of care models or specific elements of care models that research has shown are effective at improving care for high-need patients and/or reducing the cost of care. Policy makers and payers can continue progress toward a value- based system using alternative payment models, including those that work within fee-for-service structures, to support more effective care for high-need patients. Policy Opportunities to Encourage the Spread and Scale of Care Models Policy solutions must engage all aspects of care delivery, such as providing mental health support for home health aides and family caregivers, as well as accounting for existing system constraints and complexities (e.g., integration of medical and social financing of care models). Although having supportive policies in place can enable models to spread and scale, many care models do not scale because specifics of the models are not considered, such as the adapta - tions away from ideal conceptualizations to meet the on-the-ground realities or interpersonal dynamics and the role of leadership in success. Areas where policy changes could accelerate their widespread adoption and sustainability include the programmatic integration of social supports; care delivery and workforce; payment policy; quality measurement; and data infrastructure. Furthermore, policies need to consider both state and federal perspectives to be broadly adopted. Federal structures such as the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office\u2014also known as the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office or Office of the Dual\u2014can serve an important role in bridging many different health care and social services sectors and populations.Common Themes and Opportunities for Action | 107 Quality measures have proliferated and are often burdensome; a reevaluation of which limited set of measures is necessary to determine quality in specific circumstances would greatly benefit program administrators, regulators, health systems, payers, and providers. Tying payment incentives to particular measures simply because they can be measured can give too much weight to the impor - tance of those aspects of care compared to elements that are less easily quantified. Opportunities for Stakeholder Action A goal of this initiative has been to identify a path forward to produce the bold actions needed to improve the lives of the nation's 12 million high-need patients, and to reduce the unsustainably high cost of providing them with effective care and support (Hayes et al., 2016). Major stakeholders\u2014health systems, payers, providers, patients and family or unpaid caregivers, researchers, and policy makers\u2014have opportunities to address several key challenges to improving care for high-need patients. The fol - lowing list highlights stakeholder opportunities discussed throughout the workshops: Refine the starter taxonomy based on real-world use and experience to facilitate the matching of individual need and functional capacity to specific care programs. Integrate and coordinate the delivery of medical, social, and behavioral services in a way that reduces the burdens on patients and caregivers. Develop approaches for spreading and scaling successful programs and for training a workforce capable of making these models successful. Promote payment reform efforts that further incentivize adoption of suc - cessful care models. Establish a small set of proven quality measures appropriate for assessing out - comes, including return on investment, and continuously improving programs for high-need individuals. Create road maps and tools to help organizations adopt models of care suitable for their particular patient populations. In particular, action is needed by certain key stakeholders: health systems, pay - ers, providers, patients and their care partners, researchers, and policy makers. Health Systems Engage patients and caregivers in design, implementation, and evaluation of care models. Work with payers to better identify and target high-need patients and to test new practices and tools, such as a taxonomy.108 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Work with payers to develop interoperable electronic health records that can include functional and behavioral status and social needs. Identify the threshold for targeting programs to those elderly who are frail, since not all elderly need the intensive, coordinated care these programs provide. Use established metrics and quality improvement approaches to create an environment of continuous assessment and improvement for these models. Partner with community organizations, including schools and even prisons, as well as with patients, caregivers, and social and behavioral health service providers outside of the health care system to create patient-centered care plans. Assess established culture and promote changes needed to institute new and successful care models, blending medical, social, and behavioral approaches. Payers Actively support the adoption of care models or specific elements of models that research has shown to be effective at improving care for high-need patients. Work with policy makers to continue progress toward a value-based system, using alternative payment models, including those that work within a fee-for-service structure, to support more effective care for high-need patients. Expect that return on investment for most models of care for high-need patients will take time and that a return in 2 to 3 years is unlikely. Develop financing models to provide social and behavioral health services that will both improve care and lower the total cost of care for high-need patients, recognizing that even cost-neutral programs are worth supporting if the outcome is positive for patients. Support recognition, training, and education for patients and caregivers as part of care teams. Lead efforts to identify and share information about high-need patients and the potential for different models to positively affect the care of those populations. Providers Meet patients in their communities or connect patients to community and other social resources and accept that much of the care they need will be delivered by family and unpaid caregivers or professionals outside of the health care system. Learn to work collaboratively in teams, and understand that many success - ful care models work best when everyone works at the top of their licenses. Engage with patients, care partners, and their caregivers in the design and delivery of care.Common Themes and Opportunities for Action | 109 Fully adopt the proven practices of health literacy to improve patients' and caregivers' ability to follow care plans developed with their input. Identify and work to change cultural norms that may hinder adoption of successful care models. Identify and engage patients' care partners as integrated team participants. Patients and Their Care Partners Seek out formal training and education experiences to enhance care, under - stand complex medical situations, limit injuries and other errors, and identify problems earlier. Explore with your care team the potential benefits of home-based care, including improved financial, social, and psychosocial outcomes. Request formal recognition as part of the care team. Participate in active communication with providers regarding quality of care, needs, and services. Work with a care coordinator or care coordination team to amplify self- advocacy efforts and fully utilize care models. Contribute to the development of quality measures to assist in better decision making around care and care delivery. Research community With the involvement of patients, caregivers, and other key stakeholders, con - tinue research on approaches for identifying and segmenting high-need patients in practice settings and matching those individuals with successful care models. Gather better data for care models that work, including the effective integra - tion of social and behavioral health services. Develop and test a parsimonious set of metrics for measuring outcomes and return on investment for models of care. Identify the best methods of care coordination, workforce training, and education for caregivers. Study effective culture change implementation techniques to promote spread and scale of successful care models. Policy Makers Increase and expand efforts to engage patient and caregiver involvement in discussions around policy options for improving care and reducing costs for high-need patients. Harmonize and coordinate Medicare and Medicaid programs to increase access to needed services and to reduce the burden on patients and caregivers.110 | Effective Care for High-Need Patients Continue payment policy reforms and alignment initiatives to incentivize pay-for-performance instead of fee-for-service. Incentivize adoption and use of interoperable electronic health records that include functional, behavioral health, and social factors. Create state- and community-level data-sharing tools which include integrated claims databases that link and share information across payers, service sec - tors, and provider networks, such as the Predictive Risk Intelligence System (PRISM) that Washington State developed to support care management for high-risk Medicaid patients. Explore the expansion of programs to mitigate financial strain of caregiving, like Medicaid's Cash & Counseling. Modify existing regulations, such as 42 CFR Part II and data-sharing rules in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), to improve data flow among and within agencies and providers. Conclusion Common to the presentations and discussions among participants was the notion that improving the care management of high-need patients will require engagement and coordination of a broad range of stakeholders at multiple levels. While each stakeholder sector individually may impact a patient's life, a com - munity, or even a regional health delivery system, one of the most expensive and challenging populations for the current health care system will remain underserved until there is a unified effort\u2014rather than small, incremental steps\u2014to improve care for the nation's high-need patients and to reduce the cost of delivering that care. It is important that different stakeholder groups convene to discuss opportunities for actions and improvement, using the poten - tial activities identified here to guide discussion and action. The taxonomy to guide care team and care model design needs further discussion, refinement, testing, and validation, as do the implementation tactics and practices to deter - mine elements of successful care models. Policies to accelerate the spread and scale of proven models, new workforce development initiatives, suitable qual - ity measures, and expanded data infrastructure are all at the forefront of the national health care goals of balancing quality and associated costs. Sustained attention to these areas, too, is needed.Common Themes and Opportunities for Action | 111 References Hayes, S. L., C. A. Salzberg, D. McCarthy, D. C. Radley, M. K. Abrams, T. Shah, and G.

ALIGNMENT HEALTHCARE Target population The 20 percent of a health system's members who are frail, or have complex conditions or several chronic illnesses, and who account for 80 percent of health care spending. (Furman, 2015; Kao, 2016)Matched Segment Not used in matching exercise Intervention Components Alignment Healthcare's program is built around a new type of clinician, the extensivist, a highly trained physician who cares for five or six patients in the hospital, instead of the 30 that a hos - pitalist would see, and who not only treats the patient but also speaks to the patient's family and primary care physician every day. (Furman, 2015) Any member of a participating health care system who was frail, whether posthospitalization or for any other reason, can be seen at a care center by a team that included the extensivist, nurse practitioners, social workers, and case workers functioning at the top of their licenses. These care centers also have teams of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses who integrate mental health care and extend that care into nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and the patient's home. (Furman, 2015) Care centers incorporate nutritional counseling, podiatry services, and other key components for seniors. (Furman, 2015) Technology and advanced analytics play a key role in supporting the care model, with the goal being to use analytical tools to develop earlier predictive patterns that inform preventive inter - ventions before high-cost interventions are needed. (Furman, 2015) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost X X Notes The program eliminates copayments for mental health care, which decreased costs and improved outcomes.

(O'Brien, 2015)Matched Segment Not used in matching exercise Intervention Components An incentive-based program for primary care physicians that rewards them for managing patients and influencing the whole medical dollar, including the 94 percent of the plan's expenditures on specialists, inpatient care, outpatient care, and prescription drugs. (O'Brien, 2015). Credible data and analytic support provided through a dedicated informational portal and high-touch, superior technical support promote collaboration among physicians, local nurses, and other health professionals to manage members' care. These analytics provide primary care physicians with information to help them spot potential hot-spot individuals within their panels and then provide links to additional services for those patients. (O'Brien, 2015) Primary care physicians collaborate with the specialists and other medical professionals of their choice, informed by analytics that provide the primary care physician with cost and quality metrics for those other professionals, to more closely coordinate and track care for the sickest patients or those at highest risk for future illness. (CareFirst, 2017; O'Brien, 2015) Care plans are supported by local community-based care teams headed by a registered nurse. (O'Brien, 2015) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost X X Notes \"Participating providers receive a 12 percentage point increase in their fee schedule, agree - ing to higher compensation in exchange for increased effort and time devoted to improved coordination of care.

(O'Brien, 2015) \"Of the 291 PCMH panels participating in 2013, 69 percent earned an outcome incentive award averaging 36 percent, and of the panels participating in 2011-2013, 37 percent earned the award in all three years.\" (O'Brien, 2015) SOURCES: CareFirst, 2014; CareFirst, Effective Care for High-Need Patients CAREOREGON'S HEALTH RESILIENCE PROGRAM Target population The 10 percent of CareOregon's Medicaid mem - bers who incur 50 percent of the plan's medi - cal expenses. Members enrolled in the Health Resilience program were more likely to expe - rience high disease burden and psychosocial challenges. The majority of those who enrolled have experienced significant trauma in their lives. (Ramsay, 2015)Matched Segment Not used in matching exercise Intervention Components Health Resilience Specialists are paired with primary health homes and specialty practices to provide individualized high touch and trauma-informed support to patients with exceptional utiliza - tion with the primary emphasis of mitigating social determinants of health. (CareOregon, 2014) Staff are supported by clinically licensed supervisors who provide daily and weekly guidance, mentoring, and clinical supervision. (CareOregon, 2014) The Health Resilience Specialists, who have mental health and addictions training, an in-depth understanding of trauma dynamics, and extensive outreach experience with the Medicaid population, are paid and administered by CareOregon but operate as part of a primary care team. (CareOregon, 2014) The program also subcontracts with regional and culturally specific peer mentors to build longer- term sustainability into the program. (CareOregon, 2014) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost X X X Notes CareOregon's six programmatic principles of trauma-informed care include: reducing barriers; providing client-centered care; increasing transparency; taking time and building trust; avoiding judgment and labels; and providing care in a community-based setting. (CareOregon, 2014) Measures of access and quality increased significantly, as did member access to help with food, housing, and transportation. (Ramsay, 2015) Clinical staff rated the program highly on measures of care coordination, effectiveness at caring for high-need Medicaid patients, and care team satisfaction.

More than 30 percent of the members are dual-eligibles. (Klein, 2016)Matched Segment Not used in matching exercise Intervention Components For-profit model offers a one-stop-shop approach for delivering multispecialty services in the community utilizing a smaller physician panel size of 350 to 450 patients, allowing for intensive health coaching and preventive care. (Coye, 2016) Collaborative peer review, powered by customized information technology, is a central feature of this system. (Tanio, 2013) ChenMed practices offer a broad set of additional services on site, including dental care, digital x-ray, ultrasound, and acupuncture, as well as five to 15 high-volume specialists. (Tanio, 2013) Because access to care is a major issue with seniors, the practice provides door-to-door van transportation at no charge. (Tanio, 2013) To boost medication adherence, each practice has on-site physician pharmacy dispensing, which encourages patients to discuss side effects and other issues that interfere with medication adherence. (Tanio, 2013) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost X X Notes For-profit Medicare Advantage model of managed care that accepts capitated payments and is at full risk for patients' total health care costs. (Tanio, 2013) ChenMed's customized electronic health record and decision support software requires less documentation than most off-the-shelf electronic health records, allowing physicians to make concise notes and enhance productivity. (Hostetter, 2016) Ninety percent of ChenMed's diabetic patients reported they had an improved understanding of their medications and 80 percent reported improved communication with their physician. New Promoter Scores, a measure of how likely a member would be to refer a practice to a friend or colleague, was 90 percent compared to a national average for health insurance companies of 12 percent. (Klein, 2016) SOURCES: Coye, 2016; Hostetter, for High-Need Patients CIGNA COLLABORATIVE CARE MODEL Target population High-risk, high-cost patients identified based on having multiple comorbidities and through Cigna's proprietary predictive modeling. (Davda, 2015)Matched Segment Not used in matching exercise Intervention Components Cigna Collaborative Care, modeled after accountable care organizations, embeds a care coordinator, typically a registered nurse, in a physician group with a substantial primary care component. (Davda, 2015) Care coordinators work closely with Cigna's case managers to ensure that high-need individu - als receive the screenings, follow-up care, educational materials, and access to Cigna's clinical support programs, such as those for chronic condition management and lifestyle management, to help them manage their health better. (Davda, 2015) Cigna uses proprietary predictive modeling and analytics to provide the embedded care coordinator with a daily list of which members of a practice are in the hospital and will require a transition of care call at the time of discharge, and a monthly list of high-risk patients with multiple gaps in care, such as medication compliance issues and multiple emergency depart - ment visits. (Davda, 2015) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost X X Notes Cigna offers ongoing training and best practice sharing for the care coordinators and connects them with other Cigna resources such as case managers, wellness coaches, and pharmacists to expand the clinical resources available to their patients. (Davda, 2015) The medical group is rewarded through a pay for value structure if it meets targets for improving quality and lowering medical costs. (Cigna, 2014) Large physician groups active two or more years have shown 3 percent better total medical cost and a 2 percent increase in quality performance.

(Meltzer, 2014) Each CCP has a panel of approximately 200 patients and serves as both primary care physician and supervisor for each panel member's care while hospitalized. (Meltzer, 2014) The five CCPs visit hospitalized patients each morning while the other members of the care team provide care at the physicians' clinics. One CCP is assigned afternoon rounds and weekend duties. \"Providing these physicians with a high volume of inpatients and locating their clinics in or near the hospital allows them to offer many of the same benefits that hospitalists provide while offering the additional benefit of continuity across settings and over time.\" (Meltzer, 2014) \"The CCP or other care team member makes postdischarge calls to the patient and both tele - phone and text messages are used to keep the care team and patient connected.\" (Meltzer, 2014) Outcomes Well-being Utilization Cost (study not yet completed) (study not yet completed) (study not yet completed) Notes Shared saving based on risk-adjusted estimates of predicted costs.

(Mangiante, 2015) Individuals in 23 participating delivery systems and 500 practices are identified using a predictive risk model plus cognitive assessment, as well as through physician referrals. (Mangiante, 2015) Interdisciplinary care teams developed longitudinal relationships with clients and provide warm handoffs to support services outside of the health care system. (Stremikis, 2016) Care coordinators complete a face-to-face \"supervisit\" within 1 month of a member's enrollment in the program. Because medically complex patients can be anxious and depressed, coordinators are particularly attentive to their patients' social and psychological needs, providing or supplying referrals for behavioral, psychosocial, and community services. (Mangiante, 2015) Coordinators proactively provide patients with tools for effective self-management, helping them to develop action plans and to recognize signs of exacerbations of illness, and engage in two-way communication with members at least once per month, with intensity decreasing as patients become stable.
