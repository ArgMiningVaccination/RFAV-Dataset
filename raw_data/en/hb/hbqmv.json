When one occurs, by a blow to the head or body, the brain's normal functions are disrupted. The traumatic injury can affect physical and cognitive abilities, as well as interrupt sleep patterns and impact emotions and behavior. Because a concussion can become a serious medical issue or even cause death, it's critical to seek medical care quickly. Our experienced concussion team has access to the latest technology and can guide your recovery process by determining how serious your case is.

Concussions are common injuries. According to the CDC, about 3.8 million happen every year. Concussion symptoms can be difficult to spot, however, as some may seem insignificant or appear days after the injury occurred. Right after the injury, confusion or nausea may be the only symptoms. After a couple of hours have passed, you may not remember how you got hurt. Days later, you may have trouble sleeping or notice more emotional symptoms. If you or someone you know recently sustained a blow to the head or the body and a head jolt resulted, it's important to keep a watchful eye and see a doctor if any of the following signs of concussion arise: If your child was the one injured, remember you know them better than their trainer or their coach. If you think something isn't normal, you're probably right. Keep track of any new symptoms or changes in symptoms so you can let your doctor know about them. If any of these symptoms get worse, call 911 or go directly to the emergency department. Because concussions are so common, it's important to know the facts so you can promptly seek the right level of care. Facts to remember: You can't really prevent a concussion, but you can practice basic safety. This includes: Though the signs of a concussion usually resolve over time with proper care, the traumatic brain injury (TBI) could escalate into something worse if left untreated. Continuing regular activity levels and not resting could lead to life-altering complications or even death. Skipping treatment can lead to: Second-impact syndrome: A rare condition that arises from a second concussion before the first is fully healed, possibly leading to permanent brain injury or death. Regular activity levels should be avoided until you get your doctor's approval. Multiple concussions: Having a concussion increases your risk for future ones. Having another concussion may prolong the time needed for recovery or lead to chronic medical problems. A doctor can teach you ways to stay safe and avoid further damage. Post-concussion syndrome: A disorder that may develop when concussion symptoms fail to resolve over a period of months and depression, anxiety or irritability emerges. This condition is often treated differently than a brain injury.

CT scans may be performed to capture a series of X-rays to provide a 3D image of your brain.

Our physical therapy department can offer specialized vestibular therapy to help with balance or vision problems. We also offer [speech therapists](/health-services/rehabilitation-services/speech-therapy) to help with problems with speaking and thinking. Most people with a concussion need to rest to let the brain heal. Athletes may need to refrain from their sport for about 10 days. We may recommend that you avoid things like using a computer or reading if they make your concussion symptoms worse. You may need to avoid bright lights and loud noises, too. Some people need more time to rest or additional treatment.
