The name and address of the applicant and the name, qualifications and experience of the scientist and of every other person who will be responsible for planning and carrying out the release of the organisms and for the supervision, monitoring and safety of the release. Name and address of the applicant: BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 2425 Garcia Avenue Mountain View, CA 94043 2. The title of the projec -PRV -301, PROSTVAC \u00b1 GM -CSF in Men With -Resistant Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 2 PART II INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ORGANISMS Characteristics Of The Donor, Parental And Recipient Organisms 3. Scientific Name and Taxonomy PROSTVAC -V/F is a live attenuated viral vector -based investigational vaccine product that is comprised of two component viral vectors, to be used together in a prime -boost vaccination regimen: PROSTVAC -V: Recombinant vaccinia virus that co -expresses a human prostate - specific antigen (PSA) gene and genes encoding three human antigen -3 (LFA -3) (designated TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules, or TRICOM). The PSA gene used in these recombinants has an alteration in a human le ukocyte antigen -A2 (HLA -A2) specific epitope (replacement of isoleucine position 155; designated L155). PROSTVAC -F: Recombinant fowlpox virus that co as PROSTVAC -V. Both PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are large, -stranded DNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of the Poxviridae Family. The subfamily is divided into genera according to Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 3 4. Usual strain, cultivar or other strain PROSTVAC -V: New York City Board of Healt h strain of vaccinia virus PROSTVAC -F: -TC, a culture -adapted vaccine strain fowlpox virus 5. Phenotype and Genetic Markers PROSTVAC -V The parental vaccinia virus used for the generation of PROSTVAC -V was derived from a plaque isolate (designated TBC -Wy) from the seed stock of virus used by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals to produce the licensed Dryvax\u00ae Smallpox Vaccine. This vaccine is the New York City Board of Healt h (NYCBH) strain, which has been associated with the lowest incidence of clinical complications following immunization ( Fenner, 1988 ). Notably, TBC -Wy and PROSTVAC significantly more attenuated than the mixture of vaccinia viruses that comprise the Dryvax Smallpox Vaccine, as measured in an intracranial LD 50 test in weanling mice . This neurovirulence test has traditionally been the most sensitive method for measuring virulence of vaccinia virus in vivo . PROSTVAC -V can be distinguished genetically from TBC -Wy by the presence of the inserted human genes encoding PSA and TRICOM and by the unique recombination junctions between the inserted genes and the parental vaccinia sequences . In primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells, PROSTVAC -V grows approximately as well in vitro as its non -recombinant parental vaccinia f virus. PROSTVAC -F The parental fowlpox virus used for the generation of PROSTVAC -F is a plaque isolate (designated TBC -FPV) from tissue culture -adapted vaccine strain POXVAC -TC\u00ae. POXVAC -TC is a USDA poultry vaccine manufactured by Schering -Plough Corporation. PROSTVAC -F can be distinguished genetically from TBC -FPV by the presence of the inserted human genes encoding PSA and TRICOM and by the un ique recombination junctions between the inserted genes and the parental fowlpox sequences . In primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells, PROSTVAC -F grows approximately as well in vitro as its non -recombinant parental fowlpox virus. In than the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 4 6. The degree of relatededness between the donor and recipient or between parental organisms PROSTVAC -V In PROSTVAC -V, the PSA and TRICOM genes are all inserted at a single site in the Hind F region (Goebel, 1990 ) of the parental virus TBC -Wy. T hese four genes are inserted into an intergenic region between open reading frames F12L and F13L, which are transcribed to the right. No vaccinia genes are inter rupted by this insertion. PROSTVAC -F In PROSTVAC -F, the PSA and TRICOM genes are all inserted at a single site in the parental virus genome . One fowlpox gene in TBC -FPV was disrupted by the insertion of the human genes in PROSTVAC -F. The absence of this gene, FPV246, which has homology to the ankyrin repeat gene family (Afonso, 2000 ), is not predicted to have an effect on the properties of fowlpox virus. For both PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, comparison of the respective parental and recombinant viruses indi cates that the added human transgenes in these recombinant viruses have not fundamentally altered the biologic properties of the viruses with respect to virulence, replicative ability, or stability in the environment. 7. The description of identification and detection techniques . Detection and identification of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are accomplished using the following assays: Quantitative FACS assay to measure titers of infectious virus Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of inserted genes and recombination j unctions for virus identity Transgene expression by Western Blot 8. The sensitivity, reliability (in quantitative terms) and specificity of detection and identification techniques . Quantitative FACS Assay The FACS assay is a quantitative in vitro assay that confirms the expression of viral products, TRICOM\u00ae (B7.1, ICAM -1 and LFA -3) and PSA . In this assay, c ells are in cubated in vitro with serial dilution of virus then evaluated for the expression of both viral proteins as well as transgene products simultane ously. Transgene products and viral antigens in individual cells are detected with specific antibodies conjugated to fluorophores that are detected by FACS. Binding of antibodies to their specific targets is performed after fixation and permeabilization of infected cells. FACS analysis reveals the percentage of cells that are infected with virus, from which an BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 5 infectious unit ( Inf. U.) titer is calculated. It also reveals the percentage of cells that express the trangenes, from which a transducing unit (Txg. U.) titer is calculated. This assay is a fully - validated potency assay used for the release of clinical material. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of inserted genes and recombination junctions The identity of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F is demonstrated using a qualitative PCR test. Briefly, for each test, DNA is extracted from the test sample and subjected to PCR amplification using specific primers homologous to sequences flanking the inserted PSA -TRICOM genes. The resulting PCR electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and compared with DNA markers of known fragment sizes. Analysis of the recombinant viruses is conducted in parallel with analysis of PROSTVAC -V/F reference standards. The PCR ide ntity tests for PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F were validated with respect to Lower Detection Limit, Specificity, Repeatability (intra -assay precision), and Intermediate Precision . Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for PSA, B7.7, ICAM -1 and LFA -3 is used to examine the molecular weight and identity of these polypeptides expressed by a mammalian cell line following uptake of recombinant virus. Analysis of the recombinant viruses is conducted in parallel with analysis of PROS TVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F reference standards. This assay is a fully -validated identity assay used for the release of clinical material . 9. The description of the geographic distribution and of the natural habitat of the organisms including information on natu ral predators, prey, parasites and competitors, symbionts and hosts. Vaccinia virus has been used for over 200 years as a vaccine for smallpox and has a well established safety and adverse event profile ( Casey, 2005 ; Poland, 2005 ). However , the origins of vaccinia virus in nature and as a vaccine remain a mystery. During the smallpox eradication campaign, the dogma held that vaccine strains could not survive in nature and that wild -type vaccinia virus was extinct . However, although v accinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, buffalo pox virus, first isolated in India and still associated with sporadic outbreaks in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Russia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Italy, has been proposed to be a subspecies of vaccinia virus. Additional ly, several strains of vaccinia virus have been isolated throughout Brazil. R ecent studies have suggested an independent origin for South American VACV isolates, distinct from the vaccine strains used on this continent during the smallpox eradication campa ign (Trindade, 2007 ). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 -PRV Part A1 6 Avipoxviruses (APV) are distributed worldwide. APV host range is restricted in vivo to certain avian species. The virus species fowlpox virus infects and causes disease in poultry. T he parental fowlpox used for the generation of P ROSTVAC -F is a non-virulent , vaccine strain . 10. The potential of the organisms for genetic transfer and exchange with other organisms. The potential for gene transfer to other species under the proposed release of the GMO is extremely low . Recombination between the DNA genome of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F with the DNA genome of a host cell is unlikely. The poxvirus life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm ( Moss , 1996); poxviruses do not integrate into the genome of the infected cell. Therefore, the risk of poxvirus persistence by integration into the host chromosome is very low. Although the human genes expressed in PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F share homology with their counterparts in the human genome, the physical segregation between host and viral genom es renders recombination between PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and the human genome an unlikely event. The frequency, already unlikely, of any such recombination events in humans or non - avian species after administration of PROSTVAC -F would be further reduced by the lack of replicative capacity of fowlpox virus in these species. Recombination between the two PROSTVAC -V/F components, PROSTVAC -V and wild type fowlpox, or PROSTVAC -F and wild type vaccinia, is unlikely because the vaccinia and fowlpox do not share homology. No interviral recombination between vaccinia and fowlpox DNA has been observed (Scheiflinger, 1992 ). In addition, vaccinia is not normally found in nature. Recombination between PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and a wild -type vaccinia or fowlpox virus in an infected host org anism is theoretically possible. However, such recombination would not be expected to alter the virulence, growth properties, or environmental persistence of the virus . In addition, the likelihood of recombination between PROSTVAC -V and wild type vaccinia in vivo is extremely low because vaccinia is not normally found in nature. Recombination of vaccinia virus with other poxviruses, such as orf , molluscum contagiosum , or shope vitro . Recomb ination between PROSTVAC -F and a wild or vaccine strain of fowlpox would require release of PROSTVAC -F into an environment containing poultry. Such release is highly unlikely under the proposed conditions of release. Recombination with other viral genomes is also unlikely due to the lack of homology between different families of viruses as well as to the physical segregation between the genomes of the poxviruses and those of other viruses that replicate in the nucleus. Additionally, i n non-avian species susceptible to infection by PROSTVAC -F, few opportunities for genetic recombination with other could occur, since the level of replication that the vector DNA undergoes in vivo is low, and limited to cells infected by t he inoculum (no generation of infectious particles). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 7 11. Verifi cation of the genetic stability of the organisms and factors affecting stability. The entire genome of the Working Seed Virus (W SV) and the entire genome of one production lot of PROSTVAC -V and PRO STVAC -F are sequenced . In addition, for each production lot, identity is demonstrated by PCR, Western blot, and restriction site analysis. In aggregate this testing provides verification of genetic stability . In addition, a comparability assessment of the full genomes Phase 2 and Phase 3 IMP material was completed. These data further support the genetic stability of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F. 12. The following pathological, ecological and physiological traits: a. The classification of hazard according to existin g Community rules concerning the protection of human health and the environment In terms of classification of hazard, the human vaccinia virus is classified as a group 2 biological agent according to the European Economic Community (EEC) classification for the protection of workers with biological agents {Directive 2000/54/EC}. Fowlpox virus is classified as a Biosafety Level 1 organism for practices involving biological materials and containment facilities (as defined by the United States Center for Diseas e Control and Prevention, Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria). b. The generation time in natural ecosystems, and sexual and asexual reproductive cycles. Vaccinia Virus Vaccinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, although buffalo pox virus has been proposed to be a subspecies of vaccinia virus, and several strains of vaccinia virus have been isolated throughout Brazil. V accinia virus causes a transient infection in susceptible hosts , with elimination of viral components over several weeks. Host cel ls infected with vaccinia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mi xed form of apoptosis/necrosis. Vaccinia replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA. Latent infection of humans with vaccini a virus has not been observed ( Fenner, 1988 ). Fowlpox Virus The vaccine strain of fowlpox virus used for the generation of PROSTVAC -F is widely used for the prevention of disease in chickens by wild type fowlpox virus. It is not virulent and does not cause disease. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 8 Wild -type fowlpox virus causes a slow -spreading viral infection of chickens and turkeys. The course of the disease in the individual bird takes three to five weeks. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected avian cells, which resul ts in a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) 4 to 6 days post infection. Viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA. c. Survivability, including seasonability and the ability to form survival structures, including seeds, spores, and sclerotia PRO STVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are live viruses and do not form structures. Survivability is dependent upon the ability to replicate within a host cell. Poxviruses have the capacity to survive for considerable periods in dried material such as detached vaccinati on scabs. They are also relatively stable when stored frozen or lyophilized under carefully controlled conditions. However stability decreases significantly as temperature is increased. Under normal environmental conditions, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are expected to lose viability within days or weeks. d. Pathogenicity, including infectivity, toxigenicity, virulence, allergenicity, carrier (vector) of pathogen, possible vectors, host range including non -target organisms and possible activation of latent vir uses (proviruses) and ability to colonise other organisms PROSTVAC -V Vaccinia virus has been used for over 200 years as a vaccine for smallpox and has a wel l- established safety profile. US experience, published in 1968, delineate 8 deaths that occurred i n a program of over 14 million primary and secondary smallpox vaccinations (Lane, 1969 ). Normal reactions to smallpox vaccination are mild and self -limited, and include fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, chills, nausea, soreness and erythema at the vaccin ation site, local lymphadenopathy. Mild adverse reactions that can occur post vaccination are bacterial superinfection of vaccination site, erythema multiforme and general ized vaccinia. Very rare, but serious and potentially life -threatening even ts, virus is restricted to certain warm -blooded vertebrate hosts, including humans and animal species such as cattle, cats, rodents, rabbits and pigs . However, the virus does not appear to occur naturally in humans and has no known animal reservoir . Vaccinia virus causes a transient infection, with elimination of viral components over several weeks. Host cells infected with vacci nia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mixed form of apoptosis/necrosis. Vaccinia replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA. Thus, vaccinia is incapable of colonizing the host organisms that it infects. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 9 The parental virus used for the generation of P ROSTVAC -V was derived from TBC -Wy, a plaque isolate from the seed stock of virus used by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals to produce the licensed Dryvax\u00ae Smallpox Vaccine. This vaccine is the New York C ity Board of Health strain, which has been associated with the lowest incidence of clinical complications following immunization (Fenner, 1988 ). Both TBC -Wy and PROSTVAC -V are measured in a rodent neurovirulence assay ( see item 5 ); these results indicate that the insertion of foreign sequences into TBC -Wy does not increase the virulence of the resulting recombinant virus. With respect to toxigenicity and allergenicity, no biologically significant changes or signs of untoward toxicological effects were noted in either rodent or non -human primate safety studies. In addition, PROSTVAC -V has previously been administered to over 300 subjects in eight phase 1 and 2 clinical studies (see Item 32 ) and no toxic or allerge nic effects were reported . The most common AEs related to PROSTVAC -V observed to date have been injection site reactions, all of which were Grade 2 severity. PROSTVAC -F Productive fowlpox virus infection is restricted in vivo to certain avian species, including chickens, turkeys, and pigeons, and in vitro to cells derived from avian species. Although fowlpox -mediated gene expression does occur in infected non -avian cells, infection of mammalian species does not cause disease. Further, because fowlpox virus is incapable of replication in mammalian species, it is incapable of colonizing these species. The parental virus used for the generation of P ROSTVAC -F, designated TBC -FPV, was a plaque isolate from a tissue culture -adapted vaccine strain of FPV (PO XVAC -TC), which is a USDA - licensed poultry vaccine manufactured by Schering -Plough Corporation. No untoward effects on the environment, other bird species, or animal handlers have been reported from the use of POXVAC -TC. In more attenuated than the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. With respect to toxigenicity and allergenicity, no biologically significant changes or signs of untoward toxicological effects were noted in either rodent or non-human primate safety studies. In addition, PROSTVAC -F has previously been administered to over 300 subjects in eight phase 1 and 2 clinical studies (see Item 32 ) and no toxic or allergenic effects were reported . e. Antibiotic resistance, and potential u se of these antibiotics in humans and dome stic organisms for prophylaxsis and therapy Not applicable. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are viruses and therefore do not confer antibiotic resistance properties. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 10 f. Involvement in environmental processes including prima ry production, nutrient turnover, decomposition of organic matter and respiration. There is no evidence of poxviruses having any involvement in environmental processes. 13. The sequence, frequency of mobilisation and specificity of indigenous vectors and the presence in those vectors of genes which confer resistance to environmental stresses. Not applicable. Infection of a cell with PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F results in cell death. 14. The history of genetic modification. The gene encoding PSA was isolated at the N ational Cancer Institute by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA derived from RNA from the human LNCaP cell line (CRL 1740, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD), which a adenoca rcinoma (Horoszewicz, 1983 ). sequence analysis indicated that the sequence of this cDNA was identical to the published sequence with the exception of a single nucleotide change resulting in a change in amino acid residue 658 from asparagine to tyrosine (Lundwall, 1987 ). The PSA gene was then modified by in vitro mutagenesis to express full -length protein containing one altered epitope that has been shown to enhance immunogenicity (Terasawa, 2002 ). This mutation changed the encoded amino acid a t position 155 from isoleucine to leucine. The gene encoding LFA -3 was isolated by PCR amplification of Human Spleen Quick -Clone cDNA (Clontech Inc.) using the published sequence (Wallner, 1987 ). The gene encoding ICAM -1 was isolated by PCR amplification of cDNA from RNA from an Epstein -Barr Virus -transformed B cell line derived from a healthy male, using the published sequence (Staunton, 1988 ). The gene encoding B7.1 was isolated at the National Cancer Institute by PCR amplification of cDNA derived from RNA from the human Raji cell line (ATCC # CCL 86), using the published sequence (Chen, 1992 ). The sE/L promoter was isolated as a 60 bp Hind III -Sal I fragment from pJS -8, a derivative of pSC65 (Chakrabarti, 1997 ). The remaining vacci nia promoter sequences were isolated from genomic DNA prepared TBC -Wy or from the vaccinia WR strain (Panicali, 1981 ). Additional details on the genes inserted into the genomes of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F may be found in Item 20, below. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 11 Characteristics Of The Vector 15. The nature and source of the vector. As described more fully in Items 19 and 20 below, the insertion of foreign genes into the poxvirus genome is accomplished using a plasmid transfer vector that contains the expression cassettes flanked by add itional poxvirus sequences that direct recombination within a specified genome region. The starting plasmid used to generate the plasmid transfer vectors was derived from the plasmid vector pUC8 (Viera, 1982 ). 16. The sequence of transposons, vectors and othe r non -coding genetic segments used to construct the genetically modified organisms and to make the introduced vector and insert function in those organisms. As described more fully in Items 19 and 20 below, human genes were inserted into the parental vacci nia and fowlpox genomes by homologous DNA recombination within infected cells using plasmid transfer vectors that contain the expression cassettes flanked by additional poxvirus sequences that direct recombination within a specified genome region. The gen etic structures of the plasmid transfer vectors used in the generation of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, as well as the origins of each vector component are described in detail in Item 20 below. 17. The frequency of mobilisation, genetic transfer capabilities and/ or methods of determination of the inserted vector. Not applicable. Homologous recombination between poxvirus DNA and the plasmid vector results in insertion of the heterologous genes into the poxviral genome; the original plasmid transfer vector is not pa rt of the GMO. 18. The degree to which the vector is limited to the DNA required to perform the intended function. The plasmid vectors used in the generation of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F each contain DNA sequences encoding the PSA and TRICOM genes together with the poxviral regulatory sequences (promoters) that direct their expression in poxvirus -infected cells . These gene sequences are flanked by genomic regions that allow homologous recombination between the transfer plasmid and the vaccinia or fowlpox ge nomes, respectively . The backbone of each transfer plasmid includ es a bacterial origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance gene, which allow the selection and propagation of the plasmids in bacterial cells; however, only the PSA and TRICOM genes, together with the poxviral regulatory sequences are present in the final recombinant viruses. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 12 Characteristics of the Modified Organism s 19. The methods used for the modification As described briefly in Items 17 and 18 above, t he generation of recombinant pox viruses is accomplished via homologous recombination , within an infected cell, between pox virus DNA and a plasmid vector that carries the heterologous sequences to be inserted. The plasmid vector contains one or more chimeric genes, each comprising a pox virus promoter link ed to a protein coding sequence; the gene sequences to be inserted are flanked by viral sequences from a non - essential region of the pox virus genome. The plasmid is transfected into primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infect ed with the parental pox virus, and recombination between pox virus sequences on the plasmid and the corresponding DNA in the viral genome results in the insertion into the viral genome of the chimeric genes on the plasmid. 20. The methods used a. To con struct i nserts and introduce them into the recipient organism PROSTVAC -V Plasmid Vector . The plasmid vector used for insertion of the PSA and TRICOM genes into the parental vaccinia virus genome by recombination contains the following elements: a prokaryotic origin of replication to allow amplification of the ve ctor in a bacterial host; the gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, to permit selection of prokaryotic host cells that contain the plasmid; DNA sequences homologous to the Hind III F re gion of the vaccinia genome, which direct insertion of foreign sequences into this region via homologous recombination; this flanking sequence also includes the vaccinia F13L gene encoding the 37K envelope protein; a chimeric gene comprising the vaccinia 4 0K transcriptional promoter linked to the PSA gene; a second chimeric gene comprising the vaccinia 30K transcriptional promoter linked to the LFA -3 gene; a third chimeric gene comprising the vaccinia I3 transcriptional linked to the ICAM fourth chimeric gene comprising the promoter linked to the B7.1 gene. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -301: Part A1 13 Plasmid Backbone . The plasmid backbone, including the bacterial origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance gene, was derived from the plasmid vector pUC8 (Viera, 1982 ) by deletion of a 442 base pair (bp) Hae II fragment containing the pUC8 polylinkers and lacZ gene . A linker containing a single Hind III site was inserted in the unique Nde I site in this vector to facilitate additional cloning. Flanking Sequences . The vaccinia Hind III F sequences and the vaccinia promoter sequences were isolated from genomic DNA prepared from TBC -Wy from the vaccinia WR strain (Panicali, 1981 ). Sequences from the Hind III F region, including the F13L gene, that flank the PSA and TRICOM genes Transcriptional Promoters . The 40K promoter element was isolated as a 161 bp Dra I - FnuD II fragment from the vaccin ia virus Hind III H region (Rosel, 1986 ) The 30K (M2L) promoter element was isolated as a 415 bp Sal I -Rsa I fragment from the Hind III M region of the vaccinia genome (Goebel, 1990 ). The I3 promoter element was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) amplification of a 201 bp sequence immediately 5' to the translation initiation codon of the I3 gene (Schmitt, 1988 ). PSA gene . The gene encoding PSA was isolated at the National Cancer Institute by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA deri ved from RNA from the human LNCaP cell line (CRL 1740, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD), which from a prostatic adenocarcinoma (Horoszewicz, 1983 ). Nucleotide analysis indicated that the se quence of this cDNA was identical to the published sequence with the exception of a single nucleotide change resulting in a change in amino acid residue 658 from asparagine to tyrosine (Lundwall, 1987 ). The PSA gene was then modified by in vitro mutagenes is to express full -length protein containing one altered epitope that has been shown to enhance immunogenicity (Terasawa, 2002 ). This mutation changed the encoded amino acid at position 155 from isoleucine to leucine. The modified PSA gene was contained on a 786 bp fragment which consists of the entire coding sequence for PSA (Lundwall, 1987 ). LFA -3 gene . The gene encoding LFA -3 was isolated at the National Cancer Institute by PCR amplification of Human Spleen Quick -Clone cDNA (Clontech Inc.) using the published sequence (Wallner, 1987 ). The gene was contained on a 753 bp fragment which consists of the entire coding sequence for LFA -3. ICAM -1 gene . The gene encoding ICAM -1 was isolated at the National Cancer Institute by PCR amplification of cDNA reverse -transcribed from RNA from an Epstein -Barr Virus - transformed B cell line derived from a healthy male, using the published sequence (Staunton, 1988 ). The gene was contained on a 1599 bp fragment which consists of the entire coding sequence for ICAM -1. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 14 B7.1 gene. The gene encoding B7.1 was isolated at the National Cancer Institute by PCR amplification of cDNA derived from RNA from the human Raji cell line (ATCC # CCL 86), using the published sequence (Chen, 1992 ). The gene was contained on an 867 bp fragment which consists of the entire coding sequence for B7.1. The structure of the plasmid transfer vector was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion using BamH I, EcoR I, and Sac I. In addition, the products of digestion with these enzymes were subjected to Southern blot analysis using labeled probes c orresponding to the PSA, B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 genes and to the vaccinia Hind III F sequences. The DNA fragments visualized by these methods were of the predicted sizes, and the presence of the PSA, B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 genes was unequivocally demonstrated, thus confirming the predicted structure of the plasmid. Generation of Recombinant Virus. The PROSTVAC -V recombinant virus was generated using standard recombination techniques. CEF cells were infected with the parental vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 pfu/cell. Using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Graham, 1973 ) cells were then transfected with the plasmid transfer vector pT2240. After 48 hours, infected cells were harvested and progeny virus was released by three rounds of freezing and thawing. A derivative of TBC -Wy was created to facilitate the isolation of recombinant virus. This derivative virus, designated TBC -Wy37, was generated from TBC -Wy by replacement of the F13L gene with the E. coli gpt gene and the lacZ gene using a procedure similar to that described in Blasco & Moss ( 1991 ). Deletion of the F13L gene results in a virus defective in in the formation of pox viral plaques on infected cells in vitro . Expression of the lacZ gene by TBC - Wy37 results in the production \u00df -galactosidase. PROSTVAC -V was generated using TBC -Wy37by described by Blasco & Moss (1995 ). CEF cells were infected with TBC -Wy37 and transfected with pT2240. Recombination between the plasmid vector and the viral DNA restores the F13L (37K) gene of the parental TBC -Wy; thus, the desired recombinant virus possess es the ability to form plaques on a permissive cell line. In addition , in recombinant viruses, the gpt gene and the lacZ gene are replaced by the four chimeric transgenes described above. Recombinant progeny viruses were identified by their ability to form plaques and their colorless appearance in the presence of Bluo -Gal, the histochemical substrate for -galactosidase. After recombination, CEF cells were infected with progeny virus until distinct plaques were visible. Plaques were picked from the cell monolayer and their progeny were further propagated. Repeated roun ds of plaque isolation and replating resulted in the purification of the desired recombinant, which was then amplified on CEF cells to generate a recombinant seed stock. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV A1 15 PROSTVAC -F Plasmid Vector. The plasmid vector used for insertion of the PSA and TRI COM genes into the parental fowlpox virus genome by homologous recombination contains the following elements: a prokaryotic origin of replication to allow amplification of t he vector in a bacterial host; the gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, to permit selection of prokaryotic host cells that contain the plasmid; DNA sequences homologous to the BamH I J region of the fowlpox genome, which direct insertion of foreign sequences into this region via homologous recombination; the E. co li lac Z gene, flanked by repeated sequences; a chimeric gene comprising the vaccinia 40K transcriptional promoter linked to gene comprising the vaccinia 30K transcriptional promoter linked to the LFA -3 chimeric gene c omprising the chimeric gene comprising the sE/L to the B7.1 gene. Plasmid backbone . The plasmid backbone was identical to that for PROSTVAC -V Flanking Sequences . The fowlpox BamH 1991 ) sequences were isolated from genomic DNA prepared from the POXVAC -TC vaccine strain (Schering Corporation) of fowlpox virus. Sequences from the BamH I J region that flank the PSA(L155), LFA -3, ICAM -1, B7.1 a nd lacZ genes include an 850 bp BamH I - Bgl II fragment upstream of the 40K -lacZ sequence and a 750 bp Bgl II - Xba I fragment downstream of the and I3 promoter were t o those used for PROSTVAC -V. The sE/L promoter was isolated as a 60 bp Hind III -Sal I fragment from pJS -8, a derivative of pSC65 (Chakrabarti, 1997 ). The C1 promoter element was isolated as a 240 bp Sau3A I fragment from fowlpox virus (Jenkins, 1991 ). Sequences for Transient Selection . The E. coli lac Z gene was isolated as a 3100 bp BamH I fragment from pDP500 (Panicali, 1986 ). The lacZ gene is flanked by repeated sequences for transient lacZ selection. The repeated sequence consists of 219 bp from th e 3' end of the left flanker of the fowlpox BamH I J insertion site plus 161 bp from the vaccinia 40K promoter. PSA gene . The gene encoding modified PSA was isolated as described for PROSTVAC -V LFA -3 gene . The gene encoding LFA -3 was isolated as describe d for PROSTVAC -V. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September Part A1 16 ICAM -1 gene . The gene encoding ICAM -1 was isolated as described for PROSTVAC -V. B7.1 gene. The gene encoding B7.1 was isolated as described for PROSTVAC -V. The structure of the plasmid transfer vector was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion using BamH I, EcoR I, and EcoR V. In addition, the products of digestion with these enzymes were subjected to Southern blot analysis using labeled probes corresponding to the PSA, B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 genes and to the fowlpox Bam H I J sequences. The DNA fragments visualized by these methods were of the predicted sizes, and the presence of the PSA, B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 genes was unequivocally demonstrated, thus confirming the predicted structure of the plasmid. Generation of Re combinant Virus . The PROSTVAC -F recombinant virus was generated using standard recombination techniques. CEF cells were infected with the parental fowlpox virus. Using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Graham, 1973 ) cells were then transfected with the plasmid transfer vector pT 2246. Infected cells were harvested and progeny virus was released by three rounds of freezing and thawing. A chromogenic assay for -galactosidase was used to identify and isolate recombinant viruses containing the lacZ, PSA and TRICOM genes . This method takes advantage of the ability of fowlpox virus to form distinct plaques when grown on CEF cell monolayers . Cells were infected with progeny virus until distinct plaques were visible, at which time the plaques were ove rlaid Bluo -Gal to allow visualization of plaques expressing the lacZ gene. Viral plaques expressing lacZ appeared blue against a clear background. Positive plaques were picked from the cell monolayer and their progeny were further subjected to several ro unds of plaque purification. The E. coli lac Z gene was flanked by repeated sequences. Because repeated sequences are unstable in pox viruses (Moss, 1981 ), upon amplification the purified \"blue\" recombinant viruses spontaneously gave rise to white plaques from which the lacZ gene has been deleted. The white plaques were selected and plaque -purified. The purified recombinant pox virus contained only the desired genes encoding PSA and TRICOM . Positive recombinants were amplified on CEF cells to produce a seed stock. The seed stock was then subjected to titration, sterility testing, and genomic and protein expression analysis. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 17 21. The description of any insert or vector construction Detailed in Item 20 above . 22. The purity of the insert from any unknown sequenc e and information on the degree to which the inserted sequence is limited to the DNA required to perform the intended function For both PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, the DNA sequence of the inserted transgenes and associated transcriptional control regions, t ogether with approximately 800 -900 base pairs of genomic viral sequences on either side of the inserted genes was determined. Both PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F exhibited the expected nucleotide sequences; the coding sequences of the four inserted genes and t heir associated transcriptional control regions are identical to the predicted sequences. The transgenes are inserted at the expected site in the viral genome. No unexpected rearrangements were detected. Portions of the vector manipulated during its derivation conformed to predicted sequence. The inserted sequences are limited to the four human genes and the associated poxvirus transcriptional control regions required for their express in the recombinant poxviruses. 23. The methods and criteria used for selection The methods and criteria used to select the recombinant pox viruses PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are detailed in item 20, above. Confirmation of identity, genomic structure, and protein expression were performed as described below. Confirmation of the identi ty and genomic structure of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F was accomplished by restriction enzyme digestion using three different enzymes and Southern blot hybridization using vaccinia -specific or fowlpox -specfic probes, LFA -3-specific, ICAM -1-specific, and B7.1 -specific probes. Analysis of each recombinant virus was conducted in parallel with the parental virus and the plasmid used for homologous recombination. In addition, sequence analysis was performed on t he inserted foreign genes, on the recombination junctions, and on the regions 200 base pairs upstream and downstream of the gene insert. Recombinant virus DNA sequences were compared to the sequence of the plasmid vector used to generate the recombinant. Western blot analysis, usin g antibodies specific for PSA and the three TRICOM proteins was used to examine the molecular weight and identity of the proteins expressed by the recombinant virus es. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 18 24. The sequence, functional identity and location of the alter ed, inserted or delected nucleic acid segments in question and, in particular, any known harmful sequence . There are no harmful traits associated with the human genes inserted into PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F. In PROSTVAC -V, the human PSA and TRICOM genes we re inserted into an intergenic region between open reading frames F12L and F13L in the Hind F region of the genome. No vaccinia genes are interrupted by this insertion. In PROSTVAC -F, the human PSA and TRICOM genes were inserted into the FPV426 gene in the Bam HI J region of the genome. The absence of this gene, FPV246, which has homology to the ankyrin repeat gene family, is not predicted to have an effect on the properties of fowlpox virus. The identity and function of the inserted genes is described i n detail in Item 23, above. Characteristics of the Genetically Modified Organisms in Their Final Form 25. The description of genetic traits or phenoty pic characteristics and in particular any new traits and characteristics which may be expressed or no longer e xpressed PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are vaccinia and fowlpox viruses, respectively, into which have been inserted genes encoding modified human PSA and the three human immunoregulatory molecules B7.1, ICAM -1, and PROSTVAC -F expres s the four inserted human genes. No vaccinia genes are interrupted by th e insertion of human genes into PROSTVAC -V; in PROSTVAC -F, a single gene , FPV246, inactivated by the gene insertion. The inactivation of FPV246, which has homology to the ankyrin repeat gene family not predicted to have an effect on the properties of fowlpox virus. Thus, with the exception of their ability to express the human PSA and TRICOM genes, the genetic traits or phenotypic characteristics of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are es sentially those of parental vaccine strains of vaccinia virus and fowlpox virus. 26. The structure and amount of any vector or donor nucleic acid remaining in the final construction of the modified organisms. The only exogenous genes present in PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are genes encoding human PSA, B7.1, LFA -3, and ICAM -1, together with the poxviral regulatory sequences (promoters) that their expression in poxvirus -infected cells . BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 19 27. The stability of the organism in terms of genetic traits The entire geno me of the Working Seed Virus (W SV) and the entire genome of one production lot of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are sequenced . In addition, for each production lot, identity is demonstrated by PCR, Western blot, and restriction site analysis. In aggregate this testing provides verification of genetic stability . In addition, a comparability assessment of the full genomes Phase 2 and Phase 3 IMP material was completed. These data further support the genetic stability of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F.The rate and level of expression of the new genetic material in the organisms and the method and sensitivity of measurement of that rate and level. 28. Rate of expression of the new genetic material This has not been measured 29. The activity of the ge ne product The presumed mode of action of PROSTVAC -V/F involves the induction of anti -PSA immune responses that result in the eradication of PSA -expressing tumor cells. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are therapeutic vaccines designed to deliver the tumor -assoc iated antigen PSA to antigen -presenting cells (APCs), where it is then processed and expressed on the APC surface within the major histocompatability complex (MHC), leading -cell activation ( Essajee, ). In order of the expressed PSA, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F also express three human costimulatory molecules, designated TRICOM. Vaccination with PROSTVAC -V results in the simultaneous expression by infected cells of PSA epitopes in combination with costimul atory molecules . The co -expression of PSA in the context of the TRICOM molecules is expected to enhance the T cell immune response to PSA. These immune responses to PSA are then boosted by multiple immunizations with the corresponding recombinant fowlpox virus, P ROSTVAC -F. Data describing the activity of PROSTVAC gene products are reported in section 32. 30. The description of identification and detection techniques, including techniques for the identification and detection of the inserted sequence and ve ctor Confirmation of the identity and genomic structure of the recombinant viruses is accomplished by (1) PCR amplification of the inserted genes and flanking regions ; (2) FACS assay using antibodies specific for PSA, B7.7, ICAM -1, LFA -3, and the vector to examine the co -expression of all insert -derived antigen in host cells ; and (3) Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for PSA, B7.7, ICAM -1and LFA -3 to exa mine the molecular weight and identity of the polypeptides expressed by the recombinant viruses in cell lines. Analysis is conducted in parallel with analysis of PROSTVAC -V and F reference standards. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 20 31.

Inc. 22 September 2011 BNIT Part A1 23 Summary of Nonclinical Studies PROSTVAC -V and -F, and related pox virus vaccines have been tested in mouse, rabbit and non-human primate models as well as in a number of in vitro experiments. Notably, PROSTVAC was shown to induce robust anti -PSA humoral as well as cell mediated immunity in mouse, which translated into anti -tumor efficacy in a PSA -tumor model; in addition, anti -tumor activity provided by related pox virus vaccines targeting different antigens has also been reported in numerous publications ( Table A1 -2). No biologically significant changes or signs of untoward toxicological effects were noted in either rodent or non -human primate safety studies. Clinical Studies of PROSTVAC -V/F PROSTVAC -V/F is the product of more than 15 years of poxviral vaccine development and evaluation by the US National Cancer Instititue (NCI) and the former Therion Biologics Corporation (Therion). Since 1991, ten recombinant vaccinia -based va ccines and eight recombinant fowlpox -based vaccines produced by Therion for the treatment of various cancers have been evaluated in human clinical trials sponsored the NCI. Over 1,000 cancer patients, most with metastatic disease, have been treated to dat e with these various poxvirus -based vaccines in NCI -sponsored or Therion -sponsored clinical trials. The PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F products were preceded by a number of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies on earlier vaccinia and fowlpox constructs that exp ressed PSA. Clinical evaluations of early versions of these PSA -containing poxviral vectors involved over 250 patients. The initial constructs tested were vaccinia -PSA, in three Phase 1 studies totaling Sanda, 1999; Eder, 2000; Gully, 2002 ). Later, a boost regimen was devised with boosting with fowlpox -PSA containing vectors, in two studies, one with 64 patients ( Kaufman, 2004 ) and another unpublished study of approximately 16 patients. The NCI subsequently began a series of trials usi ng additional admixed vectors encoding a single costimulatory molecule (B7.1/CD80). These studies involved 94 patients ( Gully, 2005; Arlen, 2005; Madan, 2008 ). No significant safety issues were identified in these early studies. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have been evaluated in eight clinical trials in the United States under two separate INDs. These agents have been administered to over 300 men up to a maximum dose of 2 x 108 plaque -forming units (pfu) of PROSTVAC -V (now BB -MF 10428). Therion conducted a trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in ten patients, and a randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy (as defined by progression -free survival) of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in 122 men (125 enrolled, 122 received drug) with castration -resistant metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC). The NCI initiated its own ongoing investigations of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, alone and in combination with other therapies, in 2003, under NCI BB -IND 10915. These clinical BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 24 trials cover a range of study designs evaluating PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in early and late-stage disease and in combination with other therapies . To date, the NCI has conducted two Phase 1 studies, one Phase 1/2 study and three Phase 2 studies in the United States; no dose - limiting adverse effects have been noted in any of these trials. Therion com pleted the randomized Phase 2 study through approximately one year of follow -up. However, in 2006, Therion went out of business. In early 2007, the NCI, which had collaborated with Therio n to develop PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F for the treatment of prostat e cancer, acquired all rights to the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F technology and to the regulatory files previously owned by Therion. In 2008, BNIT acquired the Therion regulatory files and rights to the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F technology from the NCI in a license agreement, and a collaborative research and development agreement (CRADA). BNIT conducted and completed the final overall survival analysis for the Phase 2 trial. Summaries of Individual Clinical Studies with the GMO Conducted by the NCI The NC I studies outlined in Table A1 -3 evaluate PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F under a variety of study designs alone and in combination with various therapies. These are all small studies designed to evaluate the broad potential utility of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F for the treatment of prostate cancer, and they are reviewed primarily to further support the safety of this product.

In relation to human health a. the toxic or allergenic effects of the non -viable organisms and/or their metabolic products PROSTVAC -VF has previously been administered to over 300 subjects in eight Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies (see Item 32) and no toxic or allergenic effects were reported . b. the comparison of the organisms to the donor, recipient or (where appropriate) parental organism regarding pathogenicity As described in Item 5, PROSTVAC -V and PR OSTVAC -F are comparable to their parental viruses with respect to pathogenicity. c. the capacity of the organisms for colonization Replication and transcription of members of the Pox family of viruses occurs in the cytosol of infected cells, with virally enco ded enzymes driving these processes. PROSTVAC V/F DNA is extra -chromosomal and is n ot integrated. Poxviruses are cleared from the host within several days for PROSTVAC -F and weeks for PROSTVAC -V. Thus, colonization by PROSTVAC -V/F does not occur. d. if the organisms are pathogenic to humans who are immunocompetent i Diseases caused and mechanisms of pathogenicity including inv asiveness and virulence The most common AEs related to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F observed to date have been injection site reactions, a ll of which were Grade 2 severity. Typical AEs historically seen with intradermal administration (scarification) of vaccinia virus vaccines (vesicles, pustules, and have not been observed with PROSTVAC -V. PROSTVAC -V immunization is subcutaneou sly administered, which greatly reduces injection site reactions, and skin surface wound formation/viral shedding. The most common systemic AEs attributed to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F administration were fatigue, nausea/vomiting, fever, chills, arthralgia and dizziness. Reactions and Complications Associated with Smallpox Vaccinia Vaccination Vaccinia virus causes a transient infection, with elimination of viral components over several weeks. Host cells infected with vaccinia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mixed form of apoptosis/necrosis. Vaccinia replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA. Vaccinia virus is known to be shed from the wound site in traditional dermal scarification bas ed vaccination. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 27 The use of vaccinia virus for worldwide eradication of smallpox provides a safety database with the number of observations in the millions. Geographical differences in strains of vaccinia virus used as well as differences in reporting practices, diagnostic and follow -up criteria between countries , are a cause of some discrepancies in the incidences of adverse events reported, but the overall picture of vaccinia virus safety is very well known. An additional set of data is provided by recent vaccination campaign of military and civilian vaccinations in the US. A number of events post smallpox vaccination are expected and considered to be normal: fever, myal gia, headache, fatigue, chills, nausea, soreness and erythema at the vaccination s ite, local lymphadenopathy. Satellite lesions around the vaccination site have been reported as well as local edema. These symptoms are self -limiting, last for around three weeks after vaccination and rarely are a cause for serious concern ( Frey, 2002; F ulginiti, 2003 ). Mild adverse reactions that can occur post vaccination are bacterial superinfection of vaccination site, erythema multiforme and generalized vaccinia. Superinfection is a rare event with incidence from 0.14 to 55 cases per million accord ing to different reports (Vellozzi, 2004). Erythema multiforme (EM) most often presents as papules, plaques or urticaria which may be symmetrical and may involve palms and soles. EM resolves spontaneously and requires no special care. A development of St evens -Johnson syndrome with mucosal involvement is extremely rare, with only one case noted in the 2003 -2004 vaccination campaign in the US (<1 per 1,000,000) ( Fulginiti, 2003; Neff, 2008 ). Generalized vaccinia results from viremic spread of vaccinia virus from the vaccination site. It presents as generalized rash which behaves like the vaccination site lesion, progressing through papular, vesicular, pustular and scab -forming stages. The incidence is difficult to assess, since historically there was no st rict definition to distinguish generalized vaccinia from other conditions where rash is a dominant symptom (severe chickenpox, smallpox, eczema vaccinatum, EM). Retrospective analysis of 2002 - 2004 vaccinations suggests an incidence of ~50 case s per 1,00 0,000 ( Bryant -Genevier, 2006 ). The rash appears within a week after vaccination and resolves within a week. Most instances do not require specific therapy (Fulginiti, 2003 ). Some of the post -vaccinia adverse events, although very rare, are serious and po tentially life - threatening. They include the most serious complication known. It was almost always fatal prior to the introduction of vaccinia immune globulin ( VIG). PV occurs predominantly in persons with T -cell deficiencies or receiving treatments that result in T -cell deficiencies. The primary vaccination site fails to heal, viremic spread of vaccinia leads to generalized appearance of new lesions without re active immunoinflammatory response ( Bray, 2003; Fulginiti, 2003 ). PV is extremely rare; historical incidence is in the order of 1 case per 1 000 000. There were no reports of PV in the military and civilian vaccines in 2002 - 2004 vaccination campaigns ( Neff, 2008 ). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 28 EV manifests as rash (popular, vesicular, pust ular, erosive) that can be localized or generalized and predominantly occurs in the areas that have been affected by lesions of atopic dermatis or other eczematous skin condition. Historically it occurr ed at a rate of ~ 1 case per 25, 000 vaccinations. EV can occur in a vaccine recipient as well as in susceptible individuals in close contact. Two cases of EV from transmission have been recently reported; both in children of recently vaccinated US military personnel ( Lederman, 2009; Vora, 2008 ). In the military vaccination program in the US there were no reports of EV among 450,239 vaccinees, probably due to careful screening for contraindications ( Grabenstein, 2003 ). Review of civilian vaccinatio ns did not detect any cases of EV ( Velozzi, 2005 ). EV can be prevented by thorough screening of at -risk individuals and education on importance of avoiding contacts with such persons and proper hygiene. PVE historical case -fatality rate is 25%. The hist orical (1963 - 1968) reported frequency of PVE in United States was reported at 2.9 cases per 1,000,000 .PVE has higher prevalence and mortality rate in children compared to adults. Higher historical rates were reported in Europe compared to US. Variabili ty is attributed to differences in case definitions, clinical evaluations and differences in vaccine strains used by different countries ( Sejvar, 2005 ). Pathogenesis is still under investigation, although several compelling theories focus on autoimmune me chanism. Aside from vaccinia, measles and rabies vaccines have known association with PVE, as well as other viral and bacterial infections ( Benneto, 2004; Menge, 2007 ). Review of 2002 - 2004 vaccinations in US reported 3 cases of PVE for the rate of 5 per 1 000 000. Recent vaccination campaign s in the US revealed a higher than historically observed incidence of myopericarditis in vaccinees. Predominant symptoms were chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue, typically mild and transient. Among milit ary contingent, 88% of cases occurred in men with the incidence of 16.11 per 100,000 for primary vaccines and 2.07 per 100,000 in revaccinees ( Arness, 2004 ). In civilian population s, women accounted for 67% of cases and the majority of events (86%) were r eported in revaccinees ( Casey, 2005; Sniadack, 2008 ). Variability between the two sets of data may be explained by differences in demographics of vaccinees, case detection, ascertainment and reporting practices ( Morgan, 2008 ). Myo/pericarditis has been l ong associated with a number of viral infections, although there are very few reports of confirmed viremia. A few cases of myo/pericardites have been reported following DTP and influenza vaccinations ( de Meester, 2000; Boccara, 2001 ). It is currently assumed that injury to the heart post viral infection is more of an immune inflammatory than direct nature ( Cassimatis, 2004; Feldman, 2000 ). Review of data from 2002 - 2004 vaccinations in US reported ~ 1 case of autoinoculation per 6,500 vaccinations with 1 7% of ocular cases, none with corneal involvement ( Neff, 2008 ). Vacc inia keratitis is the most serious consequence of autoinoculation, since lesions on the cornea threaten eyesight. Diseased or injured conjunctiva and cornea may increase the risk of this complication. Vaccinia keratitis will respond to treatment with topical antiviral agents and BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 29 interferon, and can be prevented with use of occlusive bandages over scarification site and patient education ( Fulginiti, 2003 ). Transmission of vaccinia to close contacts is another known complication. Contact vaccinia may manifest as PV, EV or accidental infection of the eye, mouth, or genital areas. Review of several national and state surveys between 1962 and 1968 gives a frequency for EV at 8 - 27 per 1,000,000, and for accidental infections at 3 - 44 per 1,000,000 ( Neff, 2002 ). The rate of contact vaccinia in 2002 - 2004 was <10 cases per 100,000. Education of vaccinees in proper care for the vaccination site, proper hand hygiene, and avoidance of cont act with at -risk individuals seems to be a reasonable and effective prophylactic against accidental contact with vaccinia. Severe adverse reactions associated with the use of traditional smallpox vaccines have not been observed in prior clinical studies of PROSTVAC or related PSA (or other tumor antigen) - containing vaccinia virus vaccines administered to vaccinia pre -immune cancer patients. The use of attenu ated vaccinia virus, diligent screening for exclusion of patients with known risk factors and thorou gh education of potential patients and study personnel in proper hygiene and would care should reduce the risk of development of these reactions. Safety of Fowlpox Vaccination Fowlpox virus is a member of the genus Avipox, which is evolutionarily divergent from v accinia virus non -crossreactive Taylor, 1988; Beukema, 2006 ). Immune responses to vaccinia do not block infection and immunization with fowlpox -based vectors. Hence vaccinia - primed immune responses can be boosted with fowlpox ve ctors. In addition, fowlpox vectors do not replicate in human cells (only in avian cells), and are therefore much less of a safety risk than vaccinia -based vectors. Fowlpox vectors mediate a limited infection in human cells, with early viral and transgen e expression, but late gene expression is blocked, and no infectious particles are produced. Thus minimal viral surface antigen is made, and minimal neutralizing antibody immune responses are induced. This enables multiple boosting with the fowlpox -based vectors. Fowlpox virus has been investigated and used in vaccine design for at least two decades. As with vaccinia virus, it offers the advantages of a large genome but provides an additional safety assurance by not be ing able to replicate in mammalian cells. Fowlpox virus -based vaccines (HIV, malaria, cancer) have been tested in both animals and humans. No safety concerns have been raised and the adverse events associated with the use of fowlpox vector s have been limited to mild injection site reactions ( Beukema, 2006; Essagee, 2004; Webster Part A1 30 ii Communicability Vaccinia Vaccinia virus may be transmitted by direct contact with virus shed from the vaccination site or with contaminated dressings or oth er infectious material. Vaccinia is shed from the primary vaccination lesion of humans and guinea pigs from approximately the third day to the end of the third week after vaccination (Cooney, 1991; Friedman, 1962 ); shedding from other sites is rare , and i s generally associated with more virulent strains of smallpox vaccine or with complications after vaccination (Cummings, 2008; Frey, 2002; Kim, 2005; , including PROSTVAC -V, have d emonstrated viral shedding only at the Limited data available on viral shedding after vaccination of vaccinia -experienced (previously vacc inated) individuals , but shedding from revaccination sites seems to be shorter by about 1 week and possibly of lower titer than shedding from primary vaccination sites (Seaman, 2010 ). This finding is significant, as all study subjects are required to have had prior smallpox vaccination. Viral shedding is further reduced in individuals that are vaccinated by the subcutanteous route ( Roberts, 1932; Henderson, 1939; Cherry, 1977; Connor, 1977 ), which is the route that will be used for the administration of PRO STVAC -V. Bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site, further minimizing release into the environment. That airborne or droplet spread of vaccinia virus from the respiratory tract of healthy vaccinees occurs is doubtful (Lane, 2003; Neff, 2003; T albot, 2007 ). Although the virus can be found in the bloodstream and pharynx of patients with adverse events involving vigorous viral replication and/or abnormal host defenses, particularly eczema vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia (Lane, 2003 ), epidemiologic evidence for airborne spread is scant. Contact transmission of vaccinia -based smallpox vaccine is rare (Neff, 2002; CDC, 2004 ). No secondary transmission of recombinant poxviruses, including PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, has However, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are live viruses and, as such, retain the potential for transmission . Consequently, healthcare personnel who have direct contact with contaminated dressings or other infectious material from participants in clini cal studies are instructed to adhere to appropriate infection control measures . In addition, study exclusion criteria exclude subjects from participation if they have close or household contact with individuals at risk fordeveloping serious adverse reacti ons. Use of appropriate infection control measures, such as covering the vaccination site (including bandages) and washing hands after contact with the vaccination site, will prevent transmission. Fowlpox virus does not replicate in human cells. Conseque ntly, viral shedding in humans is limited and appears to be confined to the vaccination site. Fowlpox is not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans and is of minimal potential hazard ordinary conditions of use. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 31 They can be handled safely in the l aboratory without special apparatus or equipment, using techniques generally acceptable for nonpathogenic material. iii Infective dose The minimum infectious dose of vaccinia and fowlpox viruses is unknown ( Savona, 2006 ). Under the proposed release, each pati ent will receive one immunization with 2 x 108 infectious units (Inf. U.) of PROSTVAC -V Week 1, followed by six immunizations with 1 x 109 Inf. U. of PROSTVAC -F administered in Weeks 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. iv Host range and p ossibility of alteration Vaccini a can infect warm -blooded vertebrates such as mammals, rodents, and birds. The insertion of human genes into the genome of vaccinia to generate PROSTVAC -V does not alter this host range. Fowlpox virus replication in vivo is restricted to certain avian spe cies. Fowlpox virus replicates in chickens, turkeys, and pigeons, but not in quail, ducks, or canaries ( Tripathy, 1984; McMillen, 1994 ). The insertion of into the genome of fowlpox to generate PROSTVAC -F does not alter this host range. v Possibi lity of survival outside of human host Poxviruses cannot propagate without a permissive host organism. Poxviruses have the capacity to survive for considerable periods in dried material such as detached vaccination scabs. They are also are relatively stable when stored frozen or lyophilized under carefully controlled conditions. However stability decreases significantly as temperature is increased. Under normal environmental conditions, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are expe cted to lose viability within days or weeks. In addition, poxviruses are readily inactivated by a number of common disinfectants and cleaning agents. vi Presence of vectors or means of dissemination The primary means of dissemination of vaccinia is via dire ct contact with the infection site or with virus -contaminated materials. Contact transmission of vaccinia -based smallpox vaccine is rare (Neff, 2002; CDC, 2004 ). Airborne or droplet spread of vaccinia virus from the respiratory tract of healthy vaccinees has not been definitively demonstrated ( Lane, 2003; Neff, 2003; Talbot, 2007 ). Although the virus can be found in the bloodstream and pharynx of patients with adverse events involving vigorous viral replication and/or abnormal host defenses, particularly eczema vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia (Lane, 2003 ), epidemiologic evidence for airborne spread is scant. Fowlpox virus does not replicate in human cells. Consequently, viral shedding in humans is limited and appears to be confined to the vaccinatio n site. The probability of transmission to non -BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 32 target organisms is therefore very low. In permissive avian species, transmission of recombinant vaccines based on vaccine strains of avipox virus is rare ( McMillen, 1994; Paoletti, 1995 ). vii Biological stability The evaluation of genetic stability of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F at several stages of the production process is described in Item 11. In terms of stability in vivo , vaccinia virus causes a transient infection in susceptible hosts , with eliminati on of viral components over several weeks. Host cells infected with vaccinia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mi xed form of apoptosis/necrosis. In vivo stability of fowlpox virus in vivo is not relevant to this application, since fowlpox virus do es not replicate in mammalian cells. viii Antibiotic resistance patterns Not applicable ix Allerginicity PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have not been shown to be allergenic in any preclinical or clinical studies to date. However, based on the manufacturing procedures used to produce PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, pati ents with known allergy to eggs, egg products or aminoglycoside antibiotics (for example,gentamicin or tobramycin) are excluded from the study. In addition, patients should remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes following administration of the PROSTV AC for observation for signs of adverse reactions. x Availability of appropriate therapies For some very rare complications of vaccinia infection, early administration of vaccinia immune globulin ( VIG) is advised. Recognition of clinical symptoms compatible with eczema vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, and some cases of auto - inoculation should prompt consideration of VIG therapy. The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to be time -depen dent. VIG is of no benefit in the treatment of post -vaccinial encephalitis, and is contraindicated for the treatment of vaccinial keratitis. VIG is available in United States through CDC and in several other countries through appropriate health authoriti es. Despite the very low risk for complications that require VIG administration, BNIT is working on securing a necessary supply of VIG for the countries where it is not available internally. Although there is no recognized alternative to VIG in treating severe complications resulting from vaccinia vaccination, in vitro and animal model data in several poxvirus infections models demonstrate the activity of cidofovir at clinically relevant doses. Subjects who experience severe vaccinia complications may be treated with cidofovir. Treatment with cidofovir will be recommended primarily after clinical failure following treatment with vaccinia immune globulin. Cidofovir is generally available through hospital pharmacies.

The description of the proposed deliberate release, including the purpose or purpos es and foreseen products of the release. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are used in a prime -boost vaccination regimen to optimize immune responses against prostate cancer tumor cells. The proposed Phase 3 trial is a, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate PROSTVAC -V/F with and without adjuvant GM -CSF fo r the treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This trial will be conducted globally. Patients will be randomized with equal probability to one of three double -blind arms of 400 patients each: Arm V+G: GM -CSF Placebo Arm P : PROSTVAC -V/F Placebo + GM -CSF Placebo The trial interventions will consist of 1 subcutaneous (sc) immunization with PROSTVAC -V (2 x 108 Inf. U/dose) or pla cebo in Week 1, followed by six immunizations with PROSTVAC -F (1 x 109 Inf. U//dose) or placebo administered in Weeks 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Each immunization will be accompanied by administration of sc GM -CSF or placebo on the day of immunization and f or the subsequent three days (sc injection within 5 mm of the original PROSTVAC -V/F or placebo injection site). The Treatment phase of this trial is six months including an End -of-Treatment visit at Week 25. During the Treatment phase, patients will continue to be treated with vaccination therapy through PSA and/or radiological progression. The primary objective of this study is to ascertain whether the survival of patients randomized to receive PROSTVAC (with or without GM -CSF) is superior to that of patients randomized to receive the placebo control. Exploratory endpoints will also be inc luded and are outlined below: To model secondary radiological disease progression over the first year of study participation.

PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are frozen preparations of liv e recombinant vaccinia and fowlpox vaccines that are supplied in borosilicate (2R) glass vials sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminium -plastic closures. Each vial of PROSTVAC -V contains a single dose (2 x 108 infectious units (Inf. U.) per 0.50 mL) of P ROSTVAC -V in PBS/10% glycerol. Each vial of 22 September Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 38 PROSTVAC -F contains a (1 x 0.50mL) of PROSTVAC -F in no adjuvants or preservatives. PROSTVAC -V/F will be administered to study subjects by subcutaneous injection. The site of the PROSTVAC -V or placebo vaccination will be covered with a sterile, nonadherent dressing such as a Telfa bandage until the scab, if any, falls off naturally. For the PROSTVAC -F or placebo, the injection site will be covered with a plain adhesive bandage until a scab (if any) forms or for patient comfort. 39. The quantity of organisms to be released. A central storage and distribution depot for study vaccine and placeb o for 13 participating EU countries [Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom] and also including Israel, Russia and Switzerland will be located in Craigavon , Northern Ireland, United Kingdom at the following location: Company name ALMAC Clinical Services Address 9 Charlestown Road Seagoe Industrial Estate Craigavon BT63 5PW United Kingdom Study vaccine will be packaged as individual -use vials, with 6 vials to a carton. Cartons sent to the drug distribution depot will be bundled for shipping into 10 -carton packs. From the depot, individual sites or secondary depots (Russia, Israel) will be supplied over a period of approximately two years with enough IMP to service the enrolled patient population for the entire dosing period (~5 months per patient). It is anticipated that this will require multiple shipments. Sites will initially be suppli ed with one carton of PROSTVAC -V, one carton of PROSTVAC -V placebo, 2 cartons of PROSTVAC -F, and 2 cartons of PROSTVAC -F placebo. Sites will be resupplied when the IVRS resupply trigger of 6 remaining vials of PROSTVAC -F/placebo or 3 remaining vials of PR OSTVAC -V/placebo is met. The primary EU depot (ALMAC Clinical Services, Craigavon, Northern Ireland) will receive shipments of study vaccine estimated to contain a total of 1,800 vials of F placebo. should be noted that PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F placebo are the same construct: empty fowlpox vector. ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 39 40. The disturbance of the site, including the type and method of cultivation, mining, irrigation, or other ac tivities. Not applicable. Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 is not an agricultural study. 41. The worker protection measures taken during the release. All principal investigators and sub -investi gators participating in the study will be qualified by education, training an d experience to assume responsibility for the proper conduct of the trial according to the guidelines outlined in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 - Good Clinical Practices. Clinical sites where the study is to be conducted will be thoro ughly evaluated prior to the initiation of the study to ensure that the facilities are sufficient for storing and administering the vaccine, as well as having the appropriate facilities for the collection and storage of human specimens. Additionally, all clinical site personnel involved in the handling or administration of study vaccine will be trained according to the study protocol, and all supportive documentation, including study specific laboratory and clinical trial material manuals. A thorough stud y-specific training will occur prior to the initiation of the study via a formal local investigator meeting and/or on -site study initiation visit. The risk of transmission of recombinant viruses to exposed healthcare workers is very low. There have been no cases of transmission to healthcare personnel in any of the studies with PROSTVAC -V/F or PROSTVAC -V/F-related vaccinia -based vaccines. As reported for the handling of vaccinia strains found in smallpox vaccines, if appropriate infection -control precautio ns are observed, healthcare workers are probably at less risk of infection than laboratory workers because of the smaller volume of lower titer of virus in clinical specimens as compared with laboratory material ( Garner , 1983; Bolyard , 1998 ). However, because of the potential for transmission of vaccinia or recombinant vaccinia viruses, healthcare personnel who have direct contact with contaminated dressings or other infectious material from participants in clinical studies will receive det ailed instruction on proper prophylactic measures. BNIT does not recommend prophylactic smallpox vaccination for healthcare workers conducting the study, since vaccinations would put such workers at a real risk of post -vaccination complications. The most critical preventive measure is proper handling of the vaccine and thorough hand hygiene after any contact with vaccination site or bandage materials. In fact, there were no cases of contact transmission in health care setting or from civilian vaccinees t o their contacts reported during the US vaccination campaign (MMWR May 9, 20003/52(18);419 -420). Procedures for preparation of the vaccine are described in the clinical protocol. PROSTVAC -V classified as a group 2 biological agent according to the Europe an Economic Community (EEC) classification for the protection of workers with biological agents {Directive 2000/54/EC}. Loading of syringes may be performed using standard aseptic methods in a clinical pharmacy or clinical laboratory. These recommendation s are the same as those for administering smallpox vaccine BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 40 with bifurcated needles. BNIT recommends routine use of standard universal precautions when directly handling the vaccine, including the wearing of a lab coat, eye protection, and gloves. PROSTVAC -F is c lassified as BSL1 and because it cannot replicate in mammalian cells, no special precautions beyond standard, universal precautions for infectious materials are required. Thus, standard universal precautions as dictated by the WHO ( WHO , 2006 ) are a dequate in dealings with PROSTVAC -F and should be followed at any clinical trial site in accordance to ICH/GCP. In case of spills, poxviruses are readily inactivated by a number of detergents and can easily be contained. Material Safety Data sheets will be provided with each product and study staff will be provided with specific instructions to address spills, including information on containment, personal protective equipment, disinfection, and disposal procedures. 42. The post -release treatment of the site . All transport of PROSTVAC will be done according to EU guidelines for the transport of GMOs and IATA Transportation Regulations. PROSTVAC vaccine or placebo will be transported to the clinical study site as cartons of 6 individual, frozen vials . Study vaccine will be stored at - 70C or below in the original outer package and will be stored in a secure location with limited access. Following administration, used study vaccine materials will be placed immediately into sealed bags and retained for accounta bility. Upon reconciliation and accountability, used study materials will be destroyed by the clinical site following institutional procedures for the disposal of biohazardous material. All unused study vaccine will be returned to ALMAC Clinical Services central storage depot in the UK or disposed of at the clinical site upon authorization from BNIT. 43. The techniques foreseen for elimination or inactivation of the organisms at the end of the experiment. All vaccine materials, including vials, syringes, and other biomedical waste generated during the conduct of the study will be discarded into appropriate biohazard waste containers and disposed of at the study site according to site procedures. 44. Information on, and the results of, previous releases of the org anisms and in particular, releases on a different scale or into different ecosystems. Preclinical studies and clinical studies using PROSTVAC or related vaccines are listed in Item 31. PROSTVAC -V/F and related pox virus vaccines have been tested in mouse, rabbit and non - human primate models as well as in a number of in vitro experiments. Recombinant vaccinia and fowlpox vaccines elicited immune responses to antigens presented and showed substantial evidence of anti -tumor activity in murine models. No biologically significant changes or signs BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 41 of untoward toxicological effects were noted in either rodent or non -human primate safety studies. In clinical studies with PROSTVAC -V/F and relate d vaccines, adverse reactions were minimal. A local injection site reaction is typical, and comparable to those seen with other modern vaccines. Potential adverse reactions attributable to the administration of PROSTVAC -V/F at 50% frequency include injec tion site reactions (pain, swelling, induration, and redness), and at 10% frequency include headache, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea; the majority of events of Grade 1 and 2 in severity.

No developments or changes in land use in the region are anticipated. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 46 PART IV THE O RGANISMS AND THE ENV IRONMENT Characteristics Affecting Survival, etc 57. The biological features which affect survival, multiplication and dispersal. The potential for escape, dispersal, or establishment of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F in the environment is low. Poxviruses cannot reproduce in the absence of a susceptible host cell. Vaccinia virus replication is restricted to certain warm -blooded vertebrate hosts. Vaccinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, although buffalo poxvirus in India has been pr oposed to be a subspecies of vaccinia virus and Cantagalo virus in humans and cattle in Brazil is reported to be a vaccinia -like virus ( Damaso, 2000 ). Fowlpox virus is host -range restricted in vivo to certain avian species, and the fowlpox vaccine strain used for PROSTVAC -F is non -virulent. Unlike viruses such as retroviruses, poxviruses undergo a transient infection in a host organism. The poxvirus replication cycle occurs in the cytoplasm of infec ted cells. There is no interaction with the nucleus and no integration of viral genes into the host genome. Therefore, the risk of poxvirus persistence by integration into the host chromosome is very low, unlike other viruses, such as retroviruses, which integrate and establish permanent infections in the host. Latent infection of humans with vaccinia virus has not been observed ( Fenner, 1988 ). Pox viruses are not capable of forming spores or generating other specialist structures to enhance environmental survival. Pox viruses are relatively stable at sub -freezing temperatures but lose viability at higher temperatures. Additionally, poxviruses are readily inactivated by a number of detergents; thus, accidental spills can be contained and are not likely to result in spread of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F in the environment. The general environment is not likely to support propagation of these viruses, which require specific eukaryotic cells for replication, and the viruses decay at ambient temperatures (see It em 58, below). PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are comparable to their corresponding nonrecombinant parental viruses with respect to growth characteristics and stability in the environment. The added human transgenes have not fundamentally altered the inherent properties of the viruses. Therefore, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have not acquired any known phenotypic properties that would increase their risk to the environment beyond those associated with the use of the corresponding nonrecombinant parental viruses. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 47 58. The known or predicted e nvironmental conditions which may affect survival, multiplication and dissemination, including wind, water, soil, temperature, pH. PROSTVAC -V Vaccinia virus is relatively stable when stored at low temperatures. This contributed to the success of the smal lpox vaccination program in developed countries where refrigeration was readily accessible. However, vaccine potency rapidly declined after storage at ambient temperatures, resulting in a high rate of vaccination failures in developing countries in the ea rly twentieth century. Major efforts were required to develop a dried vaccine that would be stable at ambient temperatures ( Fenner, 1988 ). There are several published studies on the recovery of non -recombinant vaccinia virus under various laboratory con ditions designed to mimic environmental exposure. Virus survival was evaluated, for example on fabric and food (Sidwell, 1966; Pastoret, 1996; Essbauer, 2007 ); dried or in liquid (including saline, drinking water, sterile -filtered lake or river water, sto rmwater, stormwater supplemented with fetal calf serum soil) (Mahnel, 1977; Mahnel, 1987; Essbauer, 2007 ); under different conditions of relative humidity, temperature or pH (Mahl, 1975; Newman 2003 ); exposed to air or in airtight con tainers ( Mahnel, 1987 ). There are many differences among these published experiments, including different vaccinia strains, preparation techniques, different starting virus titers, and viral titration methods. However, there are clear data in all of thes e studies that show first, that vaccinia is a relatively stable virus under a variety of laboratory conditions, and second, that stability decreases significantly when the virus is exposed to ultraviolet light ( McDevitt, 2007 ) or as temperature and/or humi dity are increased. Specific stability studies have been performed on the non -recombinant vaccinia parental virus (TBC -Wy) and on PANVAC ). PANVAC recombinant vaccinia vir us PROSTVAC -V, expresses the three TRICOM costimulatory molecules; in -V at dried or in water at various temperatures was compared to that of the non -recombinant parental virus, TBC -Wy. These studies demonstrated that the recombinant virus is comparable to the corresponding non -recombinant parental virus. Both viruses lost viability over a period of weeks when stored in water at 25 C. The same viruses lose viability over a period of days when stored dried at 25 C. These results are consistent with published reports discussed above that demonstrate that poxviruses are stable at low temperatures but are less stable at higher tempera tures without special treatment such as lyophilization under controlled conditions. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 48 PROSTVAC -F There are few published studies on the persistence of avipox viruses in the environment. However, persistence in the environment, adverse sequellae, and other environmental issues have not been reported as a result of the use of licensed recombinant fowlpox and canarypox virus - based products, including veterinary vaccines against Newcastle Disease Virus, avian influenza virus, rabies, feline leukemia virus, can ine distemper, and West Nile virus. As part of the licensure procedure, the USDA announced Findings of No Significant Impact with respect to the likelihood of an adverse environmental event using these vaccines ( Payne, 1994 ; Payne, 1995 ; Payne, 1996 ; Fede ral Register, 1994, 1997 a, 1997b , 2003, 2004 ). Specific stability studies have been performed on the non -recombinant fowlpox parental virus (TBC -FPV) and on PANVAC ). recombinant -F, expresses the three TRICOM costimulatory molecules; in 2006; Madan, 2007 ). Stability of PANVAC -F at dried or in water at various temperatures was compared to that of the non -recombinant parental virus, TBC - FPV. These studies demonstrated that the recombinant virus is comparable to the corresponding non-recombinant parental virus. Both viruses lost viability over a period of weeks when stored in water at 25 C. The same viruses lose viability over a period of days when stored dried at 25C. These results indicate that PROSTVAC -F is stable at low temperatures but are less stable at higher temperatures without special treatment such as lyophilization under controlled conditions. 59. The sensitivity to specific agents. Vaccinia and fowlpox viruses are rapidly inactivated by a number of disinfectants ( Erterpi, 2009 ). For example, one study showed that fowlpox virus and vaccinia virus are both inactivated within 1 minute by the following disinfectants: 70% ethanol, ether. ( PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are inactivated by exposure to ultraviolet light ( Sagriponti, 2011 ) and by exposure increasing temperatures. For example, when sto red at 25C, viruses lose viability over a period of weeks when stored in water, and over a period of days when stored dried. For PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, BNIT has qualified and approved the disinfectants Klercide CR -Biocide A and Perform Sterile Concentrated Oxy for product changeover and for surface disinfection, respectively. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 49 Interactions with the Environment 60. The predicted habitat of the organism. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are genetically engineered viruses and thus do not exist in nature. The habitat of the parental viruses has been previously discussed ( see Item 9 ). Vaccinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, although buffalo pox virus has been proposed to be a subspecies of vaccinia virus, and several strains of vaccinia virus have been isolated throughout Brazil. Avipoxviruses (APV) are distributed worldwide. The virus species fowlpox virus infects and causes disease in poultry. The parental fowlpox used for the generation of PROSTVAC -F is a non-virulent , vaccine strain . 61. The studies of the behaviour and characteristics of the organisms and their ecological impact carried out in simulated natural environments, such as microcosms, growth rooms and greenhouses. No studies have been conducted on t he ecological impact of PROSTVAC on simulated natural environments. 62. The capability of post -release transfer of genetic material - a. from the genetically modified organisms into or ganisms in affected ecosystems There is minimal potential for gene transfer to other species under the proposed release of the GMO. PROSTVAC -V and PRO STVAC -F cannot infect microbes, insects, cold -blooded vertebrates, or plant cells. The GMO will be released in a hospital examination ro om and is unlikely to come in contact with other animal species. Furthermore , no dissemination of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F outside the injection site has been shown in human s injected by the subcutaneous route . Recombination between the DNA genome of PR OSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F with other DNA genomes, such as the human genome or other viral genomes in the infected host cell, is improbable for the following reasons. The poxvirus life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm (Moss , 1996); poxviruses do not inte grate into the genome of the infected cell. Therefore, the risk of poxvirus persistence by integration into the host chromosome is very low. In non-avian species susceptible to infection by PROSTVAC -F, few opportunities for genetic recombination with ani mal poxviruses could occur, since the level of replication that the vector DNA undergoes in vivo is low, and limited to cells infected by the inoculum (no generation of infectious particles). Recombination with other viral genomes is unlikely due to the la ck of homology between different families of viruses. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 50 The human genes expressed in PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F share homology with their counterparts in the human genome; however the physical segregation between host and viral genomes renders recombination b etween PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and the human event. Recombination between PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and a wild -type vaccinia or fowlpox virus in an infected host org anism is theoretically possible. Recombination between modified poxvir us and other poxviruses is dependent on DNA replication, co -localization of replication and DNA homology between the two viruses. The likelihood of recombination between PROSTVAC -V and wild type vaccinia in vivo is extremely low because vaccinia is not normally found in nature. Recombination between PROSTVAC -F and a wild or vaccine strain of fowlpox would require release of PROSTVAC -F into an environment containing poultry. Such release is highly unlikely under the proposed conditions of release. b. from indigenous organisms to the genetically modified organisms. Recombination between the DNA genome of indigenous organisms to the genetically modified organisms is unlikely for reasons described in 61a, above. The poxvirus life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm ( Moss, 1996 ); consequently, the physical segregation between host and viral genomes renders recombination with PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F improbable. 63. The likelihood of post -release selection leading to the expression of unexpected or undesirable t raits in the genetically modified organisms. There is no evidence that selection leading to the expression of unexpected or undesirable traits in PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F would occur under the conditions of release. 64. The measures employed to ensure and to v erify genetic stability, the description of genetic traits which may prevent or minimise dispersal of genetic material and methods to verify genetic stability. Genetic stability of PROSTVAC -V/F following administration under the conditions of this release will not be monitored. As stated above the DNA dose not incorporate into host cell genome and is cleared along with infected host cells shortly after administration. The GMO is limited in its ability to disperse in the environment. Under normal environme ntal conditions pox viruses lose viability within days or weeks. 65. The routes of biological dispersal, known or potential modes of interaction with the disseminating agent, including inhalation, ingestion, surface contact, burrowing. Following administrati on of PROSTVAC, the route of subsequent biological dispersal to the environment or to non -target organisms could occur through direct contact with the vaccination site or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 51 Vaccinia viral shedding is tr ansient and occurs primarily at the vaccination site; it has not been demonstrated to occur at other sites , including nose, throat, urine, and Kim,2005; Klote, viral reduc ed after subcutaneous vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viru s, which is the intended route of administration of PROSTVAC -V (Roberts, 1932; Henderson, 1939; Cherry, 1977; Connor, 1977 ); furthermore, bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site ( Talbot, 2006 ). Recombinant avipoxviral shedding has not been detected in blood, saliva, urine, or rectal swabs after vaccination (Bleijs, 2005 ). Viral DNA has been detected at the injection site, but the presence of live virus was not assessed. Therefore , avipox viral shedding in humans, if it occurs, appears to be confined to the vaccination site. 66. The description of ecosystems to which the organisms could be disseminated. The dissemination and impact of PROSTVAC -V/F on ecosystems is limited because disse mination requires close contact with the vaccination site or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The study will be conducted at standard healthcare facilities. It is not anticipated that the study vaccine or any waste associated with study procedures will affect the surrounding ecosystem. Potential Environmental I mpact 67. The potential for excessive population increase of the organisms in the environment. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are labile viruses that cannot replicate outside permissiv e cells. Therefore, they cannot increase in number without contact with permissive cells or host. 68. The competitive advantage of the organisms in relation to the unmodified recipient or parental organisms. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have not been shown to di splay a competitive advantage over their unmodified parental viruses with respect to replication in vitro . 69. The identification and description of the target organisms. PROSTVAC -V/F will be administered to men aged 18 - 85 years old with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic CRPC. Patients will have progressive disease following androgen suppression or blockade therapy and withdrawal, or surgical castration, and will be chemotherapy na\u00efve for metastatic prostate cancer. Patients must be vaccinia -experienced (previous smallpox vaccination). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 52 70. The anticipated mechanism and result of interaction between the released organisms and the target organisms. PROSTVAC -V/F is a viral vector -based product that is administered in seven subcutaneous vaccinations, over a five month period. It is intended to generate immune responses to prostate - specific antigen and prostate cancer cells. It uses poxviral vectors to introduce modified PSA to the patient in an inflammatory and immunogenic manner to brea k self -tolerance, which generates immune responses directed against prostate cancer cells. The vaccine appears to induce a chronic active immunomodulatory action, and to slow overall disease progression. 71. The identification and description of non -target organisms which may be affected. The potential for PROSTVAC -V/F interaction with other organisms in the environment would be limited to viral shedding and secondary transmission via direct contact with the vaccination site or indirect contact with contamin ated surfaces or objects. The most likely non -target organisms would include health care workers or contacts of vaccinees. In addition, environmental release could theoretically affect animals susceptible to pox virus infection, including certain warm bl ooded vertebrates such as mammals, rodents, or and birds. Neither PROSTVAC -V nor PROSTVAC -F is known to infect cold -blooded vertebrates such as fish, amphibians, and reptiles ( Essbauer, 2001 ); thus, there is no known risk.to aquatic animals from any poten tial environmental release. Additionally, neither virus infects microbes or plants. The extent of exposure to non -target species is expected to be limited by the fact that vaccine administration occurs in a clinical site under controlled conditions. The administration of PROSTVAC -V/F via the subcutaneous route, the use of bandaging, which contains virus at the vaccination site, and comprehensive education of healthcare providers and patients all serve to minimize exposure to non -target species. Although the potential theoretically exists for secondary transmission of the virus to non -target organisms, multiple studies indicate that transmission to non -target organisms, either human -to-animal or human -to-animal, is rare except perhaps in the case of transm ission of vaccinia by vaccinated or infected animal handlers to cattle. To date there has never been a published report of transmission of vaccinia virus from vaccine recipients to health -care personnel ( CDC, 2001 ). Furthermore, hundreds of individuals ha ve been vaccinated with PROSTVAC -V/F or with related recombinant poxvirus vaccines, and no evidence of contact transmission has been noted in any clinical trial to date. 72. The likelihood of post -release shifts in biological interactions or in the host range . Vaccinia can infect warm -blooded vertebrates such as mammals, rodents, and birds. Fowlpox virus infects certain avian species including chickens, turkeys, and pigeons. The host range of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F is identical to that of their parental v iruses. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 53 There is no reason to believe that the host range of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F would be altered under the conditions of this release. A s indicated above, the likelihood of release into the general environment is remote. The intrinsic mutation rate of poxviruses has not been precisely determined but is probably similar to that of other systems with proofreading DNA polymerases (Knipe, 2007 ). Shifts in biological interactions or in the host range would require rapid genetic changes in the GMO; as th is is not expected to occur, the likelihood of post -release shifts in biological interactions or host range is negligible. 73. The known or predicted effects on non -target organisms in the environment and the impact on population levels of competitors, prey, h osts, symbionts, predators, parasites and pathogens. The extent of exposure to non -target organisms is expected to be limited by the fact that vaccine administration occurs in a clinical site under controlled conditions. The administration of PROSTVAC -V/F via the subcutaneous route, the use of bandaging, which contains virus at the vaccination site, and comprehensive education of healthcare providers and patients all serve to minimize exposure to non -target species. Although the potential exists for secon dary transmission of vaccinia virus to non -target organisms, multiple studies indicate that transmission to non -target organisms, either human -to-animal or animal -to-animal, is unlikely except perhaps in the case of transmission of vaccinated or infected a nimal handlers to cattle. 74. The known or predicted involvement in biogeochemical processes. Not applicable. Neither vaccinia nor fowlpox virus have been shown, and are not anticipated to, have any involvement in biogeochemical processes. 75. Any other potential ly significant interactions with the environment. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are live viruses that require a host cell to replicate. They can only remain viable following infection and proliferation in an appropriate host organism. Other than potential ho st organisms, no environmental niches or h abitats would be affected, either directly or indirectly, by exposure to PROSTVAC -V/F. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 54 PART V MONITORING, CONTROL, WASTE TREATMENT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE P LANS Monitoring Techniques 76. Methods for tracing the organis ms and for monitoring their effects. Overall Study Monitoring and Record Retention The study will be monitored by BNIT or its designee on a regular basis throughout the study period in accordance with general monitoring principles set forth in ICH E5. All study documents (subject files, signed informed consent forms, copies of case report forms, Study File Notebook, study vaccine accountability records, etc) must be kept secured until disposal is authorized by the Sponsor, which will be no sooner than two years after approval of the study drug for marketing in an ICH region (United States, Japan, Europe), and until there are no more pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinu ation of the clinical development program for the study drug. These documents may need to be retained for longer periods in some countries due to local regulatory requirements. Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint for the study is overall survival. Exp ected median survival is approximately 2 years. Approximately 10 -20% of patients would be expected to be surviving at 4 years post study. All patients will be followed for vital status until study closure or death . Twelve hundred (1200) patients are planned to be enrolled in a 3 arm study. There are 2 comparisons, PROSTVAC -V/F plus GM -CSF versus control, and PROSTVAC -V/F alone versus control. The final analysis will be triggered when 534 events (deaths) occur per comparison. The trial is powered to determine a 20% reduction in the risk of death (critical HR 0.82) with criteria for success of P=0.025. Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints include the following: Efficacy : To ascertain whether a greater proportion of patients randomized to one or both PROSTVAC -V/F arms remain event -free at six months as compared to the patients randomized to placebo Safety : To further characterize the safety and tolerability of PROSTVAC immunotherapy, characterize type and number of AEs compared to placebo Exploratory BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 55 o To model secondary radiological disease progression over the first year of study participation. To ascertain whether a greater proportion of patients randomized to either Arm V+G or Arm V remain event -free (radiological progression) six months p ost End -of-Treatment visit (using scans at End -of-Treatment visit as a new baseline), as compared to the patients randomized to Arm P. This analysis will include all patients, and separately the HLA -A2-expressing subgroup. o To assess the role of post -progr ession anti -cancer therapies as an alternative explanation for observed survival differences. o To ascertain whether the survival of HLA -A2-expressing patients randomized to Arm V+G, or Arm V is superior to that from HLA -A2-expressing -patients randomized to Arm P. o To ascertain whether a greater proportion of HLA -A2 expressing patients randomized to Arm V+G or to Arm V remain event -free at six months as compared to the HLA -A2 expressing patients randomized to Arm P. o To compare arms with respect to immune res ponse to immunizing antigen (PSA), as well as to non -vaccine containing prostate antigens, and tumor -associated antigens, and assess whether immune responses are prognostic and/or predictive. o To evaluate for baseline biomarkers which are prognostic and/or predictive of long term survival outcome. o To compare arms with respect to vaccine effects on circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels (US sites only). Safety Assessment and Monitoring Patients will be followed during the Treatment phase of the study for any sig ns or symptoms of treatment -emergent toxicity by means of a focused physical exam, hematology, serum chemistry panels, EKG, and recording of AEs and concomitant medications. All SAEs will be immediately reviewed by the Sponsor and CRO medical monitors. In addition, this study will employ a Data Monitoring Committee. Immune Response Assessment and Monitoring Serum samples will be assayed for antibody development to the vector s and the insert (PSA) . In addition, serum will be assayed for development of ant ibodies to other prostate cell antigens, as well as other tumor -associated antigens . Serum will also be profiled for changes in cytokine and chemokine expression, changes in circulating tumor markers, and circulating nucleic acid tumor markers. Paxgene t ubes will yield total whole blood RNA and DNA for analysis of select gene expression by quantitative PCR, as well as enable analysis of gene arrays to detect changes in overall patterns of gene expression. Serum samples are very sensitive for detecting ap propriate BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 56 vaccine induced anti -viral titers. Antibody responses to PSA are difficult to detect, as PSA is a self antigen, and high circulating levels of PSA in the blood of prostate cancer patients may bind and clear any induced antibody. Selected sites will collect research samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for immune function assays. PBMCs will be assessed for PSA antigen -specific responses by ELIS POT, flow cytometric, and T -cell culture assays. Determinant spread to other prostate antigens and tumor -associated antigens will also be assessed. All evaluations will be performed at laboratories using standard procedures for these assays. Only US sites within a narrow geographic range of a processing laboratory will participate in thi s portion of the protocol. Cellular assays are difficult to standardize, and because of strong self tolerance anti -PSA responses are rare (1/100,000 T cells range). However, anti -tumor associated antigen responses are frequently induced post PROSTVAC imm unization, and are monitored. Viral Shedding Assessment and Monitoring The shedding of poxviruses (including PROSTVAC -V/F) in patients has been evaluated ( Arlen 2007; Hepburn 2004 ). These studies have demonstrated that vaccinia viral shedding occurs trans iently at the site of vaccination. Bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site. Viral shedding does not occur at other sites, including urine, throat and blood, during the normal course of vaccination with smallpox vaccine. Viral shedding in ur ine and throat is rare and is associated with complications after vaccination or with smallpox vaccine strains that are more pathogenic than the New York City Board of Health strain used to derive PROSTVAC -V. Moreover, subcutaneous vaccination, the intend ed route of administration for PROSTVAC -V, reduces the frequency of viral shedding. Recombinant vaccinia virus was detected at the site of vaccination, up to 14 days post treatment. It was not detected in urine or saliva after vaccination with doses up to and including the dose intended for clinical use of PROSTVAC -V (Arlen 2007 ). Similarly, shedding of avipox viruses after vaccination of non -avian species is confined to the vaccination site and is additionally limited due to lack of viral replication. No secondary transmission of recombinant poxviruses, including PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, has been reported in humans. Consequently, no specific viral detection/monitoring relative to PROSTVAC - V/F is scheduled in the present proposal. 77. Specificity (to ident ify the organisms and to distinguish them from the donor, recipient or the parental organisms), sensitivity and reliability of the monitoring techniques. No specific viral detection/monitoring relative to PROSTVAC -V/F is scheduled in the present proposal. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 57 78. Techniques for detecting transfer of the donated genetic material to other organisms. As noted previously, there is minimal risk of gene exchange between the GMO and other organisms. Therefore, no monitoring of other organisms is planned. 79. Duration and fre quency of the monitoring. No specific viral detection/monitoring relative to PROSTVAC -V/F is planned. Control of the Release 80. Methods and procedures to avoid and/or minimise the spread of the organisms beyond the site of release or the designated area for use. Procedures are in place to avoid and/or minimize the spread of the GMO by controlled containment during transport and at the clinical sites and by minimizing the potential of secondary transmission to vulnerable populations through exclusion criteria defined in the study protocol. All principal investigators and sub -investigators participating in the study will be qualified by education, training and experience to assume responsibility for the proper conduct of the trial according to the guidelines out lined in International Conference on harmonization (ICH) E6 - Good Clinical Practices. Clinical sites where the study is to be conducted will be thoroughly evaluated prior to the initiation of the study to ensure that the facilities are sufficient for stor ing and administering the vaccine, as well as having the appropriate facilities for the collection, processing and storage of human specimens. All clinical site personnel involved in the handling or administration of study vaccine will be trained accordin g to the study protocol, and all supportive documentation, including study specific laboratory and clinical trial material manuals. A thorough study -specific training will occur prior to the initiation of the study via a formal local investigator meeting and/or on -site study initiation visit. Clinical site staff responsible for administering PROSTVAC -V/F, collecti ng clinical samples , or conducting clinical evaluation of study subjects will be instructed to follow the World Health Organization (WHO) univer sal precautions for the prevention of transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings ( WHO Standard Precautions , 2006 ). Strict accountability of all doses of PROSTVAC -V/F imported into the UK will be maintained at all times. PROSTVAC -V/F study vaccine s and placebo will be shipped from Germany directly to ALMAC Clinical Services, Craigavon, Northern Ireland f rom which distribution to clinical sites will occur. Upon receipt at the clinical site, the shipment will be promptly inspected and processed immediately. Study vaccine will be stored at -70C or below in the original outer package in a secure location with limited access. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 58 All unused study vaccine will be returned to ALMAC Clinical Services, Craigavon, Northern Ireland, for destruct ion or disposed of at the clinical site upon authorization of BNIT according to the sites standard destruction policies for infectious medical waste, or sent to a licensed infectious medical waste destruction facility according to site SOPs . Accurate stu dy vaccine accountability records will be maintained by site personnel. Following administration, used study vaccine vials will be placed immediately into locked containers or sealed bags and according to site SOPs, either retained for accountability or sent for immediate destruction . All sample collections will be performed by study site personnel who have been trained appropriately. The other possible route of release of PROSTVAC is via viral shedding during the clinical trials. Vaccinia viral shedding is transient and occurs primarily at the vaccination site; it has not been demonstrated to occur at other sites , including nose, throat, urine, and feces. The frequency of viral shedding is reduced after subcutaneous vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus, which is the intended route of administration of PROSTVAC -V; furthermore, bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site. Recombinant avipoxviral shedding has not been detected in blood, saliva, urine, or rectal swabs after vaccination. Vir al DNA has been detected at the injection site, but the presence of live virus was not assessed. Therefore, avipox viral shedding in humans, if it occurs, appears to be confined to the vaccination site. No secondary transmission of recombinant poxviruses, including PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, to contacts has been reported in humans. The study exclusion criteria outlined in the protocol exclude subjects from participation if they have the potential to come into contact with individuals considered to be at r isk for secondary transmission of PROSTVAC -V/F should a subject shed vaccine virus. These exclusion criteria provide a guideline for the extent of contact that should be avoided to minimize the risk of transmission to these populations. The exclusion cri teria, together with education of vaccinees in proper care for the vaccination site, proper hand hygiene , and avoidance of contact with at -risk individuals , offer reasonable and effective prophylactic against accidental contact with vaccinia. 81. Methods and p rocedures to protect the site from intrusion by unauthorised individuals. Study vaccine and subject data will be stored in a secure location with limited access to clinical study staff. Study sites will otherwise follow standard daily operating procedures for security measures. Clinical study sites will follow applicable local and national regulations regarding the maintenance of confidential patient information during the conduct of a clinical trial. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 59 82. Methods and procedures to prevent other organisms fro m entering the site. All staff working in the facility will use personal protective equipment (laboratory coat, apron, safety glasses, and disposable gloves) as appropriate and will follow local documented procedures for Infection Control, which should min imise the risk of other organisms entering the facility. Waste Treatment 83. Type of waste generated. Each dose of PROSTVAC is supplied in borosilicate (2R) glass vials, which are sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminium -plastic closures. In addition to vials, other waste generated includes syringes and needles used for vaccine administration and for collection of blood samples, dressings, and other standard supplies required for physical and medical examination of subjects. 84. Expected amou nt of waste. Based on the current protocol, approximately 25 - 30 subjects will be recruited in England in up to 10 sites over an estimated one -year recruiting period. Each site will receive one 6 -vial carton of PROSTVAC -V, one carton of PROSTVAC -V placeb o vector), two 6 -vial of PROSTVAC -F, and two cartons of PROSTVAC -F placebo (empty fowlpox vector) as initial supply. Each subject will receive a maximum of one dose of PROSTVAC -V (2 x 108 Inf. U.) or placebo, and six doses of PROSTV AC-F (1 x 109 Inf. U.) or placebo. A small overage (12 vials of each of the four component vaccine products will be held for emergency resupply. Therefore, allowing for the packaging configuration and for some waste or resupply, up to 72 vials of PROSTVA C-V and 132 vials of PROSTVAC -F, and 204 vials of empty fowlpox vector could be generated as waste. Patients will be provided with injection site care kits containing instruction sheets, disposable gloves, absorbent toweling, alcohol swabs, nonadherent, Telfa -type bandages, band -aids and zip-lock biohazard bags for disposal of used bandages and gloves. Patients will be instructed to return the zip -lock biohazard bag containing all used supplies at their next clinic visit. The Investigator or his/her des ignee must maintain accurate records of dates, quantities and the lot numbers of all study drug received, to whom dispensed (patient -by-patient accounting), and accounts of any product accidentally wasted or intentionally destroyed. The Investigator or designee must retain all used, unused, partially used, wasted, or expired study drug until the study monitor has confirmed accountability unless the institution has a policy of immediate disposal/destruction for used experimental products. At the conclusion of the Treatment phase of the study, all unused vaccine, GM -CSF, and placebo supplies (collectively, study medication) will be either destroyed on site or by a licensed facility BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 60 contracted by the site, or returned to the Sponsor or designee following final reconciliation. At the conclusion of the Treatment phase of the study, an overall summary of all study drug received, unused, partially used, wasted, and returned will be prepared. For any investigational product that is not destroyed at the clinical sit e upon authorization from BNIT according to the sites standard destruction policies for infectious medical waste, or sent to a licensed infectious medical waste destruction facility according to site SOPs, it will be returned to Almac, the distributor for all the countries listed in Section 39. The total product to be stored at Almac for distribution to the UK and 15 other countries participating in this global trial is listed in Section 39 (page 41, last paragraph). 85. Possible risks. All clinical study sites are licensed healthcare facilities and have standard facility controls in place for administration of vaccines, collection and processing of clinical specimens, and clinical evaluation of study subjects. Clinical site staff will be instructed to fol low the World Health Organization (WHO) universal precautions for the prevention of transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings ( WHO Standard Precautions, 2006 ). No risk related to PROSTVAC -related waste is anticipated. Clinical study sites will be instructed to follow normal site procedures for disposal of infectious biomedical waste. Patients will be provided with zip-lock biohazard bags for disposal of used bandages and gloves and will be instructed to return the zip -lock biohazard bag co ntaining all used supplies at their next clinic visit. 86. Description of treatment envisaged. Clinical study sites will be instructed to follow normal site procedures for disposal of infectious biomedical waste. Emergency Response Plans 87. Methods and procedures for controlling the organisms in case of unexpected spread. In the event that the contents of the vaccine vial are accidentally released and come in contact with shipping materials, exposed skin, clothing or laboratory surfaces, standard safety precaution s should be used. Vaccinia and fowlpox are enveloped viruses and are susceptible to detergents and clorox -based disinfectants. Contaminated materials should be placed in biohazard safety bags and disposed of as biohazard waste. Surfaces in contact with v accinia should be thoroughly cleaned with an appropriate disinfectant and cleaning materials should be disposed of as biohazard. Sites of skin contact should be cleaned with standard detergents appropriate for hand washing. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 61 Accidental release could also po tentially occur by direct contact. The Centers for Disease Control noted in a 10 -state survey of smallpox vaccinations that the risk of transmission to contacts was 27 infections per million vaccinations, and 44% of these occurred in children <5 years old . Therefore, the precautions of injection site care, including covering the site with a dressing, covering it with a layer of clothes (e.g., long pants or sleeves), subcutaneous injection (rather than dermal scarification), and careful hand washing, are c ritical. The vaccine should not be given to subjects who are primary care -givers for children 3 years old. Accidental transmission of vaccinia virus to a clinic staff member or a member of the patients family or friends will be reported on a modified SAE form and the event will be followed by the Principal Investigator until resolved. All such events will be summarized in the annual safety update to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Any accidental or suspected secondary transmission will be rep orted immediately to the Sponsors Medical Monitor and to the CRO or designee. All such events will be summarized for the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and forwarded prior to the next scheduled meeting. PROSTVAC -F does not replicate in human cells; therefore the risk of horizontal transmission is extremely low. Th is risk will be further mitigated through the use standard biosafety precautions such as those that are used when handling human blood or tissue samples. In addition, it should be noted th at in extensive clinical experience with related viral vaccines, horizontal transmission has not been reported. 88. Methods, such as eradication of the organisms, for decontamination of the areas affected. In case of accidental release, the source of the spil l or leak should be contained. Absorbent material should be used to absorb liquid from contaminated surface. Absorbent materials must be disposed of in biohazard bags. The contaminated surface should be cleaned with detergent - based cleaners or 10% Clorox . Cleaning materials must be disposed of in biohazard bags. Individuals involved in clean up should wear protective clothing including gloves, eye protection and laboratory coat. 89. Methods for disposal or sanitation of plants, animals, soils and any other th ing exposed during or after the spread. Administration of PROSTVAC -V/F will occur only within contained clinical sites. It is therefore not anticipated that PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F will come into direct contact with any plants, animals or soils. Additio nally, neither PROSTVAC -V nor PROSTVAC -F is capable of infecting microbes or plants. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 62 90. Methods for the isolation of the areas affected by the spread. PROSTVAC -V/F vaccines will be supplied in individual dose vials. Each vial of PROSTVAC - V contains a single dose (2 x 108 infectious units (Inf. U.) per 0.50 mL) of PROSTVAC -V in PBS/10% glycerol. Each vial of PROSTVAC -F contains a single dose (1 x 109 infectious units (Inf. U.) per 0.50 mL) of PROSTVAC -F in PBS/10% glycerol. The amount of vaccine stored at each clinical study site and resultant waste will be quite low. Additionally, any unexpected release or spills can be decontaminated quickly using detergent -based cleaners or 10% Clorox . It is therefore not anticipated that isolation procedures will be req uired. 91. Plans for protecting human health and the environment in case of the occurrence of an undesirable effect. As described, extensive procedural controls are in place for the transport, storage, administration, disposal, and monitoring of PROSTVAC -V/F t reatment for the duration of the clinical study. Should any unexpected undesirable effect occur, BNIT will follow standard procedures of assessment of the effect and decisions regarding study continuance. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 22 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A1 63 PART VI INFORMATION ON METHODOLOGY Information on the viral titration assays, PCR analysis, FACS analysis, and Western blot analysis are provided in Items 8 of this application. Information on the methods used for construction of the transfer plasmids used to generate PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are inclu ded in Item 20 of this application. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 1 PART A2: DATA OR RESULTS FROM ANY PREVIOUS RELEASES OF THE GMO Overview PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have been evaluated in eight clinical trials in the United States under two separate INDs. These agents have been administered to over 300 men up to a maximum dose of 2 x 108 plaque -forming units (pfu) of PROSTVAC -V and 1 of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F was initiated by the former BB -IND 10428 (now BB -MF 10428). Therion conducted a trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in ten patients, and a randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy (as defined by progression -free survival) of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in 122 men (125 enrolled, 122 received drug) with castration -resistant metastat ic prostate cancer (mCRPC). The NCI initiated its own ongoing investigations of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, alone and in combination with other therapies, in 2003, under NCI BB -IND 10915. These clinical trials cover a range of study designs evaluating PRO STVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in early and late - stage disease and in combination with other therapies. To date, the NCI has conducted two Phase 1 studies, one Phase 1/2 study and three Phase 2 studies in the United States; no dose - limiting adverse effects have b een noted in any of these trials. Therion completed the randomized Phase 2 study through approximately one year of follow -up. However, in 2006, Therion went out of business. In early 2007, the NCI, which had collaborated with Therion to develop PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F for the treatment of prostate cancer, acquired all rights to the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F technology and to the regulatory files previously owned by Therion. In 2008, BNIT acquired the Therion regulatory files and rights to the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F technology from the NCI in a license agreement, and a collaborative research and development agreement (CRADA). BNIT conducted and completed the final overall survival analysis for the Phase 2 trial. Summaries of Individual Clinical St udies with the GMO Conducted by Therion and BNIT Therion's BB -IND the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F construct. This IND was initiated in 2002 with a Phase 1 safety trial in 10 patients. A placebo -controlled, randomized Phase 2 trial in 122 patients was begun in 2003. These studies are summarized in Table A2 -5 and described below. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September Former BB -IND 10428 Proto col No. Study Type and Regulatory File Study Title Study Design N Study Duration and Status P1-4 Pilot Efficacy and Safety A Phase I Trial of Pox PSA Vaccines (PROSTVAC) with B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA - 3 Co -stimulatory Molecules (TRICOM) in Patients with Prostate Cancer Open -label, single arm 1 PROSTVAC - V prime 1 PROSTVAC -F boost 10 active 57 days ------ Complete TBC - PRO -002 Efficacy and Safety A Phase II randomized, double blind, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROSTVAC\u00ae-VF/TRICOM in combination with GM - CSF in patients with androgen -independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate Double blind, randomized 2:1 active: placebo 1 PROSTVAC - V prime 6 PROSTVAC -F boosts 122 (82 active, 40 placebo) 168 days, with additional long t erm follow up ------ Complete Protocol P1 -4: A Phase I Trial of Pox PSA Vaccines (PROSTVAC) with B7.1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 Co -stimulatory Molecules (TRICOM) in Patients with Prostate Cancer Study Description Therion study P1 -4 was a Phase 1, multi -center, open -label, single -arm study to evaluate the safety of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in the treatment of patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DiPaola, 2006). The study population included male patients 18 years of age who had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with elevated PSA levels. Study patients had either AIPC with rising PSA, or had androgen -independent metastatic prostate cancer and were not candidates for chemotherapy at the time of enrollment into the trial. Study patients must also have received prior vaccinia (smallpox) immunization with no serious allergic reactions, and have a life expectancy of at least six months. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F when administered to patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The secondary objectives of this study were: 1) to assess immune response to a single prime and boost administration of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, and 2) to detect changes in serum PSA levels and rate of change following vaccination. Eligible patients, after undergoing evaluations consisting of laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, 24 -hour creatinine clearance, PSA levels, serum testosterone), physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG), received two subcutaneous BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 3 injections in the upper arm at Day 1 and Day 29 \u00b1 2 days. Day 1 treatment consisted of one dose of 2 x 108 pfu of PROSTVAC -V and Day 29 (\u00b1 2) treatment consisted of on e dose of 1 x 109 pfu of PROSTVAC -F. Safety parameters evaluated during the course of this study included medical history, vital signs, physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, ECG readings, laboratory tests (hema tology, chemistry, urinalysis, 24 -hour creatinine clearance), and concomitant medications. Safety was assessed by examining these parameters and tabulating adverse events occurring between baseline and Day 57 (\u00b1 2). Changes in ECOG performance status and ECG readings collected at screening and Day 57 (\u00b1 2) were evaluated, in addition to abnormalities in laboratory assessments and changes in vital signs and physical examinations collected at baseline, Day 15 (\u00b1 2), Day 29 (\u00b12), and Day 57 (\u00b12). Changes in laboratory test results not assessed as being clinically significant were not reported as adverse events. Safety information in this protocol was defined, analyzed and reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) dictionary, Version 2. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as 1) any CTC grade 4 event, 2) any event considered a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), and 3) any death; any life -threatening event i.e., an event that places the subject, in view of the Principal Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death); any event that requires or prolongs in -subject hospitalization; any event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; any congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a subject who participated in this study and received investigational drug; other medically important events that in the opinion of the Principa l Investigator may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Since worsening of prostate cancer was to be expected, disease progression was not reported as an adverse event. Ho wever, if the event of disease progression met criteria for seriousness, this event was reported as a SAE. Allergic reactions or complications from the vaccine were graded from CTC Grade 1 through 4. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 4 Results Ten patients completed the study. The demogr aphic characteristics of these patients are shown in Table A2 -6. Table A2 -6 Patient Demographics for Study P1 -4 Demographic PROSTVAC -VF, n=10 Age Mean (SD) Range 70 (5.4) 63, 79 Ethnic Origin, No. (%) Caucasian African American 9 (90) 1 (10) Ten patients received a total of 20 vaccine administrations between January 9, 2003 and March 27, 2003. All ten patients completed all study visits. There were no DLTs and no patient was withdrawn from the study due to a DLT, inoculation -related adverse even t, or other adverse event related to the administration of the investigational product. Two patients were considered withdrawn from the study after, having received both doses of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F. One patient received an epidural injection of a corticosteroid, which was prohibited per protocol, as treatment for underlying metastatic disease. The other patient developed progression of metastatic disease unrelated to the investigational product that required treatment with a corticosteroid (refer t o SAE narrative below). There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in temperature, pulse or blood pressure noted in any study patient. An ECG at Day 57 (\u00b1 2) in one patient revealed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 46 beats per minute (bp m) but this was assessed by the Principal Investigator as not being a clinically significant change from the patient's baseline ventricular rate of 61 bpm. There were no other clinically significant changes from baseline in ECGs observed. Laboratory tests revealed a clinically significant change from baseline in only one patient whose baseline gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) of 165 U/L increased to 298 U/L at Day 57 (\u00b1 2). This was most likely due to underlying disease. Abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in four patients and lactate dehydrogenase in five patients that had increased from baseline were assessed by the Principal Investigators as not being clinically significant and were most likely due to underlying disease. Results from 24 -hour urine collections for creatinine clearance determinations were reported as showing no clinically significant changes from baseline. Results from one 66 year -old patient did reveal a decrease in creatinine clearance from 114.8 mL/min at baseline to 50. 0 mL/min at Day 57 (\u00b1 2). This result was assessed as normal by the Principal Investigator. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 5 A total of 37 AEs were reported in ten patients. Of these, 17 were assessed as being either remotely, possibly, or probably related to the investigational product (Table 5 -10). All data have been monitored, and data tables were generated from the clinical database. Adverse Events have been coded and are presented using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms. Two of the 17 were inoculation -related events observed in one patient each. Both were reported as Grade 1 reactions and were mild in severity. There were two events of diarrhea occurring in the same patient and two events of fatigue that occurred in two patients reported a s possibly related to the investigational product. Other single adverse events assessed as remotely, possibly, or probably related to the investigational product included anorexia, candidal infection, constipation, cough, dyspepsia, hypoaesthia, lymphaden opathy, myalgia, nausea, pruritis, and paresthesia. All of these adverse events were assessed as mild except for the lymphadenopathy which was assessed as moderate in severity and was described as swollen right cervical nodes. The event resolved without sequelae. The paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia events occurred in the same patient, and were manifested as left sided facial numbness and tingling which were assessed as mild in severity. The patient received the second vaccination without complications, a nd the symptoms continued. Although this event was reported as remotely related to the investigational product, a causal relation to underlying metastatic disease was subsequently suspected (see below). All other adverse events were reported as not relat ed to the investigational product.

The patient received both study vaccinations but was prematurely withdrawn from the study on BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 7 Day 45 after receiving treatment with corticosteriods, which were prohibited by the protocol. The patient completed all protocol -specified safety assessments. Serious Adverse Events One serious adverse event (metastatic disease of the sphenoid bone) assessed as unrelated to investigational product was reported in this study. Patien t J-A/005, a 65 -year old male with metastatic prostate cancer being treated with leuprolide, received PROSTVAC -V on 05 February 2003 and PROSTVAC -F on 05 March 2003. On Day 30 (06 March 2003), the patient developed mild numbness and tingling on the right side of his head with a trigeminal nerve distribution. He was seen on Day 45 (21 March 2003), was sent to the Emergency Room, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital. MRI of the brain showed probable diffuse metastatic disease to the skull base and sphenoid bones. Epidural components to the metastases were noted along the left greater wing of the sphenoid and possible metastatic lesions toward the right cavernous sinus. The patient was treated with prednisone (20 mg qd) and radiation. The patient received both vaccine administrations but was considered withdrawn from the study on Day 45 after treatment with corticosteroids which were prohibited per the protocol. All safety assessments were completed on this patient. The investigator reported tha t the event was related to disease progression. Conclusions In Study P1 -4, there were no DLTs and no patient was withdrawn due to a DLT, inoculation - related event, or other adverse event that was related to the investigational product. Inoculation - related adverse events occurred in two patients and were all Grade 1. No Grade 2 or higher inoculation -related adverse events were observed. One SAE occurred that was unrelated to the investigational product. Based on the available data, one administration of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F each were well tolerated, and no clinically significant, serious adverse events causally related to its administration have been observed in this study. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT Phase II Randomized, Dou ble- blind, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of PROSTVAC -VF/ TRICOM in Combination with GM -CSF in Patient s with Androgen -Independent Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate Study Description The objective of this Phase 2 study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F in combination with recombinant human GM -CSF versus empty vector in combination with placebo in patients with androgen -independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The study was of a randomized (2:1), double -blind, empty vector -controlled design. The study population included male patients 18 years of age who had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with evidence of metastatic disease, were refractory to hormone therapy, had castrate testosterone levels, had not received chemotherapy or recent radiation therapy, and had not had an allergy or untoward reaction to prior vaccinia (smallpox). Patients were stratified into treatment groups based on bisphosphonate use (yes or no ). Patients were administered study treatment as follows: PROSTVAC -V (vaccinia virus, PSA antigen, and TRICOM) 2 \u00d7 108 plaque -forming units (PFU) (sc): 1 \u00d7 109 PFU (boost) or empty vector: Days 14, 28, 56, 84, 112, and 140; GM-CSF 100 \u00b5g or placebo was co -administered on each of the dosing days and consecutively for three days after vaccination at the vaccination site . The primary endpoint of the study was progression -free survival (pfs), defined as the proportion of patients who remained alive and progression free at the end of the study (Day 168). Progression was defined by central radiology as one or more of the followi ng: 1) identification of two or more new sites of bone metastasis on bone scan compared with the baseline bone scan. Progression on bone scan had to be confirmed by plain radiograph; 2) increase in the sum of all measurable target lymph node metastases o n CT scan by greater than 20% according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST criteria) compared with baseline scan. The primary efficacy analysis was on proportion of PFS in the intent -to-treat analysis sample. The rate of pfs in the i ntent -to-treat analysis sample was calculated using the Kaplan -Meier estimate and compared using the log -rank test. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 9 The secondary endpoints of the study were: Time -to-progression (TTP) or death. Time -to-progression was defined as the time from registratio n until progression (as defined for the primary endpoint) or death occurred. Overall survival (analyzed using Kaplan -Meier estimates and the log -rank test). Tumor responses on target and nontarget lesions, and best overall tumor response according to RECIS T criteria. The duration of tumor response (complete or partial response) was to be calculated as well. Time to onset of tumor -associated pain diagnosed by the investigator. Tumor -associated pain was to be confirmed by bone scan or CT scan. The time to onset of opioid analgesic use was also calculated. Effect of vaccination on PSA levels. A postinduction response in PSA levels was defined as a decrease of 50% or greater in PSA compared with baseline levels. This was to be confirmed by a subsequent PSA value, with a decrease 50% or greater of the baseline value, measured four or more weeks later. Safety as measured by AEs. Safety data were collected at each vaccination visit and included laboratory tests, physical examination findings, vital sign measure ments, AEs, and concomitant medications. Adverse events were recorded from start of study drug administration until Day 168. Adverse events were graded using the CTCAE v3.0 and were coded according to the MedRA Version 6.0. The relationship of each AE to study treatment was determined by the investigator to be not related, possibly related, or definitely related. Results Eighty four patients were enrolled into the active group and 41 patients enrolled into the placebo group. Eighty -two patients in the ac tive group and 40 patients in placebo group received drug. Patient demographics are shown in Table A2 -8.

Six patients were misstratified. Bisphosphonate stratification in registration is used for efficacy analyses. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 11 The primary endpoint of the study was progression -free survival at Day 168, which was similar between the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and control group ( Figure A2 -1). No patients in either group had a partial or complete response (CR), and the majority of patients had stable or progressive disease as of their last visit. Additiona l secondary measures of efficacy, such as time to onset of tumor -associated pain, time to onset of opioid analgesic use for any pain, and effect of vaccination on PSA levels were similar between the treatment groups and did not reveal any improvement in th e PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group over the control group. Figure A2 -1 Progression -Free Survival (Therion Phase 2 Study - TBC -PRO -002) In contrast to the primary endpoint results at Day 168, results for long -term overall survival suggest that the percent survival over time was higher for patients in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group than for the control group. M edian survival in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group was longer than for the control group (25.1 and 16.6 months, respectively). Additionally, the percentage of patients that survived for longer than 1000 days was approximately twice as high in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group compared with the control group (29 of 82 patients [35.4%] and 7 of 40 pati ents [17.5%], respectively). Data were analyzed using the log -rank test and the stratified (by corrected bisphosphonate use) log -rank test. For the log -rank test, the overall hazard ratio was 0.622 (95% CI 0.414 - 0.936), P=0.0216. For the stratified lo g-rank test, the overall hazard ratio was 0.559 (95% CI 0.367 - 0.852), P=0.0061. Data are presented in Figure A2 -2. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 12 Figure A2 -2 2 -002) The PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group had a safety profile similar to that of the control group, and there were no significant differences in the incidences of AEs or SAEs between the two treatment groups. Incidence of adverse events with either a possible or definite relationship to treatment is presented in Table A2 -9 by system organ class in order of decreasing frequency. General disorders and administration site conditions were the most common treatment -related system organ class: 67 patients ( 81.7%) in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group an d 31 patients (77.5%) in the control group. The next most common treatment -related system organ class was g astrointestinal disorders (18.3% of patients in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and 10.0% of patients the control group), n ervous system diso rders (17.1% of patients and PROSTVAC -F group and 15.0% of patients in the control group), skin and sc tissue disorders (14.6% of patients in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and 12.5% of patients in the control group), and m usculoskel etal and connective tissue disorders (12.2% of patients PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and 15.0% of patients in the control group). Individual AEs that occurred in at least 10% of all patients are displayed in Table A2 -10. The most frequently rep orted events were injection site -reactions, including injection site erythema, induration, pain, pruritus, swelling, and warmth. These local injection site reactions were balanced in the treatment arms. Other frequently reported events were: fatigue: 3 5 patients (42.7%); nausea: patients (18.3%), 13 (12.2%) and dizziness: 10 (12.2%). Chills, fatigue, and nausea were more common in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F arm than in t he control arm. Some AEs in this study may have resulted from the administration of GM -CSF. When GM -CSF (Leukine, sargramostim) was used in a placebo -controlled study at 250 g/m2 (body surface area) per day, patients in the GM -CSF group had an increased incidence of fluid retention, reported as peripheral edema, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion (Leukine prescribing information May 2004). The dose used in this study, 100 g, was lower than the dose in the study cited above. The incidence of per ipheral edema was 13.4% in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and 10.0% in the control group. There was one case of pleural effusion reported for a patient in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group, and no cases of 09 September 14 Table A2 -9 Treatmen t-Related Adverse Events by System Organ Class in Order of Decreasing Incidence in PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F Number of Adverse Events 622 197 System Organ Class No. Patients (%) No. Patients (%) Patients with at least one adverse event 70 (85.4) 32 (80.0) General disorders and administration site conditions 67 (81.7) 31 (77.5) Gastrointestinal disorders 15 (18.3) 4 (10.0) Nervous system disorders 14 (17.1) 6 (15.0) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 12 (14.6) 5 (12.5) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 10 (12.2) 6 (15.0) Metabolism and nutrition disorders 6 (7.3) 1 (2.5) Vascular disorders 5 (6.1) 1 (2.5) Infections and infestations 4 (4.9) 4 (10.0) Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders 4 (4.9) 3 (7.5) Blood and lymphatic system disorders 3 (3.7) 0 (0.0) Ear and labyrinth disorders 3 (3.7) 0 (0.0) Investigations 3 (3.7) 2 (5.0) Psychiatric disorders 3 (3.7) 0 (0.0) Cardiac disorders 1 (1.2) 2 (5.0) Renal and urinary disorders 1 (1.2) 0 (0.0) Reproductive system and breast disorders 0 (0.0) 2 (5.0) Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications 0 (0.0) 1 (2.5) Abbreviation: PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, vaccinia -specific antigen, and TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules.

Study Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events Of the 105 patients treated (82 treatment group, 23 cross -over patients) there were a total of three patients who discontinued study medication early due to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F- related adverse events. There were two patients with possibly treatment -related Grade 3 adverse events (injection site cellulitis, and a generalized anorexia/myalgia - possibly due to disease progression). In addition, one patient experienced Grade 4 serious adverse events which led to early discontinuation of study medication (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura -TTP, cardiac -301: Part A2 17 infarction ). These were felt to be unlikely but possibly related to treatment. This patient is described on the following page. Serious Adverse Events A total of 16 treatment -emergent SAEs occurred during the study. These SAEs occurred in five patients (6.1%) in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group and in two patients (5.0%) in the control group. Table A2 -12 lists all treatment -related SAEs by patient. Of note, there were two SAEs that occurred before treatment in two patients in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F gro up. Patient 043-0029 experienced chest pain that started four days and resolved two days before receiving his first study treatment. He went on to receive treatment and received six vaccinations throughout the course of the study. Patient 046 -0030 commi tted suicide before receiving any study treatment.

A serious adverse event report was submitted, but no case report form data are available. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 18 Two ( in one patient), were possibly but unlikely treatment -related. The patient, a 74 year old male, was screened for the study on 08 Jul 2004. Medical history included prostate cancer diagnosed in 1994, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia and hypertensio priming dose of PROSTVAC -V on 19 Jul 2004, followed by three biweekly booster doses o f PROSTVAC -F. GM -SCF was administered per protocol. The last booster dose of PROSTVAC -F was administered on 14 Sep 2004 and the last dose of GM -CSF on 17 Sep 2004. On 09 Oct 2004 (Day 83 of the study), patient experienced epigastric pain/heartburn, nausea , dyspnea and diaphoresis. He was hospitalized on 10 Oct 2004, diagnosed with myocardial infarction and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and was discontinued from the study. Following admission and evaluation, the patient was found to have mult iple abnormalities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated cardiac enzymes, cardiac infarction, and acute renal failure due to TTP. The patient was treated with serial plasmaphoresis, hemodialysis, and other treatments, and discharged on 30 Oct 2004. On 01 Apr 2005 (Day 257) patient was admitted to the hospital with a large left thalamic hematoma, hypertension and an INR of 3.5; his condition deteriorated and he expired on 03 Apr 2005. Intracranial hemorrhage is a very well known complication of ant icoagulation therapy with risk of hemorrhage increasing when INR rises above the therapeutic range of 2 to 3. Increase in INR combined with hypertension as another known risk factor is a most likely cause of this patient's death. Both myocardial infarctio n and TTP were considered as possibly, but unlikely treatment -related. TTP has not been previously reported in association with vaccinia immunizations. Conclusions This randomized and double -blind Phase 2 study provides evidence of a meaningful survival benefit for patients treated with PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F with a stratified log rank test P = 0.0095. For patients in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set, the m edian survival was 25.1 months for patients in the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group, compared to 17.7 months for patients in the control group. The percentage of patients who were alive approximately three years after treatment was twice as high for the PR OSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F group (34.5%) compared with the control group (17.1%). The estimated hazard ratio was 0.581 (95% CI 0.384 -0.880). While the primary endpoint of pfs failed to meet statistical criteria, the results from this Phase 2 study provide a mple justification for a Phase 3 evaluation of PROSTVAC -V BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September Part A2 19 and PROSTVAC -F and therefore the absence of strong PFS findings serve to suggest important Phase 3 study conduct considerations. The vaccination regimen was well tolerated and safety profile was sim ilar for the two treatment groups. Summary of Safety of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F were well tolerated in study TBC -PRO -002. The most frequent adverse events included injection site reactions, chills, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, peripheral edema, dizziness, althralgia, constipation, and diarrhea. Data beyond this summary are available in the Final Study Report. Deaths One patient died while in study TBC -PRO -002. The cause of death was completed suicide. The death occurred after screening and study registration, prior to receiving study drug. A second patient died due to progression of prostate cancer approximately four months after he had completed study TBC -PRO -002. An SAE report was submitte d, but no case report form data are available Serious Adverse Events Treatment -related SAEs reported in Therion -sponsored studies P1 -4 and TBC -PRO -002 are shown in Table Table A2 -13 Treatment -Related SAEs in BNIT/Therion -Sponsored Studies Stud Possible *These events occurred in the same patient. Premature Terminations Due to Adverse Events Five patients treated with PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F withdrew from BNIT/Therion - sponsored clinical studies. The reasons for withdrawal were unrelated to study treatment for four patients. One patient withdrew because of two SAEs that were defined as possibly related to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F. A narrative for this patient's experience is included above.

In addition, data were collected on anti -tumor response, PSA -specific T -cell activation, and vaccinia virus clearance. Of note: this trial most closely resembles the BNIT/Therion randomized, controlled Phase 2 study TBC -PRO -002 in terms of patient population and regimen, although the specific regimens evaluated and the study objectives differ. Patients with progressive prostate cancer were enrolled in two stages. The vaccines were administered subcutaneously on Days 1, 29, and 57. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) establ ished in Stage 1 (Arms 2 -5) was used in Stage 2 (see below). The study plan called for three to six patients to be entered in the arms of Stage 1. Stage 1 Arm 1 F9-F9-F9 Arm 2 V8-F9-F9 Arm 3 V8-F9-F9 + G Arm 4 V8-F9-F9 + (F-G7) Arm 5 V8-F9-F9 + (F-G8) F9 = 1 x 109 pfu rF -PSA(L155)/TRICOM V8 = 2 x 108 pfu rV -PSA(L155)/TRICOM G = 100 g GM -CSF sc at injection site after vaccine daily H 4 days (Days 1 -4; 29 -32; 57 -60) F-G7 and F -G8 = 1 x 107 or 1 x 108 pfu rF -GM-CSF, respectively, given with F9 Patients c ompleting Stage 1 of the study who did not have progressive disease and did not experience unacceptable adverse events (AEs) were offered to enter Stage 2, to receive additional monthly vaccinations beginning on Day 85 for three months, and then every 12 w eeks as per the treatment arm in which they were enrolled. The second stage of the study followed a randomized Phase 2 design to compare the immunological effects of vaccine alone, or in combination with GM -CSF (G), or rF -GM-CSF (F -G). Patients enrolled in Stage 2 had to have measurable metastatic disease without prior chemotherapy. Eight patients were enrolled randomly in arms 6 -9. The treatment dose and schedule for these arms were the same as arms 2 -5 in Stage 1 (see above), and were dependent on co mpletion of all dose levels of Stage 1. The maximum accrual was 30 patients for Stage 1 and 32 for Stage 2. Stage 2 BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 23 Arm 6 V-F-F Arm 7 V-F-F + G Arm 8 V-F-F + (F -G) Arm 9 V-F-F + (F -G) A report on the Stage 1 portion of this study detailed the results of the first 15 patients enrolled was published (Arlen, 2007). No DLTs or Grade 3/4 adverse events were observed. Injection site reactions were noted in 8/15 patients (53%), and were more severe in the three patients who received co -immunization with high dose rF -GM-CSF. Importantly, four patients were followed after vaccinia vaccination by PCR and by plaque assay. While the injection site and PBMC did score positive by PCR (viral DNA fra gments), replicating virus was isolated from only one patient, at only one site, the injection site. Interestingly, this patient developed a pock at the injection site and was co -immunized with rF -GM-CSF. None of seven patients with measurable disease, b y CT scan, had objective response. Nine of 15 had decreases in PSA velocity, 4/15 had absolute decreases in PSA, and one had a decrease of >30%. Five of six HLA -A2-positive patients had increases of PSA -3a epitope specific T -cells, as measured by 2 -4 fold increases in interferon gamma ELISPOTS. This study demonstrated the relative safety of PROSTVAC -V with multiple boosts of PROSTVAC -F in combination with GM-CSF. The ongoing Stage 2 portion of this study has shown some evidence of short term anti -tumor activity, and correlation with immune responses. Stage 2 was closed to accrual in December 2005. A subgroup of patients were maintained on long -term monthly vaccinations. If patients were stable and experienced no significant adverse events, they were of fered the possibility of maintenance therapy with monthly PROSTVAC -F boosts. Five patients were treated for over a year with no adverse events. In the Stage 2 portion of this study, an attempt was made to compare vaccination with protein based GM -CSF and fowlpox vector encoded GM -CSF as vaccine adjuvants. In that trial, four groups of eight patients each received either, protein GM -CSF, rF -GM-CSF low dose, rF -GM- CSF high dose, or no GM -CSF in conjunction with PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F vaccination. No cle ar difference could be discerned in an immunological or clinical outcome; however, the numbers of patients are small, and no definitive conclusion could be drawn. A report on the 32 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of this trial was published (Gull ey, 2010). Two patients out of 12 had CT evidence of reduction in measurable soft tissue disease. One patient experienced a partial response at three months with a 68% decline in his hilar adenopathy, and another had 33% reduction in a pelvic lymph node at six months. Additionally, one patient had stable disease lasting 11 months, and an additional patient with stable disease for 10 months had a 29% decrease in his soft tissue disease. Five of thirty -two patients BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 24 demonstrated declines in PSA of >30% and one patient's PSA declined >70%. At the time this report was prepared, 11 of 32 patients were still alive with a median survival of 27 months. Importantly, 13 of 29 patients developed greater than 2 -fold increase in PSA -3a epitope specific ELISPOTS, and five patients developed a greater than 6 -fold increase in ELISPOTS. Overall survival was correlated with the development of this immune response. According to NCI BB -IND 10915 20010 APR information there were 47 evaluable patients (47 entered the trial a nd 47 were treated). Of the 90 adverse events reported, the vast majority were Grade 1 and 2 (87). Injection site reaction was the most frequently observed adverse event (42 patients) and none were greater than a Grade 2 (29 of 42 patients had Grade 2 ev ents). Fatigue and lethargy constituted the second most frequent event reported (9 patients); all were Grade 1. Other individual adverse events constituted less than 5% of the total reported events. There were three Grade 3 adverse events, including bon e pain, fever and transfusion (packed red blood cells). No adverse events exceeded Grade 3 in severity. There were no IND Safety Reports (SAEs) related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. Protocol 6066: Phase 1 Feasibility Study of Intraprostatic P SA-Based Vaccine in Men with Prostate Cancer and Local Failure Following Radiotherapy or Cryotherapy or Clinical Progression on Androgen Deprivation Therapy in the Absence of Local Definitive Therapy The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the clinical safety and feasibility of intraprostatic prime/boost vaccine strategy that involves priming with PROSTVAC -V - GM-CSF followed by boosts PROSTVAC -F with or without subsequent rF - GM-CSF and with or without simultaneous boost s of PROSTVAC -F and rF -GM-CSF. Twenty - one of 30 planned patients have been enrolled in this study as of February 28, 2010. The study includes five cohorts of three to six patients each. According to NCI BB -IND 10915 2009 APR information, there were no D LTs or drug -related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported to date in this study. Of the 106 AEs reported, all but one was Grade 1 and 2. The most commonly reported AE was fever in the absence of neutropenia, where neutropenia is defined as ANC <1.0 x 109/L (19 events), followed by injection site reaction/extravasation changes (17 events). One Grade 3 event was reported as related to an obstruction of the prostate. There were no IND Safety Reports (SAEs) related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. Protocol 7207: Phase 1 Trial of a PSA -Based Vaccine and an Anti -CTLA -4 Antibody in Adults with Metastatic Androgen -Independent Prostate Cancer The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of a fixed dose of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F vaccine in combination with dose escalated anti -CTLA4. The secondary objectives included an evaluation of the immunologic response (as measured by an increase in PSA -specific T -cells by ELISPOT assay in HLA -A2+ patients) and clinical respons e (as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] and PSA consensus criteria). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 25 This was an open -label, Phase 1 safety trial with sequential cohorts of patients (n = 3 to 6) all receiving a fixed dose of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F and G M-CSF, with escalation of MDX -010 (ipilimumab). Monthly boosting vaccinations continued until the patients were off study. The protocol was amended to allow patients who received the initial six doses of MDX -010 to receive a maintenance dose every three months until there is evidence of disease progression or toxicity, for up to an additional 12 months (four additional doses). The protocol was amended to extend biochemical eligibility parameters to patients with Gilbert's syndrome with total bilir ubin 3 mg/dL. Since the majority of patients treated with the highest dose of MDX -010 (10 mg/kg) developed skin rash, the protocol was amended to allow these patients to continue re -treatment with MDX -010 and/or vaccine if the rash was not painful with necrotic keratinocytes on biopsy, the rash does not contain bullous lesions with necrotic keratinocytes on biopsy, the rash resolves to Grade 2 within 28 days of planned administration of MDX -010, and an NCI dermatologist has reviewed the case for any addi tional risk factors. Because of concerns for progression to toxic epidermal necrolysis, patients with rash who do not meet indicated criteria were not eligible for MDX - 010 retreatment. A protocol amendment excluded patients with autoimmune hemolytic ane mia, ulcerative and hemorrhagic In MDX -010 was withheld for Grade 3 skin -related AEs regardless of causality. A preliminary report by Mohebtash et al. (2009) on 30 patients indicated there were no dose - limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no >grade 2 toxicities attributed to the PROSTVAC -V/F vaccine. There were no IND safety reports (SAEs) related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. There was no evidence of clinical benefit in the six patients who had prior chemotherapy at dose level (DL) 1 and 2; therefore, subsequently patients with prior chemotherapy were excluded. The median time to progression for nine chemotherapy -na\u00efve patients treated on DLs 2 and 3 was 6.1 months (range 2.9 -11.6 months). Median PSA doubling time increased from 2.2 months at baseline to 3.7 months on study (p=0.17). Five of nine patients had 50% declines in PSA from peak during study and one had a sustained decrease in PSA >95% from baseline. Four of these patients had stable disease for 6 months and two had unconfirmed partial responses (PR) by RECIST. Of the 15 patients on DL -4, six had stable disease for 6 months, six remain on trial and one had a sust ained decrease in PSA >99% from baseline. Median PSA doubling time increased >3 -fold from 2.6 months at baseline to 8.2 months (p=0.01) at DL -4. The 24 chemotherapy -na\u00efve patients had PSA doubling time increase from 2.5 to 6 months (p=0.003). Fourteen o f 30 patients had a PSA drop from baseline on study; two of those 14 had no immune related AEs and 12 showed Grade 2 immune -related AEs temporarily associated with PSA decline. The investigators concluded that the study combination has clinical activity in chemotherapy -na\u00efve patients and is associated with manageable side effects. They also indicated that further studies are required to establish if the combination is more effective than either agent alone. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol -301: Part A2 26 Protocol 7354: A Randomized Phase II Trial Co mbining Vaccine Therapy with PROSTVAC/TRICOM and Flutamide vs. Flutamide Alone in Men with Androgen - Insensitive, Non -Metastatic (D0.5) Prostate Cancer The primary objective of this randomized Phase 2 study is to determine if use of a combination of vaccine plus flutamide may be associated with improvement in time to treatment failure (defined as rising PSA, development of metastatic disease, or removal from treatment due to excessive toxicity) compared with flutamide monotherapy. The secondary objectives a re: 1) to determine evidence of patterns of immunologic effects, which differ by treatment; 2) to estimate and compare the toxicity on the two study arms; 3) to evaluate the effect of vaccine on the development of metastatic disease after PSA progression; 4) to evaluate PSA and immune responses in patients who have had flutamide stopped at the time of PSA progression, and either continue vaccine (Arm B) or have vaccine initiated (Arm A) at time of flutamide discontinuation; and 5) to assess response rates in patients randomized to both arms, as well as responses in those patients who crossed -over from the flutamide to the vaccine only arm. The study is designed to randomize 66 patients on a 1:1 basis to receive flutamide with or without the PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F prime/boost vaccine in combination with GM -CSF. The study is divided into two steps: 1) patients are randomized to flutamide with or without vaccine, and 2) after three months patients who receive flutamide only may cross over to receive vacci ne, if their PSA levels are rising and scans show no metastatic disease. The vaccine may start four weeks after flutamide is stopped, if the PSA continues to rise. In case of a decline in PSA after the discontinuation of flutamide, PSA levels will be che cked every 28 days and vaccine may commence when the serum PSA levels begin to rise. For patients receiving flutamide and vaccine, after three months flutamide treatment will discontinue but patients may continue to receive vaccine therapy. This study wa s recently begun and 22 patients have entered as of 30 November 2009. According to NCI IND 10915 20010 APR information, a total of 41 adverse events have been reported, with the most common event being injection site reaction changes (twelve events). One patient withdrew from the study due to \"other\" reason and one patient withdrew from the study due to refusal after beginning protocol therapy. There were no IND Safety Reports (SAEs) related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. Protocol 7678: Rando mized Phase 2.5 Study of 153Sm -EDTMP (Quadramet) With or Without a PSA/TRICOM Vaccine in Men with Androgen -Insensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer This is a recently initiated open -label, randomized, two -arm Phase 2.5 study. The primary objective of this t rial is to determine if the combination of vaccine and 153Sm EDTMP (Arm B) is potentially able to improve the 4 -month progression -free survival (PFS) for patients who have progressive disease (PD) following docetaxel -based therapy for metastatic androgen -independent prostate cancer (AIPC), over radionuclide therapy alone (Arm A). The secondary goals are to BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 27 evaluate the PSA outcomes, immunologic and objective responses, toxicity, palliation, overall survival (OS), and PFS. Patients with AIPC with bone metas tasis who have had prior docetaxel will be randomized to receive 153Sm-EDTMP with or without vaccine. GM -CSF is administered sc daily for four days, beginning on the day of each vaccination and within 5 mm of the vaccination site. The accrual goal for th is trial is 68 patients; 17 patients have entered as of 30 November 2009. According to NCI IND 10915 2010 APR information, a total of 20 adverse events Grade 2 have been reported. The most common events were injection site reaction changes (six events) There have been no IND safety reports (SAEs) related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. Protocol E9802: A Phase 2 Study of PROSTVAC -V (Vaccinia)/TRICOM and PROSTVAC -F (Fowlpox)/TRICOM with GM -CSF in Patients with PSA Progression After Local Therapy for Prostate Cancer The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of PROSTVAC -V followed by PROSTVAC -F and GM -CSF on biochemical PSA progression at six months and to determine the change in PSA velocity pre -treatment to post -treatment. T he secondary objectives are to evaluate the percentage of patients experiencing a 50% decline in serum PSA at four weeks, to evaluate the tolerability and safety of the PSA/TRICOMTM vaccine in combination with GM - CSF, and to determine the effect of GM -CSF on PSA immediately after treatment (Day 4) compared to a delayed effect (Day 15); PSA nadir and percentage of patients with undetectable PSA will be assessed in patients enrolled in Step 2 of the study. GM -CSF is also administered sc daily for four days, beginning on the day of each vaccination and within 5 mm of the vaccination site. The study is divided into two steps: 1) Patients are treated every four weeks for the first three treatments, then every 12 weeks until biochemical or clinical progression . If patients do not progress, they can be treated maximally for 24 months of PROSTVAC -F following Cycle 4; 2) Upon biochemical or clinical progression, patients are re -registered into the trial and then treated with bicalutamide 50 mg once per day for on e month in combination with vaccine therapy (in combination with GM -CSF daily for four days every 12 weeks until biochemical or clinical progression or maximum of 12 months treatment). This trial has completed enrollment of 50 patients. DiPaola et al. (2009) reported preliminary data on 50 patients in this study with median PSA doubling time of 4.4 months following local therapy on Step 1 of the treatment. The overall biochemical response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) was 2% and 25 patients had stable disease (SD). Among 29 patients with follow -up >6 months, the PSA progression -free rate at six months was 66%. The authors concluded that a viral PSA vaccine platform can be administered safely to patients with minimal disease volume . The investigators indicated that the biochemical results on progression -free survival at six months and increase in BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 28 PSA doubling time in this population support larger randomized studies in patients with micro - metastatic disease. According to NCI IND 1 0915 2010 APR information , the most common event was injection site reaction (31 events) followed by fatigue (22 events). One event, fever, was Grade 3. There have been no IND safety reports related to PROSTVAC -V/F or GM -CSF in this study. Risk Management Procedures to be Utilized in Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 As with the previously conducted clinical studies of recombinant poxviruses conducted in the United States, potential risks for this study will be managed through several avenues: 1) This study wi ll be conducted in accordance with the United States Code of Federal Regulations and ICH guidelines. a. All principal investigators and sub -investigators participating in the study will be qualified by education, training and experience to assume responsibil ity for the proper conduct of the trial according to to the principles of Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as described in the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 parts 50, 54, 56, and 312, and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH ) document \"Guidance for Industry - E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance \". Further, all study activities will be conduct ed in keeping with local, state, and federal legal and regulatory requirements and the Declaration of Helsinki 2004. b. Clinical sites where the study is to be conducted will be thoroughly evaluated prior to the initiation of the study to ensure that the facilities are sufficient for storing and administering the vaccine, as well as having the appropriate facilities for the collection, processing and storage of human specimens; c. All clinical sites will be regularly monitored by BNIT (or its designee) for protocol adherence and compliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines. 2) Clinical site staff will be thoroughly trained on the study protocol prior to initiation of the study. a. A thorough study -specific training covering all aspects of the study will occur prior to the initiation of the study via a formal local investigator meeting and/or on-site study initiation vi sit. All clinical site personnel involved in the handling or administration of the GMO will be trained according to the study protocol, and all supportive documentation, including study specific laboratory and clinical trial material manuals; BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 A2 29 PROSTVAC -F is considered BSL - 1 (BSL -2 outside the United States). All vaccines in this trial should be handled using standard infection control procedures and study staff should wear personal protection consisting of at least a lab coat, gloves, and protective eyewear when handling PROSTVAC. c. Clinical sit e staff with the responsibility of administering PROSTVAC , collecti ng clinical samples , or clinically evaluating study subjects , are instructed to follow the World Health Organiz ation (WHO) universal precautions for the prevention of transmission of infectious agen ts in healthcare settings (WHO Standard Precautions 2006). 3) All transport of PROSTVAC will be done according to guidelines for the transport of GMOs and IATA Transportat ion Regulations; 4) Accountability of Drug Supplies a. Prior to study start, each Investigator will provide the actual location (facility, room number, and freezer/refrigerator number, if any) and identify the pharmacist, study coordinator, subinvestigators,or other personnel who will have access to the drug, and if different from above, any personnel who will have preparation, administration and or receipt/return/disposal responsibilities of the study drug. b. The Investigator or his/her designee must maintain accurate records of dates, quantities and the lot numbers of all study drug received, to whom dispensed (patient -by-patient accounting), and accounts of any product accidentally wasted or intentionally des troyed. The Investigator or designee must retain all used, unused, partially used, wasted, or expired study drug until the study monitor has confirmed accountability unless the institution has a policy of immediate disposal/destruction for used experimenta l products. c. Local or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used study drug. In these cases, it is acceptable for the investigational site staff to destroy any remaining dispensed study drug before a monitoring inspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining inventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, returned and destroyed. Written authorization to destroy study drug prior to monitoring reconciliation must b e obtained from the Sponsor or designee at study start -up. Each research center must provide the Sponsor a statement of the institutional policy and procedures for disposing of material with a Biosafety rating of RG2 (Appendix 12.2; RAC Guidelines 2002, Ap pendix B or equivalent outside the United States) and the institution 's policy and procedures for BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 30 disposal of hazardous waste or biologic products. A copy of the policy must be placed in the Pharmacy Manual. d. At the conclusion of the Treatment phase of the study, all unused vaccine, GM - CSF, and placebo supplies (collectively, study mediation) will be either destroyed on site or by a licensed facility contracted by the site, or returned to the Sponsor or designee following final reconciliation. At the conclu sion of the Treatment phase of the study, an overall summary of all study drug received, unused, partially used, wasted, and returned must be prepared. 5) Secondary Transmission a. Only subjects meeting all protocol -defined eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. In particular, t he study exclusion criteria outlined in the protocol exclude subjects from participation if they have the potential to come into contact with individuals considered to be at risk for secondary transmission PROSTVAC should a subje ct shed vaccine virus. These include subjects who are unable to avoid close contact or household contact with the following high -risk individuals for three weeks after the Day 1 vaccination: (a) children 3 year of age, (b) pregnant or nursing women, (c) individuals with prior or concurrent extensive eczema or other eczemoid skin disorders, or (d) immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV. b. To minimize the potential for secondary transmission, the site of the PROSTVAC -V or placebo vac cination (Week 1) will be covered with a sterile, nonadherent dressing such as a Telfa bandage until the scab falls off naturally. Patients, and if possible, patient caregivers, will be educated as to the care of the injection site, including proper bandag e changing, bathing, possible side effects, and minimization of contact with vulnerable populations. Patients will be provided with injection site care 'kits' containing, for example : instruction sheets, disposable gloves, absorbent toweling, alcohol swabs , nonadherent Telfa - type bandages, band -aids, zip -lock biohazard bags for disposal of used bandages and gloves; pre -filled syringes for home injection of GM -CSF or placebo, a cold pack, a sharps container, a digital thermometer, contact information for the study personnel, and a patient diary. Patients will be instructed to return the zip -lock biohazard bag containing all used supplies at their next clinic visit. c. Accidental transmission of vaccinia virus to a clinic staff member or a member of the patient 's family or friends will be reported on a modified SAE form and the event will be followed by the Principal Investigator until resolved. All such events will be summarized in the annual safety update to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Any accidenta l or suspected secondary transmission should be reported immediately to the Sponsor 's Medical Monitor or designee. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301: Part A2 31 6) Safety monitoring of all subjects a. Subjects will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes following administration of PROSTVAC or placebo for observation for signs of adverse reactions. b. During the 21 -week Treatment phase of this study the study visits will occur on Weeks 3, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 ( \u00b1 3 days for each individual visit). Patients will be followed during the Treatment phase of the study for any signs or symptoms oftreatment -emergent toxicity by means of a focused physical exam, hematology, serum chemistry panels, EKG, and recording of AEs and concomitant medications. c. In the event of complications due to administration of PROSTVAC -V, including eczema vaccinatum, server generalized vaccinia, some cases of auto -inoculation , VIG therapy may be provided . In he intravenous anti -viral drug cidofovir (Vistide \u00ae) can be used for severe infections, if patient is not responding to VIG. 7) Serious adverse events must be reported by the Investigator within 24 hours of learning of the event. If the event is fatal or life -threatening, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified immediately by phone, as well as by fax or email. The BNIT Medical Monitor will review all SAEs in real time. 8) In addition to the Medical Monitor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), comprised of a multidisciplinary group of experts, will also share responsibility for safety management during the study. The DMC members will have no conflict of interests relative to the sponsor or s tudy, including any financial, intellectual, or operational connection to the Sponsor or any competitor of the Sponsor. 9) The study protocol outlines the events that would discontinue dosing and enrollment of additional subjects until review of the event in question by the Medical Monitor and the DMC BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 1 PART A3: DETAILS OF PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS FOR RELEASE BNIT has not previously applied for approval of deliberate release of the GMO to any other EC member state under Directive 2001/18/EC . BNIT anticipates filing an application for deliberate release for this proposed clinical trial ( BNIT -PRV -301) in 10 European countries ( Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom) . BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 2 PART A4: RISK ASSESSMENT AND A STATEMENT ON RISK EVALUATION SUMMARY PROSTVAC (PROSTVAC -V/F) is a live attenuated viral vector -based investigational vaccine product that is comprised of two component viral vectors, to be used together in a prime -boost vaccination regimen: (1) PROSTVAC -V: Recombinant vaccinia virus that contains a modified gene encoding human prostate -specific antigen (PSA) and genes encoding three -3 (LFA -3) (or TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules, TRICOM); and (2) PROSTVAC -F: Recombinant fowlpox virus that co -expresses the same four human genes as PROSTVAC -V. PROSTVAC -V/F is being developed for the treat ment of metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This agent is the product of more than 15 years of poxviral vector development and evaluation by the NCI, the former Therion Biologics Corporation, and BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. Over 300 patients have been treated with the PROSTVAC -V/F product. PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F do not exhibit any known phenotypic changes (e.g., changes in virulence or growth advantage) that would increase their risk to the environment relative to their nonrecombi nant parental pox virus es, which are derived from licensed vaccines. Thus, the added human transgenes have not fundamentally altered the inherent properties of the viruses. In addition, the analysis of viral shedding, transmission, persistence in the envi ronment, and other potential issues indicates that the risk of any significant impact of PROSTVAC -V/F on the environment is low. Viral shedding studies of smallpox vaccine indicate that nonrecombinant vaccinia virus is shed transiently from the site of va ccination and rarely from other sites (Cooney, , including PROSTVAC -V, have demonstrated viral shedding only at the site of vaccination (Arlen, vaccinia virus results in reduced viral shedding relative to vaccination by scarification (Roberts, 19 32; Henderson, 1939; Cherry, 1977; Connor, 1977 ). Bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site, further minimizing release into the environment (Talbot, 2006 ). Contact transmission of vaccinia -based smallpox vaccine is rare (Neff, 2002; CDC, 2004 ). No secondary transmission of recombinant pox virus es, including PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, to contacts has been reported in humans. However, PROSTVAC -V and BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. -PRV -301 3 PROSTVAC -F are live viruses and, as such, retain the potential for transmission . Consequently, healthcare personnel who have direct contact with contaminated dressings or other infectious material from participants in clinical studies are instructed to adhere to appropriate infection control measures and can be offered vaccination with vaccinia vac cine. In addition, study exclusion criteria exclude subjects from participation if they have close or household contact with individuals at risk for exposure to vaccinia virus. Use of appropriate infection control measures, such as covering the vaccinati on site and washing hands after contact with the vaccination site, will prevent transmission. Fowlpox virus does not replicate in human cells (Somogyi, 1993 ). Consequently, viral shedding in humans is limited and appears to be confined to the vaccination site. These agents are not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans and are of minimal potential hazard to personnel and the environment under ordinary conditions of use. They can be handled safely in the laboratory without special apparatus or equ ipment, using techniques generally acceptable for nonpathogenic material. Pox viruses cannot propagate without a permissive host organism. In a permissive host, pox virus infections are transient, lasting up to several weeks (Fenner, 1988 ). Pox viruses do not integrate into the genome of the infected cell. The pox virus life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Moss, 1996 ). Therefore, the risk of pox virus persistence by integration into the host chromosome is very low, unlike other v iruses, such as retroviruses, which integrate and establish permanent infections in the host. Vaccinia and fowlpox viruses are stable when stored frozen or when lyophilized under carefully controlled conditions (Fenner, 1988 ). Under normal environmental c onditions, however, these viruses lose viability within days pox viruses are readily inactivated by a number of common disinfect ants and cleaning agents (Erterpi, 2009 ). Recombinant vaccinia and fowlpox viruses are currently commercially available and widely distributed in the environment as veterinary vaccines (Meeusen, 2007 ). No environmental issues associated with the use of t hese recombinant vaccines have been reported. RISK ASSESSMENT Conclusions on the Potential Environment Impact from the Release of GMOs Potential Routes for Environmental Exposure PROSTVAC -V/F will be administered in an appropriately controlled clinic envir onment by subcutaneous injection into an alcohol -cleansed site in the upper arm (deltoid) or upper outer thigh of men aged 18 - 85 years old with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic CRPC. The PROSTVAC -V or placebo vaccination site will be co vered with a sterile, BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 4 nonadherent dressing such as a Telfa bandage until the scab falls off naturally. For the PROSTVAC -F or placebo, the injection site will be covered with a Band -aid until a scab (if any) forms or for patient comfort. Routes by which th e product may potentially enter the environment include the following: Shedding of virus from study subje cts who have received the vaccine; Accident al, inappropriate disposal of the product into the sewer, or municipal waste at the site of use; Breach of c ontainer integrity during shipping and storage Accidental e xposure to the vaccine by personnel involved in preparation and administr ation of the vaccine at the site of use or handling during shipping. An analysis of these potential routes for exposure is described in the sections below, including the appropriate measures in place during the conduct of the study to mitigate the potential for environmental exposure to occur, and mitigation of adverse impacts in the event of any environmental exposure. PROST VAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are live vaccines and require a host cell to replicat e. They can only remain viable f ollowing infection and proliferation in an appropriate host organism. Other than potential host organisms, it is considered that there are no environ mental niches or habitats that would be affected, either directly or indirectly, by exposure to PROSTVAC. i. Likelihood of the genetically modified organism (GMO) becoming more persistent and invasive in natural habitats under the conditions of the propose d release(s). It is not likely that PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F will become more persistent or invasive in natural habitats under the conditions of the study. PROSTVAC -V Vaccinia virus has no known natural habitat and the origins of vaccinia virus in nature and as a vaccine are unknown . However, although v accinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, some vaccinia strains have been isolated from domestic animals, including several vaccinia strains isolated from dairy cattle throughout Brazil , as well as buffalo pox virus, first isolated in India and still associated with sporadic outbreaks in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Russia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Italy. Vaccine escape has been hypothesized to account for the presence of vaccinia strains in nature; however, sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies have provided evidence that it is unlikely these isolates have derived from a single vaccine strain used during the past century (Trindade, 2007 ). Thus, despite the extensive worldwide use of smallpox vaccine, vaccine escape into the environment seems to be at best a rare event. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 5 Stability in the Environment Vaccinia virus is relatively stable when stored at low temperatures. This contributed to the success of the smallpox vaccination program in develope d countries where refrigeration was readily accessible. However, vaccine potency rapidly declined after storage at ambient temperatures, resulting in a high rate of vaccination failures in developing countries in the early twentieth century. Major effort s were required to develop a dried vaccine that would be stable at ambient temperatures ( Fenner, 1988 ). Simple drying resulted in variable stability. Even complex drying conditions often gave unsatisfactory results. Improvements were gradually introduce d and a ppropriate lyophilization conditions were finally optimized in the 1950s, contributing to the ultimate success of the global smallpox vaccination program. Pox virus es have the capacity to survive for considerable periods in dried material such as detached vaccination scabs. They are also are relatively stable when stored frozen or lyophilized under carefully controlled conditions. However stability decreases significantly as temperature is increased. Under normal environmental conditions, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are expected to lose viability within days or weeks. There are several published studies on the recovery of non -recombinant vaccinia virus under various laboratory conditions designed to mimic environmental exposure. Virus survival was evaluated, for example on fabric and food (Sidwell, 1966; Pastoret, 1996; Essbauer, 2007 ); dried or in liquid (including saline, drinking water, sterile -filtered lake or river water, storm water , storm water supplemented with fetal calf serum or p otting soil) (Mahnel, 1977; Mahnel, 1987; Essbauer, 2007 ); under different conditions of relative humidity, temperature or pH (Mahl, 1975; Newman , 2003 ); exposed to air or in airtight containers (Mahnel, 1987 ). There are many differences among these publi shed experiments, including different vaccinia strains, preparation techniques, different starting virus titers, and viral titration methods. However, there are clear data in all of these studies first, that vaccinia is a relatively stable virus under a v ariety of laboratory conditions, and second, that stability decreases significantly as temperature is increased. Specific stability studies have been performed on the non -recombinant vaccinia parental virus (TBC -Wy) and on a t recombinant -V, expresses the three TRICOM costimulatory molecules; in two 2006; M adan, 2007 ). Stability of PANVAC -V at dried or in water at various temperatures was compared to that of the non -recombinant parental virus, TBC - Wy. These studies demonstrated that the recombinant virus is comparable to the corresponding non-recombinant p arental virus. Both viruses lost viability over a period of weeks when stored in water at 25 C. The same viruses lose viability over a period of days when stored dried at 25C. These results are consistent with published reports discussed above that dem onstrate that BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 6 pox virus es are stable at low temperatures but are less stable at higher temperatures without special treatment such as lyophilization under controlled conditions. Viral Shedding Release of PROSTVAC -V into the environment as a consequence of shedding after immunization of study subjects is unlikely. Although PROSTVAC -V is a replicating vaccinia virus , it is administered subcutaneously. Consequently, the reactions associated with intradermal administration of traditional vaccinia vaccines (sc arrin g, pustules, vesicle formation) are not typical, and were not observed in either of the BNIT/Therion sponsored clinical studies of PROSTVAC -V/F. Lesion formation at the vaccination site is considered an indirect measure of viral shedding ( Rotz, 2001; Lane, 2003 ). Consequently, the lack of lesion formation after administration of PROSTVAC -V is expected to reflect a significantly reduced level of shedding as compared with vaccination by scarification . This assumption was tested in an NCI -sponsored clini cal trial (BB -IND-10915) in which the dose and route of vaccination of PROSTVAC -V were the same as the intended dose and route of vaccination for the proposed study . In the NCI study, viral shedding and lesion formation were evaluated in four patients tha t had evidence of prior vaccination with vaccinia virus as smallpox vaccine (Arlen, 2007 ). Viral shedding was assessed over a four -week period following administration by PCR analysis and viral plaque assay of injection site swabs, urine, saliva, and blood samples. The results indicated that, while viral DNA is shed and persists in some patient samples, live virus is shed transiently, and probably exclusively, from the vaccination site . Bandaging and proper care of the vaccination site should minimize th e likelihood of viral shedding after subcutaneous administration of PROSTVAC -V. PROSTV AC-F Avipox viruses are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. Transmission of virus can occur through a break in the s kin or, more commonly, when vectored by biting insect such as mosquitoes and mites. Aerosols generated from infected birds or the ingestion of contaminated food or water have also been implicated as a source of transmission. These viruses are highly host specific. Fowlpox virus replication has been demonstrated in vivo in certain avian species, namely chickens, turkeys, and pigeons, but not in quail, ducks, or canaries (Tripathy, 1984; McMillen, 1994 ). Productive replication of avipox including the parental non -recombinant fowlpox virus TBC -FPV, has not been demonstrated in vivo in nonavian species. Productive replication in vitro has not been observed in human cells, monkey cells, and in most mammalian cells tested (Somogyi, 1993 ). A single ex ception is a hamster cell line, BHK -21 cells, which is semi -permissive for the growth fowlpox virus (Weli, 2004; Weli, Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 7 Stability in the Environment There are few published studies on the persistence of avipox viruses in the environment. However, persistence in the environment, adverse sequellae, and other environmental issues have not been reported as a result of the use of licensed recombinant fowlpox and canarypox virus - based products, including veterinary vaccines against Newcastle Disease Vir us, avian influenza virus, rabies, feline leukemia virus, canine distemper, and West Nile virus. As part of the licensure procedure, the USDA announced Findings of No Significant Impact with respect to the likelihood of an adverse environmental event usin g these vaccines ( Payne, 1994 ; Payne, 1995 ; Payne, 1996 ; Federal Register, 1994, 1997 a, 1997b , 2003, 2004 ). Specific stability studies have been performed on the non -recombinant fowlpox parental virus (TBC -FPV) and on a similar to designated PANVAC data ). recombinant -F, expresses the three TRICOM costimulatory molecules; in 2006; Madan, 2007 ). Stability of PANVAC -F at dried or in water at various temperatures was compared to that of the non -recombinant parental virus, TBC - FPV. These studies demonstrated that the recombinant virus is comparable to the corresponding non-recombinant parent al virus. Both viruses lost viability over a period of weeks when stored in water at 25 C. The same viruses lose viability over a period of days when stored dried at 25C. These results indicate that PROSTVAC -F is stable at low temperatures but are less stable at higher temperatures without special treatment such as lyophilization under controlled conditions. ii. Any selective advantage or disadvantage conferred to the GMO and the likelihood of this becoming realized under the conditions of the proposed release(s). No selective advantage is likely to be conferred to the GMO under the conditions of the proposed release. For both PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, comparison of the respective parental and recombinant viruses indicates that the added human transgen es in these recombinant viruses have not fundamentally altered the biologic properties of the viruses with respect to virulence, replicative ability, or stability in the environment. Generation of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F resulted in minimal disruption t o the parental genome. In PROSTVAC -V, the human PSA and TRICOM genes are a ll inserted at a single site in an intergenic region between open reading frames F12L and F13L. No vaccinia genes are interrupted by this insertion. In PROSTVAC -F, the human genes were inserted into the coding sequence of the FPV246, which has homology to the ankyrin repeat gene family . The absence of this gene is not predicted to have an effect on the properties of fowlpox virus. Growth properties of recombinant and non -recombina nt viruses are similar. Under the same set of growth conditions in prima ry chicken embryo dermal cells, the yield of PROSTVAC -V was BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 8 approximately half that obtained with the parental virus. PROSTVAC -F grows approximately as well in vitro as its non -recom binant parental fowlpox virus. Although PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F have not been directly compared to their respective non-recombinant parental viruses with respect to environmental stability, studies usi ng similar recombinant viruses (PANVAC) , which expres s expresses TRICOM together with two additional tumor -associated antigens , showed that stability of the recombinants dried or in water at various temperatures was comparable to that of their respective non -recombinant parental viruses. When stored at 25 C, both recombinant and non -recombinant viruses lost viability over a period of weeks when stored in water and over a period of days when stored dried. The most sensitive method for measuring virulence of vaccinia virus in vivo has traditionally been the i ntracranial LD 50 test in weanling mice. As measured by this neurovirulence assay, PROSTVAC -V is more attenuated that its parental non -recombinant vaccinia virus, which is in turn significantly more attenuated than the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. PROSTVAC -F is also significantly more attenuated than the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. A randomized (2:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of PROSTVAC -V/F, in which non -recombinant parental viruses were used as placebo, was recently completed (Kantoff, 2010 ). Eighty two patients in the active group and 40 patients in placebo group received drug. The safety profile was similar for the two groups, supporting the similarity between recombinant and non -recombinant viruses with respect to virulence and replicative ability. The comparison of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F with their corresponding non - recombinant parental viruses, which are derived from licensed products currently used as human and veterinary vaccines , respectively, demonstrate that PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are not more virulent, growth -advantaged, or stable in the environment. These studies indicate that the added human transgenes in these recombinant viruses have not fundamentally altered the biologic properties of the viruses. Consequentl y, no selective advantage has been conferred to PROSTVAC -V/F. iii Potential for gene transfer to other species under conditions of the proposed release of the GMO and any selective advantage or disadvantage conferred to those species. The potential for gen e transfer to other species under the proposed release of the GMO is extremely low . PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F cannot infect microbes, insects, cold -blooded vertebrates, or plant cells. The GMO will be released in a hospital examination room and is unlikel y to come in contact with other animal species. Furthermore , no dissemination of PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F outside the injection site has been shown in human s injected by the subcutaneous route . BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV 9 Recombination between or PROST VAC -F with the DNA genome of a host cell is unlikely . The pox virus life cycle is carried out in the cytoplasm (Moss , 1996); pox virus es do not integrate into the genome of the infected cell. Therefore, the risk of pox virus persistence by integration in to the host chromosome is very low . Although the human genes expressed in PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F share homology with their counterparts in the human genome , the physical segregation between host and viral genomes renders recombination between PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and the human genome an unlikely event. The frequency, already unlikely, of any such recombination events in humans or non - avian species after administration of PROSTVAC -F would be further reduced by the lack of replicative capacity of fow lpox virus in these species. Recombination between the two PROSTVAC -V/F components, PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F, is unlikely because the two viruses do not share homology, except with respect to the inserted human genes. No interviral recombination between vaccinia and fowlpox DNA has been observed (Scheiflinger, 1992 ). Furthermore, the two viruses are not expected to be in the same proximity, as vaccinations with PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F occur at different times and sites . Recombination between PROSTVAC -V or PROSTVAC -F and a wild -type vaccinia or fowlpox virus in an infected host org anism is theoretically possible. However, such recombination would not be expected to alter the virulence, grow th properties, or environmental persistence of the virus. In addition, the likelihood of recombination between PROSTVAC -V and wild type vaccinia in vivo is extremely low because vaccinia is not normally found in nature. Recombination of vaccinia virus with other pox virus es, such as orf , molluscum contagiosu m, or shope fibroma virus, has not been observed in vitro . Recombination between PROSTVAC -F and a wild or vaccine strain of fowlpox would require release of PROSTVAC -F into an environment containing poultry. Such release is highly unlikely under the propo sed conditions of release. Recombination with other viral genomes is also unlikely due to the lack of homology between different families of viruses as well as to the physical segregation between the genomes of the pox virus es and those of other viruses th at replicate in the nucleus. Additionally, i n non-avian species susceptible to infection by PROSTVAC -F, few opportunities for genetic recombination with other could occur, since the level of replication that the vector DNA undergoes in vivo is low, and li mited to cells infected by the inoculum (no generation of infectious particles). iv. Potential immediate and/or delayed environmental impact of the direct and indirect interactions between the GMO and target organisms (if applicable). For the purposes of t his release, the target organisms are the study subjects, i.e., men with asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). These study subjects will be administered treatment with the GMO as follows: BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. -V (vaccinia virus, 2 \u00d7 108 infectious units (Inf. U ) empty vector, subcutaneous: Week 1; -F virus, PSA antigen, and TRICOM) 1 109 Inf. U (boost) or empty vector , subcutaneous : Weeks 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21; GM-CSF 100 \u00b5g or placebo will be co -administered on each of the dosing days and consecutively for three days after vaccination at the vaccination site . PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are predicted to interact with the immune system of the subjects to gener ate an immune response to PSA. PROSTVAC -V, a live recombinant vaccinia virus, actively replicates in human cells, resulting in the presentation of high levels of antigen to the immune system over a period of one to two weeks, substantially increasing the p otential for immune stimulation. The immune response specific to vaccinia then eliminates the virus. Host cells infected with vaccinia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mixed form of apoptosis/ necrosis. Vaccinia replicates in the cytoplasm of i nfected cells, and viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA (Moss, 1996 ). Latent infection of humans with vaccinia virus has not been observed (Fenner, 1988 ). PROSTVAC -F is a live recombinant fowlpox virus. Productive fowlpox virus infection i s restricted in vivo to avian species and in vitro to cells derived from avian species; however, fowlpox -mediated gene expression does occur in infected non -avian cells (Taylor, 1988; Beukema, 2006 ), and a number of studies have shown that immunization of mammalian species by recombinant fowlpox virus can stimulate both humoral and cell -mediated immunity to the expressed transgene. Fowlpox vectors mediate a limited infection in human cells, with early viral and transgene expression, but late gene expressio n is blocked, and no infectious particles are produced. Virus Shedding Shedding of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F by study subjects is the primary mechanism by which these subjects would introduce the GMO into the environment. Based on a number of clinical stu dies with PROSTVAC -V/F and related vaccines, which are described in detail below, viral shedding in this population is expected to be transient and confined to the vaccination site. In addition, appropriate education of patients regarding care of the inje ction site ( including proper bandage changing, bathing, possible side effects, and minimization of contact with vulnerable populations ) will serve to minimize exposure to the environment. Patients will be provided with injection site care kits containin g instruction sheets, disposable gloves, absorbent toweling, alcohol swabs, nonadherent Telfa -type bandages, band -aids, and zip-lock biohazard bags for disposal of used bandages and gloves. The zip -lock biohazard bag containing all used supplies will be r eturned to the clinic for appropriate disposal. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 11 Shedding of both nonrecombinant and recombinant pox viruses, including vaccinia virus, fowlpox virus, and canarypox virus, have been addressed in a number of clinical studies. The data, which are presented b elow, indicate that : vaccinia viral shedding is transient and occurs at the vaccination site and rarely at other sites ; vaccinia viral shedding occurs with high frequency after scarification and with low frequency after subcutaneous vaccination, which is t he intended route of administration of PROSTVAC -V; bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site ; shedding of avipox virus after vaccination of nonavian species is confined to the vaccination site . In addition, in studies that assess both a recombi nant virus and its nonrecombinant parental virus, the incidence and amount of viral shedding are found to be comparable between the two viruses. That is, no recombinant pox virus has been shown to exhibit greater capacity for shedding relative to its nonr ecombinant parental pox virus . These results, combined with the patient precautions with respect to care of the vaccination site, indicate that any potential impact to the environment will be negligible. Vaccinia Shedding Vaccinia virus is shed from the p rimary vaccination lesion of humans and guinea pigs from approximately the third day to the end of the third week after vaccination (Cooney, 1991; Friedman, 1962 ). Limited data are available on viral shedding after vaccination of vaccinia - experienced (pre viously vaccinated) individuals , but shedding from revaccination sites seems to be shorter by about 1 week and possibly of lower titer than shedding from primary vaccination sites (Seaman, 2010 ). This finding is significant, as all study subjects are requi red to have had prior smallpox vaccination. Viral shedding is further reduced in individuals who are vaccinated by the subcutanteous route (Roberts, 1932; Henderson, 1939; Cherry, 1977; Connor, 1977 ), which is the route that will be used for the administra tion of PROSTVAC -V. That airborne or droplet spread of vaccinia virus from the respiratory tract of healthy vaccinees occurs is doubtful (Lane, 2003 ). Although the virus can be found in the bloodstream and pharynx of patients with adverse events involving vigorous viral replication and/or abnormal host defenses, particularly eczema vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia (Lane, 2003 ), epidemiologic evidence for airborne spread is scant. Consequently, a irborne infection isolation precautions are not necessary unless procedures that cause aerosolization of the virus are performed. Experience with Smallpox Vaccine \u2014Lesion Formation and Viral Shedding after Dermal Scarification A number of vaccinia viral shedding studies were published during the height of the wor ldwide smallpox eradication program in the 1960s and 1970s, and more recently as a result of anti - bioterrorism initiatives. Viral shedding after vaccination with smallpox vaccine , which is administered by dermal scarification, has been assessed either dir ectly by determining the presence of virus (Frey, 2003; Frey 2002a; Kim, 2005 ) or indirectly by observing lesion BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 12 formation as a surrogate for the presence of replicating virus (Frey, 2002, Hsieh, 2006 ) in persons vaccinated with smallpox vaccine . Lesion f ormation at the vaccination site is considered an indirect measure of viral shedding (CDC , 200 1; Lane, 2003 ). These studies showed that vaccinia viral shedding and lesion formation occur transiently at the injection site in most vaccinees after smallpox va ccination by scarification. Viral shedding at other sites, such as blood, urine, and throat, is rare and is generally associated with more virulent strains of smallpox vaccine or with complications after vaccination. In particular, no viral shedding at s ites other than the vaccination site has been demonstrated after the normal course of vaccination with the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. Dryvax and PROSTVAC -V are both derived from the same parental vaccinia virus, Wyeth/NYCBH, which is associated with the low est frequency of complications among widely used vaccinia strains ( Fenner, 1988 ). Experience with Sm allpox Vaccine -Lesion formation and Viral Shedding After Subcutaneous Vaccination In several studies, lesion formation in individuals who received the small pox vaccine by the subcutaneous route was compared to that in individuals receiving the smallpox vaccine by intradermal scarification ( Roberts, 1932; Henderson, 1939, Cherry, 1977; Conner, 1977 ). In all of these studies, subcutaneous vaccination with smal lpox vaccine results in fewer and smaller lesions relative to vaccination by scarification. Viral shedding is associated with the presence of a lesion at the vaccination site. Therefore, viral shedding is reduced after vaccination with vaccinia virus by t he subcutaneous route, the intended route of administration for PROSTVAC -V, as compared with vaccination by scarification. The s tudies described above that assessed viral shedding by direct assessment of nonrecombinant vacci nia viruses used doses lower tha n the doses used for recombinant vaccinia viruses, including PROSTVAC -V. However, the results with nonrecombinant vaccinia viruses are consistent with the results observed after vaccination at the higher doses used with recombinant vaccinia viruses (see below). Recombinant Vaccinia Viral Shedding in Humans The shedding of four recombinant vaccinia viruses that express HIV -1 envelope, human papilloma virus (HPV) E6/E7, interleukin -2 (IL -2), or MUC -1/IL-2 was evaluated in six published studies demonstrate that viral shedding profiles after vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses are similar to that observed after vaccination with nonreco mbinant vaccinia virus. Viral shedding of recombinant vaccinia virus occurs transiently at the vaccination site after scarification and has not been demonstrated to occur at other sites , including nose, throat, urine, and feces after vaccination intramusc ularly or intratumorally . Lesion formation at the vaccination site is associated with viral shedding. The frequency of viral BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 13 shedding is reduced after subcutaneous vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus. Bandaging contains the virus at the vaccinati on site. These data suggest that shedding of PROSTVAC -V is expected to occur transiently and with reduced frequency when administered subcutaneously, its intended route of administration. PROSTVAC -V and a related vaccine, designated TBC -3B, have been ass essed with respect to viral shedding in humans. These two viruses were generated using the same parental vaccinia virus, a derivative of the New York City Board of Health strain. The results are described in detail below . PROSTVAC -V A Phase 1 study of PROSTVAC -V/F was conducted in prostate cancer patients by the National Cancer Institute (Arlen, 2007 ). All patients that received PROSTVAC -V in this study were vaccinated subcutaneously with 2 x 108 pfu PROSTVAC -V. All patients were boosted four weeks late r with 1 x 109 pfu PROSTVAC -F. Several groups of patients also received GM -CSF, in the form of either recombinant human GM -CSF (rh -GM-CSF) or recombinant fowlpox expressing GM -CSF (rF -GM-CSF) at the vaccination site at the time of each vaccination. Viral s hedding and lesion formation were evaluated in four patients that had evidence of prior vaccination with vaccinia virus as smallpox vaccine. Viral shedding was assessed over a four - week period following subcutaneous vaccination with PROSTVAC -V. Injection site swabs and urine, saliva, and blood samples were taken on Day 0 (prior to vaccination), then on Days 3 or 4, 7, 14, and/or 28 or 32 post -vaccination. A total of 56 post -vaccination samples were obtained from these four patients. Each sample, including blood fractionated into serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) components, was assessed for the presence of viral DNA by PCR, using a primer that detects vaccinia and variola, but not fowlpox virus. Limits of detection were 103 pfu in injectio n site swab, 101 pfu in PBMC, 103 pfu in serum, 106 pfu in urine, and 106 pfu in saliva. The results are summarized in Table A4 -1. Seventeen of 56 post vaccination samples (30%) tested positive for vaccinia DNA. Viral DNA was detected in injection site swabs from all four patients. Viral DNA was also detected in PBMCs from three patients and in serum from two patients. No viral DNA was detected in urine and saliva samples. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 14 Table A4-1: Viral DNA in Patient Samples After Subcutaneous Vaccination with PROSTVAC -V Sample Number of Patients Positive for Viral DNA/ Number of Patients Tested Day 0 Day 3/4 Day 7 Day 14 Day 28/32 Total Urine Site 0/4 1/3 1/2 4/4 2/2 4/4 Four prostate cancer patients were vaccinated with 1 x 108 pfu PROSTVAC -V. Samples were taken prior to vaccination and at various times post -vaccination. DNA extracted from each sample was assessed with respect to the presence of vaccinia viral DNA by PCR. The presence of viral DNA does not indicate whether live virus is present. Therefore, patient samples were also assessed by plaque assay, which indicates the presence of live virus. The limit of detection in t he live virus assay was not determined. The results are summarized in Table A4 - 2. Live virus was detected in only one of the four patients. Live virus was detected at the injection site at Day 7 and Day 14 in this patient. In addition, in one PBMC sampl e from this patient at Day 3, one single plaque was detected in one out of twelve duplicate wells. Live virus was not detected at the injection site at this time point. Three other PBMC samples from this patient, taken at different time points after vacc ination, were negative. All PBMC samples from other patients were negative. No live virus was detected in any sample from any patient after Day14. Table A4-2: Live Virus in Patient Samples After Subcutaneous Vaccination with PROSTVAC -V Sample Number of P atients Positive for Live Virus/ Number of Patients Tested Day 0 Day 3 Day 7 Day 14 Day 28 Any Day Urine 0/2 1/4 Four prostate cancer patients were vaccinated with 2 x 108 pfu PROSTVAC -V. Samples were taken prior to vaccination and at various times post -vaccination. Each sample was assessed with respect to the presence of live vaccinia virus by viral pl aque assay. a One plaque was detected in one of twelve duplicate wells from one sample from one patient. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 15 Each patient was monitored with respect to injection site reactions after subcutaneous vaccination with 2 x 108 pfu PROSTVAC -V. Injection site reacti ons are listed in Table A4-3. Live viral shedding information from Table A4 -2 is included to assess the association between lesion formation and viral shedding. Only one of four patients formed a lesion (vesicle followed by eschar) after subcutaneous vac cination. Live virus was detected at the vaccination site of this patient only. Table A4 -3: Injection Site Reactions and Live Viral Shedding after Subcutaneous Vaccination with PROSTVAC -V Patient Number Vaccine Injection Site Reaction Live Virus Detected At Vaccination Site 3827069 PROSTVAC -V none No No a rF-GM-CSF expresses GM -CSF. A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of PROSTVAC -VF was recently completed (Kantoff, 2010 ). The objective of this study was to evaluate sa fety and efficacy of PROSTVAC -V/F in combination with recombinant human GM -CSF versus empty vector in combination with placebo in patients with androgen -independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The vaccine route, dosage, and schedule is comparable to t hat contemplated for the proposed release. Eighty -four patients were enrolled into the active group and 41 patients enrolled into the placebo group. Eighty -two patients in the active group and 40 patients in placebo group received drug. General disorders and administration site conditions were the most common treatment -related system organ class: 67 patients ( 81.7%) in the PROSTVAC -V/F group and 31 patients (77.5%) in the control group. The most frequently reported events were injection site -reactions, including injection site erythema, induration, pain, pruritus, swelling, and warmth. These local injection site reactions were balanced in the treatment arms, indicating that the frequency of lesion formation is comparable after vaccination with nonrecomb inant and recombinant vaccines. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. BNIT TBC-3B TBC -3B virus that co -expresses the env, gag, and pol genes from a Clade B strain of HIV -1. This candidate AIDS vaccine is based on the same parental vaccinia virus as PROSTVAC -V. Two clinic al trials of TBC -3B (BB -IND-4930) were performed by the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Unpublished viral shedding data from these studies indicate that this recombinant vaccinia virus is shed transien tly at the vaccination site after vaccination by scarification. The frequency of TBC -3B viral shedding is reduced after subcutaneous vaccination. In the first AVEG trial, TBC -3B was administered to fourteen subjects with evidence of prior smallpox (vaccin ia) vaccination (vaccinia -immune subjects). The subjects in this first trial were vaccinated with 4.19 x 109 pfu/mL TBC -3B by scarification. The vaccination sites were assessed for the presence of live vaccinia virus by plaque assay. In the second AVEG trial, TBC - 3B was administered to twenty healthy subjects with no prior history of smallpox vaccination (vaccinia -na\u00efve subjects). Subjects were vaccinated with 3.67 x 106 pfu TBC -3B either subcutaneously or by scarification. In these two trials, the vac cination sites were assessed after vaccination for the presence of live vaccinia virus by plaque assay. The outer bandage was assessed for the presence of live vaccinia in one study. The results are summarized in Table A4 -4. Shedding at the site of vacc ination was observed in most subjects that were vaccinated by scarification. In contrast, viral shedding was detected only in a small proportion of subjects after subcutaneous vaccination. All vaccinees that shed virus had lesions at the vaccination site . No virus was detected in the outer bandage, demonstrating that bandaging contained the virus at the vaccination site and effectively prevented spread of virus to the environment. Table A4 -4: Viral Shedding after Vaccination with AIDS Vaccine TBC -3B Prior Vaccination Status Route Dose Tested 106 pfu Vaccination site 3/10 Vaccinia viral shedding was assessed in two different clinical trials of TBC -3B, a vaccinia -based AIDS vaccine. The presence of live virus at the vaccination site or bandage was measured b y infection of susceptible cells. a Evidence of prior vaccination with vaccinia virus (smallpox vaccine) b Thirty -two outer bandages were cultured; number of subjects was not noted c No evidence of prior vaccination with vaccinia virus BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -301 17 Vaccinia viral shedding, lesion frequency, and lesion size at the site of vaccination were assessed in each of the twenty vaccinia -na\u00efve subjects vaccinated subcutaneously or by scarification with TBC -3B. The results are shown in Table A4 -5. Viral shedding was detected in all subjects vaccinated by scarification. In contrast, viral shedding was detected in only three of ten subjects vaccinated subcutaneously. The last day that virus was detectable at the vaccination site in these three subjects was thirteen, twenty -one, and twenty -eight days, respectively, after subcutaneous vaccination. All subjects that were vaccinated with TBC -3B by scarification had lesions. The frequency of lesions was lower after subcutaneous vaccination. Viral shedding was observed only in su bjects who had lesions at the vaccination site. Thirteen subjects vaccinated with TBC -3B that had detectable virus at the injection site also had lesions at the injection site. The four subjects who had no detectable virus at the injection site had no vi sible lesions. There were three subjects who had lesions but no detectable virus. In all three of these cases, the lesion size was quite small, 0.5 cm2. There were no instances of detectable virus in the absence of a lesion. Thus there is an associat ion between the presence of virus and the presence of visible lesions. Table A4-5: Viral Titers and Lesions at Site of Vaccination with TBC -3B Vaccination Route (N) Number of Vaccinees Lesion - Number of Vaccinees Virus Viral Tite r in All Vaccinees (log10 SD Scarification 10 10 (10) 6 3 0.84 1.81 Twenty vaccinia vaccinated with 106 pfu TBC -3B subcutaneously or by scarification. The amount of live virus in va ccination site swabs was assessed by plaque titration on susceptible cells. The difference between the maximum viral titers observed after scarification versus subcutaneous vaccination was statistically significant (p=0.001, Students unpaired t -test). a All subjects that shed virus also had lesions at the vaccination site. A limited study was performed to assess the presence of vaccinia DNA in the blood of subjects in these two clinical trials of TBC -3B. Serum samples were taken on Day 0 prior to vacc ination and on Day 56 post -vaccination. In the first trial, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) harvested from the sera of nine vaccinia -primed subjects were subjected to nested PCR analysis for vaccinia DNA. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 copies of DNA per reaction. The limit of detection was 1 copy per 2500 cells or 1 copy per 670 cells, depending on the individual sample. No vaccinia DNA was detected in any of the test sa mples from the nine subjects. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 18 Since TBC -3B contained HIV -1 DNA as well as vaccinia DNA, the blood from seventeen subjects was assessed for the presence of HIV DNA. Serum samples were taken on Day 0 prior to vaccination and on Day 56 post -vaccination. PBLs were harvested and were subjected to nested PCR analysis for HIV DNA sequences that are present in TBC -3B. The sensitivity of this assay was 100 copies of DNA per reaction. No HIV DNA was detected in any of the seventeen subjects. This confirmed the absence of TBC -3B vaccinia genomic DNA in the PBLs of these subjects. Thus, vaccinia viral DNA was not detected in PBLs on Day 56 following vaccination of vaccinia -primed subjects by scarification with a vaccinia -based vaccine. In the second clinical trial of TBC -3B, serum samples from four subjects vaccinated by each route (scarification or subcutaneous) were taken on Day 0 prior to vaccination and on Day 56 post-vaccination. PBL harvested from the sera of these eight vaccinees were subjected to nested PCR analysis for vaccinia DNA. No vaccinia DNA was detected in any of t he test samples from the eight vaccinees. In addition, the blood from eight vaccinia -na\u00efve subjects vaccinated with TBC -3B (five vaccinated by scarification and three vaccinated subcutaneously) was assessed for the presence of HIV DNA by nested PCR. Serum samples were taken on Day 0 prior to vaccination and on Day 56 post -vaccination. No HIV DNA was detected in any of the eight vaccinees. Since the same HIV DNA sequence was inserted into the genome of the recombinant vaccinia virus TBC -3B, the genomic DNA in the PBL of these vaccinees. Thus no vaccinia viral DNA was detectable in blood by Day 56 following vaccination of vaccinia -na\u00efve subjects subcutaneously or by scarification with a recombinant vaccinia -based vaccine. In summary, viral shedding studies of recombinant vaccinia virus TBC -3B demonstrated that the frequency of viral shedding was lower after subcutaneous vaccination relative to vaccination by scarification. In addition, the few subjects who shed virus after subcutaneous vaccination generally shed lower amounts of virus relative to the amount of virus shed after scarification. Conclusions -Vaccinia Shedding The studies described above demonstrate that viral shedding profiles after vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses are similar to that observed after vaccination with nonrecombinant vaccinia virus. Viral shedding of recombinant vaccinia virus occurs transiently at the vaccination site after scarification and has not been demonstrated to oc cur at other sites , including nose, throat, urine, and feces after vaccination intramuscularly or intratumorally . Lesion formation at the vaccination site is associated with viral shedding. The frequency of viral shedding is reduced after subcutaneous va ccination with recombinant vaccinia virus. Bandaging contains the virus at the vaccination site. These data suggest that shedding of PROSTVAC -V is expected to occur transiently and with reduced frequency when administered subcutaneously, its intended rou te of administration. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 19 Avipox Shedding Avipox viral shedding has not been detected in blood, saliva, urine, or rectal swabs of nonavian species after vaccination. Avipox viral shedding in humans appears to be confined to the vaccination site and is limite d due to lack of viral replication. PROSTVAC -F is a recombinant fowlpox virus. Recombinant fowlpox -based vaccines have been licensed by the USDA as veterinary vaccines against Newcastle Disease Virus and avian influenza virus. Canarypox virus is an avipo x virus related to fowlpox virus . Recombinant vaccines based on canarypox virus have been licensed by the USDA for use in cats, dogs, and horses. These vaccines include rabies, feline leukemia virus, canine distemper, and West Nile Virus. In addition, r ecombinant fowlpox and canarypox viruses are under investigation as candidate vaccines for a variety of human cancers and infectious diseases. Avipox Viral Shedding in Humans Viral shedding studies have been performed after vaccination of humans with reco mbinant canarypox viruses 2005; J. Tartaglia and I. Elias, unpublished information ). These studies are summarized below. In a clinical trial of a canarypox virus -based HIV vaccine, HIV -negative pati ents were vaccinated intramuscularly with 107.0 cell culture infectious doses (CCID 50, synonymous with TCID 50) of vaccine. Samples of blood, saliva, and urine were taken at 3, 6, and 9 hours post -vaccination and at 1, 2, 7, and 14 days post -vaccination. R ectal swabs were taken at 1, 2, 7, and 14 days post - vaccination. The samples and swabs from three vaccinees were tested for the presence of viral DNA by nested PCR and were tested for live virus by viral culture. No viral DNA or live virus was detected i n these samples. In another clinical trial of a canarypox virus -based HIV vaccine, HIV -positive patients were vaccinated intramuscularly with 107.08 CCID 50 of vaccine. Samples, including plasma, blood cells, saliva and urine, were collected from twelve patients prior to vaccination and 1, 2, and 6 hours post -vaccination. DNA was extracted from each sample and was then subjected to quantitative PCR (Q -PCR) analysis. All samples were negative for the presence of canarypox viral DNA. Limits of detection were 25 CCID 50/mL plasma, 200 CCID 50/mL blood cells, 5 -10 CCID 50/mL saliva, and 25 CCID 50/mL urine. In a clinical trial of a canarypox virus -based melanoma vaccine, melanoma patients were vaccinated subcutaneously and intradermally with 107.09 CCID 50 vacci ne. Samples of blood, saliva, urine, and injection site swabs were taken from three patients prior to vaccination and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post -vaccination. The presence of canarypox viral DNA was assessed by conventional PCR analysis. No canarypox vira l DNA was detected in the blood, plasma, saliva, and urine samples. Limits of detection were not specified. Canarypox viral DNA was detected in injection site swabs from all three patients. Patients were boosted with vaccine three weeks after BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 20 the first v accination, and vaccination site swabs were taken up to 9 hours post -vaccination. Again, canarypox viral DNA was detected in injection site swabs from all three patients. It is not clear whether live virus was shed from the vaccination site, as the prese nce of viral DNA does not indicate whether live virus is present. These studies demonstrated that recombinant avipoxviral shedding has not been detected in blood, saliva, urine, or rectal swabs after vaccination. Viral DNA has been detected at the injec tion site, but the presence of live virus was not assessed. Therefore, avipox viral shedding in humans, if it occurs, appears to be confined to the vaccination site. v. Possible immediate and/or delayed environmental impact of the direct and indirect in teractions between the GMO with non -target organisms, including impact on population levels of competitors, prey, hosts, symbionts, predators, parasites, and pathogens. Possible environmental impact and effects on human health resulting from direct and ind irect interactions between PROSTVAC -V/F and non-target humans (e.g., health care workers or contacts of vaccinees) are described in section iv, above and section vi, below. This section will address the impact of contact between PROSTVAC -V/F and non -human organisms. PROSTVAC -V Vaccinia virus can infect warm -blooded vertebrates such as mammals, rodents, and birds. Vaccinia virus is not known to infect cold -blooded vertebrates such as fish, amphibians, and reptiles ( Essbauer, 2001 ), although vaccinia has be en demonstrated to infect certain cells in tissue culture, including kidney cells from the tortoise Testudo graeca and liver cells from the lizard Lacerta viridis (Shindarov, 1965 ). Other pox virus es, not related to vaccinia virus, have been observed in s everal cold -blooded species. The appearance of pox virus -like particles has been reported in a small number of these species, such as the frog Rana temporaria , the chameleon Chamaeleo dilepsis , and several species of crocodiles. Two species of pox virus es, not including vaccinia virus, have been identified that infect reptiles ( Essbauer, 2001 ). Therefore, there is little risk to aquatic animals from any potential environmental release of vaccinia viruses such as PROSTVAC -V. Vaccinia virus has no known n atural habitat and the origins of vaccinia virus in nature and as a vaccine are unknown . However, although v accinia virus has no known natural animal reservoirs, some vaccinia strains have been isolated from domestic animals, including several strains isolated from dairy cattle throughout Brazil (Trindade 2007 ), as well as buffalo pox virus, first isolated in India and still associated with sporadic outbreaks in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Russia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Italy (Singh, 2007 ). Outbreaks are a ssociated with animal morbidity as well as infection of milkers and animal handlers. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 21 The origin of these circulating vaccinia strains remains unclear. One possibility is that vaccine strains were accidentally introduced into the environment during the sma llpox eradication program; however, at least for the Brazilian vaccinia strains, genetic variation among isolates suggests that ancestral strains existed before the beginning of the WHO smallpox eradication vaccination campaigns (Trindade, 2007 ). Thus, it is also possible that vaccinia -like viruses initially existed, undetected, in nature. The vaccine strains used in India and Brazil were different from the licensed Dryvax smallpox vaccine from which PROSTVAC -V was derived. PROSTVAC -V does not exhibit any known phenotypic changes (e.g., changes in virulence or growth advantage) that would increase its risk to the environment relative to its nonrecombinant parental pox virus . Indeed, PROSTVAC -V is more attenuated that its parental non -recombinant vaccinia virus, which is in turn significantly more attenuated than the licensed Dryvax smallpox vaccine. Thus, the likelihood that PROSTVAC -V would result in the establishment and persistence of vaccinia virus in wild or domestic animals is remote. The extent of exposure to non -target species is expected to be limited by the fact that vaccine administration occurs in a clinical site under controlled conditions. The administration of PROSTVAC -V via the subcutaneous route, the use of bandaging, which contains virus at the vaccination site, and comprehensive education of healthcare providers and patients all serve to minimize exposure to non -target species. Although the potential exists for secondary transmission of the virus to non -target organisms, multiple studie s indicate that transmission to non-target organisms, either human -to-animal or animal -to-animal, is unlikely except perhaps in the case of transmission of vaccinated or infected animal handlers to cattle. Potential contact transmission in animals has been studied with the recombinant vaccinia virus - based rabies vaccine, Raboral V -RG. In one study ( Brochier, 1988 vaccinated orally with 107.2 pfu Raboral V -RG were kept in close contact with unvaccinated animals. No contact control seroconverted or s howed other evidence of contact transmission. In another study (Blancou, 1986 ), eight foxes were penned in pairs. One animal from each pair was administered 108 pfu orally. Serum samples were collected from all animals at Days 14 and 28. All animals were challenged with live rabies at Day 28. All four vaccinated animals had high titers of rabies - neutralizing antibodies and resisted challenge with live rabies. Three of four control contacts had no detectable anti -rabies antibodies and succumbed to rabi es challenge. One contact control was positive for antibodies and resisted challenge. Biting behavior had been observed within a few minutes of oral vaccination and was likely the cause of this transmission event. Contact transmission of Raboral V -RG was assessed in five raccoons housed with non - vaccinated contact controls. Transmission of vaccinia virus was assessed by the presence of anti - vaccinia neutralizing antibodies and survival after challenge with a lethal dose of rabies virus. Two of the fi ve contact controls showed evidence of contact transmission of V -RG. These two raccoons, housed with vaccinated raccoons of the opposite gender, developed low titers of anti -BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 22 vaccinia neutralizing antibodies and were protected against challenge with rabies virus. Three males housed with vaccinated male raccoons did not develop detectable neutralizing antibodies against vaccinia and were not protected against challenge with rabies virus. Contact transmission studies were also performed in badgers, ferrets, dogs, cats, mice, and cattle. No evidence of contact transmission of V -RG was observed in these species. Raboral V -RG was issued a conditional USDA license in 1995 and was fully licensed in 1997. Raboral V -RG is placed in baits that are then distributed b y air or by hand into wildlife areas. Over 40 million doses (108 pfu per dose) have been distributed since 1995. This represents an extremely large viral burden on the environment (>1015 pfu), much greater than any potential amount of PROSTVAC -V that wou ld be introduced under conditions of the proposed release . One study evaluating potential contact transmission of recombinant vaccinia virus after subcutaneous vaccination of animals has been reported ( Holt, 2002 ). No contact transmission was observed. Twelve guinea pigs were vaccinated subcutaneously in the neck three times at monthly intervals with 107 pfu of a recombinant vaccinia virus, Connaught strain, expressing Ebola virus protein. Thirty -six control guinea pigs, injected with buffer instead of v accinia virus, were co -housed in the same room as the vaccinia -vaccinated animals: twelve in the same cages as the vaccinated animals (two vaccinated and two unvaccinated animals per cage), twelve in the cages below the vaccinated animals, and twelve in a rack across the room, near the air exhaust vent, to assess potential airborne transmission. Blood was taken three weeks following the final vaccination to evaluate seroconversion to vaccinia virus. Eleven of the twelve vaccinated animals seroconverted t o vaccinia virus (the vaccinated animal that did not seroconvert had received only one vaccination due to technical issues). The thirty -six unvaccinated animals were negative for the presence of antibodies against vaccinia virus. Thus, there was no evide nce of transmission of vaccinia virus from vaccinees to contact controls after subcutaneous vaccination in this study. PROSTVAC -F PROSTVAC -F from an attenuated veterinary fowlpox vaccine, POXVAC -TC, which is used by the poultry industry to prot ect chickens from infection with pathogenic fowlpox virus. No untoward effects on the environment, other bird species, or animal handlers have been reported from the use of POXVAC -TC. Recombinant fowlpox viruses are currently licensed by the USDA to vacc inate poultry against avian influenza and Newcastle disease. Over two billion doses of recombinant fowlpox virus - based influenza vaccine have been used in Mexico and Central America, with no reported adverse reactions ( Bublot, 2006 ). BN ImmunoTherapeutics, BNIT -PRV -301 23 Fowlpox virus has n ot been reported to replicate in nonavian species. The probability of PROSTVAC -F spreading to non -target organisms is, therefore, very low. In the unlikely event of viral transmission, no clinical disease is expected in the non -target organism. Transmis sion of fowlpox virus is likely to be maximal among poultry, as fowlpox virus replicates in certain avian species. Limited transmission of a vaccine strain of fowlpox virus among chickens, a permissive host for fowlpox virus, has been reported ( McMillen, 1994 ). Chicks were vaccinated by wing -web stab and by scarification with 2 x 104 effective infectious doses (EID 50) of recombinant fowlpox virus that expresses the HN and F proteins from Newcastle Disease Virus (FPV -NDV) or with the parental fowlpox vacci ne virus (FPV -001) used to generate the recombinant virus. Unvaccinated contact controls were co -housed with the vaccinated chicks. In one experiment, vaccinated and unvaccinated chicks were challenged with pathogenic fowlpox virus three weeks after vacc ination. In a second experiment, half the vaccinated and unvaccinated chicks were challenged with pathogenic fowlpox virus five weeks after vaccination, and the other half were challenged with pathogenic NDV five weeks after vaccination. All chicks were examined for fowlpox lesions or clinical signs of NDV. All vaccinated animals were protected against challenge with pathogenic fowlpox virus; that is, none developed fowlpox lesions. Most chicks that had been vaccinated with FPV -NDV were protected against challenge with NDV. None of the contact controls were protected against challenge with NDV. A small number of contact controls were protected against challenge with fowlpox virus, indicating contact transmission occurred in a minority of the chicks, a s pecies in which fowlpox virus readily replicates. The low level of contact transmission that occurred was not sufficient to confer protection against challenge with NDV. The ability of the vaccine strain and the recombinant fowlpox virus to infect other a vian species was evaluated. Lesion formation was observed in turkeys but not in quail after inoculation with fowlpox virus. Both parental and recombinant fowlpox virus could be isolated from injection sites of turkeys but not from quail ( McMillen, 1994 ). Fowlpox replication occurs in chickens, turkeys, and pigeons, but not ducks or canaries ( Tripathy, 1984 ). Therefore, fowlpox virus replicates productively in some but not all avian species, further limiting potential transmission of virus. vi. Possible immediate and/or delayed effects on human health resulting from potential direct and indirect interactions of the GMO and persons working with, coming into direct contact with or in the vicinity of the GMO release(s). Persons working with, coming into dire ct contact with, or in the vicinity of, the GMO release include (1) study subjects, to whom the GMO will be administered; (2) their close or household contacts; (3) healthcare providers. The possible immediate and/or delayed effects on human health result ing from potential direct and indirect interactions with the GMO, as well as the precautions taken to minimize the incidence of adverse effects, are described below. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT Clinical Experience PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are products of more than 15 years of poxvir al vaccine development and evaluation by the NCI , the former Therion Corporation and BN-ImmunoTherapeutics (BNIT) . Since 1991, ten recombinant vaccinia -based vaccines and eight recombina nt fowlpox -based vaccines produced by Therion for the treatment of va rious cancers have been evaluated in human clinical trials sponsored by the NCI. Over 1,000 cancer patients, most with metastatic disease, have been treated to date with these various pox virus - based vaccines in NCI -sponsored or Therion -sponsored clinical trials. Clinical evaluations of early versions of PSA -containing poxviral vectors involved over 250 patients. The initial constructs tested were vaccinia -PSA, in three Phase 1 studies totaling Sanda, 1999; Eder, 2000; Gully, 2002 ). Later, a boost regimen was devised with boosting with fowlpox -PSA containing vectors, in two studies, one with 64 patients ( Kaufman, 2004 ) and another unpublished study of approximately 16 patients. The NCI subsequently began a series of trials using additi onal admixed vectors encoding a single costimulatory molecule (B7.1/CD80). involved 94 patients ( Gully, 2005; Arlen, 2005; Madan, 2008 ). No significant safety issues were identified in these early studies. Therion conducted two clinical st udies with PROSTVAC -V/F, the product to be administered in the proposed Phas e 3 trial F: P1 -4, a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of PROSTVAC -V/FF in -002, a randomized, placebo - controlled Phas e 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC cancer (Kantoff, 2010 ). Therion completed the Phase 2 study through approximately six mont hs of follow -up. Additional long term follow -up has been completed by BNIT. In 2003, the NCI initiated its own investigations of PROSTVAC -V/FF alone and in combination with other therapies under NCI BB -IND 10915. To date, the NCI has conducted two Phas e 1 studies, one Phase 1/2 study and three Phase 2 studies in the United States. These six studies, of which one has been completed, three are fully enrolled and two are open, have treated 188 patients with PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F. The most common AEs related to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F observed to date have been injection site reactions, all of which were Grade 2 severity and resolved without sequelae. Typical AEs historically seen with intradermal administration (scarification) of vaccinia virus vaccines (vesicles, pustules, and scaring) have not been observed with PROSTVAC -V. This may reflect the fact that PROSTVAC -V is administered subcutaneously. The most common systemic AEs attributed to PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F administration were fatigue, nausea/vomiting, fever, chills, arthralgia and dizziness. There have been two SAEs thought to be possibly due to the PROSTVAC -V/FF treatment; both of occurred in the same patient. This BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 thrombotic thr ombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and was discontinued from the study. Laboratory evaluations likewise did not reveal any untoward effects of treatment. No vaccinia - related complications were noted. Overall, based on clinical information available today, recombinant poxviral vaccines present a very good safety profile. Potential Toxicities of PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F Adverse Reactions associated with smallpox vaccinia vaccinations Vaccinia virus causes a transient infection, with elimination of viral compone nts over several weeks. Host cells infected with vaccinia virus are short lived (days) and die by a mixed form of apoptosis/necrosis. Vaccinia replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and viral DNA does not integrate into the host cell DNA. Vaccin ia virus is known to be shed from the wound site in traditional dermal scarification based vaccination. The use of vaccinia virus for worldwide eradication of smallpox provides a safety database with the number of observations in the millions. Geographi cal differences in strains of vaccinia virus used as well as differences in reporting practices, diagnostic and follow -up criteria between countries , are a cause of some discrepancies in the incidences of adverse events reported, but the overall picture of vaccinia virus safety is very well known. An additional set of data is provided by recent vaccination campaign of military and civilian vaccinations in the US. A number of events post vaccination are expected and considered to be normal: fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, chills, nausea, soreness and erythema at the vaccination site, local lymphadenopathy. Satellite lesions around the vaccination site have been reported as well as local edema. These symptoms are self -limiting, last for around three week s after vaccination and rarely are a cause for serious concern ( Frey, 2002; Fulginiti, 2003 ). Mild adverse reactions that can occur post vaccination are bacterial superinfection of vaccination site, erythema multiforme and generalized vaccinia. Superinfe ction is a rare event with incidence from 0.14 to 55 cases per million according to different reports ( Vellozzi, 2004 ). Erythema multiforme (EM) most often presents as papules, plaques or urti caria which may be symmetrical and may inv olve palms and soles. EM resolves spontaneously and requires no special care. A development of Stevens -Johnson syndrome with mucosal involvement is extremely rare, with only one case noted in the 2003 -2004 vaccination campaign in the US (<1 per 1,000,000) ( Fulginiti, 2003; Neff, 2008 ). Generalized vaccinia results from viremic spread of vaccinia virus from the vaccination site. It presents as generalized rash which behaves like the vaccination site lesion, progressing through papular, vesicular, pustular a nd scab -forming stag es. The incidence is difficult to assess, since historically there was no strict definition to distinguish generalized vaccinia from other BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 26 conditions where rash is a dominant symptom (severe chickenpox, smallpox, eczema vaccinatum, EM). Retrospective ana lysis of 2002 - 2004 vaccinations suggests an incidence of ~50 cases per 1,000, 000 ( Bryant -Genevier, 2006 ). The rash appears within a week after vaccination and resolves within a week. Most instances do not require specific therapy (Fulginiti, 2003 ). Some of the post -vaccinia adverse events, although very rare, are serious and potentially life - threatening. They include progressive the most serious complication known. It wa s almost always fatal prior to the introduction of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). PV occurs predominantly in persons with T -cell deficiencies or receiving treatments that result in T -cell deficiencies. The primary vaccination site fails to heal, viremic spread of vaccinia leads to generalized appearance of new lesions without response extremely rare; historical incidence is in the order of 1 case per 1 ,000,000. There were no reports of PV in the military and civilian vaccines in 2002 - 2004 vaccination campaigns ( Neff, 2008 ). EV manifests as rash (popular, vesicular, pust ular, erosive) that can be localized or generalized and predominantly occurs in the areas that have been affected by les ions of atopic dermatis or other eczematous skin condition. Historically it occurr ed at a rate of ~ 1 case per 25, 000 vaccinations. EV can occur in a vaccine recipient as well as in susceptible individuals in close contact. Two cases of EV from transmis sion have been recently reported; both in children of recently vaccinated US military personnel ( Lederman, 2009 ; Vora, 2008 ). In the military vaccination program in the US there were no reports of EV among 450,239 vaccinees, probably due to careful screen ing for contraindications (Grabenstein, 2003 ). Review of civilian vaccinations did not any cases of EV ( Velozzi, 2005 ). EV can be prevented by thorough screening of at -risk individuals and education on importance of avoiding contacts with such persons and proper hygiene. PVE historical case -fatality rate is 25%. The historical (1963 - 1968) reported frequency of PVE in United States was reported at 2.9 cases per 1,000,000 vaccinations. PVE has higher prevalence and mortality rate in children com pared to adults. Higher historical rates were reported in Europe compared to US. Variability is attributed to differences in case definitions, clinical evaluations and differences in vaccine strains used by different countries ( Sejvar, 2005 ). Pathogenes is is still under investigation, although several compelling theories focus on autoimmune mechanism. Aside from vaccinia, measles and rabies vaccines have known association with PVE, as well as other viral and bacterial infections ( Bennet to, 2004 ; Menge, 2007 ). Review of 2002 - 2004 vaccinations in US reported 3 cases of PVE for the rate of 5 per 1,000, 000. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 27 Recent vaccination campaign s in the US revealed a higher than historically observed incidence of myopericarditis in vaccinees. Predominant symptoms w ere chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue, typically mild and transient. Among military contingent, 88% of cases occurred in men with the incidence of 16.11 per 100,000 for primary vaccines and 2.07 per 100,000 in revaccinees ( Arness, 2004 ). In civ ilian population s, women accounted for 67% of cases and the majority of events (86%) were reported in revaccinees ( Casey, 2005 ; Sniadack, 2008 ). Variability between the two sets of data may be explained by differences in demographics of vaccinees, case de tection, ascertainment and reporting practices ( Morgan, 2008 ). Myopericarditis has been long associated with a number of viral infections, although there are very few reports of confirmed viremia. A few cases of myopericarditis have been reported followi ng DTP and de Meester, 2000 ; Boccara, 2001 ). It is currently assumed that injury to the heart post viral infection is more of an immune inflammatory reaction than direct nature ( Cassimatis, 2004 ; Feldman, 2000 ). Serious adverse rea ctions known to be associated with traditional smallpox vaccinations have not been observed in prior clinical studies of PROSTVAC -V or other vaccinia -based vaccines. The risk of these rare events is thought to be further reduced for PROSTVAC -V due to the use of attenuated strain of vaccinia. Review of data from 2002 - 2004 vaccinations in US reported ~ 1 case of autoinoculation per 6,500 vaccinations with 17% of ocular cases, none with corneal involvement ( Neff, 2008 ). Vaccinia keratitis is the most serio us con sequence of autoinoculation, since lesions on the cornea threaten eyesight. Diseased or injured conjunctiva and cornea may increase the risk of this complication. Vaccinia keratitis will respond to treatment with topical antiviral agents and interf eron, and can be prevented with use of occlusive bandages over scarification site and patient education ( Fulginiti, 2003 ). Vaccinia Shedding and Secondary Transmission Transmission of vaccinia to close contacts is another known complication. Vaccinia viru s is shed from the vaccination lesion of vaccinees; transmission of vaccinia virus is rare but does occur. Contact vaccinia may manifest as PV, EV or accidental infection of the eye, mouth, or genital areas. Review of several national and state surveys b etween 1962 and 1968 gives a frequency for EV at 8 - 27 per 1, 000,000, and for accide ntal infections at 3 - 44 per 1, 000,000 (Neff, 2002 ). The rate of contac t vaccinia in 2002 - 2004 was < 10 cases per 100,000. Education of vaccinees in proper care for th e vaccination site, proper hand hygiene , and avoidance of contact with at -risk individuals seems to be a reasonable and effective prophylactic against accidental contact with vaccinia. Recombinant vaccines based on the same parental virus as that used for PROSTVAC -V have been tested in clinical trials for over a decade. Hundreds of volunteers have been vaccinated by various routes including scarification, intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 28 administration. Doses have ranged up to 2 x 109 pfu. No evidence of contact transmission of these vaccinia virus -based vaccines has been noted in any clinical trial to date. Safety of Fowlpox Vaccination Fowlpox virus is a member of the genus Avipox, which is evolutionarily divergent from v accinia virus and se rologically non -crossreactive (Taylor, 1988 ; Beukema, 2006 ). Immune responses to vaccinia do not block infection and immunization with fowlpox -based vectors. Hence vaccinia - primed immune responses can be boosted with fowlpox vectors. In addition, fowlpo x vectors do not replicate in human cells (only in avian cells), and are therefore much less of a safety risk than vaccinia -based vectors. Fowlpox vectors mediate a limited infection in human cells, with early viral and transgene expression, but late gene expression is blocked, and no infectious particles are produced. Thus minimal viral surface antigen is made, and minimal neutralizing antibody immune responses are induced. This enables multiple boosting with the fowlpox -based vectors. Fowlpox virus h as been investigated and used in vaccine design for at least two decades. As with vaccinia virus, it offers the advantages of a large genome but provides an additional safety assurance by not be ing able to replicate in mammalian cells. Fowlpox virus -based vaccines (HIV, malaria, cancer) have been tested in both animals and humans. No safety concerns have been raised and the adverse events associated with the use of fowlpox vectors have been limited to mild injection site reactions ( Beukema, 2006 ; Essaj ee, 2004 ; Webster , 2006 ). No evidence of transmission of fowlpox virus has been noted in any clinical trial to date. As fowlpox virus is replication -defective in humans, transmission of PROSTVAC -F in humans is an unlikely event. Procedural Controls Precaut ions and Contraindications for Study Patients Following the priming vaccination with PROSTVAC -V, the vaccination site will be covered by a sterile non -adherent dressing ( e.g., Telfa pads), and patients should receive instructions regarding dressing care, p roper hands hygiene, bathing, etc. All vaccine vials, applicators, and patient bandages or dressings removed from the vaccination site should be disposed of in appropriate biohazard containers. PROSTVAC -V will not be administered if any of the following a pplies to either the patient or the patient's close household contacts for at least three weeks after the PROSTVAC -V vaccination: persons with active or a history of eczema or other eczematoid skin disorders; those with other acute, chronic or exfoliative skin conditions ( e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, severe acne or other open rashes or wounds) until condition resolves; pregnant or nursing women; children less than one year of age; and immunodeficient or immunosuppressed persons (by disease or t herapy), including those with HIV infection. Close household contacts are those who share housing or have close physical contact. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 29 Due to information recently issued by the CDC on cardiac events observed in the current smallpox vaccination program, patient s with significant cardiovascular abnormalities or diseases will be excluded from treatment. Because PROSTVAC -V and PROSTVAC -F are manufactured in chicken embryo cells, patients with hypersensitivity to eggs will be excluded from treatment. In addition, t here should be no history of allergy or untoward reaction to prior vaccinia (smallpox) vaccination in patients receiving PROSTVAC -V. Vaccinia -Related Precautions for Healthcare Workers The risk of transmission of recombinant viruses to exposed healthcare w orkers is very low. There have been no cases of transmission to healthcare personnel in any of the studies with PROSTVAC -V or related vaccinia -based vaccines. As reported for the handling of vaccinia strains found in smallpox vaccines, if appropriate infe ction -control precautions are observed, healthcare workers are probably at less risk of infection than laboratory workers because of the smaller volume of lower titer of virus in clinical specimens as compared with laboratory material (Garner, 1983 ; Bolyar d, 1998 ). Healthcare workers who are pregnant, have exfoliative skin conditions, or are immunocompromised should avoid exposure to contaminated dressings or to the inoculation site. Safe Handling of Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccines Special consideration mu st be given to the nature of the initial vaccine: a recombinant replicating vaccinia virus. Patient instruction materials will include detailed descriptions for bandaging, bathing, and reporting any possible side effects. Patients will also be educated r egarding restrictions on contact with certain classes of individuals (children under the age of 12 months, pregnant or lactating women, immunocompromised individuals). Procedures for preparation of the vaccine are described in the clinical protocol. PROSTV AC-V is classified as group 2 biological agent according to the European Economic Community (EEC) classification for the protection of workers with biological agents {Directive 2000/54/EC}. Study staff will be provided specific instructions for storage, u se, and destruction of these materials. All patients will be dosed with the vaccines in the clinic or hospital setting according to local regulations. PROSTVAC -V is aseptically vialed at low volume in a sealed vaccine vial. Loading of syringes may be pe rformed using standard aseptic methods in a clinical pharmacy. Routine, standard universal precautions are recommended when directly handling the vaccine vials, including the wearing of a lab coat, eye protection, and gloves. There is no need to sequeste r patients after dosing. Vials and needles and syringes may be disposed of as for infectious medical waste according to local regulations. BN ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. 09 September 2011 Protocol BNIT -PRV -301 30 PROSTVAC -F virus is classified as a Biosafety Level 1 organism for practices involving biological materials and cont ainment facilities (as defined by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria). Because is cannot replicate in mammalian cells, no special precautions beyond standard, universal precautions for infectio us materials are required. There are no patient restrictions with respect to activities (such as bathing), personal contact, or bandaging required for vaccination with PROSTVAC -F. Treatment of Vaccinia Complications For some very rare complications of vac cinia infection (see end page 25/beginning page 26) , early administration of vaccinia immune globulin ( VIG) is advised. Recognition of clinical symptoms compatible with eczema vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, and some cases o f auto -inoculation should prompt consideration of VIG therapy. The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to be time -dependent. VIG is of no benefit in the treatment of post -vaccinial encephalitis, and is contraindicated for the treatment of vaccinial kera titis. VIG is available in United States through CDC and in several other countries through appropriate health authorities. Despite the very low risk for any complication requiring VIG administration, BNIT is working on securing a supply of VIG for the c ountries wher e it is not available internally . Although there is no recognized alternative to VIG in treating severe complications resulting from vaccinia vaccination, in vitro and animal model data in several poxvirus infections models demonstrate the ac tivity of cidofovir at clinically relevant doses. Subjects who experience severe vaccinia complications may be treated with cidofovir. Treatment with cidofovir will be recommended primarily after clinical failure following treatment with vaccinia immune globulin. Vistide\u00ae is generally available through hospital pharmacies. vii.
