But, according to researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), it's one that can be influenced by a simple shifting of attention toward the healthy side of life. And that shift may provide strategies to help us all make healthier choices \u2014not just i n terms of the foods we eat, but in other areas, like whether or not we pick up a cigarette. 07/29/11 Caltech Researchers Increase the Potency of HIV -Battling Proteins When it comes to a small HI V-fighting protein, called cyanovirin-N, Caltech researchers have found that two are better than one. Stephen Mayo 08/16/11 HIV Havens: Caltech Researchers Find New Clues About How HIV Reservoirs May Form Much like cities organize contingency plans and supplies for emergencies, chronic infectious diseases like HIV form reservoirs that ensure their survival in adverse conditions. But these reservoirs \u2014small populations of viruses or bacteria of a specific type that persist despite attack by the immune system or drug treatment \u2014are not always well understood. Now, however, researchers at Caltech believe they have begun to decode how a reservoir of infection can persist in HIV -positive populations. Davi d Baltimore 09/01/11 Caltech Team Says Sporulation May Have Given Rise to the Bacterial Outer Membrane Bacteria can generally be divided into two classes: those with just one membrane and those with two. Now researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have used a powerful imaging technique to find what they believe may be the missing link between the two classes, as well as a plausible explanation for how the outer membrane may have arisen. Grant Jensen 09/08/11 Caltech Group Applies New Techniques and Sees Surprises in Cell Division Caltech researchers have obtained the first high -resolution, three -dimensional ima ges of a cell with a nucleus undergoing cell division. The observations, made using a powerful imaging technique in combination with a new method for slicing cell samples, indicate that one of the characteristic steps of mitosis is significantly different in some cells. Grant Jensen 09/09/11 Captivated by Critters: Humans Are Wired to Respond to Animals Some people feel compelled to pet every furry animal they see on the street, while others jump at the mere sight of a shark or snake on the television screen. No matter what your response is to animals, it may be thanks to a specific part of your brain that is hardwired to rapidly detect creatures of the nonhuman kind. In fact, researchers from Cal tech and UCLA report that neurons throughout the amygdala \u2014a center in the brain known for processing emotional reactions \u2014 respond preferentially to images of animals. Ralph Adolphs and Christof Koch 09/21/11 Four Caltech Researchers Given NIH Director's Awards Four members of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) faculty \u2014William Clemons Jr., assistant professor of biochemistry; Thanos Siapas, professor of computation and neural systems; Long Cai, assistant professor of chemistry; and Lea Goentoro, assistant professor of biology \u2014have been named among the researchers being given National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Awards. Thanos Siapas and Lea Goentoro 6PRESS RELEASES 2012 09/26/11 Caltech Neuroscientists Record Novel Responses to Faces from Single Neurons in Humans Responding to faces is a critical tool for social interactions between humans. Without the ability to read faces and their expressions, it would be hard to tell friends from strangers upon first glance, let alone a sad person from a happy one. Now, neuroscientists from Caltech, with the help of collaborators at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and Cedars -Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, have discovered a novel response to human faces by looking at recordings from brain cells in neurosurgical patients. Ralph Adolphs 10/03/11 Caltech Engineers Build Smart Pet ri Dish The cameras in our cell phones have dramatically changed the way we share the special moments in our lives, making photographs instantly available to friends and family. Now, the imaging sensor chips that form the heart of these built - in cameras are helping engineers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) transform the way cell cultures are imaged by serving as the platform for a \"smart\" petri dish. Michael Elowitz 10/05/11 Caltech Named World's Top University in New Times Higher Education Global Ranking Caltech has been rated the world's number one university in the 2011- 2012 Times Higher Education global ranking of the top 200 universities, displacing Harvard University from the top spot for the first time in the survey's eight- year history. 10/10/11 Caltech Neuroscientists Pinpoint Specific Social Difficulties in People with Autism Researchers from Caltech have isolated a very specific difference in how high -functioning people with autism think about other people, finding that \u2014in actuality \u2014they don't tend to think about what others think of them at all. Ralph Adolphs 10/19/11 Bridging the Gap Like a bridge that spans a river to connect two major metropolises, the corpus callosum is the main conduit for information flowing between the left and right hemispheres of our brains. Now, neuroscientists at Caltech have found that people who are born without that link \u2014a condition called agenesis of the corpus callosum, or AgCC \u2014still show remarkably normal communication across the gap between the two halves of their brains. Ralph Adolphs 10/27/11 Building Better HIV Antibodies Using highly potent antibodies isolated from HIV -positive people, researchers have recently begun to identify ways to broadly neutralize the many possible subtypes of HIV. Now, a team led by biologists at Caltech has built upon one of these naturally occurring antibodies to create a stronger version they believe is a better candidate for clinical applications. Pamela Bjorkman 11/01/11 Switching Senses Many meat -eating animals have unique ways of hunting down a meal using their senses. To find a tasty treat, bats use echolocation, snakes rely on infrared vision, and owls take advantage of the concave feathers on their faces, the better to help them hear possible prey. Leeches have not just one but two distinct ways of detecting dinner, and, according to new findings from biologists at Caltech, their preferred method changes as they age. Daniel Wagenaar - Broad Senior Research Fellow 7PRESS RELEASES 2012 11/02/11 Caltech Researchers Find Pulsating Response to Stress in Bacteria Turning on the heater is a reasonable response to a cold environment: switch to a toastier state until it warm s up outside. Biologists have long thought cells would respond to their environment in a similar way. But now researchers at Caltech are finding that cells can respond using a new kind of pulsating mechanism. The principles behind this process are surprisi ngly simple, the researchers say, and could drive other cellular processes, revealing more about how the cells\u2014and ultimately life \u2014work Michael Elowitz 11/23/11 Caltech Scientists Point to Link between Missing Synapse Protein and Abnormal Behaviors Although many mental illnesses are uniquely human, animals sometimes exhibit abnormal behaviors similar to those seen in humans with psychological disorders. Such behaviors are called endophenotypes. No w, Caltech researchers have found that mice lacking a gene that encodes a particular protein found in the synapses of the brain display a number of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Mary Kennedy 11/30/11 Biologists Deliver Neutralizing Antibodies that Protect Against HIV Infection in Mice Over the past year, researchers at Caltech, and around the world, have been studying a group of potent antibodies that have the ability to neutralize HIV in the lab; their hope is that they may learn how to create a vaccine that makes antibodies with similar properties. Now, biologists at Caltech led by Nobel Laureate David Baltimore have taken one step closer to that goal: they have developed a way to deliver these antibodies to mice and, in so doing, have effectively protected them from HIV infection. David Baltimore 01/12/12 Worm Seeks Worm: Caltech Researchers Find Chemical Cues Driving Aggregation in Nematodes Scientists have long seen evidence of social behavior among many species of animals. Dolphins frolic together, lions live in packs, and hornets construct nests that can house a large number of the insects. And, right under our feet, it appears that roundworms are having their own little gatherings in the soil. Until recently, it was unknown how the worms communicate to one another when it's time to come together. Now, however, researchers from Caltech hav e identified, for the first time, the chemical signals that promote aggregation. Paul Sternberg 01/25/12 Making Sense of Sensory Connections A key feature of human and animal brains is that they are adaptive; they are able to change their structure and function based on input from the environment and on the potential associations, or consequences, of that input. To learn more about such neural adaptability, researchers at Caltech have explored the brains of insects and identified a mechanism by which the connections in their brain change to form new and specific memories of smells. Stijn Cassenaer Broad Senior Research Fellow 02/08/12 Caltech Researchers Develop Gene Therapy to Boost Brain Repair for Demyelinating Diseases Our bodies are full of tiny superheroes \u2014antibodies that fight foreign invaders, cells that regenerate, and structures that ensure our systems run smoothly. One such str ucture is myelin, a material that forms a protective cape around the axons of our nerve cells so that they can send signals quickly and efficiently. But myelin becomes damaged in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, leaving neurons without their sheaths. Researchers from Caltech now believe they have found a way to help the brain replace damaged myelin. Paul Patterson 8PRESS RELEASES 2012 02/17/12 Moore Foundation Gives Caltech $6 Million for Chemistry of Ce llular Signaling Center With $6 million of funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Caltech has established the Chemistry of Cellular Signaling Center. The new center will build on the Institute's successes at the interface of chemistry and biology, and will focus on determining how complex systems of molecules interact to create the pathways that regulate the lives of cells and allow them to respond to their environments. 02/27/12 Some Bacteria Attack Using Spring -loaded Poison Daggers Bacteria have evolved different systems for secreting proteins. One, called a type VI secretion system, is found in about a quarter of all bacteria with two membranes. Despite being common, researchers have not understood how it works. Now a team, co -led by researchers at Caltech, has figured out the structure of the type VI secretion system apparatus and proposed how it might work\u2014by shooting spring -loaded poison molecular daggers. Grant Jensen 03/08/12 Do You Hear What I Hear? In both animals and humans, vocal signals used for communication contain a wide array of different sounds that are determined by the vibrational frequencies of vocal cords. Knowing how the brain sorts out these different frequencies \u2014which are called frequency -modulated (FM) sweeps \u2014is believed to be essential to understanding many hearing -related behaviors, like speech. Now, a pair of biologists at Caltech has identified h ow and where the brain processes this type of sound signal. Guangying Wu Broad Senior Research Fellow 04/12/12 Determining a Stem Cell's Fate What happens to a stem cell at the molecular level that causes it to become one type of cell rather than another? In studies that mark a major step forward in our understanding of stem cells' fates, a team of Caltech researchers has traced the stepwise developmental process that ensures certain stem cells will become T cells \u2014cells of the immune system that help destroy invading pathogens Ellen Rothenberg 04/13/12 Decoding Worm Lingo All animals seem to have ways of exchanging information\u2014monkeys voc alize complex messages, ants create scent trails to food, and fireflies light up their bellies to attract mates. Yet, despite the fact that nematodes, or roundworms, are among the most abundant animals on the planet, little is known about the way they netw ork. Now, research led by California Institute of Technology (Caltech) biologists has shown that a wide range of nematodes communicate using a recently discovered class of chemical cues. Paul Sternberg 06/04/12 Hands -On Research A nuzzle of the neck, a stroke of the wrist, a brush of the knee\u2014these caresses often signal a loving touch, but can also feel highly aversive, depending on who is delivering the touch, and to whom. Interested in how the brain makes connections between touch and emotion, neuroscientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered that the association begins in the brain's primary somatosensory cortex, a region that, until now, was thought only to re spond to basic touch, not to its emotional quality. Ralph Adolphs 9NEW BIOLOGY FACULTY MEMBERS 2012 Assistant Professor, Viviana Gradinaru discovered her passion for neuroscience at Caltech, her alma mater, where she was accepted as a transfer student from University of Physics, Romania, with a full scholarship. Viviana did her Ph.D. work with Karl Deisseroth at Stanford University and she played an instrumental role in the early development and applications of optogenetics, a research area concerned with the perturbation of neuronal activity via light-controlled ion channels and pumps. During her doctoral and postdoctoral studies Viviana developed optogenetic tools, molecular and hardware, many of which are being used today by the neuroscience community and helped disseminate the technology by training students in the OIL (Optogenetics Initiative Laboratory at Stanford) and during summer courses at Cold Spring Harbor. For her thesis, Viviana collaborated with Jaimie Henderson (Stanford Neurosurgery) on a project that used optogenetics to look at the mechanisms for Deep Brain Stimulation in a rodent model of Parkinson's; her work emphasized the importance of axonal stimulation for modulating brain- wide activity and behavior. In her own lab at Caltech, Viviana plans to look into the generalized role that axonal stimulation could play into DBS -targeted disorders such as Parkinson's and depression and the underlying mechanism of action. In addition, the Gradinaru Lab at Caltech will continue to push forward optogenetic technologies by developing tools for electrical and biochemical control and localizing them to subcellular compartments. To achieve the goals of neuronal circuits investigation and tool development for neuroscience the Gradinaru lab will use advanced Molecular and Synthetic Biology ; Electrophysiology ( in vitro and in vivo ); Rodent Surgery and Behavior; Imaging (2 -photon) and Optogenetics (gene delivery of photosensitive proteins to specific cell types). The lab will be a great fit for any interdisciplinary -minded person. Professor Markus Meister comes to the Biology Division at Caltech from Harvard University, where he held the Jeff C. Tarr Chair in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Markus was born near Munich, Germany in 1960, spent much of his youth in Italy, and studied physics at the Technische Universit\u00e4t in Munich. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Caltech in 1987 under Prof. Howard Berg, studying the biophysical mechanisms controlling the bacterial flagellar motor, and performed postdoctoral research with Denis Baylor at Stanford University from 1987- 1991, where he began to work on the visual system. Markus has been a professor at Harvard since 1991. Markus is a neuroscientist whose research centers on information processing by sensory systems. He is a world expert in the neural circuitry of the retina, where he has discovered new principles governing the early processing of visual information. He has found that the retina is considerably \"smarter\" than previously believed, in that it carries out functions that are more specialized than simply spatio -temporal filtering. More recently, Markus has used genetically engineered mice in which very specific subsets of retinal cells are fluorescently labeled, to discover the neural function of these cells. He will continue this work, as well as theoretical analysis of neural information processing and the design of novel technologies for wireless recording of neural activity, in his new laboratory at Caltech. 10BIOLOGY ANNUAL RETREAT 2012 NOVEMBER 2011 During the fall term , the Biology Division Faculty, postdocs, and graduate students gather for an annual retreat. The Biology Retreat provides an opportunity for new faculty and new graduate students to meet, socialize and familiarize themselves with the diverse research taking place in various labs and assists them in selecting their rotation labs. It also assists the grad students in selecting their rotation labs. In addition, many collaborations begin as a result of talks and conversations that take place during the three-day event.

NATHAN PIERCE RECEIVED THE 2011-2012 FERGUSON PRIZE FOR HIS SEMINAL WORK ON THE MECHANISM AND REGULATION OF SCF UBIQUITIN LIGASES . THIS AWARD GOES TO THE STUDENT WHO IS JUDGED BY THE FACULTY TO HAVE PRODUCED THE BEST PH.D. THESIS OVER THE YEAR . DR. PIERCE PERFORMED HIS GRADUATE STUDIES IN THE LABORATORIES OF PROFS . RAY DESHAIES AND SHU-OU SHAN. PROF . DESHAIES NATHAN PIERCE CHAIR , STEPHEN MAYO In his first study, Dr. Pierce was the first person to apply pre -steady -state kinetics to the study of enzyme mechanism in the ubiquitin system. The target of his effort was the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase. Using quench- flow methods, Dr. Pierce determined the kinetic parameters for SCFCdc4 -catalyzed multiubiquitination of a substrate. This remarkable analysis allowed him to distinguish betwee n two extant models for ubiquitin chain assembly (i.e. the chain is preassembled and transferred en bloc vs. assembled in a stepwise fashion upon substrate). Dr. Pierce's data unequivocally supported the latter hypothesis. The kinetic data also explained h ow different SCF ubiquitin ligases can yield a different spectrum of products due to variations in the efficiency pf ubiquitin chain initiation and in the processivity of ubiquitin chain extension. Dr. Pierce's analysis provides a foundation for future stu dies into the structural features that enable ubiquitin chain synthesis. In his second study, Dr. Pierce turned his attention to the regulation of the assembly of SCF complexes. In this work, he made the remarkable observation that Cand1, which was posited to be a sequestration factor for the core SCF subunit Cul1, is actually an exchange factor that catalyzes the equilibration of Cul1 with a population of Fbox -Skp1 complexes. Fbox -Skp1 comprise a substrate receptor that binds directly to Cul1 and determine s the substrate specificity of the resulting SCF complex. There are dozens of different Fbox proteins expressed in human cells, and prior to Dr. Pierce's work, a key question was how this large number of Fbox proteins compete for access to Cul1. In the absence of Cand1, SCF complexes are extremely stable and dissociate on a time -scale of weeks, but in the presence of Cand1, Fbox -Skp1 modules equilibrate with Cul1 within minutes. Cand1 accelerates this equilibration by 1 million fold, which provides an eleg ant explanation for why Cand1 is important to sustain the function of SCF and other cullin -based ubiquitin ligase complexes in vivo. 14PROFESSORIAL AWARDS AND HONORS 2012 David Baltimore, Pr esident Emeritus, Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology, Nobel Laureate: 2012 Sackler Foundation Endowment 2012 Civic Scientist Lecture Series, James A.

Some studies focus on the psychological level, using behavioral data from healthy people to make inferences about how emotion modulates memory, attention, or conscious awareness . A second approach uses neuroimaging and electrophysiology to investigate the neural mechanisms behind emotional and social processing. A third approach studies the performances, and the brains, of special populations. At Caltech, we have been recruiti ng people 38RALPH ADOLPHS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 with agenesis of the corpus callosum to investigate the functional consequences of disruption in long-range connectivity. Dr. Lynn Paul leads this work. In collaboration with Joe Piven at the University of North Carolina, we have also been studying people with autism. At the University of Iowa, we have ongoing collaborations that involve neurological populations with focal brain lesions, and, together with hospitals in the Los Angeles region, which involve neurosurgical patients in whom we can record intracranially. A major focus in the past year has been on making comparisons across some of these populations and approaches. For instance, we are comparing people with autism and with amygdala lesions tested on the same tasks. Many of these comparative studies build on years of data accrual in our laboratory involving a significant amount of work by our staff, as well as the graduate students and post -docs. A second area where we are making comparisons is across methods. For instance, we are comparing responses measured in the amygdala to features of faces, and doing so using both the signal typically measured in fMRI studies (the BOLD response), as well as recording action potentials from single neurons in neurosurgical patients who have depth electrodes in the amygdala. Finally, we are continuing to collaborate with colleagues in the social sciences at Caltech who bring a model -based approach to understanding human behavior. Taken together, these studies of social cognition across a variety of populations, using multiple measures, and complemented with computational modeling, are giving us powerful insights not only into how specific structures might work (like the amygdala), but also how they might function in a network of multiple component s. Extending our understanding of social cognition to the systems level, and examining the connections between different brain regions, constitutes a major thrust for future studies in our laboratory. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Ralph Adolphs Measuring personal space in patients with amygdala lesions Eye tracking to faces in people with autism Connectivity of the brains in agenesis of the corpus callosum as visualized with MR imaging 39RALPH ADOLPHS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Bryan, R, Perona, P, & Adolphs, R (accepted 2012) Perspective distortion from interpersonal distance is an implicit visual cue for social judgments of faces.

In collaboration with Prof. Barbara Wold and Dr. Brian Williams, we are investigating gene expression in microdissected von Economo neurons using RNA -Seq. We are also using this technique to discover differences between specific cell types in neurotypical and autistic brains. We are analyzing the comparative structure of the frontal and insular cortex in primates using connectivity based on high resolution diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, and cellular and fibe r architecture. Finally we have initiated a study of the brains of non -demented centenarians with Prof. David Bennett and his colleagues at Rush University using these same methods as part of an endeavor to understand brain aging in extremely old individua ls who had preserved cognitive functioning. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right Professor John Allman The microdissection of a von Economo neuron (VEN), which is the large bipolar cell in the center of the field; the VEN outlined for laser microdissection; the microdissected VEN.

While the concept of artificial intelligence has received a great deal of attention in the popular press, the actual determination of the neural basis of intelligence and behavior has proven to be a very difficult problem for neuroscientists. Our behaviors are dictated by our intentions, but we have only recent ly begun to understand how the brain forms intentions to act. The posterior parietal cortex is situated between the sensory and the movement regions of the cerebral cortex and serves as a bridge from sensation to action. We have found that an anatomical map of intentions exists within this area, with one part devoted to planning eye movements and another part to planning arm movements. The action plans in the arm movement area exist in a cognitive form, specifying the goal of the intended movement rather than particular signals to various muscle groups. 44RICHARD ANDERSEN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Neuroprosthetics. One project in the lab is to develop a cognitive -based neural prosthesis for paralyzed patients. This prosthetic system is designed to record the electrical activity of nerve cells in the posterior parietal cortex of paralyzed patients, interpret the patients ' intentions from these neural signals using computer algorithms, and convert the \" decoded \" intentions into electrical control signals to operate external devices such as a robot arm, autonomous vehicle or a computer. Recent attempts to develop neural prosthetics by other labs have focused on decoding intended hand trajectories from motor cortical neurons. We have concentrated on higher -level signals related to the goals of mov ements. Using healthy monkeys with implanted arrays of electrodes we recorded neural activity related to the intended goals of the animals and used this signal to position cursors on a computer screen without the animals emitting any behaviors. Goal deco ding has advantages including the coding of multiple sequences, fast decoding, and improving trajectory decoding by knowing the final goal. Interestingly we have recently found that trajectories are also represented in posterior parietal cortex that is a tremendous advantage since goals and trajectories can be decoded from a single area rather than having to implant two different areas. We are also ramping up for clinical studies in paralyzed patients using recordings from the posterior parietal cortex. One prosthetic will be a communication device operating a tablet (e.g., iPad). The second will control a state -of-the-art robotic limb that has been developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins. Coordinate frames. Our laboratory also e xamines the coordinate frames of spatial maps in cortical areas of the parietal cortex coding movement intentions. One new discovery is the finding of a novel, \"relative \" coordinate frame used for hand- eye coordination. Neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex and area 5d of posterior parietal cortex encode the position of the eye to the target and the position of the hand to the target. Interestingly the dorsal premotor cortex also encodes the relative position of the hand to the eye. A similar relative c oding may be used for other tasks that involve the movements of multiple body parts such as bimanual movements. Local field potentials. The cortical local field potential (LFP) is a summation signal of excitatory and inhibitory dendritic potentials tha t has recently become of increasing interest. We have reported that LFP signals in the saccade and reach regions provide information about the direction of planned movements , as well as the state of the animal; e.g. , baseline, planning a saccade, planning a reach, executing a saccade, or executing a reach. This new evidence provides further support for a role of the parietal cortex in movement planning. It also shows that LFPs can be used for neural prosthetics application s. Since LFP recordings from im planted arrays of electrodes are more robust and do not degrade as much with time compared to single cell recordings, this application is of enormous practical importance. We have also been comparing the correlation of spikes in one area with LFPs in another to determine how cortical areas communicate with one another during different tasks. Cortical repair . We are currently performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments in awake, behaving monkeys. This technique is important sinc e fMRI experiment s are routinely done in humans and monitors the changes in blood flow during different cognitive and motor tasks. However, a direct correlation of brain activity with blood flow cannot be achieved in humans, but can in monkeys. Thus, the correlation of cellular recording and functional MRI activation in monkeys provide s us with a better understanding of the many experiments currently being performed in humans. We are also using monkey fMRI for clinical studies. We are 45RICHARD ANDERSEN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 temporarily inact ivating parts of cortex to see how brain circuits adjust to compensate for inactivation. In the future we will use electrical stimulation of cortical areas determined by fMRI to be active during the compensation process. These studies are aimed at developing medical devices that can accelerate brain repair from traumatic brain injury and stroke. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Functional magnetic resonance imaging of human during movement planning Schematic of concept of a cognitive neural prosthetic Area of the posterior parietal cortex involved in planning different actions PUBLICATIONS 2012 Bremner, L.R. and Andersen, R.A., (2012) Coding of the Reach Vector in Parietal Area 5d.

We seek to elucidate how fundamental properties common to emotional states or responses, such as arousal, are encoded in the circuitry and chemistry of the brain, and how s ensory stimuli eliciting specific emotional responses, such as fear or aggression, are transformed and organized into behavior by the nervous system. Our work employs molecular genetic tools to mark, map and functionally manipulate specific circuits, to d etermine how identifiable populations of neurons contribute in a 48DAVID ANDERSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 causal manner to behavior. These interventional studies are complemented by electrophysiology and functional imaging to measure activity in neural circuits. We use two model organisms in the laboratory: mice and the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster , with roughly equal emphasis on both. Emotion circuits in the mouse brain Research using the laboratory mouse Mus musculus focuses on understanding the neurobiology of fear, anxiety, aggression and pain, and the interrelationships between the circuitry that processes these emotions. Our studies of fear are currently centered on the function of circuits in the amygdala, a med ial temporal lobe structure that plays an important role in Pavlovian learned fear, a form of classical conditioning. We have identified genes that mark several subpopulations of neurons that form a dynamic microcircuit within the central nucleus of the a mygdala. The function of this microcircuit in fear behavior is being dissected using optogenetic tools, such as channelrhodopsin, and pharmacogenetic tools, such ivermectin -gated chloride channel (GluCl) (Lerchener et al., 2007) , together with acute slice electrophysiology and genetically -based anatomical tracing of synaptic pathways. Similar approaches are being used to understand the role of another brain region strongly implicated in stress and anxiety, the lateral septum (LS). There are conflicting data on whether the LS promotes or inhibits anxiety, due to a lack of information about its microcircuitry. We have gained a point -of-entry into this structure by focusing on neurons expressing the type 2 corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor (Crhr2), and are using a combination of transgenic and novel viral tools to understand the functional circuitry in which these neurons participate. In the case of aggression, we are focusing on circuits within the hypothalamus, an area that has extensive connectivity with both the LS and the amygdala, through which it receives input from the olfactory system (Choi et al ., 2005). We are using chronic in vivo multi -unit recording to probe the relationship between neuronal activity and aggression, as well as mating, and are also employing genetically based functional perturbations to understand how these two related social behaviors are processed by a common structure. Pain has both a sensory and an affective component. We are using genetically targeted methods to probe the functional roles of different subpopulations of primary sensory neurons ide ntified by the expression of Mrgprs, a family of orphan G protein -coupled receptors that we previously characterized (Dong et al ., 2001). We are interested in the extent to which these receptors mark neurons specialized for particular types of painful sti muli, and if so how this specificity is conveyed to the brain. 49DAVID ANDERSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 Emotion circuits in Drosophila The pioneering work of the late Seymour Benzer proved that the powerful genetics of Drosophila could be used to dissect the genetic underpinnings of many types of complex behaviors. Until recently, however, it was not clear whether this model system could also be applied to understanding the neurobiology of emotion and affect. We are taking two complementary approaches to determine the extent to which this is po ssible, and if so what we can learn from it. One approach is to dissect the neural circuitry underlying behaviors that are analogous to defensive behaviors in higher organisms, such as avoidance (Suh et al ., 2004, 2007), aggression (Wang et al., 2008) or immobility (Yorozu et al., 2009). The other is to model internal states or processes that are fundamental to many types of emotional responses, such as arousal, to ask for example whether arousal is unitary, or whether there are different types of behavio r-specific arousal states (Lebestky et al., 2009). In both cases, we are developing novel behavioral assays, as well as machine vision - based approaches (Dankert et al., 2009) to automate the measurement of these behaviors (in collaboration with Pietro Per ona, Allen E. Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering), and are using molecular genetic -based tools to image and perturb neuronal activity in order to identify the specific circuits that mediate these behaviors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor David Anderson Neurons in the lateral septum that are involved in anxiety (blue), receive synaptic input from other neurons expressing speci fic neuropeptides (red spots).

For more details and publications, see http://www.klab.caltech.edu . Research carried out as part of a \"Bio physics of Computation\" focuses on how the electrophysiology, synaptic architecture, and dendritic morphology of groups of individual neurons subserve information processing. We are working on the forward problem of determining the local field potential (LFP) that 52CHRISTOF KOCH LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 results from the synaptic and electrical activity of 1,000 of neurons in the hippocampus. We are also considering the inverse problem, studying the extent to which the local field influences the timing of action potentials of neurons. Our experimental (recordings with up to 12 patch electrodes in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in vitro ) and computational research clearly shows that gradients as low as 1 mV/mm in the extracellular field can significantly affect the synchrony of neurons. That is, not onl y synaptic but also ephaptic effects will influence the firing behavior of population of neurons. This work is done in collaboration with the laboratories of Gyuri Buzsaki at Rutgers/New Jersey and Henry Markram at the EPFL/Lausanne. Our laboratory collaborates with the neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Itzhak Fried at UCLA, recording from 128 electrodes in the medial temporal lobe of awake patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy who are implanted with depth electrodes to localize the focus of seizure onset. This unique setting allows us to observe invariant recognition, imagery and representation of familiar objects and famous individuals in conscious humans by listening in on the spiking activity of many individual neurons - complemented by local field analysis. This work requires sophisticated data processing skills and the careful design of the appropriate behavioral -physiological paradigms that will work in a clinical context. In on current work, we demonstrated that patients can selectively, rapidly, transiently and voluntarily control the firing behavior of selective neurons in the medial temporal lobe, enhancing the firing rate of some, while simultaneously suppressing the firing rate of others and leaving the bulk of neurons unaffecte d. Understanding the action of selective, visual attention (both saliency -driven, bottom -up, as well as task-dependent, top-down forms) requires a firm grasp of how visual object recognition in natural scenes can be solved at the computational level, an d how the resulting algorithms can be mapped onto the known architecture of the visual cortex and associated cortical and sub -cortical areas. We use analytical methods, coupled with computer simulations of the appropriate circuitry in the primate visual s ystem, visual psychophysics, eye tracking and functional brain imaging at Caltech's 3.0 T Trio scanner to investigate human attentional selection (via saliency) and object recognition in the near - absence of focal attention, in visual search, in natural scene perception and as reward is modulated. Aspects of this work are done in collaboration with Antonio Rangel, Ralph Adolphs and Colin Camerer of Caltech and with Laurent Itti at USC. Together with Tomaso Poggio at MIT, we investigate neurobiologically plausible models of both, the ventral, object -recognition and the dorsal, attention visual streams. We continue to work on understanding how neurons in regions LIP and FEF - modulated by top- down information - implement a visual saliency map. We study the neuronal correlates of consciousness, developing a neurobiological framework to understand how subjective feelings (in particular, conscious visual perception) can arise in the mammalian forebrain. Using `Continuous Flash Suppression' (CFS) and other tec hniques we have invented to hide images from conscious perception, we can show that visual, selective attention is a distinct process from visual consciousness. In collaboration with Chris Adami of the Keck Graduate Institute and Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, we are studying Tononi's Integrated Information Theory of consciousness and apply the underlying complexity measures to both abstract, as well as concrete biological circuits and motifs. 53CHRISTOF KOCH LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Christof Koch A, Illustration of the extracellular potential Ve calculation in a population through the superposition of contributions from all compartments in all cells.

The so- called songbird is particularly interesting to us, because young birds imitate song either from their fathers or other males in the vicinity. Song learning consists of two stages, memorizing a song during youth and reproducing it in adulthood. We would like to know where in the brain and in what form tutor song is stored. We know the chain of discrete brain areas that control song. These areas are unique to bird species that learn song and the areas are collectively referred to as the song control system. However, our own follow -up studies have revealed several new connections between areas that were thought to form a simple chain. Thus, our findings make the song control system much more complex than it was originally reported (Figure below). (A ) shows the old figure and (B) shows the new figure based on our data. The red lines indicate the newly found connections. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Masakazu Konishi Owl capturing prey 56MASAKAZU KONISHI LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 P UBLICATIONS 2011 Funabiki K., Ashida G., Konishi M., (2011) Computation of Interaural Time Difference in the Owl's Coincidence Journal of Neuroscience, 31(43):15245- 15256.

We are describing the neural events that occur when an animal is chronically exposed to nicotine. We hypothesize that this set of responses underlies the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction, the world's largest preventable cause of death. There is no medical justification for the use of smoked tobacco. However , the organism's responses to chronic nicotine also underlie the benefits of two inadvertent therapeutic effects of smoking: the inverse correlation between a person's history of smoking and his/her susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, and the preventive effect of nicotine in autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal- lobe epilepsy. We are studying these complex neural processes at several appropriate levels: the genes, the receptor proteins, the effects on neurons, the organization of neurons in circuits, the resulting behavior of animals, and even neural events in humans. Several lab members are describing the molecular/biophysical aspects of SePhaChARNS, for \"selective that SePhaChARNS is a thermodynamically driven process leading to the classical observation that chronic exposure to nicotine causes \"upregulation\" of nicotinic receptors. Other proteins modify SePhaChARNS; and lab members are studying two of th ese: the modulatory protein lynx, and the auxiliary nicotinic subunit 5 . If the hypothesis is proven, SePhaChARNS is the molecular mechanism that shapes an animal's response to chronic exposure to nicotine. We are now producing subcellular movies depicting the first 24 hours of nicotine addiction \u2014thought to be the most crucial -stage in the process, especially for adolescents. These images display the spread of newly chaperoned, fluorescent receptors as they travel from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane. Other lab members are generating mice with genetically modified nicotinic receptors \u2014gain of function, not knockouts. Some mice have a hypersensitive subunit; in such mice, responses to nicotine represent selective excitation of receptors containing that subunit. Other mice have a fluorescent subunit, so that we can quantify and localize upregulation of receptors containing that subunit. We are also engineering Cys -loop receptors in order to manipulate neurons. Now we are optimizing suitably mutated C. elegans GluCl receptor channels to have strong res ponses to 59HENRY LESTER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 minuscule concentrations of the anthelmintic ivermectin and its derivatives. In collaboration with Professor David Anderson's group, we have introduced these channels into mouse neurons. When the animal is injected with ivermectin, the neurons can be selectively silenced \u2014and eventually, we hope, selectively activated. If we can improve the system, there are important applications for both research and therapy. Several of our projects lead naturally to drug discovery procedures. We have a drug discovery collaboration with Michael Marks and his group at the University of Colorado, Boulder; and with Targacept, Inc. We also collaborate with Robert Freedman and his colleagues at the University of Colorado, Denver, to generate scientific knowledge a nd therapies around the heavy smoking by schizophrenics. We also have interests in new techniques at the intersection of biophysics, single -molecule imaging, chemistry, mouse genetics, and neuroscience. We're delighted to host visitors in our lab on the t hird floor of the Kerckhoff Laboratory. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Henry Lester Fluorescent 3 nicotinic receptor subunits in medial Unmixed alpha4YFP LESTER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Tavares, Ximena Da Silva and Blum, Angela P. and Nakamura, Darren T. and Puskar, Nyssa L. and Shanata, Jai A.

Using knockout mice and over -expression in vivo with viral vectors, we are exploring the role of the neuropoietic cytokine leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) in regulating neural stem cell proliferation and fate in the adult brain. In the context of neuroi mmune interactions during fetal brain development, we are investigating a mouse model of mental illness based on the known risk factor of maternal influenza infection. Huntington's disease (HD) is another focus, where we are investigating potential therapies using intracellular expression of antibodies (intrabodies) and also manipulating NFkB activity. We are also studying the regulation of MeCP2 by IKKa, because MeCP2 mutations are responsible for Rett syndrome, which frequently involves autism symptoms. Cytokines are diffusible, intercellular messengers that were originally studied in the immune system. Our group contributed to the discovery of a family that we termed the neuropoietic cytokines, because of their action in both the nervous and hematopoietic/immune systems. We demonstrated that one of these cytokines, LIF, can coordinate the neuronal, glial and immune reactions to injury. Using both delivery of LIF in vivo and examination of the consequences of knocking out the LIF gene in mice, we find that this cytokine has a powerful regulatory effect on the inflammatory cascade. Moreover, LIF can regulate neurogenesis and gliogenesis. LIF is a critical regulator of astrocyte and microglial activation following stroke, seizure or trauma, and this cytokine also regulates inflammatory cell infiltration, neuronal and oligodendrocyte death, gene expression, as well as adult neural stem cell renewal. These results highlight LIF as an important therapeutic target. We use gene therapy to deliver LIF in a chemical model of multiple sclerosis, and find that LIF increases oligodendrocyte number and stimulate s remyelination. We are currently modifying the viral vector so that LIF can be delivered in the peripheral circulation and be regulated by exogenous signals, in a cell -specific manner. Cytokine involvement in a model for mental illness is also being investigated. This mouse model is based on findings that infection in pregnant women c an significantly increase the likelihood of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. We are using behavioral, neuropathological, molecular, and brain imaging methods to investigate the effects of activating the maternal immune system on fetal brain development and how this leads to altered behavior in young and adult offspring. The cytokine IL -6, acting on both the placenta and fetal brain, is key in mediating the effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) on the fate of the offspring. We have new evi dence that MIA alters the endogenous immune cells in the placenta, as well as hematopoietic stem cell fate and lymphocyte subsets and reactivity in the adult offspring. These changes are connected with behavior, as bone marrow transplants from na\u00efve, control mice can correct the abnormal behaviors seen in the MIA offspring. In collaboration with the Amaral laboratory at UC Davis, we have extended the MIA model to non -human primates, and find that the offspring of immune -activated mothers display a series of autism -like behaviors. In collaboration with the Mazmanian laboratory 64PAUL PATTERSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 at Caltech, we are also examining the effects of MIA on gastrointestinal tract inflammation in the offspring. We find that adult MIA offspring display deficits in gut permeabilit y. Mor eover, this leaky gut and the abnormal behaviors can be corrected by administration of probiotic bacteria, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for these mental illnesses. We are utilizing intracellular antibody expression to block the toxicity of mutant huntingtin (Htt), the protein that causes HD. We produced single -chain intrabodies that bind to various domains of Htt, and these can either exacerbate or alleviate Htt toxicity in cultured cells, acute brain slices, and in Drosophila HD models. Gene therapy using one of these intrabodies in five different mouse models of HD is highly effective in ameliorating the behavioral deficits and neuropathology caused by mutant Htt in these models. We have also implicated the NFkB signaling pathway in the path ogenesis of HD, and identified several steps in this signaling cascade as potential therapeutic targets. In collaboration with the Langen laboratory at USC, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy , we have obtained new structural information on the domains of mutant Htt when it forms fibrils. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Images, left JM, Fischer T, Patterson PH, Langen, R (2012) Structural features and domain organization of huntingtin fibrils.

Despite the impact of sleep disorders, the fact that we sleep for a third of our lives, and the evolutionary conservation of sleep -like behaviors, the mechanisms that regulate sleep remain poorly understood. It is therefore important to develo p simple and cost -effective systems to study the genetic and neural regulation of sleep. Zebrafish are a useful system for these studies because: 1) unlike invertebrates, fish have the basic brain structures thought to regulate mammalian sleep; 2) larval zebrafish are transparent, which makes it easy to monitor and manipulate their neurons; and 3) zebrafish are amenable to high - throughput screens that can identify genes, drugs and neurons that regulate sleep. Zebrafish are therefore a useful system for unraveling the mysteries of sleep. The goal of our lab is to address two fundamental questions: What genetic and neural mechanisms regulate sleep? We are addressing these questions by performing genetic and small molecule screens, and by testing candidat e genes and neurons for their roles in regulating sleep/wake behaviors. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 67DAVID PROBER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Image from left to right: Professor David Prober Transgenic zebrafish embryos that expr ess red fluorescent protein in Hypocretin neurons and green fluorescent protein in QRFP neurons.

In these projects, we 69SHINSUKE SHIMOJO LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 focus on implicit cognitive processes, emotional decision making, social communication, plasticity, and their neural correlates. Vigorous collaborations have been conducted between our ps ychophysics laboratory here , and the CREST Japan site located at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, as well as Harvard MGH, Boston University, Gordon College London, Occidental College, and MetaModal Inc. Besides, we continue collaborative efforts on \"social brain, \" under the Caltech -Tamagawa gCOE (grand Center Of Excellence) program (supported by MEXT, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, which was started in September, 2008). Using a variety of methods including eye tracking, high- density EEG, fMRI and MEG, we examine how exactly peripheral sensory stimuli, neural activity in the sensory cortex, and the mental experience of perception are related to each other in the highly plastic fashion. In particular, we aim to understand implicit, as opposed to explicit or conscious, somatic and neural processes that lead to, and thus predict, conscious emotional decision such as preference. Amongst all, most challenging on -going attempts in the laboratory include: (1) the in triguing interactions between predictive processes (prior to and thus predicting the mental event or behavior) and postdictive processes (posterior); (2) the inter -brain causal connectivity under social cooperative interactions ; (3) remote tDCS modulation of subcortical reward system ; and (4) sensory substitution by visual -auditory devise. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Shinsuke Interpersonal EEG Subcortical activity under a pressure 70SHINSUKE SHIMOJO LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Bhushan, V., Saha, G., Lindsen, J., Shimojo, S. & Bhattacharya, J .

Previous research has shown that the hippocampus is critical for the formation of long -term declarative memories, and that this hippocampal involvement is time - limited. The current predominant conjecture is that memories are gradually established across distributed neocortical netwo rks through the interactions between cortical and hippocampal circuits. However, the direct experimental investigation of these interactions has been difficult since, until recently, simultaneous chronic recordings from large numbers of well -isolated single neurons were not technically feasible. These experiments became possi ble with the advent of the technique of chronic multi -area tetrode recordings in freely behaving rodents. Using this technique we monitor the simultaneous activity of large numbers of cortical and hippocampal cells during the acquisition and performance o f memory tasks, as well as during the sleep periods preceding and following experience. Our research efforts focus on analyzing the structure of cortico -hippocampal interactions in the different brain states and on characterizing how this structure is modulated by behavior; how it 73THANOS SIAPAS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 evolves throughout the learning process; and what it reflects about the intrinsic organization of memory processing at the level of networks of neurons. Our experimental work is complemented by theoretical studies of network models and the development tools for the analysis of multi -neuronal data. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right Professor Thanos Siapas 74DORIS TSAO LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Assistant Professor of Biology: Doris Y.

Most of our work has been centered around the study of the molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connections are formed and modified during development. In the embryo, we examine signaling systems involved in motor and central nervous system (CNS ) axon guidance . We also study the control of tube geometry in the tracheal (respiratory) system; this process uses some of the same phosphotyrosine signaling pathways that regulate axon guidance. In the larva, we focus on synaptogenesis and synaptic pla sticity in the neuromuscular system. In the adult, we investigate the neural and molecular mechanisms that control fat storage. Our approaches combine genetics, molecular biology, electrophysiology, biochemistry, and cell biology . We have also begun a project to develop a new strategy for systematic generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against cell - surface and secreted proteins . We will use this to generate mAbs against both Drosophila and human proteins . We plan to use the anti -human mAbs for i nvestigation of vascular development and tumor angiogenesis . Motor axon guidance and muscle targeting The Drosophila motor axon network has provided one of the best systems in which to study axonal pathfinding and targeting mechanisms . The network is si mple: 32 motoneurons innervate 30 body wall muscle fibers in each abdominal segment. Each motoneuron axon is targeted to a specific muscle fiber, and few projection errors are made during normal development . Thus, the motor axon network is a genetically hard-wired map, and is an ideal system in which to study how genes 77KAI ZINN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 control the formation of specific synaptic connections . In much of our work, we have focused on the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating motor axon guidance decisions. In part icular, we have studied receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), which are cell surface receptors that antagonize the activities of tyrosine kinases . Our current focus is on the identification and characterization of ligands recognized by the extracellular domains of the RPTPs . We have shown that one cell -surface ligand interacts with an RPTP in both cis and trans , and that cis and trans interactions have different signaling outcomes. We have also conducted genetic screens to identify cell surface proteins that label specific muscle fibers for recognition by motor axon growth cones . These studies showed that members of one family of cell surface molecules, the leucine -rich repeat (LRR) proteins, are likely to function as muscle target labels . We are continuing to examine the roles of several LRR proteins in controlling recognition of specific muscle fibers . Synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in t he larval neuromuscular system Motor growth cones reach their muscle targets during late embryogenesis and then mature into presynaptic terminals that are functional by the time of hatching . The pattern of Type I neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses in the larva is simple and highly stereotyped, with boutons restricted to specific locations on each muscle fiber. These synapses continue to expand and change as the larva grows, because their strengths must be matched to the sizes of the muscle fibers they drive. This growth represents a form of synaptic plasticity, because it is controlled by feedback from the muscle to the neuron. Studies of NMJ synapses in flies are relevant to an understanding of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain, because the fly NMJ is a glutamatergic synapse, organized into boutons, that uses ionotropic glutamate receptors that are homologous to vertebrate AMPA receptors. Our recent work on synapses has focused on control of synaptic protein translation. Local translation at synapses has been studied in Aplysia , mammalian, and arthropod systems. It has attracted interest b ecause it is a mechanism that allows neurons to separately adjust the strengths of individual synapses . Our work on local translation began when we identified pumilio (pum) in a genetic screen . Pum is an RNA -binding protein that represses translation of mRNAs, and maternal Pum controls patterning during early embryonic development. However, our work showed that Pum is also an important mediator of synaptic growth and plasticity at the NMJ . Postsynaptic Pum negatively regulates expression of the essentia factor eIF- 4E and the glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIA, and it binds selectively to the 3'UTRs of the eIF -4E and GluRIIA mRNAs. Pum also represses expression of Nanos binds to the 3' UTR of nos mRNA . Nos is require d for Pum function during early development, and Pum and Nos form a complex that represses translation of hunchback mRNA during early development . However, our results show that Pum and Nos have antagonistic functions at the NMJ . Pum represses translation of GluRIIA, while alternative glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIB. 78KAI ZINN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 We are currently attempting to develop reporters to measure local postsynaptic translation in live transgenic animals . The current reporter is a fusion of GluRIIA to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Eos . We hope to use these reporters to determine whether Pum and Nos actually regulate local translation of GluRIIA and other postsynaptic mRNAs . We will also attempt to test a m odel for control of Pum activity by aggregation left Kai Zinn The pattern of motor axons and synapses in the ventral region of a third -instar larval hemisegment, visualized using the 3D rendering program Imaris.

The peripheral nervous system forms from two cell types that are unique to vertebrates: neural crest cells and ectodermal placodes. We study the cellu lar and molecular events underlying the formation, cell lineage decisions and migration of these two cells types. The neural crest is comprised of multipotent stem -cell-like precursor cells that migrate extensively and give rise to an amazingly diverse se t of derivatives. In addition to their specific neuronal and glial derivatives, neural crest cells can also form melanocytes, craniofacial bone and cartilage and smooth muscle. Placodes are discrete regions of thickened epithelium that give rise to portions of the cranial sensory ganglia as well as form the paired sense organs (lens, nose, ears). Placodes and neural crest cells share several properties including the ability to migrate and to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Their progeny ar e also similar: sensory neurons, glia, neuroendocrine cells, and cells that can secrete special extracellular matrices. 83MARIANNE BRONNER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 Our laboratory focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction, early development and evolution of the neural crest and placodes. This research addresses fundamental questions concerning cell commitment, migration and differentiation using a combination of techniques ranging from experimental embryology to genomic approaches to novel gene discovery and identification of gene regulatory regions. These studies shed important light on the mechanisms of neural crest and placode formation, migration and differentiation. In addition, the neural crest and placodes are unique to vertebrates. In studying the evolution of these traits, we hope to better understand the origin of vertebrates. Because these cell types are involved in a variety of birth defects and cancers such as neurofibromatosis, melanoma, neuroblastoma, our results on the normal mechanisms of neural crest development provide important clues regarding the mistakes that may lead to abnormal development or loss of the differentiated state. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________ Images, l eft to right: Professor Marianne Bronner In situ expression pattern of transcription factor Snail2 Antibody staining for HNK -1 epitope GFP reporter expression for an enhancer encoding transcription factor Sox10. 84MARIANNE BRONNER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 201 2 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Fishwick, K., Bronner, M.E. and Taneyhilll, L.

Our research is done on sea urchin embryos, which provide key experimental advantage s. We pursue an integrated, \"vertical\" mode of experimental analysis, in that our experiments are directed at all levels of biological organization. Our work extends from the transcription factor -DNA interactions that control spatial and temporal expression of specific genes, to the system -level analysis of large regulatory networks, to the sets of downstream effector genes they control. It has become apparent that only from the GRN system level of analysis can causal explanations of major developmental phenomena directly emerge, and this is our main focus. The sea urchin embryo is the first in which major portions of the developmental process have been encompassed in experimentally solved GRNs. Modeling demonstrates that these networks provide a predictiv ely sufficient explanatory framework for understanding how the genomic regulatory code causes the progression of regulatory states that underlie all downstream developmental process. In current projects GRN analysis is being extended to the complex spatial regulatory domains of the oral ectoderm and the postgastrular gut, as well as to the mesoderm and the ciliated band. We are also isolating cells expressing given regulatory states by FACS, and from their transcriptomes determining the specifically expressed effector genes, so that their cell -type specific control systems can be directly related to the hierarchically upstream GRNs. A large scale transcriptome analysis is providing invaluable information on gene use in embryonic and adult tissues, on gene mo dels, and on gene expression dynamics. One reason for the advanced knowledge of sea urchin embryo genomic control systems is their accessibility to cis -regulatory analysis, and a recent technological development in our lab has enabled high throughput cis -regulatory analysis in which expression of 10 to >100 constructs can be determined simultaneously. Both specific genes of key interest and relevant sets of genes are currently targets of cis -regulatory examination. Knowledge of the genomically encoded contr ol processes of development opens the way to exploration of their evolution. In collaboration with the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine, genomic sequence from other echinoderms at phylogenetically strategic distances is being obtained, which potentiates a variety of evolutionary projects. One such is exploration of the divergence of the GRNs underlying the embryonic specification of sister groups of sea urchins that diverged before the Permian/Triassic extinction. Another project is aimed at the cis -regulatory evolution of a gene expressed differently in sea stars and sea urchins. Closely related to evolutionary rewiring of developmental GRNs is experimental rewiring of GRN circuitry, which has now been greatly facilitated by the advent of the predictive model referred to above, so that the consequences can be studied a priori in silico. The main research initiatives in our laboratories at the present time are as follows: i. Gene regulatory network underlying endomesoderm specification in S. purpuratus embryos : Many of the individual projects reported below are contributing to understanding of this GRN. At present, over 60 regulatory and signaling genes have been linked into this network. The 87ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 architecture of the network is emerging from an interdisciplinary approach in which high resolution spatial and temporal regulatory gene expression data are combined with perturbation data obtained by gene expression knockouts and the results of cis -regulatory analysis to provide a causal explanation of the observed embryology. A model of the GRN through time is emerging which indicates the inputs and outputs of the cis -regulatory elements at its key nodes. This model essentially provides the genomic regulatory code for specificati on of the endomesodermal territories of the embryo, up to gastrula stage (30 h after fertilization). This year we published the dynamic mechanism by which the endoderm/mesoderm fate decision is made, as well as that by which future anterior vs. posterior endoderm is specified. By this point, the p re-gastrular skeletogenic lineage GRN and the endodermal GRNs are largely solved. The endodermal GRN project is now focused on the specification of the development of the post -gastrular gut, which consists of ma ny distinct regions (foregut, midgut, hindgut, sphincters, blastopore/anus region). The initial major effort is to achieve a comprehensive determination of the dynamic regulatory states of these regions. Within the next year or two the pre -gastrular oral and aboral mesodermal GRNs, which produce different mesodermal cell types, will have been brought to a similar level of completeness as the pre- gastrular endodermal GRNs, including a complete analysis of mesodermal Notch target genes. (endoderm: Dr. Isa belle Peter, Jonathan Valencia, Miao Cui, Jina Yun, Cathy Dong, Natnaree Siriwon; mesoderm: Dr. Andrew Ransick, Dr. Stefan Materna*) *Graduated 2011 ii. Dynamic Boolean model of endomesoderm gene regulatory network: We have constructed a dynamic model representing the control system operative in life, such that the regulatory response capabilities of each gene in the endomesoderm GRN are formalized in a vector equation indicating the inputs and logic processing funct ions executed by the relevant genomic cis - regulatory module(s). The vector equations encompass all the regulatory interrelations stated explicitly in the GRNs, and the model as a whole provides a direct test of the overall completeness of the experimental analysis underlying the GRN. Original strategies for incorporation of signaling interactions, embryonic geometry, and lineage, were devised. A wholly novel computational and graphic display apparatus was created to support model operations. Each hour t he outputs of every gene in the model (if any), are computed from the inputs available then, for each endomesodermal spatial domain (skeletogenic, mesoderm, anterior and posterior endoderm); thus, the model computes the dynamically changing regulatory states of the embryo. The relation between real time and change in transcriptional status had been calculated for sea urchin embryos earlier, in a first principles kinetic model (Bolouri and Davidson, PNAS , 2003), and these kinetics were applied to the tempor al animation of the Boolean model. The results thus far are as follows: i, The model perfectly predicts the observed spatial domain of expression of each gene throughout the endomesodermal domains. ii, The model recreates the temporal dynamics directl y observed for the spatial patterns of expression of almost all genes, with a few exceptions; thus the model demonstrates by direct comparison between data and observation that the GRNs are essentially sufficient to explain causally the progression of spat ial regulatory states (the oral and aboral GRNs only up to 18h, the remainder to 30 h). iii, The model immediately pinpoints exactly where gaps in our knowledge remain. iv, The model can be used for in silico perturbation of the effects of 88ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 gene knockouts and experimental embryology, and thus we have shown that it almost perfectly predicts the regulatory changes occasioned by certain gene over -expressions and gene knockouts, and even recreates the regulatory results of a famous experiment in which transp lantation of early cleavage skeletogenic cells from the vegetal to the animal pole produces a second perfectly organized endomesoderm. (Dr. Isabelle Peter, Dr. Emmanuel Faure, Eric Davidson) iii. Oral and aboral ectoderm GRNs: In an effort to extend GRN analysis to most of the domains of the embryo, we are working out the GRNs for oral and aboral ectoderm specification, including about 50 more regulatory genes (the one remaining major territory, the apical neurogenic region, is not at present being studied in our laboratories). The ectoderm is a complex mosaic of spatial regulatory states. Both the aboral and oral ectoderms produce numerous sub-regional regulatory state domains, and they are separated by another territory with its own regulatory st ate, the neurogenic ciliated band. A very large amount of spatial expression analysis has been required to complete the roster of regulatory genes expressed in the ectoderm, and to unravel the constituent regulatory genes of the ectodermal domains abuttin g the endoderm, the remaining oral and aboral epithelia, the mouth region on the oral side, and the ciliated band. Complex inter - and intra - domain signaling events must also be taken into account. Based on extensive perturbation analyses and cis-regulato ry data, a GRN is emerging for the oral ectoderm that will soon approach the completeness of the endomesodermal GRNs. The aboral ectoderm GRN will require more analysis. GRNs wil l be encompassed in the predictive dynamic Boolean model, with the ultimate goal of extending such a model to nearly the whole embryo. (Dr. Enhu Li, Dr. Smadar Ben -Tabou deLeon, Dr. Julius Barsi) iv. High throughput cis-regulatory analysis, and its impact on GRN analysis: A recent technological breakthrough is revolutionizing t he processes of GRN validation and discovery, as well as vastly improving the efficiency with which cis -regulatory control systems can be analyzed. This is the development of multiplexed cis -regulatory analysis using vectors marked with \"bar - coded\" sequence tags, up to 130 of which can be injected together into a single batch of sea urchin eggs (\"nanotags\"). The individual vectors are regulated independently in vivo and their outputs can be de -convolved at once by NanoString technology. To this end a NanoString codeset was designed to recognize the barcode tag sequences. Expression of individual vectors can also be examined spatially since each vector also expresses GFP. The effects of perturbations of gene expression can now be determined at the sam e time on endogenous genes and on their cis - regulatory systems isolated by high throughput functional genomic scans. The uses of cis - regulatory nanotag technology include: i, scans of very large genomic regions to find cis - regulatory sequences in which l arge numbers of constructs can be assessed together; ii, time course measurements of quantitative output of >100 diverse cis -regulatory constructs at once; iii, effects of perturbations of regulatory state on large numbers of cis-regulatory constructs; iv, analysis of >100 mutant constructs in single experiments. (Dr. Jongmin Nam, Ping Dong) v. Specific cis-regulatory projects using high throughput methods: Cis -regulatory systems at certain GRN nodes are of particular importance, and many of these are the subjects of particular 89ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 experimental analysis . During this year cis -regulatory systems of the following genes, among others, were studied at the level of their sequence specific inputs and their functional meanings (some of these projects are now complet e and have been or will soon be published): Among genes currently or recently thus R. Andrew Cameron, Dr. Andrew Ransick; Dr. Sagar Damle*, Miao Cui) vi. Embryonic transcriptome analysis: A large -scale S. purpuratus transcriptome sequencing and analysis project has been carried out . RNAs from 10 timed embryonic stages, from various feeding larval stages, and from all accessible adult tissues have been sequenced in depth and assembled, and quantitative per transcript databases are in construction. Three valuable kinds of data have been obtained and after computational analysis are being mounted on our public sea urchin genomics database: i, We were able to correct erroneous gene models based on priori predictions from the genome sequence in over 1/3 of cases, using the actual mapped mRNA structure(s); we also added several thousand new genes to the genome annot ation; and we verified the remaining gene model predictions. The transcriptome data have vastly improved the usefulness and accuracy of the genome sequence. ii, The sets of transcripts expressed in each stage and tissue have been discovered, and classifi ed in terms of a custom ontology of our own construction. This ontology reflects the classes of particular interest to the research community to which we belong and which we serve, such as transcripts coding for immune proteins, for cytoskeletal proteins, for transcription factors, for signaling factors, for biomineralization proteins, etc. The ontological classes were based on the expert annotations of genes in the S. purpuratus genome project. iii, We now possess global data on dynamic changes in prevalence of given transcripts during development and on absolute values. These values lock in nicely with NanoString and QPCR measurements in most cases. There is an innumerable wealth of data of biological interest in this data set. As one example, the egg transcriptome provides a comprehensive definition of maternal mRNA ( which was first discovered in sea urchin eggs) both qualitatively and quantitatively, a subject now revisited for the first time in 30 years. (Dr. Qiang Tu, Dr. R. Andrew Cameron, Eric Davidson) vii. Physical isolation of embryonic cells expressing given regulatory states: Another technological breakthrough has been the development of methods for disaggregation of sea urchin embryos to the single cell level, and efficient FACS sorting, without significant loss of cells or reduction of viability. The cells are sorted on the basis of expression of recombineered BAC vectors, in which a flourophore is expressed under control of the cis -regulatory system of a gene canonically representing a given domain- specific regulatory state. Recoveries of expressing cells are quite acceptable, and controls show that the procedure does not affect the distribution of transcripts. The availability of this technology leads in two different directions: First, it will allow us to characterize the transcriptomes of many developmental compartments at different times, including complete knowledge of differentially expressed regulatory genes. This is the primary requirement for systematic extension of GRN analysis to later and more complex developmental stages, a major near future laboratory objective. Second, we can obtain the transcriptomes of cells 90ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 expressing given regulatory states. For example in skeletogenic cells isolated on the basis of expression of t wo different specifically expressed BACs all known biomineralization gene transcripts are enriched and other effector genes expressed specifically in these cells can now be accessed. In situ hybridization demonstrates that this procedure is extremely accurate in assigning cell type specific genes. This in turn will lead to construction of \"Global GRNs\" in which the control systems of all specifically expressed downstream genes (of given ontological classes) are discovered and linked into our current up stream GRNs. (Dr. Julius Barsi, Dina Malounda, Dr. Qiang option at the cis-regulatory level: The major mechanism of evolutionary change in GRN structure is co -option of regulatory and signaling genes to expressio n in new spatial/temporal domains of the developing organism. This means change of cis -regulatory modules at the sequence level, so that they respond to different regulatory states; or alternately, changes in the cis -regulatory modules of genes encoding t he spatial allocation of regulatory states. An excellent example is the use of Delta -Notch signaling to promote mesoderm specification in sea urchins, but to promote endoderm specification in sea stars (the sea urchin mode is the derived co - option). Sea stars and sea urchins shared a last common ancestor about 500 million years ago. To determine what happened in the lineage leading to sea urchins, we are carrying out a cis -regulatory study of sea star delta , for comparison to sea urchin delta , including cross -specific transfer of expression constructs. Current results show that though it is expressed quite differently in sea stars, a cis -regulatory module of sea star delta produces expression in sea urchin skeletogenic lineages, though no such lineage exists at all in sea stars. Thus it was aspects of the upstream regulatory state to which the delta gene responds that were co -opted in the evolution of the sea urchin skeletogenic lineage . (Dr. Feng Gao) ix. Eucidaris tribuloides , an evolution ary window on the origins of the euechinoid endomesoderm specification GRN: The euechinoids are the modern sea urchins, of which the main research model is S. purpuratus , for the last 40 years our laboratory workhorse. The euechinoids diverged from the Paleozoic precursor echinoid lineage about 275 million years ago. Eucidaris tribuloides is a descendant of the other surviving branch of echinoids deriving from the same common ancestor stock. Its endomesodermal specification process is quite different fr om that of S. purpuratus ; for example, it lacks a precociously invaginating skeletogenic micromere lineage altogether. Current results show the endodermal specification functions of E. tribuloides are similar to those of S. purpuratus , but its mesodermal specification is different in several respects. Its micromeres apparently produce delta signals as do those of S. purpuratus , but control of their specification is differently wired, and they fail to express key skeletogenic genes in pre - gastrular development. The pleisiomorphic specification GRN of E. tribuloides mesoderm will reveal exactly how that of S. purpuratus evolved since divergence. In addition, we are attempting to reprogram the development of the skeletogenic cell lineage in E. tribu loides , by inserting regulatory apparatus from S. purpuratus . We term this Synthetic Experimental Evolution. (Eric Erkenbrack) 91ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 x. New genomics projects: A large amount of additional echinoderm sequence is in process of being obtained. The leaders in this project are Richard Gibbs and Kim Worley at the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM -HGSC) in Houston, in close collaboration with us. An initial draft sequence of the genome of Lytechinus variegatus has been obtained, and the genomes of the sea star referred to above, Patiria miniata , and of E. tribuloides have been s equenced. Much additional genome sequence of S. purpuratus has also being obtained, so as to significantly improve its quality; and earlier skim sequences of tw o congeners, S. franciscanus and Allocentrotus (Strongylocentrotus) fragilis have been augmented. New sequencing projects underway will provide the genomic sequences of a brittle star and a sea cucumber; thus we will have genomes of four of the five echinoderm classes. All of these data are being curated and mounted on the public genome databases that we maintain and continuously augment. (BCM -HGSC, R. Andrew Cameron, Eric Davidson) xi. Additional research endeavors: Principles of developmental GRN design. We are formulating a general view of developmental GRN structure, and its implication for development and evolution. ( i) Developmental GRNs are deeply hierarchical. ( ii) They are composed of modular subcircuits ex ecuting discrete logic functions; ( iii) These subcircuits evolve at different rates within the same GRN and may have diverse evolutionary origins; ( iv) Multiple subcircuits are brought to bear on given developmental processes, including dynamic lockdowns b y feedback circuitry, to ensure that they function accurately and resiliently: the \"wiring\" is clearly not parsimonious in design; ( v) Different processes, e.g., embryonic spatial specification, terminal differentiation, physiological response, are contro lled by differently structured GRNs, which have different depths and are composed of different types of subcircuit. ( vi) GRN structure provides specific guides to processes by which body plans have evolved. (Dr. Isabelle Peter, Eric Davidson) Biotapestry . The GRN visualization software BioTapestry, developed by our collaborator Wm. Longabaugh (Institute for Systems Biology), is now in wide use, and we are further expanding its capacities so that it will automatically generate allowed network architectures from machine readable time and space of expression data plus results of perturbation analysis. A second - generation version with much enhanced capacities has been published. (Wm. Longabaugh, Eric Davidson) Recombineered BACs. Our BAC libraries have provided the source material for in vitro recombineered BACs used by the outside research community as well as ourselves. More than 100 different recombinant BACs from five echinoderm species have been constructed for use as reporter constructs, with the use of our own in house sequencing instrumentation. This includes constructs in which a fluorescent protein coding region (GFP, RFP, mCherry, Cerulean) has been inserted into the coding region of a gene of interest as well as numerous constructs in which cis - regulatory modules (CRM) have been deleted or specifically mutated. (Julie Hahn, Ping Dong, Miki Jun) 92ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Dynamic imaging of regulatory state clones. A method was perfected to allow periodic confocal imaging of immobilized embryos for many hours during development, and utilized to track clones of cells expressing given BAC constructs. A main result was the distinct cell behavior during gastrulation of veg2 cells expressing foxa , which execute convergent extension to the archenteron after 30h, vs.veg1 cells expressing evenskipped , which much later invaginate as a coherent cone to generate the hindgut. (Dr. Emmanuel Faure, Dr. Isabelle Peter, Dr. Mat Barnett*) Re-engineering the GRN to achieve a predicted cell fate switch. We used recombineered BAC vectors to place under control of a skeletogenic regulatory system a gene encoding an upstream regulator of pigment cell specification. On introduction into the embryo this BAC causes skeletogenic cells to switch fate and become differentiated pigment cells. Some cells adopt a mixed fate but many complete or nearly complete transformation to the pigment cell state. We observed a cryptic repression function that down regulates the skeletogenic GRN in the transformation process. (Sagar Damle*) Graduated, 2011 Additional Note: The Sea Urchin Research Resource. Sea urchin embryos (as well as embryos of other echinoderms) have remarkable advantages as an experimental system, and now, after 40 years of molecular biological experimentation on them a significant array of resources has become available. These embryos offer an easy gene transfer technology, with high throughput technologies available, which makes the sea urchin embryo an experimental system of choice for studying the genomic regulatory code. Reliable methods have been developed for high throughput measurement and for specific perturbation of gene expression in the embryo, as well as sensitive and dramatic means of visualizing spatial gene expression.For the species we work with ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) embryonic material is available at all seaso ns of the year. The embryos are optically clear, easily handled, remarkably able to withstand micromanipulations, injections and blastomere recombination and disaggregation procedures ; well understood and relatively simple embryonic process is known from over a century of research; and in -house egg- to-egg cultureis routine (in a special culture system we have developed, located at Caltech's Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory). Recent additions to our special research arsenal include the NanoString nCounter for simultaneous measurement of hundreds of transcript levels and a NanoString codeset targeting >200 interesting regulatory genes and some signaling ligands and receptors expressed during embryogenesis; plus >100 custom recombineered BACs, most including rel evant regulatory genes and some also special vectors or regulatory mutants. We have a rich collection of arrayed BAC libraries for many other species of sea urchin, and other echinoderms, at various degrees of relatedness to S. purpuratus . The genome of S. purpuratus been annotated at the Human Genome Sequencing Center (Baylor College of Medicine), as has the genome of another sea urchin used as a research model. We utilize additional experimental echinoderm models for evolutionary GRN comparisons, viz. the sea star Patiria miniata also of local provenance, and the (in pleisiomorphic \"pencil urchin\" Eucidaris tribuloides . Their The embryos of both these 93ERIC DAVIDSON LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 animals prove to be as excellent subjects for gene regulation molecular biology as is that of our usual sea urchin. The Center for Computational Regulatory Genomics R. Andrew Cameron, Director The Center for Computational Regulatory Biology and its subsidiary, the Genomics Technology Facility, is an integrated unit whose goal is to develop, refine and test computational approaches in genomics broadly and cis -regulatory analysis specifically. It conducts three overlapping areas of activity. The Genomics Technology Facility is a high -throughput library arraying and printing operation that generates arrayed libraries and clones (provided on request to the community). The operation of the Facility centers on a Genetix Arraying Robot, a large flatbed robotic arm with video camera used to produce bacterial macro -array libraries and filters. We currently maintain in -80\u00b0C freezers 27 different echinoderm libraries comprising a total of approximately three million arrayed clones. The Research Center carries out genomically oriented wet lab research, and works collaboratively with the transcriptome and genomics efforts. A major project at present is the use of newly available sequence data to explore t he mechanisms and rules of functional cis -regulatory evolution within the range of divergence times available in the various species of sea urchins for which genomic sequence and expression vectors are available. The Computational Branch supplies software and analysis to sea urchin developmental biologists and maintains databases fundamental to the Sea Urchin Genome Project, an initiative that began in the Davidson laboratory. Its major functions are maintenance of the sea urchin genome database and solution of ongoing genomics problems. An extensive website providing access to many kinds of genomics, transcriptome and gene expression data is maintained. The main work of the Computational Branch is continuous development and improvement of sea urchin genomics resources, including genome annotations, gene models, updates of sequence assemblies, and incorporation of the stream of new genomic sequence from HGSC. This information is mounted on the Sea Urchin Genome Project web site ( http://spbase.org/ ). (Dr. R.

A central problem in biology is to understand the principles of gene circuit design that govern the architecture and function of these circuits. Our lab tries to address this problem in three ways: First, we construct synthetic genetic circuits and study their behavior in individual cells. These synthetic circuits are simpler counterparts to the complex circuits one finds in nature. This 96MICHAEL ELOWITZ LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 approach - \"synthetic biology\" - allows one to analyze compare alternative circuit architectures in cells, and identify minimal systems sufficient to confer key biological functions. For example, we have constructed circuits that exhibit oscillations and other dynamic phenomena, (e.g., Elowitz & Leibler, 2000). We hav e used synthetic circuits to analyze the dynamics and variability of gene regulation at the single -cell level, (e.g., Elowitz et al., 2002, and Rosenfeld et al., 2005). We also make use of 're -wiring' perturbations to alter the architecture of natural genetic circuits, as in our recent studies of the genetic competence and stress response systems of Bacillus subtilis (S\u00fcel et al., 2006; S\u00fcel et al., 2007; Locke et al, 2011). Second, we analyze the dynamics of natural genetic circuits in order to understand basic principles of their operation. We have developed the ability to acquire and quantitatively analyze large time - lapse movie datasets. These movies allow tracking of circuit dynamics individual cells as they grow and develop. By incorporating several distinguishable fluorescent protein reporter genes in these organisms, we can track multiple circuit components simultaneously. The results constrain models of the corresponding circuits and provide insight into basic principles of differentiation (see S\u00fcel et al., 2006 and S\u00fcel et al., 2007), and regulation (Cai et al., 2008; Locke et al, 2011). Most recently, we have analyzed signaling through the Notch pathway in and between individual mammalian cells. This work showed that same -cell (cis) interactions between Notch and Delta lead to a situation where individual cells can 'send' or 'receive' signals, but cannot do both at the same time (Sprinzak et al, 2010). Third, we are analyzing the generation of variability within cell populations. Genetically identica l cells appear to actively generate variability, even in homogeneous environmental conditions. We focus specifically on two complementary questions: How do cells use intrinsic \"noise\" (stochasticity) in their own components to make effectively random cell fate decisions? And how do they suppress noise in order to operate reliably despite of variability. Current projects are examining these issues in Bacillus subtilis, a very simple prokaryote that exhibits both differentiation and development, as well as in more complicated mammalian cell culture systems. Recently, we have examined the role that noise plays in enabling an alternative mode of evolution through partially penetrant intermediate genotypes (Eldar et al., 2009). We have also studied the way in whi ch dynamic correlations of fluctuations in gene network dynamics can help identify active regulatory interactions (Dunlop et al., 2008). We have also begun to address these issues in mouse embryonic stem cells, which exhibit extensive functionally importan t heterogeneity. Projects in the lab make extensive use of mathematical models of genetic circuits. We are also developing software and tools to improve gene circuit construction and quantitative analysis of movie data. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ 97MICHAEL ELOWITZ LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Images from left to right: Professor Michael Elowitz Bacillus subtilis bacterial micro -colony responding to stress by modulating the frequency of stochastic pulses of activation of a key transcription factor.

Our approach has been to develop imaging tools that are sufficiently robust so that the movements, lineages and gene expression in living cells can be analyzed as an adjunct to the techniques more typically employed by systems biology. Systems biology provides a means to organize the explosion of data from molecular approaches and the dramatic progress from in vitro culture assays, but it requires some means to test the proposed linkages. Our goal is to test these proposed mechanisms in the intact embryo, with the hope of moving forward to an understanding of which of the potential mecha nisms operate in the natural biological context. There are many challenges to such tests, including the tagging of cells or molecules so that they can be followed in the intact system, the visualization of the tagged structures, and the interpretation of the time -varying events these images represent. Solutions to these challenges require the coordinated efforts of researchers spanning the life and physical sciences. In the past year we have made significant advances in imaging fast events in the develop ing embryo, ranging from the movements of cilia in the developing ear and left -right organizer and the flows these cilia generate, to the workings of the beating heart as it takes shape. This has required the development of new image acquisition and proce ssing tools that offer quantitative analyses of the key events. These tools are proving to be generalizable to other systems such as the Drosophila embryo , offering access to events that have previously been too difficult to address. In parallel with the refinement of new imaging tools, we have been creating new and more efficient means for creating embryos with genetically encoded fluorescent tags. Through random insertion into the genome, this approach permits the creation of functional fusions between a host protein and a fluorescent protein, permitting cells and developmental questions to be posed in normally developing embryos. The creation of these new lines is dramatically more efficient than previous approaches, making it possible for even modest -sized facilities to embark on large -scale screens. This increased efficiency of creating marked strains requires a parallel increase in imaging technologies, and the refinement of in toto image acquisition and analysis tools answers this challenge. Recent ly we have translated our imaging tools to clinical utility, with the hope of creating fast and accurate diagnostic tools for age- related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. These tools are able to generate striking images of the retinal vasculature and determine photoreceptor health, offering rapid and non- invasive diagnostics for eye disease processes before vision loss. There have been dramatic advances in other areas as well, ranging from the refinement of new sensor technologies with rese archers in the Kavli Nanoscience Institute, to improved tools for acquiring information from MRI images and collecting 4D light microscopic images. Our 100SCOTT FRASER LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 combination of modern and classical technologies continues to offer surprises and insights. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Scott Fraser Imaging of live heart in a transgenic zebrafish using our new gene trap technology (blue: tropomyosin; red: desmin) Imag ing of the vasculature in a healthy human eye without the use of exogenous dyes.

Signaling between cells is crucial in animal physiology, and yet, there aren't actually that many signaling pathways in animal cells. According to last count, only about a handful of signaling pathways function in early embryogenesis. The very small number of pathways contrasts with the unimaginably diverse processe s in which they participate. Moreover, these few signaling pathways are highly conserved in animal cells. Why are so few enough? Our challenge is to understand the properties of these signaling pathways. We are interested in understanding the molecular co mponents of these pathways, as well as the properties to which the molecular architecture as a whole gives rise. We are interested in understanding what the pathways do, as well as what they can do\u2014even in the parameter regime unexplored by the cells, because this may be a critical factor during evolution when new environmental challenges arise. With theoretical and experimental work on the canonical Wnt pathway, we are beginning to build insights into what allows this pathway to be so conserved in evo lution and yet so versatile in function. The current work in the lab is divided into: (1) A deeper investigation into the novel principle of fold -change detection we discovered in the Wnt pathway; (2) Investigation into the properties that facilitate tissu e-specificity of the pathway; and (3) Investigation into the implementation of the Wnt pathway in patterning the embryos. 103BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Professor of Biology: Bruce A.

For further information on Hay lab research consult our web page (http://www.its.caltech.edu/~haylab/). One goal of our work is directed towards understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate cell 104BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 death, proliferation, innate immunity, microRNA function, and spermatogenesis. We use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to identify genes that function to regu late these processes. Important cellular regulatory pathways are evolutionarily conserved; thus, molecules identified as regulators of these processes in Drosophila are likely to have homologs in vertebrates and the pathways that link these molecules are likely to be regulated similarly. A second goal of our work addresses three questions in population biology. 1) Can we bring about reproductive isolation (speciation) between populations of plants or animals that otherwise freely interbreed? Answers to this question have application to the growing number of situations in which plants and animals are engineered to show specific pharmaceutical or agricultural traits. In brief, we would like to be able to limit gene flow between engineered organisms and th eir wild counterparts. 2) Can we engineer the genetics of populations so that they drive themselves to local extinction? For example, invasive non -native plants and animals cause substantial economic losses. A number also cause substantial environmental damage, leading in many cases to extensive range reduction and/or extinction of unique, endemic species. Our goal is to develop genetic tricks that drive local extinction of invasive species and disease vectors. 3) Can we drive genes into wild populatio ns so that all individuals express a trait of interest? With regard to this last aim, we are particularly interested in developing transgenic insects that will prevent transmission of mosquito - borne pathogens that cause malaria and dengue fever. More than 500 million people are infected with the malaria parasite each year, resulting in 1 -3 million deaths, while dengue, a mosquito -borne virus, infects more than 100 million people each year, resulting in more than 25,000 deaths. Effective vaccines do not exist, and in the case of malaria, the causative agent, the parasite Plasmodium falciparum has acquired resistance to many drugs. Vector suppression through the release of sterile males, the use of insecticides, or modification of the environment provides an important tool for limiting mosquito -borne disease. However, each approach has limitations. Release of sterile males provides only transient population suppression, insecticides affect many non-target species and mosquitoes often evolve resistance to these compounds, and wholesale modification of the environment may not be feasible, or desirable in many situations based on ecological concerns. Our goals are two -fold: to develop transgenic insects that lack the ability to transmit these pathogens (pri marily as collaborations with other labs); and to develop genetic tools for driving these genes into wild populations of insects, thereby blocking disease transmission. Approaches similar to those described above can also be used to tackle diseases of agr icultural interest. One disease of current interest is known as citrus greening disease (also known as Huanglongbing; HLB). HLB is caused by the bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter , which is transmitted to the citrus plant by an insect, the phloem feeding citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri . The disease is difficult to detect and current methods of control involve either regular use of insecticides or - once the tree is infected - tree destruction. HLB threatens to effectively eliminate the citrus industry in many areas in the US. We are interested in working with the citrus industry to develop transgenic insect -based approaches to prevent HLB. 105BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 We are also interested in the molecular mechanisms that underlie parthenogenesis - the ability of females to reproduce wit hout males. While parthenogenesis is known to occur in many different animals, the molecular mechanisms that allow a switch from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction are unknown for any species. To get at this question we have sequenced genomes of sexual and parthenogenetic versions of Drosophila pallidosa and are using classical mapping and RNA -seq approaches to identify the genes involved. Drosophila models of human neuro -degenerative diseases ( Ming Guo (and the Guo lab), Haixia Huang, Bruce A. Hay, Nikolai Kandul ). In collaboration with the Guo lab at UCLA we are studying Drosophila models of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Guo, M. et al. (2003) Hum. Mol. Genet. 12:2669- 2678; Clark, I.E. et al. (2006) Nature 441:1162- 1166). We are particularly interested in understanding how disruption of mitochondrial function contributes to these diseases. Gene activation screens for cell death regulators: MicroRNAs, small non -coding RNAs, define a new fami ly of cell death regulator ( Haixia Huang, Bruce Hay ). We have carried out several screens for cell death regulators in the fly and have identified a number of new molecules. Among these are multiple microRNAs, small noncoding RNAs that function by inhibit ing translation of target transcripts. We are interested in determining when and where these molecules regulate death, as well as the nature of their targets. We are also designing microRNAs that target known cell death regulators as a way of probing the function of these proteins in specific contexts. Cell death, caspases and IAPs (H. Arno J. M\u00fcller, Soon Ji Yoo, Bruce A. Hay ). In flies and vertebrates most, if not all, cells can undergo apoptosis in the absence of new gene expression, indicating that t he components required to carry out apoptosis are present and ready for activation. The core of the cell death machine consists of members of a family of proteases known as caspases, which become activated in response to many different death signals. Active caspases then cleave a number of different cellular substrates that ultimately lead to cell death and corpse phagocytosis. Most if not all cells constitutively express caspase zymogens (inactive precursors) sufficient to bring about apoptosis. Thus, the key to cell death and survival signaling revolves around controlling the levels of active caspases in the cell. Several basic strategies are used to regulate caspase activity, and the core proteins that drive caspase- dependent death are evolutionarily conserved. In Drosophila many cells experience chronic activation of the apical cell death caspase Dronc. If unrestrained, active Dronc cleaves and activates downstream effector caspases that bring about cell death. Cells survive because they express t he IAP DIAP1, which suppresses Dronc activity, as well as that of caspases activated by Dronc. One major pathway through which caspase -dependent cell death in flies is induced is through the regulated expression of pro- apoptotic proteins that disrupt DIAP 1-caspase interactions through several different mechanisms, each of which has the effect of unleashing a cascade of apoptosis -inducing caspase activity. We are interested in several questions. 1) What are the signals that lead to caspase activation in c ells that would normally live? 2) How do IAPs regulate caspase activity and when and where does this regulation define points of control? 3) How is IAP activity regulated? 4) And 106BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 finally, as discussed further below, how do caspases, IAPs and their regul ators work to regulate non-apoptotic processes? We are using both genetic screens and biochemical approaches to identify the critical molecules. Caspases and their regulators in a non -apoptotic process, spermatid differentiation ( Haixia Huang, Geoffrey Pi ttman ). We have found that multiple caspases, acting through distinct pathways, acting at distinct points in time and space, are required for spermatid individualization, a process in which spermatids (which develop in a common cytoplasm) become enclosed i n individual plasma membranes and shed most of their cytoplasm Huh, J. et al. (2004) PLoS Biology 1:E15). Spermatid individualization is an evolutionarily conserved process, but little is known about how it is brought about. Several questions are of inter est to us: 1) What are the upstream signals that drive caspase activation? 2) What are the nonapoptotic targets that facilitate differentiation? 3) How is cell death prevented in the face of high levels of caspase activity that would normally be associated with cell death? 4) Do caspases play similar roles in promoting spermatid differentiation in mammals? 5) Can we manipulate the biology of spermatogenesis so as to bias gamete production so that males produce gametes carrying the Y chromosome, but not the X chromosome? Elements with these characteristics, if they are located on the Y chromosome, are predicted to drive a population to extinction through the generation of male -only populations. Cell death and the innate immune system (Bruce A. Hay). As d iscussed above, many IAP family proteins inhibit apoptosis. IAPs contain N -terminal BIR domains and a C -terminal RING ubiquitin ligase domain. Drosophila by inhibiting caspases. Apoptosis initiates when proteins such a s Reaper and Hid bind a surface groove in DIAP1 BIR domains via an N -terminal IAP Rpr - Hid -dependent apoptosis, but little is known about DIAP2's normal functions. We generated diap2 null mutants, which are viable and show no defects in developmental or stress -induced apoptosis. Instead, DIAP2 is required for the innate i mmune response to Gram -negative bacterial infection (Huh, J. et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282:2056- 2068). DIAP2 -kB homolog Relish, and this requires the DIAP2 RING domain. Increasing the genetic dose of diap2 results in an increased immune response, while expression of Rpr or Hid results in down- regulation of DIAP2 protein levels. Together these observations suggest that DIAP2 can regulate immune signaling in a dose-dependent manner, and that DIAP2 is regulated by IBM- containing proteins. Therefore, diap2 may identify a point of convergence between apoptosis and immune signaling pathways. Driving genes for disease refractoriness into wild pest insect populations with Medea selfish genetic elements ( Sandler, Bruce A. Hay ). An attractive approach to suppressing mosquito -borne diseases involves replacing the wild -insect population with modified counterparts unable to transmit disease. Mosquitoes with a diminished capacity to transmit Plasmodium have been identified in the wild and created in the laboratory, demonstrating that 107BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 endogenous or engineered mosquito immunity can be harnesse d to attack Plasmodium . However, a critical unanswered question is how to spread these effector genes throughout the areas inhabited by disease -transmitting insects. Epidemiological and modeling studies suggest that it will be necessary to rapidly replace a large percentage of the wild mosquito population with refractory insects in order to achieve significant levels of disease control. Because insect disease vectors are spread over wide areas and can migrate significant distances, mass release of refractory insects associated with simple Mendelian transmission of effector -bearing chromosomes is unlikely to result in a high enough frequency of transgene -bearing individuals. Compounding this problem, enhancement of immune function in insects is often cost ly, requiring tradeoffs with other life history traits such as longevity and fecundity that decrease fitness. Therefore, it is likely that insects carrying effector transgenes will be less fit than their wild counterparts, resulting in a decrease in the fraction of individuals carrying genes for refractoriness over time. These observations argue that population replacement will require coupling of genes conferring disease refractoriness with a genetic mechanism for driving these genes through the wild population at greater than Mendelian frequencies. Maternal -effect lethal selfish genetic elements in the flour beetle Tribolium casteneum have the following behavior: when present in a female, they must be inherited in the next generation in order for the offspring to survive. The molecular nature of these elements (known as Medea elements) is unknown, but their spiteful genetic behavior (they cause the death of those who fail to inherit them, giving a relative transmission advantage to those that do carry them) makes them attractive candidates to mediate drive because it is predicted to lead to rapid spread of the element within the population even if it carries an associated fitness cost. Medea's ability to spread, and the time it takes to become present in all individuals, is a function of fitness cost and introduction frequency. The plot in Figure 1 describes the number of generations required for Medea to be present in 99% of individuals, for a Medea element with an embryonic fitness cost (resulting from the presence of a cargo transgene designed to protect from disease, for example). Homozygous Medea :non-Medea introduction ratios are indicated on the Y axis, and embryonic fitness cost on the X axis. Area between lines indicates regions of parameter space within which a specific number of generations (indicated by numbers and arrows) are required for the frequency of Medea individuals to reach a frequency of 99% or greater. Line color, shown in the heat map at right, provides a measure of how many generations are required. Black lines (50+) indicate that fifty or more generations are required. The border between the black -lined region and 108BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 the lower unlined region defines the critical Medea :non-Medea introduction ratio, below which Medea will be eliminated from the population . The molecular biology of endogenous Medea elements is unknown, but the genetics suggests a model in which Medea consists of two linked genes: The first encodes a toxin that is expressed only in the female germline, with effects that are passed to all progeny. The second encodes an antidote, expressed under the control of an early zygote - specific promoter (Figure 2). Mothers that carry a Medea element express a toxin (red dots) that is inherited by all oocytes (small ovals). Embryos (larg e ovals) that do not inherit Medea die because toxin activity (red background) is unimpeded (lower left square). Embryos that inherit Medea from the mother (upper left square), the father (lower right square) or both (upper right square), survive because expression of an antidote early during embryogenesis (green background) neutralizes toxin activity. We imagine that Medea is comprised of two closely linked genes (upper left). We created synthetic Medea elements in Drosophila that can drive populatio n replacement (Figure 4) and that are resistant to recombination -mediated dissociation of drive and effector functions. These elements (Figure 3) result from zygotic rescue of a maternal loss -of-function that results in embryonic arrest. During oogenesis a maternal transcript is synthesized (green dots), whose product is required for early embryogenesis. In females carrying a Medea , the first transgene (the toxin) drives maternal drives maternal germline -specific expression of microRNAs that silence expres sion of the gene whose product is required for early embryogenesis. This results in 109BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 inheritance of a lethal condition - the loss of an essential maternally deposited product - by all oocytes/embryos. Progeny survive the embryonic arrest thereby induced if they inherit from their mother a tightly linked transgene driving early zygotic expression of the maternally silenced gene just in time to restore embryo development, but they die if they fail to inherit it. Sensing and killing dengue and yellow fever virus- infected cells in their insect host ( Kelly J. Dusinberre, Zachary Sun) Dengue and yellow Fever virus infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. The virus must enter and replicate inside mosquito midgut cells, disseminate throughout the body and ultimately i nfect the salivary gland (7 -14 days later), in order to be transmitted to a new individual during a subsequent blood meal. Our goal is to develop transgenes that are phenotypically neutral when expressed in uninfected individuals, but that kill virus -infected cells and/or the mosquitoes themselves. The virus encodes several activities that are not present in uninfected host cells. These include a viral polyprotein protease, and RNA -dependent RNA polymerase. We are developing molecules that sense these activities and cause the death of cells and insects in which they occur, thereby preventing disease transmission to humans. Engineering reproductive isolation and population replacement using a synthetic underdominance system (Kelly Dusinberre, Katie Ken nedy, Mario Zuba, Jennifer Hu, Anna Buchman). The Medea system detailed above is very good at spreading genes into populations distributed over large areas, provided that modest levels of migration occur. This is ideal for situations in which the goal is to carry out population replacement in large regions. However, some communities may favor an approach in which population replacement is restricted to a local environment (Lets see how it does in your back yard, before trying it in mine). This creates a challenge: how to spread genes within a local environment, but maintain a barrier to migration - driven spread and fixation in surrounding regions. To address this need we are developing the 110BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 synthetic underdominance system illustrated in Figure 5. In this syste m homologous chromosomes carry toxin -antidote pairs in which the toxin present on chromosome A (Killer 1) is linked to an antidote (Rescue 2) that represses Killer 2. Killer 2 is located at the same position on the homologous chromosome B, linked with an a ntidote (Rescue 1) that represses Killer 1 (Figure x). In such a system, organisms can only survive if they carry A and B chromosomes (in A/B individuals), or only wildtype (+) chromosomes (in +/+ individuals). A/+ and B/+ individuals die. A and B chromoso mes will also carry genes that confer resistance to disease transmission. Such a system has two interesting features. First, it constitutes a simple method for engineering reproductive isolation (speciation). Matings between +/+ individuals produce viable progeny, as do matings between A/B individuals. However, mating between +/+ and A/B individuals produce only A/+ and B/+ progeny, which all die. This simple technology has a number of potential applications and provides a platform from which to explore s ome of the evolutionary consequences of reproductive isolation. Second, it provides a method for driving genes into a local environment in such a way that they are unlikely spread to fixation in surrounding regions through migration. In brief, for underdom inance, as with Medea elements that carry a fitness cost, a threshold frequency must be achieved in order for spread to occur at all. With single locus underdominance this threshold is quite high (66%) (Figure 6, left panel). In two - locus underdominance (Figure 6, right panel), the two toxin -antidote cassettes are located on non -homologous chromosomes. In this configuration more transgenic progeny can survive in crosses to wildtype, and thus the introduction threshold required for spread to occur is signifi cantly lower, 33%. Once the threshold is crossed, these underdominant systems drive the wildtype chromosomes out of the population by causing their death in individuals that carry A or B, but not both. The A/B genotypes have great difficulty in spreading into surrounding regions through migration because as they migrate into areas composed largely of +/+ individuals, they are more likely to mate with +/+ individuals than with A/B individuals, resulting in the likely death of progeny that carry one but not the other. We are 111BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 developing several versions of underdominance in Drosophila and are working to move these systems to mosquito species. Sensing and responding to normal and abnormal microRNA expression ( Nikolai Kandul ). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non -coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by suppressing the translation or promoting the degradation of transcripts to which they hybridize. Importantly for our purposes, when miRNAs are perfectly complementary to their target transcripts, transcript cleavage and degradation results. It is clear that miRNA expression is deregulated in many disease states. In addition, many viruses encode miRNAs that promote viral replication and/or suppress host defense systems. Our goal is to develop methods for sensing the expression of a particular miRNA, and then transducing this signal into changes in gene or protein expression. This will allow us to monitor the levels of miRNA expression in living animals. It will also allow us to regulate cellular physiology in res ponse to the levels of particular miRNAs. Predicting the fate of gene drive systems and their cargos in the wild ( John Marshall, Bruce Hay, Catherine Ward, Jennifer Hu) . As we develop gene drive strategies we need to be able to predict how they are likely to behave. A number of questions arise: Under what ecological and population genetic conditions will drive chromosomes spread? What are the likely epidemiological consequences of spread in terms of disease prevention? What are the likely functional lifeti mes of these elements in the wild? What are the possibilities for removal and replacement of first - generation elements with second -generation elements? We are using mathematical modeling and computer simulations to address these issues for a number of dif ferent drive strategies. How many possible ways are there for driving genes into populations, resulting in either population replacement or population elimination? ( John Marshall, Bruce Hay ). We are interested in identifying all the ways in which genes, gene complexes, or entire chromosomes can promote their own spread into populations. This analysis may identify novel mechanisms by which populations have been shaped in the wild. It may also identify mechanisms that could be used to drive genes into popula tions, either providing them with some desirable trait, or driving the population towards an inviable genotype and extinction. We are particularly interested in identifying those mechanisms that can be thought of as consisting of combinations of genes with toxin and antidote activities as these can in principal be engineered, and may also have evolved in the wild as a consequence of epistatic interactions between genes. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Bruce Hay Eugene Delacroix's \"Medea\" Title 112BRUCE HAY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Marshall, J.M. and Hay, B.A. (2012 ).

Epidemiologic and clinical reports reveal a dramatic increase in immune disorders: inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Emb oldened by the 'hygiene hypothesis' proposed two decades ago, scientists have speculated that lifestyle changes (vaccination, sanitation, antibiotics) have predisposed developed societies to these disorders by reducing bacterial infections. However, the hypothesis remains without explanation as our exposure to most bacteria does not result in disease. Mammals are colonized for life with 100 trillion indigenous bacteria, creating a diverse ecosystem whose contributions to human health remain poorly underst ood. In recent years, there has been a revolution in biology toward understanding how (and more importantly, why) mammals harbor multitudes of symbiotic bacteria. We have recently demonstrated for the first time that intestinal bacteria direct universal development of the immune system; thus fundamental aspects of mammalian health are inextricably dependent on microbial symbiosis. Furthermore, it is now 114SARKIS MAZMANIAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 clear that all of the diseases in question astonishingly involve a common immunologic defect found in the absence of symbiotic bacteria. As we have co -evolved with our microbial partners for eons, have strategies used against infectious agents reduced our exposure to health -promoting bacteria, ultimately leading to increased disease? We propose that the human genome does not encode all functions required for health, and we depend on crucial interactions with products of our microbiome (collective genomes of our gut bacterial species). Through genomics, microbiology, immunology and animal models, we wish to define the molecular processes employed by symbiotic bacteria that mediate protection from disease. Advances in the past year have now made it possible to mine this untapped reservoir for beneficial microbial molecules. Ultimately, understanding the i mmune mechanisms of these symbiosis factors may lead to natural therapeutics for human diseases bas ed on entirely novel biological principles. __________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to Right : Professor Sarkis Mazmanian Bacteria Colonizing the Gut PUBLICATIONS 2012 Hsiao EY, McBride SW, Chow J, Mazmanian SK, Patterson PH.

Land plants develop in two directions, up and down - with up being the shoot and its accompanying leaves and flowers, and down the root. We concentrate on the shoot, and on the set of stem cells that continuously provides the cells for the shoot throughout the growth of the plant. This set of cells is called the 116ELLIOT MEYEROWITZ LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 shoot apical meristem. It utilizes a number of different pattern -forming processes that are as yet poorly understood. First, the maintenance of the stem cell populations in the shoot meristem is mediated by peptide hormone communication between different regions of the meristem. The peptide CLAV ATA3 signals to the cells below the pluripotent stem cells in the apical region called the central zone via transmembrane receptor serine- threonine kinases that include CLAVATA1 and additional and related members of the plant leucine- rich repeat receptor kinase family. Recent progress on this system includes the finding that CLAVATA1 experiences ligand -induced internalization, which buffers the receptor system to wide ranges of CLAVATA3 concentration, and that in the related brassinosteroid receptor system, a step in formation of the active kinase signaling complex is movement of a receptor -associated protein from plasma membrane to cytoplasm. Secondly, there is a system of small -molecule hormone perception and feedback involving the plant hormones termed cytokinins. These have been shown to play a central role in maintenance of the fixed gene expression domains in the shoot meristem, which remain constant even as cells move through the domains to become differentiated parts of the plant (stem, leaves and flowers). One recent advance in this area has been the development of a computational model that relates cytokinin concentration to the formation and maintenance of different domains of gene expression in the shoot apical meristem. One prediction of the model, a feedback of the CLAVATA system on cytokinin synthesis, was confirmed. Finally, there is another large feedback network in which the plant hormone auxin is actively moved through the meristem by its transporter, and initiates formation of leaves a nd flowers in the geometric patterns that are easily recognized in pine cones, sunflowers, and the like. A recent discovery here is that the subcellular position of the PINFORMED1 auxin transporter, which determines the direction of auxin flow, is determi ned in response to physical stresses in the meristem. The auxin transport system therefore responds both to chemical and physical cues, and serves as a nexus in the mediation of plant responses to mechanical stress. A recent step in this area has been th e demonstration that the microtubule cytoskeleton, which reads out the direction of anisotropic stress, is under stress control in plant cells other than meristem cells as well as in meristem cells, giving some generality to the meristem observations. Encapsulating the dynamic data and feedback between different modes of signaling in these developing tissues has led us to develop mathematical models of plant development, in which the dynamic data we gain from live imaging of growing plant tissues leads to hypotheses expressed as sets of equations, which when solved in a computer model the processes occurring in the real plant. The results from the computer are then used to predict experimental results, and new results are used to refine and alter the models. This iteration brings us closer to robust models of development, and therefore to an understanding of developmental principles. We call this approach to developmental biology Computational Morphodynamics. 117ELLIOT MEYEROWITZ LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 _____________________________________ _________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Elliot Meyerowitz Section of vegetative plant with PIN1::GFP and REV::VENUS fluorescence (photo by Ying Wang) Shoot apex with epidermal nuclei in green, chloroplasts in red (photo biologists.

This developmental process is distinct from many of the developmental systems studied at Caltech, becau se hematopoietic stem cells provide a continuing source of new T cell precursors throughout life, and development of new T -cell cohorts is mobilized in fetal life, neonatal life, and on through adulthood. This system is also distinctive because it is particularly good for shedding light on the stepwise choices the cells need to make in 119ELLEN ROTHENBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 order to complete their differentiation as T cells. Blood precursor cells need to migrate to the thymus and expose themselves to sustained Notch1 -Delta -like 4 (DL4) interactions in order to be triggered to differentiate into T cells. All the steps from multipotent precursor to committed T - lineage cell occur in this thymic environment, where cells in each stage are relatively easy to isolate, characterize, and manipulate. Thus we have been able to learn that these cells pass through a hierarchical decision tree that involves: the choice not to become a red blood cell or a platelet, the choice not to become a B cell, the choice not to become a macrophage or granulocyte, the choice not to become an antigen -presenting dendritic cell, and finally the choice not to become a natural killer cell, which leaves only various T -cell fates as the last options. This last decision concludes the T -lineage commitment process. The goal of r esearch in this lab is to understand not only how the cells acquire the properties they will need to work as T cells, but also why the options that remain open to the precursors still are open, and how the cells make the decisions they do at each branch point. The answers we are interested in provide explanations in terms of specific transcription factor actions in gene regulatory networks. A convergence of cell biological and molecular biological studies has revealed that the main events in early T -cell d evelopment can be broken into two major phases, split by the conclusion of commitment. Although both phases are normally dependent on Notch1 -DL4 signaling, they involve different \"jobs\" for the cells. The first phase seems to drive the precursors to prol iferate, with only limited acquisition of T -cell characteristics. The cells then cross the boundary into the second phase, when they reduce their proliferation and activate the full T -cell differentiation program. The clean division between these two pha ses appears to be crucial to avoid derangement of T-cell development and progression toward lymphoma. One of the regulators we have studied for many years, the Ets -family transcription factor PU.1, now emerges as a principal actor in the first phase. This factor can participate in gene regulatory networks pushing the cells to several different fates, but its early T -cell role is kept focused by interaction with Notch pathway signals. We have found evidence that in this context, PU.1 is a direct positive r egulator of multiple genes involved in the self -renewal circuit operating in phase 1 pro-T cells, based on a convergence of data chromatin immune precipitation analyzed by deep sequencing (ChIP -seq) and on gain and loss of function perturbation experiments. PU.1 must then be repressed during commitment, and we have gained insight into new cis -elements and unexpected deployments of trans -acting factors that probably cause PU.1 to be repressed during the transition from phase 1 to phase 2. We have also determined the identity of a factor that may be a major switch controller at the transition from phase 1 to phase 2, and this turns out to be the T -cell specific zinc finger factor Bcl11b. We have shown that if Bcl11b is deleted, phase 1 pro- T cells fail to undergo commitment, spawning non -T cells abnormally even in the presence of ligands . Intriguingly, Bcl11b knockout pro -T cells uncouple proliferation from differentiation, gaining the ability to keep proliferating as long as growth factors are available without developmental progression. The cis - and trans -elements required to turn Bcl 11b on can be equated with those that define T -lineage identity, and so they are a major focus of our current work. Further, the mechanism through which 120ELLEN ROTHENBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Bcl11b works to bring about commitment involves identifying its own direct target genes and interactio n partners, and that has become another important focus. Bcl11b's action at the last major identity determination point for T -cell precursors may involve network interactions with competing phase 1 regulators, and the gene regulatory network aspects of its role are another important project. The strong punctuation created by the phase 1 \u2014phase 2 transition machinery provides a new framework in which to view the roles of other essential T -lineage factors, like GATA -3, that have long appeared to have parado xical roles. GATA -3 and TCF -1 (encoded by the Tcf7 gene) are the two factors that are initially induced by Notch signaling to distinguish the first T -cell developmental stages before commitment. GATA- 3 especially has been difficult to study because its level needs to be very precisely regulated in developing T cells. The methodology we have developed to dissect stage -specific actions of PU.1 and Bcl11b has now given us more insight into the reasons why GATA -3 levels must be so tightly titrated for T cell development to proceed. Our ChIP -seq analyses of GATA -3 binding sites reveal that the phase 1 \u2014phase 2 split may not only alter the constellation of available regulatory factors in the nucleus but also alter the deployment of those factors that are presen t throughout the transition. We proposed an initial gene regulatory network model to account for the T -cell development pathway three years ago, based on the effects of transcription factor perturbation on the expression of multiple developmentally regulated genes. The newest iteration of our network model has just been published. Network construction has illuminated the need for three additional kinds of information in order to complete and confirm the model. First, a more complete \"parts list\" for the T-cell specification process: we needed to know all the transcription factors and potential signaling systems that might be candidates for regulatory roles. Second, we needed a way to locate the candidate cis -regulatory sites at which these factors might work on their target genes. Third, we needed better tools for dissecting the roles of these factors via stage -specific loss or antagonism of function. To address the first and second needs, we have carried out a major survey of all the changes in both R NA expression and epigenetic histone marks throughout the genome as the cells progress from the earliest T -cell development stages to commitment and beyond. This enterprise, carried out through a collaboration with the Wold lab, has yielded a broad and de tailed picture of the cis - and trans -regulatory changes at each stage of the T -cell specification process. Now, to verify direct functional effects of transcription factors on target genes in a stage -specific way, we have also developed a combination of i nducible deletion and dominant negative strategies that resolve direct and indirect positive and negative regulation. Another way we have sought to establish causality is by tracking the regulation of PU.1 and Bcl11b expression over time in individual cell s by live imaging. This work, carried out in collaboration with the Elowitz lab, is based on following the expression of key regulatory genes under defined developmental conditions by tracking fluorescent protein transgenes inserted into the genome under the control of the PU.1 or Bcl11b cis -regulatory elements. We are able to track cells and their descendants across least three cell cycles as they select different developmental fates 121ELLEN ROTHENBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 in real time, and thus transcription factor gene regulation changes can be directly coupled with the changes in developmental status of living cells. The commitment process is not only a way for T -cell precursors to renounce other hematopoietic fates; it is also closely intertwined with poorly understood events that will go on to influence the subspecialization of T -cell fate that the cells will undertake, and even to determine whether or not they will be allowed to survive in the T -cell lineage. A long -standing project in the lab has been to study the variants of this program in genetically distinct mouse strains with potentially altered T - cell generation. Genome -wide transcriptome analysis now suggests that one genetic background associated with immunological defects also causes important defects in phase 1 to phase 2 progr ession of thymocytes. These early defects can undermine later developmental checkpoint control and lead to a high -penetrance preleukemic phenotype. At substantial frequency, these cells can then progress to malignancy, in which the persistent phase 1 gene expression serves as a hallmark for a specific early T -cell precursor type of acute lymphoblastic lymphoma related to a virulent form of T -ALL in humans. Thus the accurate regulation of the transition from phase 1 to phase 2 in the early stages of T -cell development not only works to regulate the size of the pro -T cell pool, but also may be a matter of life and death for the organism.

We use large - scale whole genome observations to reveal the genes and cis -regulat ory modules (CRMs) that comprise these networks and defined experiments to understand how they come together to control cellular behaviors during development. Most of our studies have focused on early embryonic development up to and including gastrulation in Drosophila melanogaster , as large gene expression changes and strong cell movements are required to turn the totipotent blastula into a multi -layered embryo of distinct cell types. The Drosophila system allows us to use a variety of methods to study gene regulatory networks (GRNs) functioning during development: genetics, biochemistry, site -directed transgenesis, and now also live imaging. In particular, we are interested in 1) how gene expression is controlled from a dynamical standpoint and 2) how ce ll movements during development are regulated. These are inter -related problems. For example, in the Drosophila embryo, the function of many genes expressed along the dorsal -ventral axis is to coordinate mesoderm cell movements at gastrulation. 124ANGELIKE STATHOPOULOS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 To assay progression of developmental events, we develop and employ novel technologies for making temporally relevant observations using live in vivo imaging, computation including mathematical modeling, and molecular biology. Using such a combined approach, we ha ve made progress toward the study of morphogen gradients as well as collective cell movements. Previous studies had attempted to infer dynamic events from analysis of fixed embryo sections, because imaging into the yolk- filled Drosophila embryo had been a formidable challenge. However, overcoming imaging challenges using new approaches we designed allowed us to produce dynamical data, which upon analysis has provided many new insights into developmental processes. Therefore, a major thrust of our future research directions will be to continue to advance technology and methodology to support quantitative data acquisition for study of developmental systems. We strive to understand: 1) cis -regulatory mechanisms controlling developmental gene expression in space and time, 2) how the GRN structure can influence patterning/differentiation/signaling, and 3) how cellular behaviors are organized during collective cell movements. These are inter -related problems that are relevant for development of all animals, and as such these studies also have the potential to have far -reaching implications. The study of development is beautifully complex and, therefore, full understanding of this process requ ires broad research plans including (but not limited to): deciphering cis -regulatory logic; formation and function of morphogen gradients; analysis of both the control and collective nature of cell migration; and study of the regulation of cell adhesion, s urvival, and proliferation. Currently there are 5 main research projects in the l ab: 1) How levels and dynamics of the Dorsal transcription factor influence dorsal -ventral patterning. 2) Interactions between concurrently acting cis -regulatory modules: parallel and serial activation, and rules of order. 3) When gradient dynamics are instructional: the Hedgehog morphogen gradient in the Drosophila wing disc. 4) Mesoderm spreading during gastrulation: a multistep process influenced by signaling pathways and adhesive properties of cells. 5) Comparative studies of migrating groups of cells using imaging, quantitative analysis, gene expression profiling, and mutant screens. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Angelike Stathopoulos Cross- sections of Drosophila embryos showing Dorsal levels and gene expression along the dorsal -ventral axis Quantitative analyses of mesoderm cell spreading during gastrulation shows movements are directed 125ANGELIKE STATHOPOULOS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Bae Y, Trisnadi N, Kadam S, and Stathopoulos A.

ELEGANS DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR Summary : We seek to understand how a genome controls development, physiology, and behavior. We use Caenorhabditis elegans molecular genetics to understand detailed mechanisms, and functional 127PAUL STERNBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 genomics to obtain global views of development and behavior. We try to couple tightly computation and experimental data, in part to use computation to make experimental tests more efficient. Moreover, we study other genomes, genetics, and biology of other nematodes to help us comprehend C. elegans , to learn how development and behavior evolve, and to learn how to control parasitic and pestilent nematodes. Our behavioral studies focused this year on sexual attraction, sleep, host finding by parasitic nematodes , and response of nematodes to fungal predators . We have continued to study the chemicals (ascarosides) that constitute mating pheromone made by hermaphrodites (morphologically females but that make sperm for internal self -fertilization) and sense d by males. We hypothesize that ascarosides are a diverse family of nematode signaling molecules. To test this hypothesis we continu ed our collaboration with the labs of Art Edison and Frank Schroeder to purify mating cues from other nematode species. W e discovered the male and the female cues from Panagrellus redivivus to be ascarosides. We then looked directly for ascarosids in a variety of species and found that each species makes a distinct but partly overlapping set of ascarosides and the species te sted respond to different spectrum of ascarosides. To study parasite behaviors, we are using two genera of insect killing nematodes that are used in insect biocontrol because they deliver toxic bacteria to their hosts. One key discovery this year is that Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae use the same sensory neuron as C. elegans to respond to carbon dioxide. Steinernema carpocapsae is able to jump onto insects, and we are trying to understand the genetic and cellular basis for this amazing behavior, as well as its evolutionary origin, as only members of this genus can jump. The ascomycete Arthrobotrys oligospora attracts and kills soil nematodes. We are analyzing the odors produced by A. oligospora that attract C. elegans and characterizing the neural response to those odors at a molecular and circuit level. We have used channel rhodopsin to faithfully activate a neuron, as evidenced by whole- cell patch electrophysiology neuronal activity in a pre -synaptic cell expressing channel r hodopsin and then in its post -synaptic partner. Now that this system is validated, we are expressing channel rhodopsin and a genetically -encoded calcium sensor in a range of specific neurons to be able to examine neuronal circuit properties. One of these properties is the sleep -like state exhibited by C. elegans during four periods of developmental lethargus preceding each larval molt. The infective juveniles (IJs) of H. bacteriophora and S. carpocapsae are analogous to the dauer larvae of C. elegans . Developing C. elegans larvae choose between proceeding directly to reproductive development or to arrest development as dauer larvae, depending on population density (signaled by several ascarosides) and the amount of food available. We are studying ho w larvae make this all -or-none decision by deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA -seq) during the decision process. In the area of cell regulation, we have continued to study WNT and EGF signaling to define new components, how these two pathways interact, and what determines the specific outcomes of 128PAUL STERNBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 common signals. For this study we focus on the C. elegans vulva, a paradigm for analyzing organogenesis. In one project, we are using the polarity of the vulval secondary lineage to study how multiple types of WNT receptors act in concert or antagonistically. This year we discovered that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling works with WNT in this process. EGF controls development via the RAS/MAPkinase pathway and behavior via phospholipase C -gamma pathway. We had previously found that the EGF -receptor acts in a single neuron, ALA, to control a sleep -like state. We are testing other conserved signaling pathways for common roles in sleep regulation, and using calcium imaging to examine neuronal function dur ing worm sleep. We had discovered that a network of three homeobox -containing transcriptional regulatory proteins regulate expression of the EGF -receptor and other genes in the ALA neuron, and are now defining the cis -regulatory elements that respond to these homeobox proteins. We are trying to learn how to efficiently define cis -regulatory elements using computational analysis to predict elements, and functional assays in transgenic C. elegans to test our predictions . For example, we tested some of our methods on elements that direct expression in the DVA neuron, which we had previously shown to control the extent of body flexion during locomotion. For a number of projects, we want to identify all the genes that are expressed in a particular cell at a particular time. We thus are trying different methods of obtaining a transcriptional profile from a single cell; our current method is to microdissect a GFP -labeled cell using a modified patch clamp electrophysiology preparation, and amplify the cDNA and sequence libraries of cDNA. The male linker cell described below was our first test case. We have started extending this approach to other neurons, including the ALA and several sensory neurons. We started a new project on cell migration to understand both normal organogenesis and potential migratory programs that might be accessed by metastatic tumor cells. The C. elegans male linker cell (LC) underg oes a complex migration with changes in direction, speed, and morphology. An initial functional screen for genes involved in LC migration identified the Tlx ortholog nhr-67 as being necessary for the middle parts of the migratory program, such as negative regulation of the netrin receptor unc -5 to allow a ventral turn. We have profiled the transcriptome of individual LCs by microdissection, amplification, and cDNA deep sequencing. This study identified about 800 LC-enriched genes whose functions we are n ow analyzing, including a number of conserved proteins of unknown function that we predict will have roles in migration in human cells. Our efforts in genomics are experimental and computational. We worked with Caltech's Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genome Laboratory to determine the genomic sequence of several nematode species using only short sequencing reads. The first was a new Caenorhabditis species (angaria) that is an outgroup for the five existing sequenced species of this genus. We used cDNA sequence data to help assemble larger than gene- size pieces of this genome. By comparing the C. angaria genome to other Caenorhabditis species, we identified thousands of short, high conserved sequences that we hypothesis are regulatory. In addition, we have sequenced, assembled and 129PAUL STERNBERG LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 carpocapsae , an insect -killing nematode that can jump onto hosts (see below) and four other Steinernema species as well . We helped analyze the genome of the anima parasite Ascaris suum , and are also helping to sequence and analyze the genome and transcriptomes of the sheep parasite Haemonchus contortus . To understand parasites we think it is useful to understand free -living nematodes, so we are analyzing additional free -living worms, including Panagrellus redivivus . We continue to organize, store, and display information about C. elegans and to extend these efforts to other nematodes. With our international team of collaborators, we present this information in an Internet -accessible database, WormBase ( www.wormbase.org ). Our major contribution is to extract information from th e literature, focusing on gene, protein, and cell function; gene expression; gene -gene interactions; and functional genomics data. Annotation of gene function includes use of the Gene Ontology (GO; www.geneontology.org , and we are extending these ontologies as part of the GO Consortium. To facilitate these processes, we have developed Textpresso ( www.textpresso.org ), a search engine for biological literature. In collaboration with other model organism databases, we have applied Textpresso to the literature of C. elegans , Drosophila, Arabidopsis , nematodes in general, mouse, and several human diseases.

We often use muscle development, degeneration, and regeneration as a model system. This network is one among a large class whose members govern how cell fates and states are specified, executed and maintained. The approaches we take to these problems make heavy use of genome- wide and proteome -wide assays to extract connectivity relationships and evolutionary relatedness. Evolution of networks is studied in co llaboration with Paul Sternberg and his group to compare mammalian and worm networks, and with John Allman and his group to compare selected brain networks of primates and rodents. A longstanding goal for us is to understand regulatory events that drive t he progression of multipotential mesodermal precursor cells or adult stem cells to become determined unipotential muscle progenitors and, finally, fully differentiated cells. We currently study these cell states and transitions using functional genomics t ools based on high throughput DNA sequencing methods (RNA -Seq, ChIP -Seq etc., coupled with comparative genomics. In mouse and other vertebrates, the muscle lineage arises from paraxial mesoderm to produce muscle (also bone, skin and fat, among other deriv atives). Skeletal myogenesis is governed by both positive - and negative -acting regulatory factors. The MyoD family of four closely related, positive -acting transcription factors are key. Upon transfection, each can trigger 134BARBARA WOLD LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 nonmuscle recipient cells enter, and often to execute, the myogenic differentiation program. Our working model emphasizes that MyoD family factors are able to do this because they are highly connected and cross talk within their group and with other collaborating factors (like MEF2 factors) and other regulators that now include microRNAs. It is also clear that negative regulators of skeletal myogenesis are probably just as important for regulating the outcome, as are the positive regulators. Multiple negative regulators of skeletal m uscle are expressed in multipotential mesodermal precursors and in proliferating muscle precursors (myoblasts). It is generally believed that some of these are important for specifying and/or maintaining precursor cells in an undifferentiated state, thoug h exactly how the system works is unknown. This focuses attention on defining the in vivo target repertoire for the repressors, and learning their relationship with the positive -acting regulators. To obtain the genome -wide input and output maps for multi ple activating and repressing regulators, we were motivated to develop ChIPSeq and RNASeq methods (Johnson et al., 2007; Mortazavi, Williams et al., 2008 and below). We have been working to add to and improve these methods and the related informatics, which are increasingly concerned with integrating these diverse datasets. The basic methods produce high resolution in vivo protein:DNA interaction maps and quantitative RNA expression profiles. By mapping in vivo factor occupancy maps for key regulators and learning how the maps change from one cell state to another, members of the group are trying to address some longstanding puzzles: What distinguishes sequence motifs in the DNA that are actively bound by their cognate regulators in vivo from other motif instances that are identical in sequence but are not similarly bound? How does factor occupancy relate to transcriptional output of target genes? What is the target promoter repertoire for a given bound regulator? Work by Brian Williams, Ali Mortazavi, Gordon Kwan, Tony Kirilusha, Georgi Miranov, Katherine Fisher and Gilberto DeSalvo contribute to this series of studies. The MUSSA/MUSSAGL infor matics tools (previous work of Tristan DeBuysscher, Diane Trout and Brandon King) have been used to find candidate conserved regulatory elements in both worm and mammalian phyla. This is part of an ongoing partnership with the Sternberg lab that involves several joint projects (see Steven Kuntz and Ali Mortazavi entries below and in the Sternberg lab section). The ultimate goal is to learn enough about the structure and function of cis -regulatory elements to be able to identify them in the genome computat ionally and to be able to predict their functional output with minimal new experimental data. At the network level, we seek insights into the evolution ancient gene networks that drive myogenesis across the large phylogenetic distances separating worms, m ice and humans to define protein:protein complexes in the network more comprehensively, we developed a collaborative effort with Ray Deshaies and Sonya Hess in the Beckman Proteome Exploration Lab. This enabled postdoctoral fellow Libera Berghella to identify a repressor activity (encoded by the MSY3/csda gene) that acts on myogenin in mature myotubes (Berghella et al ., 2008). It operates through a very highly conserved cis-acting DNA sequence element in myogenin, which appears to have two distinct functi ons, one acting in early development to open the gene for transcription, and a second, repressive function that operates later on during muscle innervation and maturation. Our group is also part of the NIH Project ENCODE, in collaboration the Rick Myers, W ing Wong and Gavin Sherlock groups at Stanford and Hudson Alpha Institute. In this project we contribute 135BARBARA WOLD LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 measurements of transcription factor:genome interactions and transcriptome structure in human ES cells and other cell lines and develop methods of analysis, including a study of RNA editing across the transcriptome (see entry by Ali Mortazavi, and SoCAL BSI summer interns, Wendy Lee and Alicia Rogers). ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Barbara Wold Long RNA pol2 -positive at the locus muscle Katherine Fisher, Ali Mortazavi, Lombeyda Single -cell transcriptomics for characterization of cell- to-cell variation in cell populations and expression diff erences between rare cell types shown is the expression of a set of stem -cell ide ntity related genes in several d ifferent individual stem cells Credits: Daniel Kim, Brian Williams, Georgi Marinov PUBLICATIONS 2012 Li, Guoliang and Fisher -Aylor, Katherine I. and Mortazavi, Ali and Wold, Barbara (2012) Extensive Promoter- Centered Chromatin Interactions Provide a Topological Basis for Transcription Regulation.

Targets of RNAi are recognized through complementary base -pairing interactions with small RNAs that act as guides to RNAi effector complexes. Several distinct classes of endogenous small RNAs regulate gene expression states to impact diverse biological processes. Our l ab focuses on understanding the nature and biological functions of small RNA pathways in animals. We have identified and characterized an evolutionary conserved small RNA pathway that operates in germ cells and that is critical both for germline stem cell maintenance and for gametogenesis. Working in Drosophila and mice, we discovered a new class of small RNAs, Piwi -interacting (pi)RNAs. Piwi/piRNA pathway plays an important role in genome integrity by repressing selfish repetitive elements. A characterization of piRNA sequences in combination with genetic studies revealed that the biogenesis and function of piRNAs differs from that of other classes of small RNAs. While canonical small RNAs, such as microRNAs, affect gene expression post- trans criptionally, our 140ALEXEI ARAVIN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 studies suggest that piRNAs most likely serve as guides for de novo DNA methylation in mouse male germ cells. We are interested in two general questions: biogenesis and function of small non -coding RNAs. Biogenesis of piRNA Processing of piRNAs differs from that of other known classes of small RNAs. It was shown piRNA are produced independently of Dicer, the nuclease that generates siRNAs and microRNAs from double -stranded substrates; however, the proteins that are responsible for producing piRNAs are only partially understood. Our investigations of piRNA biogenesis led us to the ping- pong model that proposes amplification of piRNAs in a cycle that depends on the nuclease activity of Piwi proteins themselves. One of the central mys teries of repeat silencing in both mammals and flies is how repeats are distinguished from genes and selectively silenced. We are investigating the nature of the determinants that make a particular sequence a target of the Piwi pathway. We are using biochemical purification of Piwi - piRNA complexes and genetic approaches to identify proteins involved in piRNA biogenesis. Functions of the Piwi pathway and piRNA -guided de novo DNA methylation We showed that the piRNA pathway is linked to de novo DNA methyl ation in the mouse germline. One of the three murine Piwi proteins is specifically found in germ cell nuclei during the critical window when de novo methylation patterns are established. We also showed that Piwi proteins at that developmental timepoint a re associated with piRNAs that target several classes of transposable elements. The same transposons are de -repressed and their genomic sequences lose methylation in Piwi-deficient mice. The discovery that piRNAs may guide DNA methylation in germ cells is an important finding for several reasons. First, it provides a new paradigm for how small RNAs can affect gene expression. Second, it explains how a subset -of-sequences are tagged for de novo methylation. How methylation sites are defined remains a central mystery of epigenetics. An important goal of my lab is to define the pathway by which piRNAs guide de novo DNA methylation. We also study whether the piRNA pathway can be re -programmed to new targets and can be used to manipulate DNA methylation patterns in somatic cells. It is clear that germ cells, somatic stem cells and probably cancer stem cells possess unique pathways for small RNA -mediated silencing. Our long -term goal is to understand how diverse RNA silencing mechanisms are integrated wit h other pathways in context of development and pathology. Eventually, the knowledge gained from the investigation of silencing mechanisms in stem and germ cells will help us to understand the unique biology of these cells and will impact our general under standing of gene regulation and how it is altered in disease. Epigenetic regulation of transposable elements in cancer Genomes of mammalian species, including humans, are swamped by genomic parasites, transposable elements (TE). About one half of the human genome is occupied by hundreds of thousands of TE copies. It is likely that transposable elements deeply intervene wi th cellular regulatory networks. It was speculated that on evolutionary timescale TEs are beneficiary for their hosts providing genomic plasticity necessary for natural selection. Analogously, it is possible that 141ALEXEI ARAVIN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 TEs help to increase genome and epigenome plasticity of cancer cells and bring them competitive advantage and adaptability. We attempt to comprehensively investigate the role that TEs play in cancer. We study changes in chromatin structure, expression and mobilization of TEs associated with cancer development using several complementary approaches. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ PUBLICATIONS 2012 Muerdter F, Olovnikov I, Molaro A, Rozhkov NV, Czech B, Gordon A, Hannon GJ, Aravin AA.

The basic science revolves around various aspects of control of immune function . Over 25 years ago we discovered the inducible transcription factor NF -kB, later shown to be a master regulator of inflammatory and immune processes, and we continue to examine its properties . Most recently we have co ncentrated on two aspects of NF -kB, how it can produce a response that varies over more than 24 hours after its induction and how it is tuned down after induction. The timing issue has turned out to involve control by intrinsic properties of the different genes induced by NF -kB, mainly the half -life of the mRNAs and control over the timing of splicing . The tuning down involves many factors, one being feedback regulation by the NF -kB -induced microRNA miR - 146a downregulates TR AF-6 and IRAK -1 in macrophages and T cells so that a knockout of this microRNA leads to hyperactivation of the cells by LPS and a slower resolution of T cells responses to antigen. The consequence is hyperproliferation of the two- cell types and, after a y ear, frank myeloid cancer . We are deconvoluting the roles of the two cell types in cancer induction . We have also examined other microRNAs that are involved in immune processes like miR -155 and miR -125b. MiR -125b overexpression induces aggressive cancer in less than six months involving both myeloid and lymphoid disease . In a separate program, we are investigating how lentiviruses activate dendritic cells. The translation al studies derive from the development of viral vectors that can mediate changes in immune function, a program we call Engineering Immunity. In one aspect , we are focusing on lentiviral vectors that encode T cell receptor genes able to program patient T cells to react with melanoma cells . Here we collaborate with colleagues at UCLA and have an active clinical program under way . In a second program, which we call Vectored ImmunoProphylaxis or VIP, we are using Adeno Associated Virus -derived vectors to program muscle cells to make broadly reactive and potent antibodies against HIV and other pathogens. This program, presently carried out using mice that harbor a human immune system, is in transition to clinical evaluation in humans . Originally, we had hoped to do this with lentiviral vector programming of hematopoietic stem cells and th at program remains active, focusing on IgA production, which appears more potent than IgG, especially for blocking mucosal challenge. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor David Baltimore Immunofluorescence microscopy of muscle tissue following administration o f AAV vector expressing ZsGreen Structural representation of Adeno -Associated Virus 8 used to deliver anti -HIV antibody genes to muscle tissues for Vectored ImmunoProphylaxis. 144DAVID BALTIMORE LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Balazs AB, Chen J, Hong CM, Rao DS, Yang L, Baltimore D.

In addition to using X - ray crystallography and biophysical techniques to analyze protein -protein interactions in solution, 146PAMELA BJORKMAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 we use electron tomography and confocal microscopy to image interactions in cells, examining, for example, transport pathways mediated by the class I MHC -related neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), a receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG). We also are applying our antibody structure to \"engineer immunity\" against HIV. Classical class I MHC proteins present peptide antigens derived from self - and nonself proteins to T cells during immune surveillance. The MHC structure seems ideally suited for its antigen presentation function, in that i t includes a groove that is perfectly shaped to accommodate short peptide antigens. MHC homologs share similar three -dimensional structures with classical MHC molecules but have different functions, including immune functions (antibody transport by FcRn; evasion of host immune responses by viral MHC mimics) and nonimmune functions (regulation of iron or lipid metabolism by HFE and ZAG; chaperoning pheromone receptors by M10 proteins). Our crystal structures revealed that FcRn, HFE, ZAG, M10, and the poxviru s protein 2L do not present peptides and therefore play no role in conventional adaptive immune responses. The FcRn, HFE, and 2L grooves are collapsed, and cocrystal structures with their respective protein ligands show that each uses a protein -protein int eraction mode different from MHC interactions with peptides or T cell and other receptors. Our structure of 2L complexed with the host inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor - (TNF) revealed the structural basis for its picomolar affinity for TNF and may facilitate design of anti -inflammatory protein drugs. By contrast, the grooves of ZAG, M10, and the human cytomegalovirus MHC mimic UL18 are open and theoretically capable of antigen binding, but only UL18 associates with peptides. These results rais e questions about the primordial function of the MHC fold: Did it originally arise for peptide presentation/T cell interactions as part of the adaptive immune response (a relatively recent acquisition of the vertebrate immune system), or did it arise for the seemingly more ancient functions of protein transport or metabolite regulation? Perhaps surprisingly, our results suggest the former. Our studies of MHC homologs provide striking examples that structure does not always dictate function: similar structur es can adopt different functions, and conversely, similar functions can be accomplished by very different structures. We extended our characterizations of FcRn, an MHC -related receptor for IgG antibodies, to include cell biological studies of intracellular trafficking. FcRn is the receptor that transfers maternal IgG to the bloodstream of fetal and newborn mammals, thereby passively immunizing the neonate against pathogens likely to be encountered prior to development of its own fully functional immune syst em. Transfer of IgG involves trafficking of FcRn -IgG complexes in acidic intracellular vesicles across an epithelial cell barrier in the placenta (for prenatal transfer) or the intestine (for postnatal transfer). A general question exemplified by FcRn traf ficking is how cargo -containing intracellular vesicles are transported to their correct ultimate locations \u2014for example, how does the cell know that FcRn -IgG complexes should be transported across the cell for eventual release of IgG into the blood, whereas other receptor -ligand pairs should be transferred to degradative compartments? 147PAMELA BJORKMAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 To study the process by which FcRn -IgG complexes are correctly trafficked across cells, we use electron tomography, a form of electron microscopy, to derive three- dimensional m aps of transport vesicles in neonatal rat intestinal epithelial cells at resolutions of 4 -6 nm. To facilitate these studies, we developed gold- labeling and enhancement methods to locate individual IgG fragments bound to FcRn inside intracellular vesicles. Our three -dimensional images of IgG transport reveal tangled webs of interlocking IgG -containing transport vesicles, some of which are associated with microtubule tracks to allow movement via motor proteins. Other IgG -containing vesicles include multivesic ular bodies, normally associated with degradative functions but apparently functioning in IgG transport in the specialized proximal small intestinal cells of a neonate. To complement these high- resolution, but static, studies, we do fluorescence imaging in live cells, which allows tracking of labeled vesicles and quantification of the velocities and directions of FcRn -positive vesicles. We have used fluorescent imaging to characterize the intracellular trafficking pathways of two other Fc receptors: the pol ymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which transports polymeric IgA antibodies into secretions, and gE -gI, a viral Fc receptor for IgG. We discovered that gE -gI exhibits a pH -dependent affinity transition for binding IgG that is opposite that of FcRn: FcRn binds tightly to IgG at acidic, but not basic, pH, so as to bind IgG inside acidic vesicles during transport and to release IgG upon encountering the slightly basic pH of blood; by contrast, gE -gI binds IgG at the pH of blood but not at the pH of intrac ellular vesicles. We are testing the hypothesis that circulating IgG taken up by gE -gI by receptor -mediated endocytosis is destined for degradation after dissociating from gE -gI in acidic intracellular vesicles, which could form part of a viral mechanism to escape from antibody -mediated host immune responses. In addition to studying antibody receptors, we began project s to improve upon the binding and neutralization properties of antibodies with the ultimate goal to design and generate specified antibodies or antibody -like proteins with desired properties; for example, neutralizing antibodies or designed antibodies engineered to bind more tightly to a pathogen or to recruit immune effector cells. The antibodies could be produced in vivo by gene therapy techniques, thus allowing longterm production. We have focused our studies on anti -HIV antibodies, in part because HIV is very successful at evading the human immune system and conventional vaccine candidates have failed to elicit an effec tive response. D eveloping potent reagents that could be delivered through gene therapy or passive immunization would therefore greatly impact the field of HIV research and treatment. We have designed , produced , and tested novel anti -HIV protein reagents in an effort to find proteins with increased efficacy in HIV neutralization. Although HIV has evolved to evade most or all antibodies (hence the difficulty of finding an immunogen capable of eliciting a strong neutralizing antibody response in vaccine development efforts), an attractive feature of a gene therapy approach is that we are not limited to the traditional architecture of an antibody. Thus we can produce and express antibody -like proteins of different sizes (to facilitate access to hidden 148PAMELA BJORKMAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 epitopes ) and valencies (i.e., with different numbers of combining sites) and/or link antibodies to HIV- binding proteins such as the host receptor CD4. In our initial efforts, we developed CD4 -antibody fusion proteins that cross- react to neutralize a broad range o f HIV strains, and characterized a dimeric form of an anticarbohydrate antibody, 2G12, that displays a 50- to 80- fold increased potency in the neutralization of clade B HIV strains. We also proposed a previously unappreciated general mechanism that HIV uses to evade antibodies. Our hypothesis states that an anti -HIV antibody fails to potently neutralize because it can only bind using one of its two antigen -binding sites. Simultaneous engagement of both antigen - binding sites leads to a synergistic effect cal led avidity, in which the antibody -antigen interaction can become nearly irreversible. With most viruses, antibodies bind with avidity because the antigenic spikes are present on the viral surfaces at high densities, a feature that is absent on HIV. The sm all number of antigenic spikes on the surface of HIV are mostly separated by distances that are too large to allow simultaneous engagement of both antibody -combining sites. In addition, the structure of the HIV spike trimer prohibits simultaneous binding of both combining sites to a single spike. We are currently generating libraries containing two HIV-binding proteins joined using either protein or DNA linkers and are developing high -throughput screening and selection strategies to identify bivalent reagen ts that enable simultaneous binding by both antigen- binding sites, either within a spike or between spikes . A potent reagent that exhibits avidity would reduce the concentration of antibody required for sterilizing immunization to realistic levels. In addition to designing new architectures of antibodies, w e are using s tructural biology to investigate the features that make anti -HIV antibodies broad and potent. We solved a co- crystal structure of the CD4 -induced antibody 21c in complex with CD4 and a cl ade C gp120. This was the first crystal structure of containing a clade C gp120, and also revealed the first visualization of an auto -reactive antibody complexed with , supporting hypotheses that auto -reactivity is a feature of many anti -HIV antibodies . We also recently determined the structure of another antibody -antigen complex (NIH45 -46-gp120) . We then used structure -based design to create NIH45- 46 G54W, a CD4 -binding site (CD4bs) antibody with superior potency and/or breadth compared with other broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. We recently produced effective variants of NIH45 -46G54W designed using analyses of the NIH45 -46/gp120 complex structure and sequences of antibody -resistant HIV clones. One mutant, 45-46m2, neutralizes 96% of HIV strains in a cross -clade panel and viruses isolated from an HIV - infected individual that are resistant to all other known bNAbs, making it the single most broad and potent anti -HIV antibody to date. The informat ion we gain using a combination of structural biology and bioinformatics allows us to both design more broad and potent reagents and gain a better fundamental understanding of the neutralization mechanisms of anti- HIV antibodies. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Pamela Bjorkman 3-D reconstruction derived from electron tomography of the lateral intercellular space between two intestinal epithelial cells.

We think that myosin and kinesin are reasonably well understood, although new experimental results from time to time surprise us. On the other hand, we have very little knowledge or understanding of the functioning of the axonemal dyneins that power the movements of flagella and cilia; these molecular complexes are a major challenge for the future. Since retiring from experimental work in the last century, I have continued to use computer simulation methods to explore ideas about motor enzyme function in situations ranging from experimental studies on individual motors to an intact flagellum containing tens of thousands of dyneins. Current work is focused on identifying aspects of dynein function that are required to fully explain experimental observations of cyclic bending movement of a single pair of axonemal doublets.

The mechanisms that suppress such instability are of the utmost interest in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer. Our lab studies the components of the DNA replication apparatus that promote genomic stability. We use yeast genetics and biochemistry, Xenopus egg extracts, and human cells. At least seven human diseases characterized by cancer predisposition and/or premature aging are correlated with defects in genes encoding DNA helicases. The yeast genome contains 134 open reading frames with helicase motifs, only a few of which have been characterized. Martin Budd in our laboratory identified the first eukaryotic helicase essential for DNA replication, Dna2. He showed by interaction studies that it was a component of the machine that is required for accurate processing of Okazaki fragments during lagging -strand DNA replication. Enzymatic studies to elucidate the sequential action of the DNA polymerases, helicases, and nucleases required for this processing constitute an ongoing mechanistic biochemist ry project in the laboratory. Okazaki fragment processing represents the heart of the replication machine, and our studies have revealed that, as in prokaryotes, the replisome is not a machine made up of dedicated parts like its namesake the ribosome. Ins tead, the replisome is a dynamic structure with proteins constantly exchanging 152JUDITH CAMPBELL LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 protein and DNA partners to coordinate the rapid and high fidelity synthesis of the anti -parallel leading and lagging strands of the DNA template. Our current work focuses on the regulation, by reversible acetylation and phosphorylation, of the protein/protein and protein/DNA hand -offs that we have defined over the last decade. One model of cellular aging suggests that accumulation of DNA damage leads to replicative senescence. Most endogenous damage occurs during S phase and leads to replication fork stress. At least three human diseases of premature aging or cancer predisposition - Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund -Thompson - are caused by defects in helicases that interact with Dna2. Martin Budd and Laura Hoopes found that dna2 mutants have a significantly reduced life span. Microarray analysis by Isabelle Lesur showed that the dna2 mutants age by the same pathway as wildtype cells; they just age faster. Interestingly, the human Bloom and Werner genes complement the replication defect of dna2 mutants, suggesting that Dna2 works in the same pathway with these genes. We have now shown that the Dna2 helicase works with the yeast BLM ortholog, Sgs1, in the major pathway of double -strand break repair in yeast and are studying the same process in both yeast and human cells. Together Dna2 and Sgs1 are involved in the initial resection of the 5' terminated strand of the DSB to produce a single -stranded 3' end. This is a crucial step because it is where the cell decides whether to pursue the relatively error -free homologous recombination pathway or the more error -prone non- homologous end -joining repair. The 3' end generated by Dna2/Sgs1 is involved in strand invasion of the homolog and thus, the initiation of strand exchange. Perhaps even more important the single -stranded DNA is a key intermediate in the activation of the cell cycle checkpoint that protects the cell from genome instability in the presence of a double -strand break arisi ng from replication fork failure. In collaboration with Dunphy lab, we readily showed that Dna2 also participates in resection in Xenopus egg extracts. We have now reconstituted the recombination machine both from purified yeast proteins and from purified human counterparts, including Dna2 and BLM helicase. BLM helicase is defective in one of the most cancer -prone diseases yet described, Bloom syndrome. Cells from these patients show a high frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and quadriradials. The biochemical approach provides a mechanistic basis for this dynamic recombination processing machine. Especially for the human proteins, this provides insights previously unavailable due to the difficulty of performing recombination experiments in human c ells. Telomeres, i.e., the ends of linear chromosomes, are a special case of the type of ends found at DSBs. Not surprisingly, Dna2 also plays a significant role at telomeres. In fact, the bulk of Dna2 is localized to telomeres and in yeast, this localiz ation is dynamic. During G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, Dna2 is at telomeres. During S phase Dna2 leaves telomeres and is present on the replicating chromatin. Dna2 is also mobilized from telomeres in response to the induction of intrachromosomal d ouble -strand breaks with agents such as bleomycin. At the end of S phase, telomeres become single -stranded in all organisms and this occurs through 5' resection to produce single -stranded 3' overhangs. We have now shown that Dna2 is one of the major enzymes involved in resection at telomeres, as well as internal DSBs. It will be important to investigate if the same holds true in human cells with Dna2 knocked down by shRNA. 153JUDITH CAMPBELL LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Judith Campbell DNA Replication Forks in Harmony Supplementary Figure 1: Model for DNA end resection after replication stress.

DSBs are first processed by MRN (brown circles)/CtIP (yellow to generate short (blue circles), DNA2 (red pacman) or EXO1 (not shown) are necessary for long range resection to produce ssDNA that is capable of binding RPA (purple oblongs). Long range resection is also needed to effect an ATM to ATR switch. RPA bound to DNA is hyperphosphorylated thus promoting ATR phosph orylation of Chk1, induction of cell cycle checkpoint and efficient DNA damage repair. Long range resection precludes the engagement of the NHEJ pathway by preventing the hyperphosphorylation of DNA -PKcs. 154JUDITH CAMPBELL LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Pokharel, S and Cambpell, JL (2012) Crosstalk between the nuclease and helicase activities of Dna2: Role of an essential iron -sulfur cluster domain.

Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that undergo continual cycles of fusion and fission. The equilibrium of these two opposing processes determines not only the overall morphology of mitoc hondria in cells, but also has important consequences for mitochondrial function. Our research falls into several broad areas: (1) What are the cellular and physiological functions of mitochondrial fusion and fission? (2) What is the molecular mechanism o f mitochondrial membrane fusion and fission? (3) What role do mitochondrial dynamics play in human diseases? (4) How are mitochondrial genomes packaged and maintained? (5) What regulatory mechanisms maintain the quality of mitochondria? 156DAVI D CHAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 .

Ubiquitin is attached to proteins by a cascade of enzymes comprising ubiquitin -conjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin ligases protein degradation via the ubiquitin -proteasome system (UPS) at multiple levels, including the regulatory circuitry that acts upstream of ubiquitin conjugation pathways that control cell division, the ubiquitin ligases that mediate attachment of ubiquitin to proteins, and the mechanism by which ubiquitin -modified proteins are brought to the proteasome and degraded . We seek to discover new components of the UPS and uncover basic knowledge about how components of the UPS work, how their activities are regulated, what their substrates are, and how they contribute to cellular regulation . We also seek to develop drugs that target UPS enzymes for use as research tools . Given that defects in the UPS lead to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune disease, we anticipate that a better underst anding of the UPS will provide insight into diseases that afflict millions of people . We hope that this insight leads to novel therapies. 158RAYMOND DESHAIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 SCF and the Cullin- RING Ubiquitin Ligase Family : Our work to understand the biochemical mechanism by which yeast cells enter into the S phase of the cell division program where they duplicate their chromosomes led us to discover the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase, one of whose functions is to attach ubiquitin to a protein known as Sic1 . Sic1 restrains chromosome duplication by -phase -promoting cyclin -dependent kinase . Immediately binds Sic1 and attaches ubiquitin to it. An enzyme complex known the 26S proteasome then degrades cyclin -dependent kinase is released from Sic1, so that it can promote chromosome duplication. Although SCFCdc4 was discovered as a regulator of chromosome duplication in yeast, we now appreciate that it is the archetype of a large f amily of ubiquitin ligase enzymes that share a similar modular architecture. This family is defined by a module composed of a cullin subunit and a RING subunit, and hence these enzymes are referred to as cullin -RING ligases (CRLs) enzyme via the RING subunit and a substrate -binding module . This brings substrate and E2 enzyme into proximity to enable substrate ubiquitination. There are nine cullin -related proteins in turn, binds the F -box domain of a substrate receptor protein . There are 69 F -box proteins in human cells, and thus potentially as many as 69 distinct SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, each with a d ifferent substrate specificity . Each cullin uses a different linker protein to recruit a different family of substrate receptors . All told, there may be up to 240 CRLs in human cells . These enzymes control processes as diverse as circadian rhythms, the innate immune response, and glucose sensing. Given their key role in numerous regulatory pathways, we seek to understand how CRLs work, how they are regulated, what their substrates are, and how they are deployed in regulatory circuits to control processe s such as gene transcription and cell division. How CRLs Work: Despite their pivotal role in numerous regulatory pathways, we are only beginning to understand how CRLs work . Degradation of CRL substrates such as Sic1 is sustained by assembling upon the substrate a chain of ubiquitins linked together via their lysine -48 residues . We seek to understand how SCF and other CRLs work by using chemical biology approaches to develop novel substrates and tools, by devising new assays based on stop- flow and quenc h-flow techniques to measure real -time dynamics of enzyme -substrate complex formation and ubiquitin ligation with millisecond time resolution, and by developing structural and mathematical models to help us understand how the assembly of a ubiquitin chain proceeds. Regulation of CRLs by the Ubiquitin -like Protein Nedd8: Because of the broad role that human SCF and other CRL enzymes play, we sought to identify proteins that control SCF activity. This led us to discover that COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a key reaction is catalyzed 159RAYMOND DESHAIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Csn5 subunit, which together with the related Rpn11 subunit of the proteasome defined N-domain metalloenzyme) metalloproteases . CSN was previously multiple developmental processes, including photomorphogenesis in plants, neuronal differentiation, and axon guidance . Our observations suggest that the diverse activities of CSN may arise from its ability to control CRLs and other Nedd8 -modified proteins. Unexpectedly, both attachment of Nedd8 to cullins and its subsequent removal by CSN stimulate CRL activity, suggesting that active CRLs are sustained by a continuous cycle of Nedd8 attachment and removal . How this cycle operates, how it controls CRL activity, and how it is regulated remain unsolved mysteries . Interestingly, assembly of Cul1 into an intact SCF complex and the presence of substrate can both reduce the rate of deneddylation, suggesting that SCF complexes that are engaged in ubiquitination are refractory to deneddylation by CSN. We are continuing to address the mechanism and regulation of CSN by a combination of enzymological approaches, chemical biology, and quanti tative proteomics . The cycle of Nedd8 attachment to and removal from CRLs is interdigitated with a second regulatory cycle, in which a CRL from which Nedd8 has been removed binds to Cand1, leading to displacement of the substrate -binding module from the cullin scaffold. The Cand1 -cullin complex is subsequently displaced by another substrate -binding module. In this manner, CRLs are thought to undergo continuous cycle s of disassembly and reassembly. This would allow the cullin scaffold to remain in rapid equilibrium with the available pool of substrate -binding modules . We seek to understand this cycle of CRL assembly and disassembly and the role of Cand1 in this process through a combination of biochemical reconstitution, enzy mology, and quantitative mass spectrometry Substrates Are Delivered and Degraded: For many CRL substrates, ubiquitination is followed by delivery to the proteasome and subsequent degradation. Although the proteasome can degrade ubiquitinated substrates without the participation of other factors, degradation of some proteasome substrates requires the AAA ATPase p97. P97 chaperone that promotes degradation of ubiquitinated substrates by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Adding to the mystery is the fact that there are more than a dozen different p97 complexes in human cells . We believe that these complexes act at the proteasome to help unfold substrates as a prelude to thei r degradation . However, we don't really know how p97 is doing this, nor do we understand why so many different Ubxd -p97 complexes exist, and how their activities relate to ubiquitin receptor proteins that guide substrates to the proteasome . What is known is that p97 is important for the proper function of the ubiquitin system, and that mutations that cripple p97 activity underlie the syndrome known as Inclusion Body Myopathy, Paget 's disease of the bone, and Fronto- temporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and some inherited cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig 's disease). 160RAYMOND DESHAIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Several years ago, we discovered through proteomic studies that p97 assembles with a broad range of CRLs through the agency of the adaptor protein Ubxd7, suggesting that p97 plays a n intimate role in the numerous regulatory processes governed by this family of ubiquitin ligases . Recently, we have found that Ubxd7 contains a domain that binds to the Nedd8 modification that is present on active CRLs . We now seek to understand how recruitment of Ubxd7 influences the ubiquitination and degradation of CRL substrates . We also seek to identify novel functions and substrates of p97 by using a combination of biochemical, molecular genetic, and proteomic approaches in yeast. Finally, we see k to identify selective and potent small -molecule inhibitors of p97 ATPase activity that can be used as tools to study the connection between p97 and CRLs . We will continue to use chemical biology, proteomic, genetic, and biochemical reconstitution approa ches to investigate the role of yeast and human p97 in degradation of CRL substrates. Proteomics: The human ubiquitin system comprises ~570 ubiquitin ligases, ~40 E2s, ~95 deubiquitinating enzymes, and about doz en each of ubiquitin chain receptors and Cdc48/p97 complexes . Collectively, these factors target thousands of human proteins for degradation . One of the most intractable problems in the ubiquitin field is the identification of the proteins that are targe ted for degradation by any one component of the UPS. To identify the proteins whose ubiquitination is altered in cells that are lacking individual components of the UPS, we use powerful mass spectrometry -based approaches . We are also using quantitative m ass spectrometry methods to catalog the network of CRLs and how it changes in response to chemical and genetic perturbations. Regulation of Proteasome Production: Eukaryotic cells treated with proteasome inhibitors respond by up- regulating the synthesis o f proteasome subunits . This conserved response (which we refer to as 'bounce -back') is of clinical significance because it may blunt the impact of proteasome inhibitor therapy . We seek to understand how the bounce -back response works in human cells and w hether it can be modulated . We have discovered that the transcription factor Nrf1 mediates bounce -back . Nrf1 accumulates and is released from its normal location in the ER membrane upon inhibition of the proteasome . The processed form of Nrf1 that accum ulates localizes to the nucleus, where it activates expression of proteasome genes . We are now investigating the mechanisms that underlie the processing of Nrf1 . We are also seeking ways to block the activity of Nrf1 . An Nrf1 inhibitor, used in combinat ion, could potentially enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy. Role of the UPS in ES Cell Differentiation: Many key transcription factors (TFs) that control cell fate are unstable. Thus, UPS factors that control the stabilit y of TFs are likely to play a broad role in regulating differentiation . To identify UPS factors with this property, we did an siRNA screen for genes that, when silenced, resulted in enhanced formation of cardiomyocytes from ES cells . This screen uncovered multiple genes, including two substrate -specificity subunits of CRL enzymes . Surprisingly, in -depth study of one of these proteins revealed that it does not assemble to form a CRL, but instead forms a novel complex with protein phosphatase 2A (PP -2A). 161RAYMOND DESHAIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Proteomic studies implicate this protein as being a negative regulator of PP -2A. We now seek to understand how this protein regulates PP -2A and how this regulation governs the differentiation of cardiomyocytes during normal development. Regulation of the Exit from Mitosis: As with the entry into S phase, the exit from mitosis/cell division is triggered by ubiquitin -dependent degradation . The mitosis phase of the cell cycle program requires an enzyme known as mitotic on, the cell is in . At the end of mitosis, the mitotic cyclin is degraded, which shuts off the associated kinase activity, allowing the cell to exit mitosis . The protein phosphatase Cdc14 is required to switch on mitotic cyclin destruction . For most of the cell cycle program, Cdc14 is sequestered in an inactive state within the cell nucleolus by the nucleolar protein Net1 . At the end of mitosis, Cdc14 is released from Net1 and spre ads throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm . to mitotic cyclin, triggering its degradation . We are investigating the signals that govern Cdc14's release from the nucleolus and dispersal throughout the cell . Most recently, we showed that a nuclear localization sequence in Cdc14 is directly phosphorylated in late mitosis, which promotes its redist ribution to the cytoplasm, where it can dephosphorylate and activate Hct1/Cdh1. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Image s, left to right: Professor Raymond Fetters Photography) Cdc34 Dock Dane Cell 162RAY DESHAIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 den Besten, Verma, R., Kleiger, Cul1 is directly Skp1 -Fbox and substrate, and CSN inhibits deneddylated SCF catalytic mechanism .

In order to undergo division, cells must replicate their DNA during S- phase and then distribute the duplicated copies of their genomes equally to daughter cells at M -phase or mitosis. In earlier years, we focused mainly on the enzymatic network that induces the entry of cells into mitosis. A master regulatory kinase called MPF triggers mitotic entry by phosphorylating a myriad of cellular protei ns. These phosphorylations lead to the hallmark events of mitosis such as chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope disassembly, and assembly of the mitotic spindle. MPF, which stands for maturation - or mitosis -promoting factor, is a heterotrimer contain ing a cyclin, a cyclin- dependent kinase (Cdk), and a small ancillary protein Cks protein. The kinase subunit of MPF is Cdk1, the founding member of this family--it was historically known as Cdc2. MPF also typically contains one of the B -type cyclins. In order for MPF to induce mitosis, it is essential that prior events in the cell cycle have occurred normally. Notably, the cell must have copied all of its genomic DNA accurately during S -phase. In addition, the DNA must also be free of damage in order for the cell to begin division. If a cell has not replicated its DNA accurately or has suffered damage in the genome, various checkpoint mechanisms impose a blockade to mitotic entry. This delay allows time for the cell to repair DNA lesions. These checkp oint responses have additional physiological consequences. For example, 164WILLIAM DUNPHY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 these pathways can influence the transcriptional program of the cell, help to stabilize aberrantly stalled replication forks, and participate in the decision to engage in apoptosis in the event of very severe damage. Checkpoint pathways consist of sensor proteins that detect problems with the DNA and effector proteins that, for example, regulate the function of cell cycle control proteins. Various mediator proteins manage interactions between sensor and effector proteins in order to control the specificity and efficiency of checkpoint pathways. In cells with incompletely replicated DNA, a master regulatory kinase known as ATR functions near the apex of the checkpoint pathway. The act ion of ATR ultimately leads to the activation of a downstream effector kinase known as Chk1. A distinct kinase called ATM becomes activated in cells with various forms of damaged DNA, such as DNA with double -stranded breaks (DSBs). Both ATR and ATM are m embers the phosphoinositide kinase -related family of protein kinases (PIKKs). Much of our work now involves a study of the molecular pathways that lead to the activation of ATR. We are also interested in the targets of this kinase and the roles of these targets in checkpoint responses. In recent years, we have found that the activation of ATR occurs through interaction with a specific activator protein called TopBP1. We have also identified a novel mediator protein called Claspin that enables activate d ATR to recognize and phosphorylate Chk1. We are now pursuing a thorough characterization of this pathway in order to elucidate new players and regulatory principles. These efforts have led to the identification of a novel replication protein called Treslin that associates physically with TopBP1. Overall, these studies should eventually help us understand how cells maintain the integrity of their genomes. This issue is very relevant to human health because an overarching problem with cancer cells is that such cells have suffered a catastrophic deterioration in the mechanisms that maintain genomic stability. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor William Dunphy Localizations of regulators of DNA replication in human cells Xenopus la evis frog Replicating DNA fibers in human cells 165WILLIAM DUNPHY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Kumar, S., Yoo, H.Y., Kumagai, A., Shevchenko, A., Shevchenko, A., and Dunphy, W.G.

While this is of course still just a dream, we are developing electron -cryomicroscopy -based technologies to do this for at least the largest structures, hoping to show both how individual proteins work together as large \"machines \" and how those machines are organized into \" assembly lines\" within living cells. 167GRANT JENSEN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 The principle technique we're developing and using is electron cryotomography (ECT). Briefly, purified proteins, viruses, or even cell cultures are spread into thin films across EM grids and plunge -frozen in liquid ethane. Quick -freezing causes the water to form vitreous ice around the proteins and other macromolecules, preservin g their native structure but solidifying the sample so it can withstand the high vacuum within an electron microscope. Projection images are then recorded through the sample as the sample is tilted incrementally along one or two axes. The microscope we u se is one of only a few like it in the world: a 300 kV, helium -cooled, energy - filtered, dual tilting, a lens -coupled 4k CCD. Three -dimensional reconstructions, or \" tomograms, \" are then calculated from the images. In this way we can produce 3-D structures of heterogeneous proteins, viruses, and even whole bacterial cells in near -native states to \" molecular \" (~4- 7 nm) resolution. The first cells we've begun imaging are small bacteria. Now that over a thousand bacterial genomes have been sequenced, a variety of \"omic\" technologies are being used to document which genes are transcribed and when, which macromolecules are synthesized and how many of each type are present in the cell, and how they interact in pathways to mediate met abolism and regulate gene expression. Despite this encouraging progress, our persistent ignorance about many of the fundamental physical and mechanical processes that occur in a bacterial life cycle is sobering. We still don't know, for instance, how bac teria generate and maintain their characteristic shapes, establish polarity, organize their genomes, segregate their chromosomes, divide, and in some cases move. Thus in some sense the \"omics\" technologies are giving us lists of parts and reactions, but bacterial cells are not merely bags of enzymes. Structural and mechanical details are also needed. This is where ECT is poised to make an important contribution. In recent years, we have used ECT to show by direct visualization that bacteria do indeed have an elaborate cytoskeleton. We have documented structural details of different cell motility mechanisms, chemoreception apparati, flagellar motors, and metabolic microcompartments. We continue to work on all these subjects and hope also to begin sheddi ng light on the structure and management of the nucleoid and cell wall. In addition, we are also imaging the smallest known eukaryote, Ostreococcus tauri . We have also worked to apply the power of ECT to the structure and maturation of the human immu nodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV -1). HIV -1 is an interesting structural story: following its discovery in the mid -1980's, thousands (!) of different structures of its 15 different proteins and pieces of its RNA genome have been solved. Nevertheless we sti ll don't know just how these proteins fit together to form intact, infectious virions, or how their organization changes during assembly, maturation, and infection. The main technical obstacle is that while all HIV -1 virions have the same basic features, each virion is unique in its details. Techniques like X -ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, which require a large number of identical objects, have not therefore, been able to reveal \"supramolecular\" details. So far , we have imaged HIV -1 in its imma ture and mature states, and are now analyzing these at higher resolution and endeavoring to 168GRANT JENSEN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 image HIV -1 structures in living host cells, as well as host factors involved in the HIV -1 life cycle. Technologically, we are working on optimizing sample preser vation, recording better images through improved instrumentation, obtaining more images through automation, and extracting as much biological insight as possible from the images through more sophisticated image processing.

Activation of one of the connected neurons can lead to activation of all of them. 170MARY KENNEDY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Formation of new memories requires the formation of new connections am ong neurons. One way the brain accomplishes this is to strengthen synapses among neurons that fire together during an event. In addition to depolarizing postsynaptic neurons, m any neuro transmitters also initiate biochemical changes in the signaling machinery of the synapse itself. The biochemical changes can either increase or decrease the size of the signal produced by the synapse when it fires again. This is called \"synaptic plasticity.\" Our brains have evolved complex mechanisms for controlling the circumstances under which such changes will occur. For example, one of the receptors for the excitatory amino acid glutamate (the NMDA -type glutamate receptor), triggers an increase in the strength of an active synapse only when simultaneous activation of several synapses causes the postsynaptic neuron to fire an action potential. This \"plasticity rule\" is used to form memories. Our lab is studying biochemical signal transduction machinery in central nervous system synapses. In past years, we employed a combination of microchemical and recombinant DNA methods to elucidate the molecular structure of a scaffolded network of signaling enzymes located near the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses in the CNS, and called the postsynaptic density (PSD). This network controls the cellular changes that occur to strengthen or weaken synapses. For example, it regulates insertion and removal of glutamate receptors and elaboration of the postsynaptic act in cytoskeleton that underlies the shape of postsynaptic spines . Recently, w e have begun to study the postsynaptic signaling network as a system in order to learn how it regulates the delicate mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Our work involves an int erplay between spatially accurate computer simulations of biochemical reactions in the postsynapse, and experiments to test the accuracy of simulations and to help us build new models. Building of computer simulations involves a long -standing collaboratio n with Terry Sejnowski and Tom Bartol of the Salk Institute. Experiments involve a wide array of techniques including in vitro enzymatic assays with purified proteins, cellular pharmacology and electrophysiology with intact neurons, construction of mutant mice by homologous recombination, and mass spectrometric assays of protein phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo . In a major new initiative, we are building a plunge - freeze apparatus to harvest stimulated brain slices at defined times after a stimulus. W e will construct a time course of changes in activation state of the enzymes in synaptic regulatory circuits following various stimuli. To do this, we will use MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometric assays. The data will allow us to build and test kinetic models of large signal transduction pathways. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Mary Kennedy Structure of a portion of CaMKII Calcium flowing through s pine 171MARY KENNEDY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Muhia M, Willadt, S, Yee, BK, Feldon, J, Paterna, JC, Schwendener S, Vogt, K, Kennedy, MB, Knuesel, I (2012) Molecular and behavioral changes associated with adult hippocampus- specific SynGAP1 knockout P.H. and Kennedy, M.B.

Whether an organism is autotrophic or heterotrophic, free living or an obligate parasite, every cell must solve the energy -generation problem to survive. At the cellular level, most of our knowledg e of electron transfer comes from mechanistic studies of oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. While we know in exquisite detail the structure and function of various membrane -bound proteins 175DIANNE NEWMAN LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 involved in elec tron-transfer processes (e.g., cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria), we know far less about the electron -transfer agents of more ancient forms of metabolism. As geobiologists interested in the origin and evolution of the biochemical functions that sustain modern life, our work has focused on probing the co -evolution of metabolism with Earth's near -surface environments. Understanding how modern microorganisms with archaic metabolisms function is a step towards this end. Moreover, because many biological microenvironments are anaerobic, including those in most bacterial infections, this path of inquiry leads inexorably to insights about cellular electron -transfer mechanisms that potentially have profound biomedical implications. Because rocks provide the primary record of ancient events and processes, our laboratory initially explored microbe -mineral interactions. In particular, we investigated how bacteria catalyze mineral formation, transformation, and dissolution, focusing on how these processes relate to cellular energy generation or membrane organization, and how they affect the geochemistry of their environment. For every pathway that we studied, we chose model organisms that we could genetically manipulate. Through a combination of classical genetic, bi ochemical, and molecular biological approaches, we identified the genes and gene products that controlled the processes of interest. For example, we discovered how bacteria use sediment -bound arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiratio n and convert it to arsenite, a more toxic and mobile form; how anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria utilize ferrous iron [Fe(II)] as an electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby precipitating rust anaerobically; and how magnetotactic bacteria position the magnetosome, an organelle- like structure in which nanoparticles of magnetite are made. As our work progressed, however, it became increasingly clear that our findings transcended microbe- mineral interactions. Accordingly, our focus has shifted towards exploring more basic physiological questions that are relevant to diverse biological systems. Still, a geobiological perspective imbues our approach, compelling us to evaluate the functions of modern biomolecules in an evolutionary context. We are currently ex ploring two major thematic areas: I. The \"light side\": evolution of photosynthesis (focusing on how certain anoxygenic phototrophs utilize Fe(II) as an electron donor to power their metabolism, and determining the cellular function of 2-methylbacterial hopanoids \u2014isoprenoids found in the membranes of both anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs, but whose molecular fossil derivatives have been used as biomarkers for the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis in the rock record). II. The \"dark side\": physiological f an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the lungs of individuals with the disease cystic fibrosis). _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Dianne Newman Banded Iron Formations (BIF) in rock samples showing alternating layers of chert and iron oxides.

First, we have had a long standing interest in how viruses transfer their genetic material to their infected hosts. On the theoretical side, we have explored the free energy cost of DNA packing within viruses and how that stored energy can be used to power genome transfer. These efforts are complemented by single -molecule studies in which we watch individual viruses deliver their genomes in real time. These experiments reveal a rich interplay between the free energy which drives ejection and the friction that the DNA encounters as it enters the infected host. Second, we have been fascinated by the interplay between the informational and physical character istics of DNA which has led to efforts on single -molecule and single -cell studies of how transcription factors interact with, deform and loop DNA. These single -molecule approaches are coupled with statistical mechanical modeling which permit the determination of the nature of the DNA -protein interactions that mediate many genomic transactions. Until recently, our efforts have 178ROB PHILLIPS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 primarily focused on bacterial transcription, but of late we have generalized these efforts to V(D)J recombination as a signature eukaryotic example of the interplay between information and physical processes on DNA. Third, cells are subjected to forces of all kinds. One of the most severe mechanical perturbations that cells can suffer is osmotic shock. Our interest in these systems began with theoretical calculations of how mechanosensitive channels in bacteria work. Insights from these models have led us to undertake single -cell osmotic shock experiments in which we watch the response of cells harboring various combinations of mec hanosensitive channels to osmotic shock. Our efforts in this area culminated in the recent publication of a book entitled \"Physical Biology of the Cell\" published by Garland Press. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Professor Rob Phillips Partition function equation Fluorescent Cells Phage ejection 179ROB PHILLIPS LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Bassereau, P., Phillips, R. and Schwille, P.

The field of ubiquitin and regulated protein degradation was created in the 1980s, largely through the complementary discoveries by the laboratory of A. Hershko (Technion, Israel) and by my laboratory, then at MIT. In 1978- 1985, the elegant biochemical insights by Hershko and coworkers produced the initial understanding of ubiquitin -mediated protein degradation in cell extracts, including the isolation of enzymes that mediate ubiquitin conjugat ion. In 1984- 1990, these mechanistic (enzymological ) advances with cell -free systems were complemented by our genetic and biochemical discoveries with mammalian cells and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that revealed the biology of the ubiquitin system, including the first demonstration that the bulk of protein degradation in living cells requires ubiquitin conjugation and the discovery of the first ubiquitin -conjugating (E2) enzymes with 181ALEXANDER VARSHAVSKY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 specific physiological functions, in the cell cycle (Cdc34) and DNA repair (Rad6). These insights initiated the unde rstanding of the massive, multilevel involvement of the ubiquitin system in the regulation of the cell cycle and DNA damage responses. We also discovered the critical roles of the ubiquitin system in other biological processes, including stress resistance , protein synthesis and transcriptional regulation. The first primary degradation signals (degrons) in short -lived proteins were discovered by us in 1986. These signals included degrons that give rise to the N -end rule, which relates the in vivo half -life of a protein to the identity of its N -terminal residue. The discovery of the N -end rule pathway identified the first specific pathway of the ubiquitin system. Other contributions by our laboratory in the 1980s included the first polyubiquitin chains, t heir specific topology and their necessity for proteolysis; the subunit selectivity of protein degradation (this fundamental capability of the ubiquitin system makes possible the remodeling of oligomeric proteins); the first physiological substrate of the ubiquitin system (MAT alpha2 repressor); the first genes that encode deubiquitylating enzymes and ubiquitin precursors (a linear polyubiquitin chain and ubiquitin fusions to specific ribosomal proteins); and the first cloned and molecularly characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase, termed Ubr1. The 1990 discovery, the Ubr1 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates the N -end rule pathway, opened up a particularly large field, because we now know that the mammalian genome encodes at least a thousand d istinct E3s. The targeting of many distinct degrons in cellular proteins by this astounding number of different E3 enzymes underlies the unprecedented functional reach of the ubiquitin system. The term \"ubiquitin ligase\" denotes either an E3 -E2 complex or its E3 component. For accounts of the early history of the ubiquitin field, see Hershko et al. (2000); Varshavsky (2006, 2008). By the end of the 1980s, our studies had revealed the major biological functions of the ubiquitin system as well as the basi s for its specificity, i.e., the first degradation signals in short- lived proteins. The resulting discovery of physiological regulation by intracellular protein degradation has transformed the understanding of biological circuits, as it became clear that control through regulated protein degradation rivals, and often surpasses in significance the classical regulation through transcription and translation. Just how strikingly broad and elaborate ubiquitin functions are was understood more systematically an d in great detail over the next two decades, through studies by many laboratories that began entering this field in the 1990s, an expansion that continues to the present day. Our work at Caltech continues to focus on the ubiquitin system and regulated protein degradation, with an emphasis on the N -end rule pathway. The N -end rule relates the in vivo half -life of a protein to the identity of its N -terminal residue. The N -end rule pathway polyubiquitylates proteins that contain specific degrons, thereby targeting these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Degrons recognized by the N -end rule pathway include a set called N -degrons. The main determinant of an N -degron is a destabilizing N -terminal residue of a protein. Recognition components of the N -end rule pathway, called N -recognins, are specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that can target N -degrons. The N -end rule pathway consists of two branches, the Ac/N -end rule and the Arg/N -end rule pathways. The rule pathway recognizes proteins wit h N-terminally 182ALEXANDER VARSHAVSKY LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 acetylated (Nt -acetylated) The Arg/N -end rule pathway targets unacetylated N -terminal residues. The primary destabilizing N -terminal residues Arg, Lys, His, Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Ile are directly recognized by E3 N -recognins, w hereas N -terminal Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, and Cys function as destabilizing residues through their preliminary modifications. These modifications include N -terminal arginylation (Nt- arginylation) by the Arg/N -end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, nitric oxide (NO), oxygen and short peptides; the selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of DNA re pair and cohesion/segregation of chromosomes; the signaling by G proteins; the regulation of peptide import, meiosis, viral and bacterial infections, fat metabolism, cell migration, actin filaments, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular develop ment; and the functioning of adult organs, including the brain, muscle, testis and pancreas. The recent discovery of the Ac/N- end rule pathway further expanded the already broad functional scope of the eukaryotic N -end rule pathway, and has also revealed the main physiological functions of Nt- acetylases and Met -aminopeptidases (Hwang et al., 2010). Prokaryotes, which lack a bona fide ubiquitin system, nevertheless contain the N-end rule pathway, ubiquitin- independent versions of it. Many years after the initial discovery of the N -end rule, this ancient system continues to be a fount of biological insights (Varshavsky, 2011).

But while they understand individual neurons, they've been stumped by how neurons work together, how they encode information, and how they generate thoughts, emotions, and actions. That pioneering area of study is behind the Broad Fellows Program in Brain Circuitry, made possible through an $8.9 million gra nt from the Broad Foundations and philanthropist Eli Broad in 2005. Recipients of the Broad Fellowship in Brain Circuitry are able to devote up to five years to their projects, without having to worry about finding another postdoctoral appointment in a y ear or two, or limiting themselves only to research that will lead to tenure. These researchers are at a level between postdoctoral fellow and assistant professor, which means that they are very independent and don't have to worry about the tenure clock. The program is designed to give researchers the 186BROAD SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOWS ANNUAL REPORT 2012 freedom and flexibility to advance their work in whatever way is most productive, and may include the development of specific technologies or the invention of new instruments. Broad Fellows are given indivi dual space to do their work in the Beckman Laboratories of Behavioral Biology. The program strongly encourages independent cutting- edge research and provides commensurate funding, space and facilities for Fellows. The program is funded by a generous gift from the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, a Los Angeles -based venture philanthropy focused on entrepreneurship for the public good in education, science, and the arts. Further funding is provided by various federal and private institutions that support the research of individual fellows. The program is overseen and directed by Prof. Christof Koch. The director is Prof. Henry Lester as of a few months ago. Currently, five Fellows are in residence. ________________________________________________________ _____________________________________ PUBLICATIONS 2012 Cassenaer, S. and Laurent, G. modulation of spike 22278062 Kuo R.I. and Wu G.K.* (2012) The Generation of Direction Selectivity in the Audit ory System.

Instead, much of what was thought to be \"junk DNA\" turns out to encode for so called non -coding RNAs (ncRNA) that, similarly to proteins, regulate important biological processes. We use cell culture a nd fruit fly as models and a combination of biochemistry, molecular biology and high- throughput sequencing techniques to address how different classes of small non -coding RNAs regulate chromatin structure and transcription. Currently we are focusing on the role of two independent classes of small RNAs: genic small RNAs and piRNAs. We have recently described and characterized a new class of small RNAs in human cell lines, termed genic small RNAs, that map to the promoter regions (promoter associated small R NAs or PASRs) and the bodies of protein coding genes. Our studies revealed that the majority of protein - coding genes give rise to such short non -coding RNAs and expression levels of genic small RNAs, in general, correlates with the transcription of the cor responding mRNA and the presence of an active chromatin state. While the function of genic small RNAs is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that the RNAs or the act of their transcription per se regulate the expression of the protein -coding genes to which they are linked. We wish to investigate how the expression of these newly identified non -coding RNAs is controlled and how they in turn affect expression of protein -coding genes. 189KATALIN FEJES T\u00f3TH LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Establishing the correct chromatin state is crucial for mainta ining the genomic integrity of the germline. Piwi proteins and their small RNA partners, the Piwi interacting RNAs or piRNAs, function in the germline to repress transposon activity thereby maintaining genomic integrity. Much is known about the cytoplasmic function of Piwi proteins where they repress expression of transposable elements by cleavage of transposon mRNA. Most animals express at least one member of the Piwi protein family in the nucleus, but the biological significance of this localization is no t known. We are testing the hypothesis that Piwi exerts its effects on transposon expression in part by altering the epigenetic state and transcription of transposable elements. We are using high -throughput sequencing methods to identify genomic loci at wh ich Piwi is enriched and are testing the effect of Piwi depletion and tethering on histone modification patterns. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Senior Research Fel low Katalin Fejes T\u00f3th D.

The mission of the facility is to foster scientific research by providing the expertise, state -of-the-art resources, and training necessary to solve complex biological research problems and promote cutting edge research on a fee- for-service basis. The facility strives to provide cost effective analysis and cell separation on several different platforms using a myriad of protocols to enhance the scope and quality of the investigator's research. The facility is equipped with two research grade flow cytometer cell sorters and two analyzer s. This instrumentation can a nalyze and separate various types of cells and micro -organisms according to their measurable properties of light scatter and fluorescence. The BD FACSAria IIu is capable of analyzing at least nine colors utilizing three lasers (407nm, 488nm, and 633nm), and of carrying out 4 -way sorting up to 10,000 cells per second with reliable efficiency and recovery, or 1-way sorting, such as for single -cell cloning, into various cell culture plate configurations. The iCyt Mission Technology Reflection 5 -laser/9color (U V, 405, 488, 561, and 633nm) cell sorter with one Highly Automated Parallel Sorting (HAPS) module is contained in a Baker Sterilguard Advance Biosafety cabinet (BSL2). The analyzer. This analyzer is equipped with automatic startup/wash/shutdown features, absolute counting from specific volume uptake, 96 well plate chilled mini -sampler and chilled tube rack, and robotic reagent handler . It was designed in collaboration with the Ca ltech facility to provide detection of an increased range of fluorescent proteins used as lineage tracers and gene expression reporters. This utilizes the 561nm yellow laser to accommodate the red fluorescent proteins such as mTomato, mCherry, and DsRed, as well as the standard lasers for CFP (cerulean), YFP (Venus, citrine), EGFP, and others. These reporters can be combined with commonly used fluorochromes like FITC, APC, APC -Alexa 750, Pacific Blue, PE others depending on the fluorochrome panel. The BD FACSCalibur is a four -color analyzer, toget her with an offline workstation. The analyzers are available to researchers for self - service analysis provided that they demonstrate competence to use the instrument or take training provided by the facility. The facility provides consultation services to all researchers on issues relating to flow cytometry, cell sorting, and cell separation techniques ( over 120 consultation appointments with 32 Caltech lab groups and 17 administrative, JPL, and external consu ltations last year ). In addition, the facility makes Treestar 's FlowJo off- line analysis program available to its clients ( 43) for free and 193BIOLOGY FACILITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2012 non-clients (15) for a fee through a network license. The facility has negotiated discounts with two antibody vend ors and placed over 70 orders for its clients this past year. This past two years the facility provided service to 29 laboratories from the Divisions of Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Applied Physics, Geology and Planetary Science, and JPL, 80 users were supported.

This is a non- targeted event. Targeted disruption of specific genes, however, requires the manipulation of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro and their subsequent return to the embryonic environment for incorporation into the developing embryo (Zijlstra et al., 1989). The resulting chimeric mouse born is useful for two purposes: 1) it is comprised of tissue from two sources, the host embryo and the manipulated stem cells. More importantly, 2) it can be mated to produce descendants that are entirely transgenic, resulting from the ES cell contribution to the germline of the chimeric mouse. (The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 2007 to the pioneers of this technology, Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies .) The facility, in collaboration with Anderson, Baltimore, Fraser, Kennedy, Lester, Patterson, Rothenberg, Simon, Varshavsky and Wold laboratories, has generated multiple transgenic, knockout and knockin mouse strains, amounting to nearly 180 mouse strains. The Facility together with the Baltimore lab, participated in the development of a new method for the introduction of DNA into early -stage embryos (Lois et al., 2002). This method makes use of non- recombinant lentivirus as a vector for the introduction of DNA into one -cell embryos. The method has proven to be highly efficient and promises to be useful for studies in mice and rats, where large numbers of constructs need to be tested. This new methodology also makes feas ible the generation of transgenic animals in species that were hitherto impractical to work with, due to the very low numbers of embryos available for use. Since the lentiviral vector method was established, 79 transient or established mouse models have b een generated by this means, together with one Tg rat model. Facility staff has performed all embryo manipulation involved in the production of these new lines. With regard to the injection of DNA into pro -nuclei of pre -implantation stage embryos, this ye ar, GEMs staff have assisted the Fraser lab in an early embryonic developmental study of Oct4 kinetics, for the prediction of cell lineage patterning, by the injection of DNA into single nuclei of embryos at 2 cell stage, or into the cytoplasm of 2 cell stage blastomeres. The work has been published online: \"Oct4 kinetics predict cell lineage patterning in the early mammalian embryo.\" 196BIOLOGY FACILITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2012 In tissue culture and the use of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells the Facility has generated over forty new and as yet u ntested, embryonic stem cell lines, the majority of which are from C57BL/6 mice. This was a by -product of our wish to determine the most efficient approach to deriving such cell lines, since we anticipate that investigators may wish to use ES cells derive d from their own genetically altered strains of mouse. Indeed, five such new mES cell lines were derived for the Rothenberg lab. We have multiple murine ES cell lines available for use. Several are on a 129 background, some on a C57BL/6 background and others are F1 cell lines, which are a mix between 129 and C57BL/6 strains. We are able to manipulate and obtain germline transmission from all these ES cell types. C57BL/6 ES cells provide a significant advantage in that the mutation will be established initially on this well understood genetic background, instead of undertaking a two -year breeding program to reach the same point, having initially established the mutation on a sub - optimal genetic background. Hybrid mES cells have been reported to be usefu l for their vigor. Unlike mES cells from an inbred background, (e.g., C57BL/6 and 129), it is possible to derive from hybrid mES cells live pups that are wholly of ES cell origin. (Nagy et al ., 1993) This is made possible by first, the production of tetr aploid embryos. These are made by fusion of two blastomeres at the two -cell embryo stage, resulting in the production of a single viable blastomere that has twice the normal number of chromosomes. Such embryos can develop to blastocyst stage, but thereaf ter, can only contribute to extraembryonic cell lineages. Thus, mES cells injected into the blastocoel cavity in this case, are sole contributors to the developing embryo. Not every mES cell line is able to support development to such a degree. However, we have seen that animals that appear wholly of ES cell origin can be produced by injecting mES cells into earlier stage embryos (Valenzuela et al., 2010) In the light of recent publications, we are currently evaluating the benefit of altered mES cell cult ure conditions, by supplementing media with two kinase inhibitors. (Ying et al., 2008) Our goal is to make our gene targeting system more robust and efficient. The facility is able to offer the use of human ES cells, - two lines from WiCell are availabl e, H1 and H9. We also have close contact with the hES facility at USC, for advisory purposes. For the third year, we organized, set up and taught a four -week course for ten \"Bridges to Stem Cells\" students. This was in conjunction with PCC and funded by CIRM. Students had the opportunity to derive fibroblasts and mES cell lines, plus execute a gene targeting experiment. Students also successfully derived new C57BL/6 embryonic stem cell lines, using media containing two kinase inhibitors. Some of these cell lines have karyotyped well and are currently being evaluated for use in the generation of new mouse models . These fibroblasts and ES cells will also be useful for teaching at PCC in the Bio technology course, which is directed by Pam Eversole -Cire, (a former Caltech post -doc). Once a new mouse model has been characterized, it may be cryopreserved by GEMs staff, or sent to the Mutant Mouse Resource Center, to be made available to the research community in general. We currently have over 100 mouse models cryopreserved. For each line, between 200 and 500 embryos at eight -cell stage have been preserved in liquid nitrogen. There are currently 34,752 embryos frozen in total. We shall continue to preserve embryos from mouse strains carrying multiple mutations . Mouse strains carrying a single mutation will be archived by sperm cryopreservation. Sperm cryopreservation is much more economic than embryo cryopreservation, 197BIOLOGY FACILITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2012 although the recovery and establishment of the strain by in -vitro fertilization is more costly. T he advantages of archiving mouse strains are many. Unique and valuable mouse strains that are currently not in use may be stored economically. In the event that genetic drift should affect any strain, over time, then the option to return to the original documented genetic material is available. Lastly, in the event of a microbiological or genetic contamination occurring within the mouse facility, we have the resources to set up clean and genetically reliable mouse stocks in an alternative location. We also offer re -derivation as a service, whereby investigators can bring in novel mouse strains from other Institutions without risk of introducing pathogens to CIT stocks. This involves the washing and transfer of pre -implantation embryos from \"dirty\" incoming mice to \"clean\" CIT recipient animals. In addition to the maintenance of nearly 100 different targeted and non -targeted strains, we also maintain colonies of inbred and outbred animals, which are used to support the development of new lines, by investigators at Caltech. We also have many mouse models on both an inbred and an outbred background, plus intercrosses between two or three different, but related, mouse models. In total, we currently maintain nearly 200 separate strains of mouse. GEMs Facility staff have been working with IMSS in the development of software that will assist technicians and investigators in the management of their mice. Amongst its features, this inter -relational system will track the breeding history of each strain and have the ability to generate family trees. The system will also report on production levels for each strain. Users will access the system to enter genotype results and work requests. An e lectronic signal will be sent to CLAS staff when work requests are made, helping us to manage work requests in a timely manner. The system will be basic but easy to use and most valuable for the reports the system will be able to generate. We anticipate this will be a very useful animal management tool and will start to use the system in September of this year . GEMs is a fee for service facility.

In addition, the Facility conducts research on the development of novel immunological techniques. By applying the adult tolerization or cyclophosphamide immunosuppression methods, we enhance the probability of producing mAbs against a particular target antigen in a mixture, or against a specific part of a molecule. We also produce polyclonal ascites Abs by immunizing mice with antigen and then inducing t he mice with sarcoma cells to obtain high titer, polyclonal ascites fluid. This method can provide 10- 18 ml polyclonal ascites fluid per mouse while using small amounts of antigen. In its service capacity, the Facility produced Abs for the following gro ups in 2011- 12: Transmembrane Bioscience obtained hemorrhagic obtained mAbs against human TFAM (mitochondria transcription factor A). The Jun g laboratory from USC obtained mAbs against Rubicon. As part of the NHGRI ENCODE project with Dr. Wold's group, we aim to produce more than 50 chromatin immunoprecitation (ChIP) -validated mAbs against transcription factors for which ChIP -grade reagents are not available. To increase the success rate of usable reagents, we tested antigens fixed by formaldehyde in the same manner that is used in ChIP studies. Animals immunized with fixed and unfixed NRSF N250 were used and mAbs were obtained from both groups. Therefore, we now immunize animals with fixed Ag only. After cleaving the GST from the fusion protein, there is always some GST left in the sample, and several mice generated responses against the GST instead of the antigen. Our adult mouse tolerization method (Lebron et al. , 1999) was applied with the MYF5 antigen and mice showed significant improvement in recognizing the Ag. Therefore, we now tolerize mice with GST before immunization. Using these procedures, we obtained mAbs against NRSF, and EP 300. We are also currently working with the following groups: The Li laboratory from USC is immunizing with Heat Shock protein 90 alpha -F5. Transmembrane Bioscience is immunizing with Norovirus Capsid protein . The Patterson laboratory is immunizing with peptide sequence from MecP2 (Methyl CpG binding protein 2) phosphorylated S274 region. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Director Susan Ker -hwa Ou Solid Pink Cell Cluster Cancer Cell - antibodies 202BIOLOGY FACILITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2012 PUBLICATIONS 2012 Jose, J., Przybyla, L., Edwards, T.J., Perera, R., Burgnwe, J.W., Sindbis Virus E2 with Nucleocapsid Cores 2585- 2599.

The center provides heterologous expression of recombinant proteins using E. coli, insect cells (Baculovirus) and mammalian cells (HEK 293). The PEC has evolved over the last four years to provide additional capabilities that include expression optimization using multiwell -plate based miniaturization and parallelization. Enhanced purification and analytical capabilities and more recently we assist in developing and applying automated plate based biochemical protein and cell based bioassays. We continue to provide support in the experimental design and execution for Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based measurements of protein -protein interactions or generally of bio -molecular interaction studies . The instrument used for these studies has been upgraded from a Biacore T100 to a T200 instrument providing hig her resolution for SPR studies. The instrument continues to enjoy broad interest and use and has become a valued asset in the Caltech research community. The majority of proteins produced in the mammalian expression system are active human antiviral (influenza and HIV) antibodies and engineered antibody derivatives ( Engineering Immunity, Pamela Bjorkman). Mainly we use protein expression based on transient DNA transfection but recently we succeeded in generating stable cell lines expressing anti -HIV antib odies and in one case a tRNA -synthetase mutant allowing incorporation of non -natural amino acids into expressed proteins in these cell lines. 205BIOLOGY FACILITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2012 We produced many \" CHIP -able\" mAbs for the ENCODE project, ( Barbara Wold). \" CHIP -able\" mAbs are monoclonal antibodies capable of genome wide extraction and characterization of transcription factor specific DNA control sites. We have developed a production pipeline to generate antibodies in mice and llamas that are then screened for transcription factor specificity using robotic liquid handling technology. We have produced a total of over a hundred monoclonal antibodies against transcription factors focusing on the characterization of the CHIP -ability and other properties of those mAbs. This year's highlights at the PEC are the development of two automated bioassays on the Tecan Evo Freedom robotic liquid handling workstation which is an instrument that was purchased by the Steven Mayo group and upgraded with grants from Pamela Bjorkman's and Barbara Wold's group. The instrument is equipped with a variable span -8 liquid handling arm, a 96- channel pipetting arm, a robotic gripper manipulator arm and the following integrated instr uments: CO2 incubators (12 slots), a plate shaker, a heating/cooling plate carrier, a filter -plate vacuum manifold, several plate standard and stacking carriers, a PCR machine, a plate reader, and a plate washer. The whole instrument is enclosed in a Biosafety level II cabinet to allow sterile work and work with biohazardous material. The fully automated ChIP assay has been successfully validated with known ChIP reagents and allows production of up to 96 ChIP samples starting with chromatin extracts and de livering enriched chromatin running for 22 hours unattended. The second fully automated assay is a cell -based HIV pseudovirus neutralization assay originally developed by David Montefiori and routinely used by the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery (CAVD) core neutralization facility . We have validated this our automated version of this assay with known assay reagents and have successfully generated data. These automated assays exemplify the power of laboratory automation and demonstrate how automatio n can increase the productivity of experimental biology at Caltech. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Images from left to right: Director Jost Vielmetter Liquid handling robot in a biosafety ho od. The liquid handling robot contains an 8 -probe liquid handling device with fixed tips, a multi -channel pipetting device with disposable tips, and a multitude of integrated devices that can all be accessed by a robotic gripper/manipulator. All aspects of pipetting speeds, volumes, styles, and movements of labware are controlled by Tecan's Evo -specific control software (EvoWare), which runs on a PC (far right). Next to the PC is the external PCR machine control unit, and on top of it, an external CO2/air m ixer to provide a stable percentage of CO2 atmosphere for the integrated CO2 incubators.

We are collaborating with Professor Helena Ritchie at University of Michigan School of Dentistry to identify post -translational modifications of proteins. We have been continuing the investigation of insoluble and cross -linked [Os(dmebpy) 2Cl]+/2+-derivatized acrylamide and dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a widely -used detergent for the salvation and denaturation of proteins. High concentration of SDS will greatly reduce the enzymatic activity of trypsin. It also interferes with the LC separation and suppresses the electrospray ionization signals in mass spectrometry. Our preliminary experiments show that the presence of Os copolymer in the digestion buffer with up to 0.1% (w/v) SDS can still generate strong peptide signals i n LC/MS, as compared to much weaker signals in the digestion without Os copolymer. The trypsin digestion of thermus thermophilus proteins with high stability against thermal denaturation is enhanced with regards to peptide coverage in the presence of SDS and Os copolymer. Some typical examples include the fast - refolding cytochrome C proteins (from Harry Gray's group). More experiments are still going on. 208BIOLOGY FACILITIES LAB ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Services During the first eight months of fiscal 2012 PPMAL interacted with 15 laboratories.
