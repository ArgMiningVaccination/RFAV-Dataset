And then there are \"health spas,\" where you fast for days, have colonics to flush out your system, chew spelt rolls 50 times, and sleep on hard beds. After a visit to the latter, of course, you hope to come back feeling purified, spiritually enlightened, and possibly a few kilos lighter\u2014in other words, the total mind-body transformation makes roughing the austere elements worth it. Europeans are famously devoted to health spas, taking \"the cure\" for weeks at a time to reboot their bodies. Most of these tune-up spas have been around for decades and are located in northern and eastern Europe, usually deep in the woods and in no-frills structures that resemble dormitories (hence the hard beds!). But for those who prefer a total life overhaul in a less punitive setting, there is the [Lanserhof Tegernsee](http://www.lanserhof.com/english/lanserhof-tegernsee.html). Opened in January 2014 on a stretch of land above Lake Tegern, in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, this 21,000-square-meter complex bills itself as a modern health resort. The setting alone would make the trip worthwhile: there are rolling hills, flower-dotted meadows, slate-blue streams, fresh air, and lots of good Tyrolean vibes all around. And you know you're in chic territory when Karl Lagerfeld throws a Chanel fashion show here\u2014which he did in nearby Salzburg two winters ago\u2014not to mention other notable frequenters like Christian Louboutin, Jacques Grange, Marc Porter, Cindy Sherman, and Evegeny Lebedev. The accommodations don't disappoint either. German architect Christoph Ingenhoven imagined the space as high-tech monastery with sleek, straight lines, and areas for contemplation. Each room includes a terrace-balcony, floor-to-ceiling windows, generously sized (cushy!) beds, and, thankfully, WiFi. But for a digital detox, you can hit a switch to power down everything in the room. This prevents the buildup of \"electrosmog,\" which, the spa says, can interfere with sleep. And you know, that Instagram post of the Tegernesee sunset can wait until tomorrow. Most days start with fresh spelt or buckwheat rolls and herbal tea\u2014ah, yes, time to fast. Like many medi-clinics, Lanserhof hews to the philosophy of Austrian physician Franz Xaver Mayr, the so-called father of fasting, who believed that a clean digestive system leads to a clean bill of health. His FX Mayr method is built on three pillars: rest (tea-and-water fasting to quiet you internally), detoxification (cutting out everything from sugar to alcohol to lessen the strain on your gastrointestinal system), and training (chewing thoroughly and without distraction to help your body process food better). Gradually, food is introduced, and is welcomed, since it's actually quite delicious. Meals are prepared with organic, sun-ripened produce; biophotonic meat; and humanely grown ingredients\u2014all designed to optimize your digestive powers. A personalized menu could include leek-and-root-vegetable soup, herb crepes with chutney, or branzino fillets. But the real luxury might be the health treatments. Lanserhof practices \"energy medicine,\" mixing old-school approaches (such as leech therapy and liver infusions) with the best modern, preventative techniques. Every guest begins their stay with a series of examinations, including an abdomen massage to stimulate and cleanse the gut. Then, you can choose services \u00e1 la carte, and there are pages and pages of options. Many have a Jason Bourne-like futuristic feel: there are genetic tests that can check a panel of 90 genes to see if you're predisposed to any conditions. Swallow the PillCam and a tiny camera films your intestines (and records images: GI Selfie!). Worn out? Try the Cell Gym, an interval hypoxic-hyperoxic (oxygen) therapy that helps your body recoup from stress. They offer colonoscopies, hypnosis sessions, alkaline baths that draw out toxins, countless food-intolerance testings (for everything from fructose to lactose), and the Sleep Program (which measures one's sleep diagnostics). While some might argue that diagnosing every little malady can lead to unnecessary treatments, others might say that, with today's health-care system\u2014wherein you sometimes get only 10 minutes with your doctor\u2014the more information, the better. In fact, guests can treat Lanserhof's physicians as their general practitioners, and they regularly come back for checkups. Which brings up the question of cost. Prices start at 1,489 euros per week (plus room fares, which begin at 360 euros per night), and the spa recommends staying a minimum of 14 days. You can also book a seven-day visit, with full board, airfare, and a basic program of services, through [Healing Holidays](http://www.healingholidays.co.uk/accommodation/germany/lanserhof-tegernsee), for 2,799 euros per person (double-occupancy). That could be the entire "}
