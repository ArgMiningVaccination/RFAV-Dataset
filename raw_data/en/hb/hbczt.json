When hormones are out of balance, it can cause a broad range of symptoms such as weight gain, low libido & brain fog. The pellets are tiny and custom-compounded and are inserted in a simple in-office procedure. They gradually absorb, dispersing bioidentical hormones, resulting in improved mood, sleep & mental clarity, increased energy, muscle mass & weight loss and restored libido. To start, see if you are a candidate for Biote by getting a hormone evaluation.

She has helped me with my health and my 9 month old's skin/rash issue. Her approach is to understand the root cause rather than prescribe a pill/cream/etc to suppress whatever may be happening.
