It is imperative that healthcare providers have an understanding of the training and scope of other health professionals in order to effectively make decisions regarding research, collaborative clinical care, and policy. Given the prevalence of use of complementary and alternative medicine by children and families in North America, and the growing interest in \"integrative\" medicine, we aim to offer an overview of naturopathic care for children. This document describes the principles, training, and scope of naturopathic medicine, including health promotion, disease prevention, and illness management. It describes the process by which naturopathic doctors create an integrative healthcare plan for children, evaluate and apply evidence, and integrate ethical issues in practice management, and speaks to the role naturopathic doctors have regarding advocacy for community and planetary health as it relates to pediatrics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-12-24", "cleaned_text": "Scope of Practice and Principles of Care of Naturopathic Medicine in North America: A Commentary [https://doi.org/10.3390/children9010008](https://doi.org/10.3390/children9010008) [1](#B1-children-09-00008)]. Some children are significantly more likely to use CAM (also referred to as integrative medicine), including children with mental health issues [ [2](#B2-children-09-00008)], pain conditions [ [3](#B3-children-09-00008)], respiratory concerns [ [4](#B4-children-09-00008)], cancer [ [5](#B5-children-09-00008)], and neurological concerns [ [6](#B6-children-09-00008)]. Families often do not consult with a healthcare provider about the use of integrative medicine, and may not disclose its use to their medical doctor [ [4](#B4-children-09-00008)]. In the 2012 NHIS survey, only 18.4% of CAM usage had been recommended by a medical doctor [ [2](#B2-children-09-00008)]. It is critical that parents and guardians are guided by healthcare providers thoroughly trained in integrative approaches to pediatric care. Additionally, the establishment of healthy habits and the promotion of optimal lifestyle are core components of pediatric practice, influencing individual and community health through the lifespan. [7](#B7-children-09-00008), [8](#B8-children-09-00008)], naturopathic doctors (NDs) are the only professionals that are trained primarily in these approaches at a doctoral level. This ideally positions them as experts in these paradigms, to ensure safety and effectiveness for families when working independently or in collaboration with other providers. 2. Paradigm, Philosophy, Training and Regulation of Naturopathic Practice [9](#B9-children-09-00008)]. The roots of modern naturopathic training and practice lie in the integration of diverse approaches to health from a variety of doctrines. Some practitioners lean toward more traditional approaches (such as acupuncture or traditional herbal medicine), while others favor methods that have well-understood biomedical mechanisms and a rigorous evidence base. Many work with a combination of the two. Some NDs emphasize lifestyle strategies, while others rely more on the use of natural health products and other CAM approaches. [Figure 1](#children-09-00008-f001)). As all healthcare providers are, NDs are guided by the fundamental principle of nonmaleficence; five additional principles inform naturopathic care and decision-making, all of which are emphasized throughout training [ [10](#B10-children-09-00008), [11](#B11-children-09-00008)]. The Therapeutic Order was designed as a framework for holistic care to which these principles are applied ( [Figure 1](#children-09-00008-f001)). While a critical part of an ND's role is identifying when more forceful methods and/or referral may be necessary, the principles of the profession remind clinicians to approach families and children holistically, individually, and with the least force possible in order to achieve the therapeutic goal.

The broadest scopes (such as is that in the state of Arizona) include pharmaceutical prescribing, vaccination administration, intravenous nutrient therapy, acupuncture, and minor surgery. Licensed naturopathic doctors (NDs) complete an accredited ( [www.cnme.org](http://www.cnme.org), accessed on 21 December 2021) four year post-graduate medical education which blends conventional biomedical training with traditional modalities, including clinical nutrition, mind-body medicine, lifestyle counselling, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, and hands-on manual therapies. Some institutions offer additional training in other domains such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture, midwifery, and public health. There are currently eight accredited programs for naturopathic medical education in North America. [https://www.nabne.org/about/](https://www.nabne.org/about/), accessed on 21 December 2021), as well as relevant local regulatory exams. All NDs are trained as generalists. Residency training is currently not a requirement for NDs, although opportunities exist, including those with a focus on pediatrics. Specialization is not recognized in most jurisdictions. However, the American Board of Naturopathic Pediatrics (an independent arm of the PedANP) offers a fellowship certification process ( [https://www.pedanp.org/board-certification](https://www.pedanp.org/board-certification), accessed on 21 December 2021), which is recognized as evidence of board-certification in some regulated jurisdictions of practice. 3. Naturopathic Pediatric Practice - Wellness promotion - Prevention of disease - Surveillance and screening for developmental delay or disease - Management of acute and chronic illness - Coordination of care - Advocacy for a healthy community and environment 3.1. Wellness Promotion and Prevention of Disease [12](#B12-children-09-00008), [13](#B13-children-09-00008), [14](#B14-children-09-00008), [15](#B15-children-09-00008)]. There is a plethora of evidence highlighting the importance of fostering good lifestyle practices, such as optimal diet, physical movement, sufficient sleep, minimal exposure to environmental toxins, and stress mitigation, and the social and ecological determinants influencing these. Practice models generally ensure that encounter time is adequate to engage with families regarding the determinants of health most relevant to the child, their family, and their broader community, and to offer strategies to promote wellness in both the short and long term ( [Figure 2](#children-09-00008-f002)) [ [16](#B16-children-09-00008)]. [16](#B16-children-09-00008)]. Well-child checks are typically advised to be consistent with recommended immunization schedules. Although most guidelines recommend annual well-child visits after 2.5 years of age, thorough health promotion may be more effective if done semi-annually, quarterly, or more frequently if it appears to be necessary to address all concerns [ [22](#B22-children-09-00008), [23](#B23-children-09-00008), [24](#B24-children-09-00008), [25](#B25-children-09-00008)]. Naturopathic doctors are trained to utilize evidence-informed guidelines for screening, well-child promotion, and primary prevention [ [26](#B26-children-09-00008)] to ensure key determinants of health are addressed. As they do for all primary healthcare providers, well-child visits consist of a thorough history, a comprehensive physical exam, any indicated objective screening measures, relevant labs, and anticipatory guidance, depending on scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors in some jurisdictions can and do offer the full scope of recommended childhood immunizations. NDs in other jurisdictions cannot provide this healthcare service, but may engage in discussions of immunization to encourage informed consent. [27](#B27-children-09-00008)]. 3.2. Management of Disease\u2014Creating an Integrative Pediatric Plan [28](#B28-children-09-00008)]. This may include the use of botanical medicines (either topical or oral), other natural health products such as nutritional supplements or probiotics, or hydrotherapy (the therapeutic application of hot and cold water to manipulate circulation). NDs with the training and authority to do so may prescribe or administer pharmaceutical medications; or perform acupuncture, acupressure, or manual therapies (such as soft tissue or joint manipulation). Those without such authority are trained to appropriately refer to other providers when indicated. Management plans typically include recommendations for optimizing lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep habits, physical activity, stress mitigation and spending time in nature. [29](#B29-children-09-00008), [30](#B30-children-09-00008), [31](#B31-children-09-00008)], engaging children in decision-making and obtaining assent from them directly is a key part of increasing motivation to follow through with a given plan, which is of added importance when recommending the behavior modification or lifestyle changes common in naturopathic practice. The feasibility of all recommendations are ideally thoroughly explored to minimize conflict within the family environment and maximize success. It is unrealistic, for example, to significantly modify the diet of a child without considering other members of the family. Lifestyle recommendations specific to a particular child may in fact positively benefit the health of the entire family. The child should be included in planning as much as is developmentally possible to establish trust and rapport. Ideally, the child will be empowered by the plan, and take an appropriate level of responsibility in executing it. This requires some level of creativity and negotiation of choices. Practitioners attempt to engage strategies to educate, inspire, and motivate the family, making recommendations that are relevant to the unique determinants of that child's health. 3.3. Evidence-Informed Naturopathic Practice and Informed Consent [Figure 3](#children-09-00008-f003)) [ [32](#B32-children-09-00008)]. A dearth of high-quality evidence is a challenge that affects both naturopathic and pediatric care independently, made worse by the combination. Application to children may need to be extrapolated from literature relevant to adults, and from pediatric studies focusing on safe and effective management of other related conditions if available. During a review of the available literature, clinicians are trained to look for reported adverse events and evidence of tolerability. Since physiologically, metabolically, and behaviorally, children are not just small adults [ [33](#B33-children-09-00008)], caution should be taken to minimize the risk of harm. NDs are trained to adjust dosing of natural health products to the age and weight of the child [ [34](#B34-children-09-00008)]. Leaning toward less invasive or toxic interventions in general minimizes risk. [35](#B35-children-09-00008)]. All three must be integrated into the process of obtaining informed consent which requires a thorough discussion of all perceived risks and benefits of an approach and viable alternatives [ [36](#B36-children-09-00008)]. Ultimately, each intervention is an n = 1 trial\u2014true for all healthcare, and a core tenet of naturopathic practice\u2014and should be navigated as such with the family (see [Figure 4](#children-09-00008-f004)). NDs are trained to layer these thought processes on top of a foundation informed by naturopathic principles, which may ultimately influence the interpretation of evidence and/or preference by the patient or family. 3.4. Ethical Issues in Practice Management [37](#B37-children-09-00008)]. Naturopathic doctors are beholden to all standard limits of confidentiality within the jurisdiction of practice. 3.5. Advocacy for a Healthy Community and Environment [38](#B38-children-09-00008), [39](#B39-children-09-00008), [40](#B40-children-09-00008), [41](#B41-children-09-00008)]. Black, indigenous, and other people of colour are disproportionately affected. Human-caused ecological degradation of the natural world has a multitude of detrimental effects on human health [ [42](#B42-children-09-00008)]. Children are particularly vulnerable, due to the immaturity and plasticity of tissues and organ systems, as well as their disproportionately greater uptake due to normal physiology and behaviour [ [43](#B43-children-09-00008), [44](#B44-children-09-00008)]. They will also be most impacted in the future by widespread ecological and societal breakdown due to climate devastation [ [45](#B45-children-09-00008)]. Vulnerable and marginalized populations are the first and most significantly affected by environmental impacts [ [46](#B46-children-09-00008), [47](#B47-children-09-00008)]. 4. Referral to and Collaboration with a Naturopathic Doctor [48](#B48-children-09-00008), [49](#B49-children-09-00008)]. The \"why\" and \"how\" of lifestyle medicine is a core focus of naturopathic training, and NDs spend a notable amount of time engaged in lifestyle counselling and strategies of behaviour change. Collaboration with an ND can ensure families receive pragmatic support in terms of anticipatory guidance and holistic lifestyle counselling. This allows others in the medical community to focus on their areas of expertise, while NDs can apply their unique lens to enhance the capacity of the child to remain well and heal efficiently from the inevitable health concerns of childhood. [50](#B50-children-09-00008)]. Interest in and evidence for the use of CAM approaches in general are greater in certain populations, as mentioned earlier. As the only profession for which a doctorate is accredited for CAM, NDs are an excellent member of the healthcare team for families who are particularly interested in this approach to health. Because NDs are trained in both the biomedical model and other paradigms of healthcare, they are well-positioned to bridge any gaps through deeper conversations around the interpretation of evidence for CAM approaches, and strategies for integrating the best of both worlds. - If your jurisdiction is regulated, is this individual registered?

This requires regular engagement in continuing education and maintenance of malpractice insurance. - The PedANP maintains a list of professional members. However, membership only suggests an interest in pediatrics, not a specialization. The Fellowship of the American Board of Naturopathic Pediatrics (FABNP) designation indicates that the individual has met standards of certification, but this is not an accreditation of exclusion. Any naturopathic doctor may see children. 5.
