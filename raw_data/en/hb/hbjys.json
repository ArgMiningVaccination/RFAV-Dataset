Nearly 40% of adults supplement their traditional healthcare with an alternative medicine treatment. What are some of the benefits of alternative medicine? Alternative medicine treatments can have fewer side-effects because medications are not used. Natural remedies and treatments to boost your body's own healing processes are preferred. Alternative medicine also focuses on your body as a whole organism, not on your individual symptoms. Do I really need alternative medicine along with traditional medicine? Traditional medicine focuses on a group of symptoms and the disease itself, not on the patient. In traditional medicine, doctors often feel rushed and unable to provide adequate care, which can result in the overprescribing of medications.
