(Play with humans can be great exercise) Before running or starting any other repetitive exercise with your dog take the following into consideration. Exercise outside during the morning and evening hours and/or when it's cooler temperatures. Dogs cool themselves by panting and can [overheat](https://hs4dfinal.squarespace.com/heat-stroke) even in mildly warm weather during high intensity or endurance exercises. High humidity also impairs a dog cooling ability which can also contribute to [heat stroke](https://hs4dfinal.squarespace.com/heat-stroke).

Puppies and young dogs should not do any repetitive high impact endurance exercises like sustained running until their growth plates have closed. ( [e.g. long distance running, urban mushing, etc.](/bike-leash-attachment)) Nor should they be permitted to jump out of vehicles or off furniture which creates a heavy impact on growing bones. Overuse and focused stress can damage growth plates resulting in prematurely closing of the growth plate causing a malformation of the leg.

The growth plates of spayed or neutered dogs do not close until 18 to 22 months of age, depending on how early the dog was spayed or neutered and on hte dog's adult size. To confirm that our dog's growth plates have closed, you can have a veterinarian take a lateral radiograph of the stifle and check the growth plate at the tibial tuberosity, which is the last growth plate to close.\" [https://www.avidogzink.com/wp-content/uploads/puppy_exercise_guidelines_poster.pdf](https://www.avidogzink.com/wp-content/uploads/puppy_exercise_guidelines_poster.pdf) Age - Exercise Guidelines 8-16 weeks Off-leash walks 15-30 min puppy's pace walks over changes in surfaces, grass, sand, gravel, pavement Agility ground work 5-min wading sessions in water 17 weeks - 6 months Off-leash walks 45-60 min puppy's pace with larger terrain changes Hills, ditches, streams and logs Jump training up to wrist height Wading and swimming 5-10 minutes at a time 6 months - Growth Plate Closure Off-leash walks 45-60 min puppy's pace with larger terrain changes Hills, ditches, streams and logs Jump training up to elbow height Wading and swimming 10-15 minutes at a time Young Adult - Growth Plates Closed Begin endurance training - start slowly Trotting continuously for at least 20min no more than every other day Off-leash walks for an hour or more - all safe terrain Hikes for several hours depending upon weather Jump training above elbow height Wading and swimming for 10-15 minutes at a time. [Teaching Loose Leash Walking](https://www.homeskooling4dogs.com/walking-on-leash) Loose leash walking is different from \"heeling\". Loose leash walking is just that; a dog that walks with, and next to you while not pulling, or putting tension in the leash. Basically enjoying a walk on a leash with you. Heeling is having your dog directly at your side with its attention on you. Heeling is used in competition and for times when you need your dog to focus on you for short distances to get by a distraction. To learn how to teach your dog to walk nicely on a leash go here: [Teaching Loose Leash Walking](https://www.homeskooling4dogs.com/walking-on-leash) [Loose Leash Walking: Easier with Horses Than Dogs?](https://suzanneclothier.com/article/loose-leash-walking-horses-vs-dogs/) Relaxed dogs typically move from point A to point B at a trot (especially if \"going somewhere\" - even if that's from the kitchen to the hallway!) Dog + human - both are in different gaits. Most dogs cannot trot as slowly as the typical person walks. (Amazingly, many horses can and do trot as slowly as a human walks!) [Loose Leash Walking: Easier with Horses Than Dogs?](https://suzanneclothier.com/article/loose-leash-walking-horses-vs-dogs/)Suzanne Clothier Dog(s) Health & Fitness Many dogs are unprepared for intense endurance exercise for even short duration's making them susceptible to injuries. Injuries can go unrecognized for long periods of time. Very important you consider your dog's fitness and weight prior to exercise. Always start with a vet check to make sure your dog is healthy AND physically capable to participate in the exercise which should include an evaluation your dog's structure and gait for any weaknesses. Many dogs are willing to do anything we ask and often have a strong desire to participate, but we should be careful we are asking them to do more then their body can comfortably do. Be careful that you are breaking your dog's body down which will result in crippling arthritis as they age. [ \"Your Athletic Dog\"](https://suzanneclothier.com/shop/athletic-dog-functional-approach/) is an excellent book/DVD to understand how to condition your dog. The dog's structure will affect their endurance and susceptibilities to injury. There are more than 25 structural issues that will affect endurance or performance. For guidance on identifying structural issues, Pat Hastings book is a great resource. [Structure in Action: The Makings of a Durable Dog](https://amzn.to/2HGQLQM) To reduce chance of injuries your dog will need recovery time. Dogs that have a fulfilling life full of experiences to maintain their mental, physical, and emotional health are less likely to develop the inappropriate behaviors that are the result of boredom, stress, and frustration. Dogs commonly display behaviors out of stress, anxiety, and frustration such as, barking, jumping, spinning, chewing, among others. Boredom and loneliness are sources of excessive stress for both dogs and cats. Long-term stress reduces the immune system's ability to fight disease so it is important that stressors are reduced for our animals. [Enriching Your Dog's Life](https://www.homeskooling4dogs.com/enriching-your-dogs-life) [Overloaded! (It's Not by [Chris Zink DVM PhD Justin Shmalberg Nom Nom Now](https://www.nomnomnow.com/obese-dog-weight-loss)) While a dog exercise program is important, remember that most of the calories in any weight loss plan need to be shed by reducing the amount of food. \"It's unlikely your dog can tolerate enough exercise to lose weight without also reducing calories,\" says Shmalberg. Exercise must be designed with the specifics of your dog in mind\u2014many overweight pets, especially those that are middle-aged to senior, may have arthritis or other conditions which limit stamina. Walking is the best exercise for most dogs because it shouldn't overstress the cardiovascular system, and it has low impact on joints. (In fact, walking can be beneficial in arthritic dogs as it helps to maintain muscle mass and distribute joint fluid, which keeps joints lubricated). Here's how to design a dog exercise plan: If your dog is already getting controlled exercise (walking, playing, etc.), increase her activity by about 25 percent. If your dog is relatively inactive, start with the [American Animal Hospital Association's recommended five-minute walks three times daily](https://www.aaha.org/public_documents/professional/guidelines/weight_management_guidelines.pdf). Aim for your dog to get about an hour of exercise per day, as long as he can tolerate it. The amount of calories your dog burns during this period is related to the distance you travel. Dogs consume about 0.75 calories per pound per mile during walks. Exercise your dog during cooler times of day (morning, evening) or, if it's very hot, in climate-controlled areas. This is especially important for dogs with short noses. Always bring water; travel or collapsible bowls are a good idea. But leave the sports drinks at home\u2014dogs get rid of heat by panting, not sweating, so they don't lose the electrolytes like humans do. Stick close to home until you know how your dog will do, and have a plan B in case your dog can't make it back. Avoid inclines and declines in the terrain, which put more strain on the legs, until you're further into the exercise plan. Hills can, after your pet is used to exercise, help to burn more calories and build muscle. Keep your dog's nails trimmed. When they're too long, they can change the position of the toes and make walking more difficult. Make the experience enjoyable. Your overweight dog may not be excited by exercise in the beginning and it's likely to be quite tiring. Encouragement, toys, and time with you can all be used as rewards. You can give low-calorie treats, but remember to account for these in the overall calorie plan. Even better, in lieu of treats, use part of your dog's daily food to reward her during exercise. Just don't overdo it: feeding too much right before or during exercise could cause issues. Change up the type of activity as your dog progresses. Try fetch, hill work, hiking, or jogging. Swimming is a good low-impact exercise for dogs, but if they're not proven swimmers, they need to start with a life vest. Underwater treadmills (found at rehabilitation facilities) are often used to encourage weight loss in dogs being treated for orthopedic conditions. Exercise \"In general, most dogs expend about 1.1kcal/kg/km at a brisk walking pace of 10-10.5min/km.\"... \"A 45 kg dog will burn about 240 calories after 4.82km at that pace. Walking at a slower pace also has health benefits, although the benefits are difficult to quan-tify because of lack of current research.\" [8] 45kg = 99 lb dog 4.82km = 3 miles Surface Best to ride on dirt or grass surfaces since these are less harsh then pavement or concrete on your dog. You may want to consider using a paw wax to help protect your dogs paws. Temperature Dogs cool by panting. When air temperatures are near body temperature (101 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher dogs cannot cool themselves efficiently. The ground temperature can be more than 50 degrees hotter than the air temperature. Burns can result at 118 degrees. Exercise during the morning and evening hours when it's cooler and avoid concrete and especially blacktop or pavement. Humidity High humidity also impairs a dog cooling ability which can also contribute to heat stroke. What's The Best Way to Cool a Dog? \"A recent study compared three mechanisms for cooling dogs after 15 min treadmill exercise in a room at 30 degrees C (86 degrees F) (5). Dogs that were dipped in water for 5 minutes at ambient temperature had cooled in 16 minutes. Dogs that were placed in a kennel on a cooling mat at 4 degrees C (39 degrees F) with a fan took 36 minutes to cool. And dogs that were just in a kennel with a fan took 48 minutes to cool down. The authors suggested that water immersion is a method for not only treating but also for preventing overheating when dogs exercise.\" [4] Water (Hydration) Make sure to always have water on-hand to keep your dog hydrated. [How Much Water Should Your Dog Be Drinking?](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/05/07/dog-water-consumption.aspx) [A good general guideline is that a healthy dog should drink between \u00bd and 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight each day. So a healthy 65-pound Labrador Retriever should be drinking between about 33 and 65 ounces, or about \u00bc to \u00bd gallon of water daily.](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/05/07/dog-water-consumption.aspx) [If your dog is eating a moisture-rich, species-appropriate diet, she's getting some of her water needs met with each meal, so she may not drink as much from her water bowl. But if she's eating primarily dry dog food (which I don't recommend), she may actually need more than the average daily intake to compensate for the lack of moisture in her diet.](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/05/07/dog-water-consumption.aspx) [Puppies need to drink small amounts of water every couple of hours and should be closely monitored and encouraged to drink.](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/05/07/dog-water-consumption.aspx) [After a period of hard play or exercise, use caution when your dog rehydrates. If he immediately laps up the contents of his water bowl, rest him for a bit before you refill his bowl. If your dog is very active, it's a good idea to have water with you when he exercises so that you can give him frequent short water breaks to keep him hydrated.](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/05/07/dog-water-consumption.aspx) Keeping Dogs Cool Only exercise during the morning and evening hours and/or when it's cooler temperatures.

Severely affected dogs may collapse whenever they are exercised to this extent - other dogs only exhibit collapse sporadically. The first thing noted is usually a rocking or forced gait. The rear limbs then become weak and unable to support weight. Many affected dogs will continue to run while dragging their back legs. Some of the dogs appear to be incoordinated, especially in the rear limbs, with a wide-based, long, loose stride rather than the short, stiff strides typically associated with muscle weakness. In some dogs the rear limb collapse progresses to forelimb weakness and occasionally to a total inability to move.\"... \"It is common for the symptoms to worsen for 3 to 5 minutes even after exercise has been terminated.\" [6] \"EIC episodes occur when the dog is excited and exercising intensely. Observant owners will notice that the hindquarters begin to wobble until the hind end of the dog collapses. The dog feels no pain and the limbs are not stiff. They may keep trying to play and move forwards, but they need to be made to rest to regain the use of their hindquarters. A few dogs have died but stopping exercise once the dog collapses does lead to recovery without lasting consequences. However, it will all happen again. Affected individuals can have a normal life as pet dogs as long as their exercise is managed to avoid the intensity that triggers a collapse.\" [7] Recovery From Collapse \"Most dogs recover quickly but the recovery is gradual rather than instantaneous. Dogs are normal within 5 to 25 minutes with no residual weakness or stiffness. Dogs are not painful during the collapse or after recovery. Massage of the muscles or palpation of the joints or spine does not cause discomfort. Affected dogs are not stiff or sore or limping upon recovery.\" [3] \"There is a similar collapsing syndrome in Border Collies but this does not show up on the DNA test which gives us the diagnosis of EIC. The Border Collie Collapse (BCC) has a slightly different pattern with gradually increasing fatigue followed by loss of mental and optical focus leading to collapse involving forelimbs as well as hindlimbs. Both conditions have an associated transient pyrexia, which is also found in normal dogs in intense activity. This has led to EIC and BCC being [mistaken for heat stroke](https://www.homeskooling4dogs.com/heat-stroke) which is a very different condition. Heat stroke follows over-exertion at high ambient temperature.\" [2] \"In Labradors, EIC is most common in dogs bred for field trials, which fits with the observation that it shows most frequently in lean, fit, intensely exercising and highly motivated individuals. About 50 percent of the Labrador population carry the gene, but both parents must be carriers to produce affected puppies. It usually shows from five months of age, in both sexes, most often when the young dog starts intensive training. The animal will be normal in all other respects, including full clinical work-up.\" [2] \"any Labrador Retriever with exercise intolerance should always have a complete veterinary evaluation to rule-out treatable conditions such as orthopedic disorders, heart failure, anemia, heart rhythm disturbances, respiratory problems, low blood sugar, cauda equina syndrome, myasthenia gravis, hypoadrenocorticism, and muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing for EIC can now be performed to confirm a suspected diagnosis of EIC.\" [3] \"The Veterinary Genetics Laboratory offers a genetic test for EIC. Test results assist veterinarians with diagnosis of EIC and help breeders identify carriers among breeding stock to avoid producing affected dogs. Matings between carriers are expected to produce 25% of affected puppies.\" [1] \"It can be tested for so that dogs as young as five to six weeks old can be identified and not put forward for training.\" [2] Testing Treadmills can be used for endurance conditioning but they should only be used under the proper circumstances. First off they should only be used with dogs that enjoy using them. Treadmills are good for supervised physical rehab and the canine athlete. For the canine athlete they can \"be an outstanding alternative during inclement weather and can provide variety in training.\" Another consideration is that \"trotting on a treadmill does not exercise as many muscles as trotting over ground\" and \"treadmills should not constitute the main method for endurance conditioning in canine athletes that specialize in endurance events such as mushing, field trials, and herding trials.\" Additional important considerations are: The \"treadmill is at least 2.5 times the length of the dog's body\" (measured front of chest to furthest point under base of tail) \"With most larger dogs this rules out the use of treadmills designed for humans.\" \"Other cautions for use of the treadmill include not having the treadmill face a wall or other solid surface, not harnessing a dog to a treadmill\" Chris Zink; Janet B.
