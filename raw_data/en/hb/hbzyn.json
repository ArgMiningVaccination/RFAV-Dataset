The ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial, which enrolled 718 patients with 50% or more scalp hair loss as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), evaluated the efficacy and safety of LITFULO at 118 sites in 18 countries. In this pivotal study, 23% of patients treated with LITFULO 50 mg had 80% or more scalp hair coverage (SALT20) after six months compared to 1.6% with placebo. The efficacy and safety of LITFULO were consistent between adolescents (12 through 17 years of age) and adults (18 years of age and older). The most common adverse events (AEs) reported in at least 4% of patients with LITFULO include headache (10.8%), diarrhea (10%), acne (6.2%), rash (5.4%), and urticaria (4.6%). Full results from the ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 study were published by [The Lancet](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736%252823%252900222-2%2Ffulltext&esheet=53429655&newsitemid=20230623087591&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Lancet&index=2&md5=89a89507da9d8d2580b6f3f789c493e1) in April 2023. \"People living with alopecia areata are often misunderstood, and their experience is frequently trivialized as 'just hair.' However, it is a serious autoimmune disease that can have considerable negative impact beyond the physical symptoms,\" said Nicole Friedland, President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF). \"We believe the approval of LITFULO is a significant advancement for the treatment of alopecia areata, particularly for teens.

LITFULO will be available in the coming weeks. About Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease characterized by patchy or complete hair loss on the scalp, face, or body.1,2 It has an underlying immuno-inflammatory pathogenesis and develops when the immune system attacks the body's hair follicles, causing hair to fall out.1,2,3 This hair loss often occurs on the scalp, but it can also affect eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, and other areas of the body.1,2 Alopecia totalis (total scalp hair loss) and alopecia universalis (total body hair loss) are types of alopecia areata.1 Impacting nearly 7 million people in the U.S. and approximately 147 million people globally, alopecia areata can affect people of any age, gender, race, or ethnicity and can cause considerable burden beyond hair loss.1,2,3,4 Nearly 20% of people with alopecia areata are diagnosed before the age of 18.5 Additional Details on the ALLEGRO Clinical Trial Program The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial (NCT03732807) investigated LITFULO in patients 12 years of age and older with alopecia areata. Patients included in the study had 50% or more scalp hair loss as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), including patients with alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis, who were experiencing a current episode of alopecia areata that had lasted between six months and 10 years. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily LITFULO (50 mg, 30 mg, 10 mg) with or without one month of initial treatment with once-daily LITFULO 200 mg, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks. At Week 24, LITFULO groups continued their assigned doses and patients initially assigned to placebo switched to LITFULO (50 mg or 200 mg loading dose + 50 mg) for an additional 24 weeks. In this pivotal study, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with LITFULO 50 mg had 80% or more scalp hair coverage (SALT20) after six months of treatment versus placebo (23% treated with LITFULO 50 mg compared to 1.6% with placebo). The most common AEs occurring in at least 1% of patients through 24 weeks were headache, diarrhea, acne, rash, urticaria, folliculitis, red blood cell count decrease, and stomatitis. Cases of serious infection, malignancies, thromboembolic events, and lab abnormalities were also reported. More information about the ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial can be found at [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&esheet=53429655&newsitemid=20230623087591&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&index=4&md5=78d80026af19e4fe0af1071a592df851). ALLEGRO-LT is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, long-term study to investigate the safety and efficacy of LITFULO in adults with alopecia areata with 25% or greater hair loss and adolescents from 12 years of age with alopecia areata with 50% or greater hair loss. About LITFULO (Ritlecitinib) LITFULO is an inhibitor of JAK3 and family kinases. Inhibition of JAK3 and TEC kinase family members by LITFULO may block signaling of cytokines and cytolytic activity of T cells, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.6,7,8,9 Regulatory applications for LITFULO in alopecia areata have been submitted to countries around the world for review, including China, the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ritlecitinib with a decision anticipated in the third quarter of 2023. LITFULO is also being evaluated for vitiligo, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. INDICATION LITFULO is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. Limitations of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators, cyclosporine or other potent immunosuppressants. US IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION LITFULO may cause serious side effects, including: Serious infections. LITFULO can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Do not start LITFULO if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. Some people have had serious infections while taking LITFULO or other similar medicines, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body, and have been hospitalized. Some people taking similar medicines to LITFULO have died from these infections. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster). Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting treatment with LITFULO and should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with LITFULO. Before and after starting LITFULO, tell your doctor right away if you have an infection, are being treated for one, or have symptoms of an infection, including: - fever, sweating, or chills - muscle aches - cough or shortness of breath - blood in your phlegm - weight loss - warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body - diarrhea or stomach pain - burning when you urinate or urinating more often than usual - feeling very tired LITFULO can make you more likely to get infections or worsen infections you have. If you get a serious infection, your healthcare provider may stop treatment with LITFULO until your infection is controlled. There is an increased risk of death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. LITFULO is a kinase inhibitor. Cancer and immune system problems. LITFULO may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen. People, especially current or past smokers, have a higher risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma and lung cancers, while taking a JAK inhibitor. Follow your healthcare provider's advice about having your skin checked for skin cancer during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer. There is an increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a JAK inhibitor, especially for current or past smokers. Get emergency help right away if you have any symptoms of a heart attack or stroke while taking LITFULO, including: - discomfort in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back - severe tightness, pain, pressure, or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw - pain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach - shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort - breaking out in a cold sweat - nausea or vomiting - feeling lightheaded - weakness in one part or on one side of your body - slurred speech Blood clots. Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT), lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE), or eyes can happen in some people taking LITFULO. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the veins of the legs and lungs have happened more often in people 50 years and older, with at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor, taking a JAK inhibitor. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had blood clots in the past. Stop taking LITFULO and get medical help right away if you have any signs and symptoms of blood clots, including swelling, pain, or tenderness in one or both legs; sudden, unexplained chest or upper back pain; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; or changes in vision, especially in one eye only. Allergic reactions. Symptoms that may mean you are having an allergic reaction have been seen during treatment with LITFULO. Some of these reactions were serious. Stop taking LITFULO and get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of allergic reaction, including hives; rash; trouble breathing; feeling faint or dizzy; or swelling of your lips, tongue, or throat. Changes in certain laboratory test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start taking LITFULO and during treatment to check your lymphocyte and platelet counts and liver enzyme and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. You should not take LITFULO if your lymphocyte counts or platelet counts are too low or your liver tests are too high. Increased CPK levels in the blood are common with LITFULO and can also be severe.Your healthcare provider may stop treatment for a period of time if there are changes in these blood test results. Do not take LITFULO if you are allergic to ritlecitinib or any of the ingredients in LITFULO. See the Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients. Before taking LITFULO, tell your healthcare provider if you: - have an infection, are being treated for one, or have one that won't go away or keeps returning - have diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system - have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB - have had shingles (herpes zoster) - have had hepatitis B or hepatitis C - live, have lived, or traveled to certain areas (such as Ohio & Mississippi River Valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections. These infections may happen or worsen when taking LITFULO. Ask your healthcare provider if you're unsure if you have lived in an area where these infections are common - have had any type of cancer - have had blood clots - are a current or past smoker - have had a heart attack, other heart problems, or stroke - have liver problems - have abnormal blood tests (low platelet count or white blood cell count) - have recently received or are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. People who take LITFULO should not receive live vaccines right before or during treatment - are or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if LITFULO will harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with LITFULO. There is a pregnancy registry for people who take LITFULO during pregnancy. Report pregnancies to Pfizer, Inc. at 1-877-390-2940 - are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if LITFULO passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with LITFULO and for 14 hours after your last dose of LITFULO. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with LITFULO Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and overthecounter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. LITFULO and other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. The most common side effects of LITFULO include red blood cell counts; and mouth sores, redness and swelling of the lining of your mouth. These are not all of the possible side effects of LITFULO.
