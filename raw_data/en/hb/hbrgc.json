He integrates naturopathic medicine with a non-invasive and painless electronic method of diagnosis based on the German system of bioenergetic medicine. Dr. Cholewa finds this method extremely useful in identifying the underlying cause of ill health and optimizing your health and well-being. Dr. Ian Cholewa received his bachelor's degree from University of British Columbia and his Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine from Bastyr University in Seattle. He worked as a research assistant in neuroscience research centers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington before he became a naturopathic doctor. After graduating from naturopathic medical school, he practiced in Vancouver, British Columbia before starting his private practice in south Maui. Dr. Cholewa was born and raised in Poland and lived in Western Europe and Canada before relocating to Maui, where he now lives with his wife Anna. Bilingual, Dr. Cholewa speaks fluent Polish and English and even a bit of German. Dr. Cholewa is a member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians. What is a Naturopathic Physician? Naturopathic physicians (N.D.'s) are general practitioners trained as specialists in natural medicine and preventive health care. Their clinical expertise combines some techniques of both conventional and natural medicine knowledge. Naturopathic physicians' clinical education integrates modern medical knowledge with centuries-old natural medicine therapies and treatments. In their work, naturopathic physicians make practical use of the latest biochemical research along with natural therapies and treatments. Naturopathic physicians treat underlying causes of disease and employ individualized treatments to support the body's natural healing ability. They emphasize prevention and the importance of personal responsibility in health and healing. In the United States, naturopathic medicine emerged as a distinct healthcare profession 100 years ago. In Europe, naturopathic medicine is an established practice and it continues to enjoy high level of acceptance and recognition. The growing popularity of naturopathic medicine throughout the world was recognized by the World Health Organization's 1983 report recommending that naturopathic medicine be integrated into conventional health care systems. Naturopathic physicians diagnose and treat both acute and chronic disease utilizing conventional and complementary methods. They perform physical examinations, laboratory tests, radiologic examinations and other diagnostic tests. Naturopaths also employ specialized diagnostic assessments and treatment methods including: - nutritional evaluations - lifestyle counseling - autonomic reflex allergy testing - therapeutic nutrition - botanical medicine - homeopathy - physical therapy - natural hormone balancing - IV nutrient therapies - chelation therapy - complementary cancer therapies - prevention oriented care Naturopathic physicians also refer patients to appropriate medical specialists when indicated, and in some states prescribe drugs and administer vaccinations. Adherence to rigorous educational and professional standards set by recognized regulatory bodies is essential for naturopathic practitioners. To become licensed, a naturopathic physician attends a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical school and takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a naturopathic physician. In some states, they are recognized as primary care providers for insurance companies and serve as general practitioners for families. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education and the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners sets naturopathic education and examination standards. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) sets professional standards to assure public health and safety. Dr. Ian Cholewa's practice in Maui, Hawaii incorporates both naturopathic and German bioenergetic medicine to help you find the underlying causes of your personal health struggles. Through the use of the Autonomic Reflex Testing instrument, Dr. Cholewa can identify irregularities that often cannot be detected through standard laboratory tests. This method assesses the body's autonomic nervous system\u2014the complex of nerves that are responsible for most subconscious or involuntary processes in the body. Examples of processes controlled by the autonomic nervous system are breathing, heart rate and digestion which all happen without a direct physical effort. Dr. Cholewa will then measure the responses of these nerves to standardized frequencies that have known relationships to organs, pathogens, hormones, toxins and allergens. Any variations from the normal can help determine the root causes of dysfunction and disease. In our practice patients can receive a spectrum of care including: - NATUROPATHIC MEDICAL CARE - INTEGRATIVE FAMILY HEALTH CARE - GERMAN BIOLOGICAL MEDICINE - COMPLEMENTARY CANCER THERAPIES - IV NUTRIENT THERAPIES - CHELATION THERAPY - NATURAL HORMONE BALANCING - PREVENTION ORIENTED CARE - NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING - NUTRITIONAL EVALUATIONS - ALLERGY AND SENSITIVITY TESTING - NATURAL WEIGHT MANAGEMENT The combination of naturopathic medicine with German electro-diagnosis offers a new and unique approach to healthcare. It provides an efficient way to reveal imbalances underlying an illness and offers effective health building solutions. You may think of it as if the body can tell on itself; providing information about what's happening on a deeper level. Dr. Cholewa's goal is to glean the information and then increase the regulatory and self-healing capacity of the body and restore optimal health. Healing the whole body may also require additional changes to help you be your most healthy.

This test finds problems before any cellular changes have taken place - literally finding a disease before it is visible. Our bodies have a constant flow of energy within them. Known as our vital force, this energy flows through our bodies and when one part of the force meets a portion of the body that isn't healthy, it can change the way your energy moves\u2014and how you feel. For your autonomic reflex testing, Dr. Cholewa conducts a painless evaluation of the autonomic nerves. These nerves are responsible for many of the subconscious activities your body makes; including heart rate, breathing and digestion\u2014and they can also tell your doctor what's happening inside your body in ways that you won't even realize. A small wand is used to measure the electrical resistance at points on the hand, similar to acupuncture points and then your doctor will interpret the results to help you find the cause of illness and improve overall health. Autonomic Reflex Testing can reveal information on food and environmental allergies, the presence of environmental toxicities, infections, Candida (yeast) overgrowth, nutritional deficiencies and reactions to vaccines. This method also assesses functional organ imbalances and tests for patient tolerance and sensitivity of naturopathic medicines, informing the doctor which medications will be most effective for the patient. Allergy & Sensitivity Testing Many common health complaints are caused by hidden allergies. An allergy is an exaggerated response from the immune system to foreign substances, or allergens. You may be allergic to food such as milk, eggs, soy or nuts; or particles in the environment like pollen, dust, animal dander or chemicals. More than 60% of the U.S. population may suffer unknowingly from allergies. Symptoms such as fatigue, low energy, muscle aches and pains, headaches, weight gain and a lack of general sense of well-being may be caused by allergies. Many people with unidentified allergies often recognize that something isn't right within their bodies, but every traditional test has returned normal\u2014leaving them feeling frustrated and looking for answers. Identifying allergens can help improve your health, energy level and protect your immune system from long term stress. "}
