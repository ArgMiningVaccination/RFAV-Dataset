Acupuncture is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used for over 4,000 years to promote healing naturally. Acupuncture focuses on restoring natural energy, called Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), along pathways in the body called meridians. According to traditional Chinese medicine, illness is caused by disruptions in these energy pathways. If your Qi is blocked, the flow of blood is stagnated, resulting in pain and illness. Chinese acupuncture works to balance the flow of Qi to organs, glands and body tissues. Current research reveals that acupuncture works by activating the pathway between the nervous (nerve) system and endocrine (gland) system. Acupuncture benefits may include: Research has also shown that acupuncture can help manage the side effects - pain, immune functions, nausea, etc. - associated with conventional cancer treatments.

During an acupuncture session, a certified acupuncturist inserts sterile, hair-thin needles into precise spots on your body. The procedure usually causes very little pain, with most people only noticing a small prick. Aurora doctors work closely with holistic specialists like acupuncturists to enhance your healing and performance. People come to us for acupuncture because we offer: The typical course of acupuncture includes 10 treatments, but you may start improving after just a couple visits. Your first visit will take about 60 to 90 minutes, with the rest of your appointments lasting 45 to 60 minutes. You don't have to do anything special to prepare for your appointments. Before you start your treatment, it's important to check if acupuncture is covered by your insurance plan. At the start of your session, your acupuncturist will tell you the area of the body they'll focus on and whether you need to remove any clothing. You will lie on a padded table during treatment. During the session, your acupuncturist will insert several hair-thin needles in strategic locations. Most people feel only a mild sensation. Your acupuncturist may move the needles gently, sometimes using heat and electrical stimulation to enhance therapy. After about 20 minutes, your acupuncturist will remove the needles and dispose of them immediately. Many people report excellent results, but acupuncture doesn't work for everyone. Make sure you communicate with your orthopedist and primary care doctor about your acupuncture treatments.
