The [AACR Annual Meeting 2019](https://www.aacr.org/Meetings/Pages/MeetingDetail.aspx?EventItemID=174)has an anticipated attendance of more than 22,500 scientists, clinicians, advocates and other attendees from around the world, and brings together what AACR call \"the best talent and job opportunities in cancer and biomedical research.\" \"The AACR Annual Meeting program covers the latest discoveries across the spectrum of cancer research\u2014from population science and prevention; to cancer biology, translational and clinical studies; to survivorship and advocacy\u2014and highlights the work of the best minds in research and medicine from institutions all over the world,\" says AACR's meeting website. \"The AACR annual meeting is the meeting that we all look forward to very year,\" says Dr. Elizabeth M. Jaffee, AACR's 2018-2019 president, in a welcome/preview video for the meeting. \"It's a meeting that brings experts from all sectors of the cancer community\u2014from government, academia, the pharmaceutical industry, survivorship, patients, patient advocates. It brings everyone together at one meeting. It's a huge meeting. The best science\u2014the most up-to-date science\u2014is presented, from basic to translational to clinical care.\" With this year's theme, \"Integrative Cancer Science Global Impact Individualized Patient Care,\" the scientific program includes a roster of world-class speakers, hundreds of invited talks and more than 6,000 proffered papers. Presentations at the AACR Annual Meeting will span the entire field of cancer research, highlighting basic, translational and clinical research on important topics such as immunotherapy, science policy, targeted therapy, artificial intelligence, liquid biopsy, early detection, cancer interception, prevention, survivorship and cancer health disparities. This year's meeting will also include a number of science policy sessions. Those following the meeting on social media can join the conversation on Twitter with the hashtag #AACR19. \"At this year's AACR annual meeting in Atlanta, there will be an extensive focus on the science of cancer health disparities, including a plenary session dedicated to this important topic,\" says Dr. John D. Carpten, the 2019 program chair for the AACR meeting, in AACR's welcome/preview video. \"In addition, we will offer a wide range of educational and scientific sessions covering the entire spectrum of cancer health disparities and research.\" As Jaffee told DDNews, AACR added a new session format this year, and two special sessions on \"Making Science Count for Patients\" will focus the story of basic science discoveries that led to translational research and clinical application. \"One session will have talks covering the discovery of cytotoxic T cell antigen (CTLA)-4 as a modulator of T cell co-stimulation through to the clinical application and development the anti-CTLA-4 antibody,\" she says. \"The other session will focus on CDK4/6.\" Jaffee also points out that AACR has added a drug development track to this year's program. Moreover, \"This year we have increased the number of NextGen Stars speaking opportunities. In addition to being integrated into some thematic major sessions, we have two dedicated spotlight sessions to highlight the work of these rising stars.\" (See also the \"NextGen Stars\" sidebar below.)

The study offers evidence that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has reduced the incidence of infections that can lead to cervical cancer, said the study's lead author, Dr. Nancy McClung, epidemic intelligence service officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. \"Almost all sexually active individuals will get HPV at some point in their lifetime, but most HPV infections go away on their own without any treatment,\" McClung explained. \"If an HPV infection does not go away, it can cause cell changes that, over time, develop into a lesion on the cervix called a cervical precancer. Cervical precancers allow us to observe the impact of HPV vaccination earlier than cervical cancer, which can take decades to develop.\" Previous research has suggested that the incidence of cervical precancer has been decreasing. In this study, researchers sought to determine whether HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers worldwide, are also decreasing. These two types have been targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, which was most typically administered in the United States between 2006 and 2015, and by the 9-valent vaccine that is the only vaccine currently administered in the United States. As part of the CDC's HPV Vaccine Impact Monitoring Project (HPV-IMPACT), McClung and colleagues analyzed more than 10,000 archived specimens collected between 2008 and 2014 from women aged 18-39 who had been diagnosed with grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2+). Both are precancerous conditions that can arise from persistent HPV infection, and can lead to cervical cancer. The researchers tested the samples for 37 HPV types, then analyzed the proportion and estimated number of cases by HPV types over time. The researchers found that the number of cases of CIN2+ reported to HPV-IMPACT declined 21 percent, from 2,344 in 2008 to 1,857 in 2014. The estimated number of cases attributed to HPV16/18 declined from 1,235 in 2008 to 819 cases in 2014. Among women who were vaccinated, the proportion of CIN2+ cases that were HPV 16/18-positive declined from 55.2 percent to 33.3 percent. Among unvaccinated women, the proportion of CIN2+ cases that were HPV 16/18-positive declined from 51.0 percent to 47.3 percent, and among those with unknown vaccination status, from 53.7 percent to 45.8 percent. McClung explained that some vaccinated women were most likely HPV 16/18-positive because they were infected with these HPV types before they were vaccinated. The majority of vaccinated women in this study received the vaccine in their early 20s, after the age most women initiate sexual activity. According to McClung, the decline in unvaccinated women may be due to herd protection. Researchers noted that every age group saw significant declines in the proportion of CIN2+ cases that were HPV 16/18-positive, with the exception of the oldest group, those aged 35-39. McClung said this finding reflects the fact that most of these women were not eligible for vaccination because of their age. McClung said a limitation of the study was the inability to confirm vaccination status on about 50 percent of the women in the study. While white and black women saw declines in the proportion of HPV 16/18-positive precancers, Hispanic and Asian women did not. McClung noted that the Hispanic and Asian women included in this study may have been less likely to be vaccinated. But as of 2016, HPV vaccine uptake was robust in Hispanic and Asian teens; therefore, racial and ethnic disparities are expected to diminish, McClung said. The CDC's most recent statistics show that 49.5 percent of girls and 37.5 percent of boys aged 13-17 are up to date on all recommended doses of the HPV vaccine. McClung said clinicians should continue to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine for all preteens at age 11 or 12, and effectively answer parents' common questions about the vaccine. She mentioned that the study indicated that efforts to encourage families to get the HPV vaccination for their teens are paying off, and should be continued. \"This is clear evidence that the HPV vaccine is working to prevent cervical disease in young women in the United States,\" McClung concluded. \"In the coming years, we should see even greater impact as more women are vaccinated during early adolescence and before exposure to HPV.\" AACR News: Gastric acid suppressants may negatively impact survival outcomes in sarcoma patients treated with pazopanib PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In patients with soft tissue sarcoma, the concomitant use of gastric acid suppressant (GAS) therapy and the anticancer therapeutic pazopanib (Votrient) was associated with significantly reduced progression-free survival and overall survival, according to results published in Clinical Cancer Research. \"Our results indicate that gastric acid suppressants reduce the efficacy of pazopanib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma,\" explained Dr. Olivier Mir, medical oncologist and clinical pharmacologist at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute, University of Paris-Sud. \"Oncologists and pharmacists should pay close attention to patients' concurrent medications, as they may have a significant impact on cancer treatment outcomes.\" It's estimated that up to 50 percent of those undergoing cancer treatment utilize GAS therapy. Common GAS drugs include proton pump inhibitors, such as ranitidine (Zantac). In many Western countries, these medications are available over the counter. Mir noted that the absorption of pazopanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma, is pH-dependent. \"We know that pazopanib tablets taken orally need to go into an acidic environment ... in order to dissolve,\" he explained. \"As the primary function of GAS therapy is to reduce the acidity in the stomach, these drugs can reduce the absorption of pazopanib,\" Mir continued. Previous work has shown that GAS therapy reduced the absorption of pazopanib as measured in plasma in patients with solid tumors. \"We wanted to determine if the use of GAS drugs had an effect on survival outcomes in sarcoma patients taking pazopanib,\" Mir said. Mir and colleagues analyzed data combined from two completed clinical trials; one Phase 2 trial evaluated the tolerability and antitumor activity of pazopanib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, and one Phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy of pazopanib, versus placebo, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received prior therapy. A total of 333 patients treated with pazopanib were eligible for analysis; of these, 117 (35.1 percent) received GAS drugs at least once during pazopanib treatment, 59 (17.7 percent) utilized GAS therapy concomitantly for more than 80 percent of pazopanib treatment duration and 19 (5.7 percent) were already using GAS drugs at the time of trial registration. Following multivariable analysis, compared to patients who did not use GAS therapy during pazopanib treatment, those who concomitantly utilized GAS for at least 80 percent of treatment duration had significantly reduced progression-free survival (median of 4.6 months compared to 2.8 months, respectively). Concomitant use of GAS also significantly reduced overall survival; those who utilized GAS therapy for at least 80 percent of treatment duration had shorter median overall survival (8 months) compared to those who did not use GAS therapy (12.6 months). Among the 110 placebo-treated patients from the Phase 3 trial who were eligible for analysis, there were no associations between concomitant GAS use and progression-free survival or overall survival. \"This suggests that the drug-drug interaction between GAS and pazopanib directly affected the survival outcomes of sarcoma patients,\" Mir noted. Mir and colleagues also found that GAS therapy did not reduce the frequency of pazopanib-related toxicities. \"I think that our results are practice-changing, and I would discourage oncologists against prescribing gastric acid suppressants when patients are treated with pazopanib, unless it is the only option for the patient. Patients often utilize GAS therapy for abdominal pain, which is not always related to stomach acidity,\" Mir concluded. \"I would predict that the majority of patients taking GAS drugs could utilize a different therapy to aid in their abdominal discomfort. Moreover, it is important for patients to inform their oncologists of all the medications that they are taking during cancer treatment (including those available OTC) so that potential drug-drug interactions can be identified and avoided.\" AACR News: Patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma genotypes may respond to targeted and immunologic therapies PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Unlike patients with melanoma bearing BRAF V600E mutations, those whose tumors have V600K mutations may benefit less from BRAF and MEK inhibitors and more from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, according to results published in Clinical Cancer Research. \"The clinicopathic differences previously observed in V600E and V600K BRAF-mutant melanoma can now be explained by their biology. These genotypes should be considered as distinct clinical entities with differing responses to treatments, and they should be managed differently,\" said Dr. Alexander Menzies, medical oncologist and associate professor at Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Royal North Shore and Mater Hospitals. About 40 percent of patients with melanoma bear mutations in the gene BRAF, of which about 70-80 percent are V600E and 20-30 percent are V600K. Patients with BRAF mutations are often treated with targeted therapy, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, or anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, Menzies noted. The researchers have previously published a study that evaluated the clinicopathic features of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. \"We wanted to explore the molecular basis for differing clinical phenotypes observed between BRAF V600E and V600K melanomas, whether they have distinct response profiles to targeted treatments and immunotherapy, and the biological rationale for different clinical outcomes,\" Menzies added. Menzies and colleagues evaluated baseline samples taken from 93 BRAF-mutant melanoma patients treated with targeted therapy (BRAF inhibitors with or without MEK inhibitors). Of these 93 patients, 73 had V600E BRAF-mutant melanoma, while 15 patients had V600K BRAF-mutant melanoma. Baseline samples were analyzed via gene expression profiling and DNA sequencing, and mutant genotypes were correlated with clinical outcomes. The researchers also evaluated an independent cohort of 103 BRAF-mutant melanoma patients that were treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). Of these 103 patients, 84 BRAF-mutant melanoma, while 19 patients had immunotherapy based on BRAF genotype was correlated with clinical outcomes. In the targeted therapy cohort, compared with patients with V600E mutations, those with V600K mutations had less tumor regression and shorter progression-free survival, although these differences were not statistically significant. In the immunotherapy cohort, patients with V600K mutations had significantly higher progression-free survival compared with patients with V600E mutations (median of 19 and 2.7 months, respectively). While the response rate and overall survival was also higher in patients with V600K mutations compared with patients with V600E mutations, these increases were not statistically significant. \"These findings were likely limited by the small sample size of patients with V600K mutations and relatively short follow-up,\" Menzies explained. Analysis of baseline tumor samples in the targeted therapy cohort showed that patients harboring V600K BRAF mutations had a significantly higher mutational load compared with patients harboring V600E BRAF mutations. Patients harboring V600E mutations had significantly higher expression of ERK pathway genes and significantly lower expression of PI3K-AKT pathway genes compared with patients harboring V600K mutations. Because patients with V600K mutations had increased activation of the PI3K growth and survival pathway, these patients may derive benefit from treatment with PI3K inhibitors. \"Patients with V600E mutations have higher activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, suggesting that their cancers have greater dependence on this pathway for growth and survival,\" explained Menzies. \"This explains why patients with V600E mutations have a better response to BRAF/MEK inhibitors compared with patients with V600K mutations.\" The enhanced response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in V600K patients can be explained by the increased mutational burden compared with V600E patients, said Menzies, who concluded, \"We have shown that V600K BRAF-mutant melanoma patients derive greater benefit from immunotherapy and less from targeted therapy than those with V600E mutations. This suggests that V600K patients should be "}
