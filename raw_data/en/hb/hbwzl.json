It can resolve without treatment, or it may worsen and cause cirrhosis or liver cancer. A vaccine against the virus that causes hepatitis B has been available since the 1980s. For many people, [hepatitis B](/articles/306288) is a short-term condition and causes no permanent damage. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [2-6%](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm) [liver cancer](/articles/172408). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis B, and there has been a vaccine against HBV available in the United States since the [1980s](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/liver-disease/viral-hepatitis/hepatitis-b#complications) There are different vaccine series available depending on the age group. For example, infants under 1 year old can receive the vaccine in three or four doses, and those over 1 year can receive a two- or three-dose vaccine series. A person should speak with a doctor to help decide which vaccine series is suitable for them. This article will discuss the different hepatitis B vaccine schedules. It will also look at who should or should not get the vaccine. According to the [Hepatitis B Foundation](https://www.hepb.org/prevention-and-diagnosis/vaccination/guidelines-2/#US), an infant may receive the vaccine in three or four doses: - Three-dose vaccine series: Medical professionals recommend that all medically stable infants in the U.S. who have a birth weight of at least 2,000 grams receive the first dose of their hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. - Four-dose vaccine series: Combination vaccines, such as the vaccines that feature in this series, protect against various diseases. An infant often receives the first dose of the combination vaccine at 6 weeks of age. This means an infant is not protected against hepatitis B until they are 6 weeks old. Therefore, an infant should receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. The recommended HBV vaccine schedules for children under 1 year old are outlined in the |4-dose combination vaccine series||Vaxelis or Pediarix||at birth| (hepatitis B vaccine) |at 6 weeks old| (combination vaccine) |at 14 weeks old| (combination vaccine) |at 6 months old| (combination vaccine) The three-dose series is suitable for children and adults. The two-dose series is suitable for adults who are over 18 years old. The recommended HBV vaccine schedule for people [over 1 year old](https://www.hepb.org/prevention-and-diagnosis/vaccination/guidelines-2/) is after the first dose| |2-dose vaccine series||Hepislav-B||day 1||1 month after the first dose| In certain circumstances, a person may receive a vaccine series over a shorter period than that of the standard schedule. A person may have an accelerated vaccine series if they are traveling to an area that puts them at high risk of exposure or are an emergency responder in a disaster area. For adults and children This vaccine schedule involves three doses within 2 months, followed by a booster dose at 1 year. The initial accelerated doses provide immediate protection from HBV, and the booster dose helps provide long-term protection. Below is the accelerated vaccination schedule approved for [both the first dose||1 year after the first dose| For adults only The four-dose combination vaccine schedule uses a combination vaccine that protects against hepatitis A and B. This vaccine series includes three doses that a person receives within 1 month. A person then receives a booster dose after 1 year. This schedule is a common choice for people traveling on short notice outside the U.S. The two-dose vaccine schedule includes two doses that a person receives 1 month apart. Below are the two accelerated vaccination schedules for adults [over the age year the first dose| |2-dose vaccine series||Hepislav-B||day 1||1 month later| A note about sex and gender Sex and gender exist on spectrums.

It is important that infants who are born to females with hepatitis B receive accurate doses of the hepatitis B vaccine. They may also be required to receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) if it is available. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b) The table below outlines the [two recommended](https://www.hepb.org/prevention-and-diagnosis/vaccination/guidelines-2/) hepatitis B vaccine schedules for infants born to those who have first dose| |4-dose combination or Pediarix||at birth| (hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG) |at 6 weeks of age| (combination vaccine) |at 14 weeks of age| (combination vaccine) |at 24 weeks of age| (combination vaccine) Many nations use a combination vaccine that protects against several diseases, including hepatitis B.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html) - people with chronic liver disease - people with [HIV](/articles/17131) - sexually active people who are not in mutually monogamous relationships - people in a sexual relationship with someone who has hepatitis B - people who inject drugs - people who are at an increased risk due to exposure in their job - people who travel to countries with high levels of hepatitis B The hepatitis B vaccine is safe for most people. There are some common minor side effects a person may experience after receiving the vaccine. These include: A person should speak to a medical professional before getting the vaccine [if they](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hepatitis-b-vaccine.html) - have had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or any component of a hepatitis B vaccine - have had an allergic reaction to yeast - have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (Twinrix) If a person has a minor illness, such as a cold, they can still receive the vaccine. If someone is moderately or severely ill, they should wait until they recover before getting the hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver. It spreads via the transfer of bodily fluids from a person with an HBV infection to someone without the infection. There are a number of vaccines available for hepatitis B. A person receives the hepatitis B vaccine through a series of shots. There are two-, three-, and four-dose vaccine schedules that make use of these vaccines. A person may also get a combination vaccine that protects against hepatitis B and various other diseases. "}
