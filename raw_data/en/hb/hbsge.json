Now what? To start, you probably have lots of questions. Some of the most commonly asked ones are: What is ulcerative colitis? How did I get it? Will I be able to work, travel, or exercise? Should I be on a special diet? What are my treatment options? Will I need surgery? How will ulcerative colitis change my life, both now and in the future? Can ulcerative colitis be cured, and what is the outlook (prognosis)? The purpose of this brochure is to answer those questions and to walk you through some key points about ulcerative colitis and what you may experience in the future. You won't become an expert overnight, but you'll learn more and more as time goes by. The more informed you are, the better you can manage your disease and become an active member of your own healthcare team.

They can often be controlled with treatment. In the case of ulcerative colitis, medications are available that can control disease symptoms. While the medications do not actually cure the disease, many people can go for long periods of time without symptoms (called remission). Use of medications also can lower the chances of developing complications later on. Even during times of remission, it is important to continue taking medications and seeing your doctor regularly. Studies show that people with UC usually have the same life expectancy as people without UC. It is important to remember that most people who have ulcerative colitis lead full, happy, and productive lives. A brief introduction to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract Most of us aren't very familiar with the GI tract, but it's time you get acquainted. Here's a quick overview: The GI tract (see fig - ure 1) starts at the mouth. It follows a twisting and turning course and ends, many feet later, at the rectum. In between are a number of organs that all play a part in processing and transporting food through the body. First is the oral cavity (mouth), followed by the esophagus, a narrow tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Food passes through the stomach and enters the small intestine. This is the section where most of our nutrients are absorbed. The small intestine leads to the colon, or large intestine, which connects to the rectum. What is ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis (UC) belongs to a group of conditions known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition of the large intestine (colon and rec - tum) that can occur at any age. The symptoms can include abdominal pain, bowel urgency, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. The inflamma-tion begins in the rectum and extends up the colon in a continuous manner. How is ulcerative colitis different from Crohn's disease? When reading about IBD, you need to know that ulcerative colitis is not the same thing as Crohn's disease, another type of IBD. The illnesses have similar symptoms, but the areas affected in your body are different. Crohn's dis- ease may affect any part of the gastrointesti- nal (GI) tract, but ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon and rectum. Crohn's disease can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while ulcerative colitis only involves the inner - most lining of the colon (mucosa/submucosa). Finally, in Crohn's disease, the inflammation of the intestine can \"skip\" \u2014leaving normal areas in between patches of diseased intestine. In ulcerative colitis, this does not occur. In only 10 percent of cases are there overlapping features of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a condition called indeterminate colitis. Will it ever go away? No one knows exactly what causes ulcer - ative colitis. Also, no one can predict how the disease\u2014once it is diagnosed\u2014will affect a particular person. Some people go for years without having any symptoms, while others have more frequent flare-ups. However, one thing is certain: ulcerative colitis is a chronic, incurable condition.4 5 Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are more commonly found in developed coun - tries, urban areas, and northern climates. However, some of these disease patterns are gradually shifting. For example, the number of cases of UC is increasing in developing parts of the world, including China, India, and South America. 6 The genetic connection Researchers have discovered that ulcerative colitis tends to run in families. In fact, the risk for developing IBD is between 1.5 percent and 28 percent for first-degree relatives of an affected person. 7 While genetic background plays a clear role, environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, lifestyle, pollutants, and oth-ers, may impact onset, progression, and relapse of the disease. As such, while family history has a strong association with increased risk of IBD, it is currently not possible to confidently pre-dict which, if any, family members will develop ulcerative colitis. 8,9 Family members of people diagnosed with ulcerative colitis do not need to automatically be tested. If they develop symptoms, they should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist. Several conditions have symptoms that are similar to IBD, so it is important to get an accurate diagnosis. What causes ulcerative colitis? No one knows the exact cause(s) of the disease Nothing that you did made you get ulcerative colitis. You didn't catch it from anyone. It wasn't something that you ate or drank that brought the symptoms on. So, above all, don't blame yourself!The principal function of the colon is to absorb excess water and salts from the waste material (what's left after food has been digested). It also stores solid waste, converting it to stool, and excretes it through the anus. Who gets ulcerative colitis? Here are some quick facts and figures: Over the last 50 years, the number of people diagnosed with UC has been increasing.1,2 According to CDC, the incidence of UC (the number of new cases per year) ranges from 2.2 to 14.3 cases per 100,000 people. 3,4 On average, people are diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in their mid-30s, although the disease can occur at any age. 5 Men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in their 50s and 60s. 5 Ulcerative colitis is more common among Caucasians, but it can affect people of any racial or ethnic group. 6 THE GASTRO-INTESTINAL (GI) TRACT Oral Cavity (mouth) Esophagus (throat)LiverStomachLarge Intestine/ColonSmall IntestineRectumAnus1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 11 2 34 5 6 7 86 7 Most people with ulcerative colitis experience urgent bowel movements as well as crampy abdominal pain. The pain may be stronger on the left side, but it can occur anywhere in the abdomen. Together, these may result in loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss. These symptoms, along with anemia, can lead to fatigue. Children with ulcerative colitis may fail to develop or grow properly. Beyond the intestine In addition to having symptoms in the GI tract, some people also may experience a variety of symptoms in other parts of the body associat - ed with ulcerative colitis known as extraintes-tinal manifestations. Signs and symptoms of the disease may be evident in the: eyes (redness, pain, and/or changes in vision) mouth (sores) joints (swelling and pain) skin (tender bumps, painful ulcerations, and other sores/rashes) liver (primary sclerosing cholangitis and cirrhosis)\u2014a rare development In some people, extraintestinal manifestations actually may be the first signs of ulcerative colitis, appearing even years before the bow - el symptoms. In others, they may occur right before a flare-up of the disease. The range of symptoms Approximately half of all patients with ulcerative colitis have relatively mild symptoms. However, others may suffer from severe abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and fever. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis tend to come and go.What are some of the likely causes? Most ex - perts think there is a multifactorial explanation. This means that it takes a number of factors working in combination to bring about ulcer - ative colitis. More than 200 genes have now been associat - ed with IBD, though their exact role is still under investigation. It's likely that a person inherits one or more genes that make him or her more susceptible to ulcerative colitis. These genes then lead to an abnormal immune response to some environmental triggers. Scientists have not yet unequivocally identified specific trig - gers, but the bacteria in the intestine, part of our microbiome, are a leading candidate. Other environmental factors likely play a role as well. In a genetical ly s usceptible individual, whatever the trigger is, it prompts the person's immune system to \"turn on\" and launch an attack in the GI system. That is when the inflammation begins. Unfor tuna tely, the immune system doesn't \"turn off,\" so the inflammation contin-ues, damaging the digestive organs and causing the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. What are the signs and symptoms? As the intestinal lining becomes more inflamed and ulcerated (small and large sores), it loses its ability to absorb water from the waste material that passes through the colon. That, in turn, leads to a progressive loosening of the stool\u2014in other words, diarrhea. The damaged intestinal lining may begin producing a lot of mucus in the stool. Moreover, ulceration in the lining can also result in bleeding, causing the stool to become bloody in substance. Eventually, that blood loss may lead to a low red blood cell count, called anemia.8 9 Since a number of other conditions can pro- duce the same symptoms as UC, your doctor relies on various medical tests to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as infection. Tests may include: Stool tests: Used to exclude infection or to detect inflammation (fecal calprotectin). Blood tests: May detect the presence of inflammation, abnormal antibodies, anemia, or nutritional/vitamin deficiencies. Sigmoidoscopy: Examines the rectum and lower third of the colon. Colonoscopy: Examines the entire colon and end of the small intestine. For further information about diagnosing ulcerative colitis, please read our Diagnosing and Monitoring IBD brochure available at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Some questions to ask your doctor It is important to establish good communica- tions with your doctor. Patients will need to establish a collaborative relationship with all their healthcare providers, especially their gastroenterologist, to achieve the best long-term results. It is common to forget to ask some critical questions. Here is a list of questions that may be helpful for your next office visit: Could any condition other than my UC be causing my symptoms? What tests do I need to have to get to the root of my symptoms?In between flares, people may experience no distress at all. These periods of remission can span months or even years, although symp-toms typically do return eventually. The unpre-dictable course of ulcerative colitis may make it difficult for doctors to evaluate whether a particular treatment program has been effec - tive or whether remission occurred on its own. Types of ulcerative colitis and their associated symptoms The symptoms of ulcerative colitis will vary de- pending on the extent of inflammation and the location of the disease within the large intes-tine. Accordingly, it is very important for you to know which part of your intestine is affected. Listed below are some of the most common types of ulcerative colitis: Ulcerative proctitis: Bowel inflammation is limited to the rectum (usually less than six inches of the rectum) and is not associated with an increased risk of cancer. Symptoms in-clude rectal bleeding, urgency, and rectal pain. Left-sided colitis: Continuous inflammation that begins at the rectum and extends as far as the splenic flexure (a bend in the colon near the spleen in the upper left abdomen). Proctosigmoiditis is a form of left-sided coli-tis as well. Symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, and pain on the left side of the abdomen. Extensive Colitis: Affects the entire colon\u2014 continuous inflammation that begins at the rectum and extends beyond the splenic flex - ure. Symptoms include loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Making the diagnosis The path toward diagnosis begins by taking a complete patient and family medical history, including full details regarding symptoms. A physical examination is also performed. 10 11 Treatment The two basic goals of treatment are to achieve remission and, once that is accomplished, to maintain remission. If remission cannot be established, then the next goal is to decrease the severity of disease in order to improve the patient's quality of life. Treatments for ulcerative colitis work by decreasing the abnormal inflammation in the lining of the colon. This permits the colon and rectum to heal. It also relieves the symptoms of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. However, there is no one-size-fits-all treat - ment for everyone with ulcerative colitis. The approach must be tailored to the individual because each person's disease is different. It is important to note that even if a patient is in remission, ulcerative colitis may flare up at times from the reappearance of inflammation. Flares may indicate that a change in medication dose, frequency, or type is needed. Medications Some medications for the treatment of ulcer - ative colitis have been available for many years. Others are recent breakthroughs. Medications are given in different dosages and formulations and for different lengths of time. Some medications are taken as pills that are swallowed, while others are administered intra-venously (through a vein) or injected under the skin. Topical therapies (applied to body surfac - es) are given rectally, as suppositories, enemas, creams, foams, and ointments. Taking your ulcerative colitis medication(s) as prescribed reduces the risk of a flare-up. Should I have these tests during the time of a flare-up or on a routine basis? How will I know if my medication needs to be adjusted? Approximately how long should it take to see some results, or to find out that this may not be the right medication for me? What are the potential side effects of the medication? What should I do if I notice them? What should I do if my symptoms return? What symptoms are considered an emergency? If I cannot schedule a visit right away, are there any over-the-counter medications that can assist with my prescribed medication? If so, which ones? Should I change my diet or take nutritional supplements? If so, can you recommend a di-etitian or any specific nutritional supplements? Do I need to make any other lifestyle changes? When should I come back for a follow-up appointment? What are my options if I can't afford my medications? 12 13 Biologic therapies: These are protein-based therapies made from living organisms, either human or animal. These medications are anti - bodies that stop certain proteins in the body from causing inflammation. They are currently offered in an injectable form, or through intra-venous infusion (through veins). There are also biologic medications knowns as biosimilars. Biosimilars are designed to be similar, near- identical copies of another, already approved biologic therapy, known as an originator drug or reference product. They have the same safety and effectiveness and are taken in the same way as the originator drugs. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK Inhibitors): These medications, currently available as tab-lets, are broken down in the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion and are directly absorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal wall. Due to the small size of these chemically active substances, they can be transported to nearly any site in the body through the blood-stream, including the immune system. Unlike some of the other tablet-based agents, these agents work more quickly and can induce and maintain remission. They are currently approved to treat ulcerative colitis. Future Therapies: Recent advances have contributed to breakthroughs in the develop-ment of newer medical options for the treat - ment of IBD. Further developments may lead to expanding how currently approved medi-cations are used in other diseases, including ulcerative colitis.The most commonly prescribed medications fall into the following categories: Aminosalicylates: These include medications that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). These medications work by inhibiting certain pathways that produce substances that cause inflammation. They can work in the lining of the GI tract to decrease inflammation. Aminosalicylates work best in the colon and are often given orally in the form of delayed- release tablets, or rectally as enemas or suppositories. Corticosteroids: These medications affect the body's ability to launch and maintain an inflammatory process. In addition, they work to keep the immune system in check. Corti-costeroids are effective for short-term con-trol of disease activity; however, they are not recommended for long-term or maintenance use because of their potential side effects. If you cannot come off steroids without a re-lapse of symptoms, your doctor may need to add some other medications to help manage your disease. Because of their effect on the adrenal glands, steroids cannot be stopped abruptly. Immunomodulators: This class of medica-tions controls or suppresses the body's im-mune response, therefore decreasing inflam-matory activity. Immunomodulators generally are used in people for whom aminosalicylates and corticosteroids haven't been effective or have only been partially effective. Some immunomodulators are added to treatment regimens to make other medications, such as biologics, work better by preventing the for - mation of antibodies to biologic medications. They may be useful in reducing or eliminating the need for corticosteroids. They may also be effective in maintaining remission in peo- ple who haven't responded to other medica-tions and may take several weeks or months to begin to working. 14 15 There are many therapies currently under investigation. For a current, up-to-date list of all FDA-approved medications for ulcerative colitis, please visit the Foundation's online Medication guide at www.ibdmedicationguide.org. Additional information is available in our Understanding IBD Medications and Side Effects brochure at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/ brochures. Managing your symptoms The best way to control ulcerative colitis is by taking medications as prescribed by your doc - tor or other healthcare professional. However, medications may not immediately get rid of all the symptoms that you are experiencing. You may continue to have occasional diarrhea, cramping, nausea, and fever. Even when there are no symptoms or just min- imal ones, it may still seem like a nuisance to be on a steady regimen of medication. Remember, though, that taking maintenance medication can significantly reduce the risk of flares in ulcerative colitis. In between flares, more people feel quite well and are free of symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which over-the- counter (OTC) medications you can take. OTC products that may help include loperamide (Imodium \u00ae) to control diarrhea, anti-gas prod- ucts, and digestive aids. Most anti-gas products and digestive aids may also be safe to use, but you should ask your doctor about these first. To reduce fever or ease joint pain, speak with your doctor about taking acetaminophen (Ty - lenol \u00ae) rather than diges- tive system. Many OTC medications may have some adverse effects on the ulcerative colitis itself or interact with some of the medications prescribed to treat your ulcerative colitis. The safest way to handle OTC medications is to follow the guidelines and instructions of your doctor and pharmacist. For further information on managing symp- toms, please read our Managing Flares and Other IBD Symptoms brochure available at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Other considerations Surgery Many individuals with ulcerative colitis respond well to medical treatment and may never need to undergo surgery. However, after 30 years of disease, up to a third of people with ulcerative colitis may require surgery at some point. Sometimes, surgery is indicated to take care of various complications. These include severe bleeding from deep ulcerations, perforation (rupture) of the bowel, and toxic megacolon. Surgery may also be considered to remove the entire colon and rectum (a proctocolectomy) when medical therapies no longer control the disease well or when precancerous changes are found in the colon. Because ulcerative colitis is a disease that af - fects the immune system, extraintestinal symp - toms that occurred prior to surgery\u2014such as joint pain or skin conditions\u2014may recur even after the colon is removed. Depending on a number of factors, including the extent of disease and the person's age and overall health, one of two surgical approaches may be recommended. The first involves an ileostomy, an opening on the abdomen through which waste is emptied into a pouch attached to the abdomen. The second is an internal pouch, called an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 16 17 Diet and nutrition Once the disease has developed, paying attention to your diet may help you reduce symptoms, replace lost nutrients, and promote healing. There is no one single diet or eating plan that will work for everyone with ulcerative colitis. Dietary recommendations must be tai-lored just for you\u2014ulcerative colitis varies from person to person and even changes within the same person over time. There may be times when modifying your diet can be helpful, particularly during a flare. Some diets may be recommended at different times by your physician, including: Low-salt diet\u2014Used during corticosteroid therapy to reduce water retention. Low-fiber diet\u2014Used to avoid stimulating bowel movements in ulcerative colitis. Lactose-free diet\u2014For those who have an intolerance to dairy products. High-calorie diet\u2014For those who experience weight loss or growth delay. Other diets \u2014There are many other diet plans that have been tried or suggested for management of IBD. These include glu-ten-free diet, low FODMAP diet, Specific Carbohydrate Diet , and the Mediterranean diet. While an individual may benefit from (IPAA), or j-pouch, which is created by attaching the small intestine to the rectal cuff, eliminating the need for an external pouch. For further information on surgery and ulcerative colitis, please read our Surgery for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis brochure at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Possible complications Complications are by no means inevitable or even frequent\u2014especially in appropriately treated patients. But they are common enough, and cover such a wide range, that it is import - ant to be acquainted with them. Early recognition of complications often means more effective treatment. Complications can include profuse intestinal bleeding (including clots of blood in the stool), and toxic mega-colon (a rare development where the colon becomes dangerously dilated and surgical removal is required). Infection is also a concern. There is a rise of Clostridium difficile (C.diff) infection, particular - ly in hospitalized patients. The symptoms of this bacterial infection, including diarrhea and colon inflammation, mimic those of IBD flares. Peo-ple with ulcerative colitis are at greater risk for the infection than those with Crohn's disease, and all IBD patients treated with immunosup-pressive drugs or antibiotics are at increased risk. Early testing and rapid start of appropriate medical therapy can improve individual out - comes and avoid the risk of complications. Occasionally, people with ulcerative colitis may develop colorectal cancer, but this occurs in a very small number of people afflicted with IBD. For further information on complications, please read our Managing Flares and Other IBD Symptoms brochure available at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. 18 19 correct these deficiencies through vitamin and nutritional supplements. That doesn't mean that you must eat certain foods or avoid others. Most doctors recommend a well-balanced diet to prevent nutritional defi - ciency. A healthy diet should contain a variety of foods from all food groups. Meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products (if tolerated) are sources of protein; bread, cereal, starches, fruits, and vegetables (if tolerated) are sources of carbo-hydrates; and margarine and oils are sources of fat. A dietary supplement, like a multivitamin, can help fill the gaps. For more information, you may want to talk with a dietitian and read our Diet, Nutrition and Inflammatory Bowel Disease brochure at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Complementary and alternative therapies Some people living with ulcerative colitis look to complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) to use together with conventional therapies to help ease their symptoms. CAM therapies may work in a variety of ways. They may help to control symptoms and ease pain, enhance feelings of well-being and quality of life, and possibly boost the immune system. For more information about complementary and alternative therapies, view our Comple - mentary and Alternative Medicine fact sheet at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. General health maintenance It is important for ulcerative colitis patients to continue general health maintenance. While working with your gastroenterologist, also remember to speak with your primary health provider about other important issues, in- cluding vaccinations, oral health, vision, heart, breast and prostrate screening, and periodic blood testing. such diets, there is no strong evidence to support recommending these for broad use at this time. Although no specific foods worsen the under - lying inflammation of ulcerative colitis, certain ones may tend to aggravate the symptoms. Keeping a food diary can be a big help. It allows you to see the connection between what you eat and the symptoms that may follow. If certain foods are causing digestive problems, then try to avoid them. Here are some additional helpful tips: Reduce the amount of greasy or fried foods in your diet, which may cause diarrhea and gas. Eat smaller meals at more frequent intervals. If you are lactose intolerant, limit the amount of dairy products in your diet. Avoid carbonated beverages if excessive gas is a problem. Restrict caffeine when severe diarrhea occurs, as caffeine can act as a laxative. Bland, soft foods may be easier to tolerate than spicy foods. Restricting your intake of certain high-fiber foods, such as nuts, seeds, and raw vegetables may decrease your symptoms. Maintaining proper nutrition is important in the management of ulcerative colitis. Abdom-inal pain and fever can cause loss of appetite and weight loss. Diarrhea can rob the body of fluids, minerals, and electrolytes. These are nu-trients in the body that must remain in proper balance for the body to function properly. Some patients with IBD may become deficient in certain vitamins and minerals (including vi- tamin B-12, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin D, iron, calcium, zinc, and magnesium) or have trouble ingesting enough food to meet their caloric needs. Your healthcare provider can identify and 20 21 Support As time goes on, this fact will not always occupy the top spot in your mind. In the meantime, don't hide your condition from family, friends, and coworkers. Discuss it with them in order to help them understand what support you need. You'll learn that there are numerous strategies that can make living with ulcerative colitis easier. Coping techniques for dealing with the disease may take many forms. For example, attacks of diarrhea or abdominal pain may make people fearful of being in public places. But that isn't necessary. All it takes is some practical advanced planning. You may want to incorporate some of the following steps into your plans: Find out where the restrooms are in restau-rants, shopping areas, theaters, and on public transportation. Smart phone apps are avail-able to help with locating restrooms. Carry extra underclothing, toilet paper, or moist wipes when traveling, as needed. Before venturing further away or for longer periods of time, speak with your doctor. Travel plans should include a long-term supply of your medication, its generic or non-brand name in case you run out or lose it, and the names of doctors in the area you will be visiting. Try to go about your daily life as normally as possible, pursuing activities as you did before your diagnosis. There's no reason for you to sit out on things that you have always enjoyed or have dreamed of doing one day. Learn coping strategies from others. Your local Crohn's & Colitis Foundation chapter offers support groups.For detailed information about general health-care maintenance in ulcerative colitis, view our General Healthcare Maintenance fact sheet at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Stress, emotional factors, and support If you have ulcerative colitis, you're bound to have questions about the relationship between stress and emotional factors and this disease. Although flares are sometimes associated with stressful events, there is no evidence that stress causes ulcerative colitis. It is much more likely that the emotional distress that people sometimes feel is a reaction to the symptoms of the disease itself. As depression can be associated with chronic illness, a doctor may recommend medication and/or a referral to a mental health profes-sional. Although formal psychotherapy usu-ally isn't necessary, some people are helped considerably by speaking with a therapist who is knowledgeable about IBD or about chronic illness in general. 22 23 Foundation's continuing research efforts, much more will be learned, and eventually cures will be found. With the ever-increasing number of clinical trials of potential new IBD therapies, there is an even greater need for patient participation to see if these experimental therapies work.

There's no doubt that living with this disease is challenging\u2014you have to take medication and, occasionally, make other adjustments. It's important to remember that most people with ulcerative colitis are able to lead rich and productive lives. Hope for the future With many new treatments for IBD in clinical trials, experts predict that a wave of new ther - apies is on the way. It is becoming increasingly clear that a person's immune response to in-testinal bacteria plays an important role in IBD. A great deal of research is currently directed at understanding the composition, behavior, and precise role of the microbiome in the symp-toms of IBD. Hopefully, this new knowledge will uncover new treatments to control or prevent the disease. Crohn's & Colitis Foundation-sponsored research has led to huge strides in the fields of immunology (the study of the body's immune defense system), microbiology (the study of microscopic organisms with the power to cause disease), and genetics.
