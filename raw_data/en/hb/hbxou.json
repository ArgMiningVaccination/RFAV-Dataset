INTRODUCTION The National Policy for Comprehensive Care of Child Health (PNAISC-in Portuguese) covers the care of child from a comprehensive perspective and brings actions of promotion, prevention, and assistance in case of diseases in seven strategic axes. These actions occur transversally in the various levels of care11 Souza RR de, Vieira MG, Lima J\u00fanior CJF, Souza RR de, Vieira MG, Lima J\u00fanior CJF. The integral child health care network in the Federal District - Brazil. Ci\u00eanc Amp Sa\u00fade Coletiva.

The third strategic axis of this policy, called Promotion and monitoring of growth and full development, consists of surveillance and encouragement of full growth and development of the child, especially \"Early Childhood Development (\"ECD\")\", by Primary Health Care. The axis follows the guidelines of the Child Health Handbook, including actions to support families to strengthen family ties22 Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade (BR). Portal de Boas Crian\u00e7a this context, the follow-up of the child's growth and development must include vaccination actions from the perspective of preventing immunopreventable diseases for comprehensive care. Primary care health teams must monitor the vaccination coverage of children in their area, control and actively search for those with delayed vaccination, since delayed vaccination may indicate difficulties in access or other cases of vulnerability faced by families33 Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade (BR). per\u00edodo [https://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicaco... ](https://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicacoes/manual_procedimentos_vacinacao.pdf). The organization of public policies on vaccination in Brazil began with the creation of the National Immunization Program (PNI, in Portuguese) in 1973 by the Ministry of Health (MH) and was instituted in 1975 by Law 6,259. It aims to coordinate the immunization actions routinely administered in health services, to achieve vaccination coverage, and to eradicate or control several immunopreventable diseases, and represented a significant advance for public health, especially for children's health44 Minist\u00e9rio da ](https://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicacoes/manual_procedimentos_vacinacao.pdf). Despite the impact of the PNI on the reduction of immunopreventable diseases in recent decades, anti-vaccine movements can have a direct impact on child growth and development. This phenomenon occurs especially when parents and family members of children refuse to be vaccinated. A meeting held in 2011 by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, of the World Health Organization (WHO), demonstrated the growing impact of resistance to vaccination uptake present in developed and developing countries. Given the growing concern about vaccination coverage, the term vaccine hesitancy has gained prominence in this issue55 World Health Organization. Report of the SAGE Working on Vaccine Hesitancy. [Internet]. 2014 [cited in 2020 Juny 13]. Available in: https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/october/SAGE_working_group_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf?ua=1oup_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf?ua=1.

SAGE then defined vaccine hesitancy as a delay in vaccine acceptance or refusal, even with availability in health systems66 Bedford H, Attwell K, Danchin M, Marshall H, Corben P, Leask J. Vaccine hesitancy, refusal and access barriers: The need for clarity in terminology. Vaccine. [Internet]. 2018 [cited in 2020 Ago. 12]; 36(44):6556-8.

Given this continuous growth in vaccine hesitancy, 7,718 cases of measles were confirmed in Brazil in 2020. Of this total, the incidence by age group in vaccination strategies was 34.66 per 100,000 inhabitants, in children under 5 years old77 Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade epidemiol\u00f3gicas a 32.

The growing vaccine hesitancy throughout the world has become a major public health problem coupled with the pandemic of the new coronavirus in 2020, which had its emergence, in China, in December 2019 through the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2\", or SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the regime of social distancing was adopted, and, in this context, the face-to-face attendance at health care units decreased dramatically in several countries, including for childhood vaccination88 Abbas K, Procter SR, Zandvoort K, Clark A, Funk S, Mengistu S, et al. Routine childhood immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: a benefit-risk analysis of health benefits versus excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lancet Glob Health. [Internet]. 2020 Parents' concern about their children's exposure to the virus when taking them to health care units for vaccination contributed to the decrease in vaccination coverage99 Bramer CA, Kimmins LM, Swanson R, Kuo J, Vranesich P, Jacques-Carrol LA, et al. Decline in child vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 Pandemic - Michigan Care Improvement Registry, May 2016-May 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. in: https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6920e1. [https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6920e1... ](https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6920e1). From the perspective of monitoring the growth and development of the child with vaccination actions, the increase in vaccine hesitancy can decrease childhood vaccination coverage. Therefore, although vaccination is considered a safe and essential procedure for the control of immunopreventable diseases, it is complex when analyzed from the perspective of parents and family members of children. Thus, the challenge of facing the hesitant groups persists. Considering these considerations, the study aimed to analyze in scientific productions the reasons that lead parents and family members of children to vaccination hesitation in the context of control of immunopreventable diseases. METHOD We chose an Integrative Review (IR), which is one of the methods used defines methodologies and processes for identifying evidence that a given treatment is effective, provides strategies for evaluating the quality of studies and mechanisms for implementation in care1111 Santos CM da C, Pimenta CA de M, Nobre MRC. The PICO strategy for the research question construction and evidence search. Rev Lat Am Enfermagem. [Internet]. 2007 [cited https://doi.org/10.1590/S0104-11692007000300023.

In the first step, the development of the research question and the database search were performed thanks to the PICO strategy, defined as an acronym for Patient/Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes. EBP considers these four elements essential in the research question and in the design of the question for the literature search for evidence1111 Santos CM da C, Pimenta CA de M, Nobre MRC. The PICO strategy for the research question construction and evidence search. Rev Lat Am Enfermagem. [Internet]. 2007 [cited [https://doi.org/10.1590/S0104-1169200700... ](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0104-11692007000300023). In this research, \"C\" does not apply because no comparison between interventions will be performed. The search and selection of articles was performed in June and July 2020, based on the following information resources: SciELO (Scientific Eletronic Library Online), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences), BDENF (Nursing Database), IBECS (\u00cdndice Bibliogr\u00e1fico Espa\u00f1ol en Ciencias de la Salud), MEDLINE Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and CINAHL (Cummulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). The Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) in SciELO, LILACS, BDENF and IBECS were used. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) from MEDLINE and the CINAHL Titles from the CINAHL database were used to determine search terms. The search terms used, combined with the Boolean operators OR and AND, were elucidated in the search strategy ( [Chart 1]()). A second search was conducted in February 2021, using the same information resources and descriptors. Search strategy in the databases. Niter\u00f3i, RJ, Brazil, 2021 The following research question was devised. What are the reasons that lead parents and family members of children to vaccine hesitancy? In the second stage, the inclusion criteria were defined: articles available in full text in English, Portuguese, and Spanish that addressed the topic of vaccine hesitancy among parents and family members of children, who were the research participants. A time frame from 2016 to 2021 was used, due to WHO's concern, as of 2016, with groups that refuse vaccination and its influence on the population and vaccination coverage rates1212 Mizuta AH, Succi G de M, Montalli VAM, Succi RC de M. Perceptions on the importance of vaccination and vaccine refusal in a medical school. Rev. paul. pediatr. [Internet]. 2019 [cited [https://doi.org/10.1590/1984-0462/;2019;... And, as exclusion criteria: editorials, opinions and/or comments, dissertations, theses, articles in duplicate in the information resources, and articles that had health professionals as research participants. For the selection of articles, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) document, created to improve the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical Fed Sul. In this review, the PRISMA checklist was followed to increase the reliability of the research ( [Figure 1]()). Thus, after reading the titles and abstracts and applying the exclusion criteria, we went to the second moment, in which the articles were read in their entirety and then excluded those that did not answer the research question, totaling a corpus of analysis of 24 publications. Flowchart of the process of identification, selection and inclusion of studies based on the PRISMA recommendation. Niter\u00f3i, RJ, Brazil, 2021 For the development of the analysis, an instrument was prepared to characterize the studies, where each one received a numbering (1 to 24) containing the following items: author/title, design and level of evidence and country/journal/year ( [Chart 2]()). The level of evidence of the studies was classified according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): level 1 - systematic review or meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials; level 2 - well-designed randomized controlled trial; level 3 - nonrandomized controlled trial; level 4 - well-designed cohort or case-control studies; level 5 - systematic review of qualitative and descriptive studies; level 6 - descriptive or qualitative studies and level 7 - opinion of authorities or experts1414 Galv\u00e3o CM. N\u00edveis de evid\u00eancia. https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-21002006000200001. [https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-2100200600... ](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-21002006000200001). After successive readings in full of the 24 selected articles by two reviewers, a third reviewer was consulted in case of doubts. The data were analyzed and interpreted to align the findings according to their similarities and differences. Then, a synthesis of the published knowledge was prepared, resulting in the presentation of the evidence found. RESULTS The final sample comprised 24 articles ( [Chart 2]()), with 95.8% originating from international journals and 4.2% from national journals. The countries of origin were: United States (16.6%), Spain (12.5%), Canada (8.3%), (4.2%), Malaysia (4.2%), Pakistan (4.2%) and Portugal (4.2%). Regarding the country of origin, only one (4.2%) article published in Brazil was found. Regarding the year of publication, 41.6% were published in 2018. As for the design, most, 17 (70.8%), were cross-sectional studies, four (16.7%) were qualitative studies, one (4.2%) was a quantitative cohort study, one (4.2%) was an integrative review, and one (4.2%) was a case-control study. It was observed that most publications presented level of evidence 4 (79.1%), followed by level 6 (16.6%), and level 5 (4.2%). Description of the studies included in the integrative review, according to author/ title, design and level of evidence and country/journal/year. Niter\u00f3i, RJ, Brazil, 2021 The reasons for vaccine hesitancy by parents and family members of children were grouped into two categories: Un (knowledge) about vaccines and In (decision) and lifestyle. Un (knowledge) about vaccines This category demonstrated the reasons why parents and family members of children were hesitant to vaccinate their children. The reasons were lack of knowledge about vaccines, actions motivated by fake news, fear of adverse events and side effects, and underestimation of the lethality of immunopreventable N, Ullahc N, Kibriab Z, et al.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10.024) related hesitation to a low level of education and single marital status. The research of article 51919 Hu Y, Chen Y, Wang Y, Liang H. Measuring childhood vaccination acceptance of mother in Zhejiang province, East China. Hum Vaccin. Immunother. [Internet]. 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2018.15... ](https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2018.1526557) showed that 15.2% of mothers found it difficult to vaccinate their children due to incompatibility with their work schedule. DISCUSSION The reading of the corpus of articles and the analysis of their results and discussions showed that each vaccine refusal or delay in acceptance of vaccination should be seen as an opportunity to clarify doubts and concerns with parents and family members of children. This is the most opportune moment for this type of intervention, in which to take advantage of the contact with this hesitant family member. The results of this review indicated that the lack of knowledge of children's parents and family members about vaccines can lead to their hesitation. In this sense, doubts about the need for vaccines, fear of adverse events, and the spread of false information create a scenario in which families, and even health professionals, are unclear about the importance of vaccine application3939 Succi RC de M, Succi RC de M. Vaccine refusal - what we need to know. J Pediatr (Rio J). [Internet]. 2018 [cited Available in: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2018.01.008. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2018.01.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2018.01.008). The professional role in sharing information is paramount since the results of this review indicated that many parents and family members still have low knowledge about vaccines. This same condition was identified in a Brazilian study conducted with mothers in Par\u00e1, in 2018, which pointed out that the lack of knowledge of guardians about the benefits of vaccination and its importance for the prevention of immunopreventable diseases contributes to incomplete vaccination schedule, indicating that educational actions in health about vaccination have the potential to increase adherence and knowledge for disease prevention4040 Igreja P, Moia M, Reis D, Ferreira A, al. das Available in: https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012. [https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012... ](https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012). Another reason for vaccine hesitancy found in this review was that because some immunopreventable diseases become less frequent, the attention of parents and family members is focused more on the possible adverse events of the vaccine than on the disease it prevents. The lack of memory of diseases such as polio, diphtheria, and Haemophilus Influenza meningitis, and of the severity and sequelae, makes one underestimate the real need for prevention4040 Igreja P, Moia M, Reis D, Ferreira A, al. das Available in: https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012. [https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012... ](https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv6n3-012). Moreover, the idea that the risk of a particular disease is low may be linked to several factors, among them, the priorities of life and health at that time4141 MacDonald NE, SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy: Definition, scope and determinants. Vaccine. [Internet]. 2015 in: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.036. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.036). Therefore, a study conducted with 15 couples classified the participants into three groups: vaccinators, selective vaccinators, and non-vaccinators. The last two groups thought that immunopreventable diseases had been eliminated in Brazil, and some reported that there was no need to vaccinate their children based on a layman's interpretation of the epidemiological risk and http://dx.doi.org/10.21902/revistajur.2316-753X.v2i59.4100. [http://dx.doi.org/10.21902/revistajur.23... ](http://dx.doi.org/10.21902/revistajur.2316-753X.v2i59.4100). From this perspective, the risks associated with vaccine use do not justify refusal or delay in vaccine uptake, as they are less than the risks of not vaccinating and are a growing concern in several countries. The lack of knowledge about adverse events noted as reasons for vaccine hesitancy in this review is not always linked to vaccine use. Adverse events after the individual receives the vaccine are rarely causally related to the use of the vaccine, and when present and scientifically proven, they occur at a very low frequency4343 Sato APS. What is the importance of vaccine hesitancy in the drop of vaccination coverage in Brazil? Rev Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica. [Internet]. [https://doi.org/10.11606/S1518-8787.2018... ](https://doi.org/10.11606/S1518-8787.2018052001199). The SAGE Group interrelates factors regarding vaccine hesitancy and modified perceptions of illness, which have become known as the \"3 Cs\" model: trust, compliance, and convenience. Trust is related to the efficacy and safety of vaccines, the health care system that offers them, and the desires of managers. Complacency results from the low perceived risk of contracting the disease, so that vaccination would not be considered necessary. And convenience analyzes physical availability, geographical accessibility, ability to understand, and access to health information4141 MacDonald NE, SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy: Definition, scope and determinants. Vaccine. [Internet]. 2015 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.036), corroborating one of the findings of this review, of which breaking the daily routine by reconciling work hours with those of the vaccination units is a relevant factor for vaccination delay. This review also showed that parents and family members of children are motivated by false news in the media, leading them to believe that vaccines can cause autism. Social media search engines, using hashtags and algorithms, direct people to the content that interests them. Consequently, opinions are reinforced and lies are unchallenged4444 Akbas Gunes N. Parents' Perspectives about vaccine hesitancies and vaccine rejection, in the west of Turkey. J Pediatr Nurs. [Internet]. 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2020.04.001. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2020.04.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2020.04.001). Thus, information or misinformation about vaccines communicated by social media influences parents' decision-making about vaccinating, or not vaccinating, their children. Data a study4545 Frisch M, Melbye M. Vaccination and Autism. Ann Intern Med. [Internet]. 2020 Sept. [https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101... ](https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101) identified that 14.3% of parents and family members believed that vaccines cause autism. Contrary to this finding, a study4646 Gilbert NL, Gilmour H, Wilson SE, Cantin L. Determinants of non-vaccination and incomplete vaccination in Canadian toddlers. Hum Immunother. [https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2016.12... ](https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2016.1277847) showed that there is no relationship between vaccination and the development of autism. This review evidenced that parents who have a lifestyle with the practice of natural and organic food, physical activity, and use of alternative medicine thought they did not need to vaccinate their children. Here we highlight the concept of Salutogenesis, introduced in the 1970s by Aaron Antonovsky, which is considered a new approach to health promotion and a resource that strengthens the capacity of individuals, communities, and populations to stay healthy. This methodology recognizes the talents, interests, abilities, and experiences of each individual4747 Mar\u00e7al CCB; Heidemann IT; integrative review. [https://doi.org/10.12957/reuerj.2018.379... ](https://doi.org/10.12957/reuerj.2018.37954). However, a lifestyle choice based on healthy habits is not opposed to the use of vaccines as a form of protection and safety because immunization is one of the mechanisms that has contributed most to reducing infant mortality and morbidity from immunopreventable diseases. Parents' and family members' choice of alternative medicine is one of the findings of this review and related this fact to their children's vaccine hesitancy. In this regard, one study4545 Hviid JV, Frisch M, Melbye M. Vaccination and Autism. Ann Intern Med. [Internet]. 2020 Sept. 21]; 170(8):513-20. Available in: https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101. [https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101... ](https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101) identified that more than half of the parents thought that alternative medicine was more efficient and were more likely to have delayed vaccination. This review, too, showed that it is common for parents and family members' religion to be linked to their children's vaccination refusal. In 48 of the 50 states in the United States, vaccine refusal due to religious reasons is allowed. Passages in religious texts are open to free interpretation for each religious in their traditions. Thus, some groups refuse all medical interventions, while others have specific beliefs about components of vaccines4747 Mar\u00e7al CCB; Heidemann IT; integrative review. [https://doi.org/10.12957/reuerj.2018.379... ](https://doi.org/10.12957/reuerj.2018.37954). Social factors of parents and family members emerged in this review, so that some of them, such as family income and education, influence their children's vaccine hesitancy. Recent research has shown that the higher the family income, the greater are the ideas of that family against vaccines4646 Gilbert NL, Gilmour H, Wilson SE, Cantin L. Determinants of non-vaccination and incomplete vaccination in Canadian toddlers. Hum Immunother. [https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2016.12... ](https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2016.1277847). On the other hand, a study that analyzed the nurses' perception of the parents' knowledge about vaccination highlighted that the level of education is a barrier to complete assimilation of the immunization goals4848 [http://revista.cofen.gov.br/index.php/en... ](http://revista.cofen.gov.br/index.php/enfermagem/article/view/4065/1135). It should be noted that the WHO has included vaccine hesitancy in the list of the ten greatest risks to global health, due to the threat of reversing the progress made in the fight against immunopreventable diseases4949 World Health Organization. Ten threats to global health in 2019. Geneva: World Health Organization. [Internet]. 2019 Available in: https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019. [https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/... ](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019). The discontinuation of vaccination during the pandemic of COVID-19 increased the number of susceptible individuals and the likelihood of outbreaks of immunopreventable diseases, and consequently, led to increased morbidity and mortality among children from these diseases5050 World Health Organization. At least 80 million children under one at risk of diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio as COVID-19 disrupts routine vaccination efforts, warn Gavi, WHO and UNICEF. Geneva: https://www.who.int/news/item/22-05-2020-at-least-80-million-children-under-one-at-risk-of-diseases-such-as-diphtheria-measles-and-polio-as-covid-19-disrupts-routine-vaccination-efforts-warn-gavi-who-and-unicef. [https://www.who.int/news/item/22-05-2020... ](https://www.who.int/news/item/22-05-2020-at-least-80-million-children-under-one-at-risk-of-diseases-such-as-diphtheria-measles-and-polio-as-covid-19-disrupts-routine-vaccination-efforts-warn-gavi-who-and-unicef). In this sense, the success that the Brazilian National Immunization Program has acquired over 47 years in reducing immunopreventable diseases does not allow for retrocession. One limitation of this study is that, even though it was analyzed by three reviewers, it is subject to bias as in any research. Bias includes any and all distortions throughout the research process, which can happen in any type of design. CONCLUSION This review showed the diverse reasons for vaccine hesitancy among parents and family members of children. Such reasons were related to dis (knowledge) about vaccines (fake news, fear of adverse events, underestimation of the lethality of immunopreventable diseases) and in (decision) and lifestyle (healthy habits, alternative medicine, and religion). By understanding the reasons for non-vaccination, this study contributes to professional practice, as it encourages health care facility managements to establish appropriate intervention strategies with hesitant. Vaccine refusal or delay in vaccination should be considered by these professionals a window of opportunity to approach parents and family members. Thus, further studies are needed to investigate how professionals welcome the experiences, fears and beliefs of parents and family members. These should signal how guidance needs to be for the decision on whether to vaccinate children, since vaccination coverage rates in the child population are decreasing and vaccination hesitancy is increasing over the past few years.
