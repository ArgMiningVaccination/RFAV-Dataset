Ready to learn how you can jump-start your weight loss journey with our cleanse? It just takes three simple steps... - Jump-Start Your Weight Loss and Reduce Cravings To make the most of our cleanse, be sure to follow these three simple steps. Step 1: Preparation (one week out) Once you've decided on a date to start our 7-Day Cleanse, make sure to give yourself one week to prepare. Joining the Official Shaklee 7-Day Cleanse Facebook Group is a great way to find tips, recipes, and inspiration and to meet other like-minded individuals going on a wellness journey of their own. Who knows, you might meet some new friends to do the cleanse with you! When you're one week away from the cleanse, it's best to start reducing your consumption of coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, fatty foods, high-starch foods, and refined sugars. Try to incorporate more vegetables into your diet with our awesome recipes. You'll want to stock up on veggies and fruit for the upcoming cleanse week as well. When one week has passed and you have our 7-Day Healthy Cleanse in hand, it's time to get started! Step 2: Start the 7-Day Healthy Cleanse If you're someone who likes to snack, you're in luck! During your cleanse, you should be grazing all day, making sure to eat at least every 2 hours. Be sure to eat raw fruits and vegetables all day. You'll also want to make sure to drink at least 6 to 10 glasses of water, depending on your individual needs. For dinner, try a large salad with a full-fat dressing or a veggie stir-fry with a starchy vegetable. Remember to stick to your plan! After all, it's just seven days, and you'll start feeling better than ever! Step 3: Day 8 and After Congratulations on completing your cleanse! Once you've finished, be sure you don't fall back into old habits. Continue to eat healthy fruits and vegetables and gradually introduce other healthy foods back into your diet. Take it slow when it comes to reintroducing spicy foods, as you might be feeling a little sensitive. Shaklee has you covered with other ways to get the nutrients you need, like our Vitalizer daily nutrition routine and our Life Shake. Our Shaklee 180\u00ae Program can also help you lose weight and keep it off, if that's your main goal.
