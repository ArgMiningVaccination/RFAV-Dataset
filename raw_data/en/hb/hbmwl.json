Revised 01/202 eml 19 FERPA The MedStar Washington Hospital Center Medical Imaging School of Radiology and its faculty and staff will protect the privacy of students' education records as required by federal law and regulations and as set forth in this policy under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. A FERPA Consent to Release Student Information Form must be completed by the student before any protected information is released. A n MWHC MISR FERPA C onsent to Release Student Information Form is included in the Appendix of this handbook or may be obtain ed from the Director of Radiology Education upon request. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's edu cation records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are \"eligible students.\" Eligible students have the right to inspect an d review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies. Eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the heari ng, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information. Eligible students must represent themselves in all student/faculty/administrative meetings, no attorney o r other advisors/counselors are allowed in due process/grievance meetings (hearings). Eligible students have the right to request a family member (parent , spouse or significant other) be present as a si lent witness to any meeting. Third -party attendees are to direct any questions/answers to the eligible student who then has the right to direct that question/answer to program faculty or the hospital administration. Generally, schools must have written pe rmission from the eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31): o School officials with legitimate educational interest; o Other schools to which a student is transferring; o Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes; o Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student; o Organizations conducting cert ain studies for or on behalf of the school; o Accrediting organizations; o To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; o Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and o State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law. Schools may disclose, without consent, \"directory\" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell par ents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.

Students must change into a clean pair of scrubs when you report in, then wear a gown or lab coat over the scrubs whenever you leave the area. Students are not permitted to wear hospital -issued scrubs unless they are assigned to the Main OR , Third Floor Operating room , or Interventional Radiology clinical rotation s. COMMUNICABLE DISEASES A communicable disease is defined as any disease which may be transmitted directly or indirectly from one individual to another. A student must notify the MedStar Washington Hospital Center Medical Imaging School of Radiology Director of Radiology Education if he/she contracts or comes in contact with a co mmunicable disease. If exposure occurs during classroom, laboratory, or clinica l activities , the student will be referred to Occupational Health. At that time, it will be determined what action, if any, may be necessary to protect the student, other students, staff, and patients. If exposure occurs outside of program activities, the student must contact their own provider for guidance and notify program faculty. Time missed will be complete d according to the attendance policy. COVID -19 All MedStar Health associates and other \"Covered Individuals\" identified below under \"Scope of Policy\" must be Fully Vaccinated against COVID -19 unless they request and receive approval for a medical contraindication or religious exemption. All Covered Individuals required to be vaccinated must show proof of receipt of the COVID -19 vaccination in a man ner acceptable and in accordance with the schedule required by MedStar Health. Scope of Policy The vaccine requirement in this policy applies to all MedStar Health Associates (including employed physicians and other credentialed individuals, employed re sidents and fellows), private medical staff members, other non -employed credentialed professionals, non -employed affiliated residents and fellows, board members, volunteers, students, contractors, and all vendors who work for, provide services to or otherw ise do business with MedStar Health or any of its subsidiaries while on MedStar premises (collectively referred to as \"Covered Individuals\"). The vaccine requirement applies to all MedStar Health Associates, including those who may be currently designated as 100% remote. Professionals visiting MedStar Health premises for short - term events (e.g., consultants to Administration, Grand Round presenters) are excluded from this policy. COVID -19 is a pandemic of respiratory disease that spreads from person -to-person. COVID -19 can cause mild to severe illness; most severe illness occurs in older adults. Nevertheless, people of all ages are at risk of contracting COVID -19, and people with severe chronic medical conditions including, but not limited to, heart disea se, lung disease, and diabetes, are at a higher 36 edited 5/23 eml risk of developing serious COVID -19 illness. Additionally, healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID -19 have a higher risk of exposure. Students understand that the Clinical Facilities may have patien ts recovering from COVID -19. Symptoms of COVID -19 include, but are not limited to: o Fever (subjective or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) or chills o Cough o Congestion o Sore throat o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing o Diarrhea o Nausea or vomiting o Fatigue o Headache o Muscle or body aches o New loss of taste or smell o Or otherwise feeling unwell. Reported illnesses may range from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including death. If a student feels sick, the student agrees not to go to the Clinical Facilities and the student will stay home for the period recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Medstar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC). Additionally, while participating in the Program, students agree to take all necessary precautions recommended by the CDC and adopted by MWHC to prevent the spread of COVID -19, including but not limited to, washing hands thoroughly and often, avoiding gatherings in excess of approved number of people, and wearing a mask to cover their mouth and nose. Current guidance includes universal masking, eye protect ion with all patient encounters, transmission -based precautions, frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing, and other prevention strategies as needed. Guidance is subject to change without notice. All students are required to be vaccinated. Booster vac cines are highly suggested. Vaccinated students (at least 2 -weeks after the documented second dose) are not permitted to perform any exam on a confirmed COVID -19 patient during the first semester , but ARE permitted to perform an exam on a patient under inv estigation (PUI). Fully vaccinated students are permitted to perform exams on confirmed COVID -19 positive patients during their second (Spring) semester. MedStar Washington Hospital Center requires COVID -19 vaccines to all student providers. Both vaccines have equal efficacy (94 -95%) and similar side effects and safety profiles. MWHC provides Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at no cost to student providers. Permission to examine a PUI or confirmed COVID -19 positive patient may differ between clinical sites per the institution policies. Masking Guidance ** Subject to change according to CDC and MSH guidance: Face masks (N95 respirators or procedure masks) are optional for all asymptomatic associates, patients and visitors, including those in clinical areas. A new isolation order, \"Masking Required\" will be available in MedConnect for cases when a provider or patient requests masking in a patient's room. This order may be used at clinician discretion for patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g., 37 edited 5/23 eml immuno compromised patients) or when a patient requests that associates mask in their room. Additionally, signage indicating the masking order will be available for patient doors. Patients can request that providers and associates wear a face mask in their treat ment area. These requests MUST be respected and honored. Face masks will be available onsite for patients, visitors and associates. Students are not permitted to wear cloth (homemade) masks during any class, laboratory, or clinical activity. The face ma sk must fit completely over the nose, under the chin, and snugly against the sides of his/her face. **subject to change based on current CDC recommendations and MSH guidance. Students are not permitted to wear cloth (homemade) masks during any class, laboratory, or clinical activity. The face mask must fit completely over the nose, under the chin, and snugly against the sides of his/her face. **subject to change based on current CDC recommendations and MSH guidance. Students are required to wear an N95 respirator , or PAPR hood for students with an approved N95 exemption, and MWHC approved eye protection for any PUI or COVID -19 positive patient interactions. Students wit h a PAPR must have their PAPR with them in clinic at all times. When not in clinic, the PAPR must be securely stored on -site. Students are only permitted to remove it from MWHC if they are assigned to an off -site clinical facility. Students who are assigne d to an off-site clinical facility must take their PAPR with them to and from that site every day. Any student who does not comply with the PPE face -covering requirement will be subjected to disciplinary action as a failure to comply with the MWHC MISR cli nical dress code policy. Guidance is subject to change without notice. Voluntary COVID -19 testing is available for asymptomatic students who request COVID -19 testing for any reason. It is important to note, voluntary student testing does not replace exist ing infection prevention protocols, including the need to continue universal masking and proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), physical distancing, and hand hygiene. Wellness testing can be scheduled online or by calling the Wellness Center at 877-384- 3530 . Testing Process Please see the Clinical Coordinators or StarPort for the most recent testing process. MedStar Health associates, including providers, can now schedule COVID -19 testi ng online using the Integrated Digital Health Platform (IDHP) at Access.MedStarHealth.org or through the COVID -19 StarPort page here. Associates may create an account; log in using an existing IDHP account or their MedStar Health Patient Portal (myMedStar) credentials; or continue as a guest (NOTE: Using the guest option will not allow associates to access, c hange, or cancel their appointment at a later time).

MWHC OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH There are certain instances when a student may need to be evaluated by MWHC Occupational Health . These occasions may include situations regarding exposure to blood/body fluid/needle stick or if a student has an infectious disease. These visits would be to ensure that the health and safety of the student, patients, visitors , and Associates are considered. HANDWASHING Please refer to the MWHC Hand Hygiene policy in the Appendix. INFECTION CONTROL Students are to observe standard precautions with all patients whenever there is a possibility of exposure to blood and other body fluids. Summary of the Center for Disease Control Guidelines to Prevent Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Other Blood -Borne Infectious Agents in the Hospital: A. Needles and Other Sharps - avoid accidental injury; dispose of in sharps needle disposable boxes. B. Hand washing - before and after patient contact donning gloves; before and after donning gloves. C. Gowns - if soil ed with blood and body fluids is anticipated. D. Masks - for prolonged co ntact with coughing patients and when airborne or splattering is likely. E. Protective Eyewear - if splashing of infectious materials is likely. F. Gloves - when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or contamin ated items. Standard precautions are required for all patients. Some patients also require additional precautions because of specific communicable infections or conditions. Some examples of these categories are strict isolation, contact isolation, drainag e/secretion precautions, respiratory precautions, and enteric precautions. Students coming in contact with these isolation situations must observe the appropriate isolation condition. Any Student having a question regarding infection control situations sho uld contact the supervising radiologic tec hnologist, Clinical C oordinator, or Director of Radiology Education . Any student believing, they have received exposure to infectious material must contact the Clinical Coordinator, Director of Radiology Education and Occupational Health . 40 edited 5/23 eml Students may feel free to refer to MedStar Health Infection Prevention policies, procedures , and standards which are available online, through SharePoint , in the Policies Database. PREGNANCY POLICY Declaration of pregnancy is vol untary and at the discretion of the student. A student who bec omes pregnant has the following options: A. Voluntarily give written notice of declaration of pregnancy - A student who voluntarily makes a written declaration of pregnancy may take advantage of lower exposure limits (0.5 rem), and additional dose monitoring provisions. The student must declare her pregnancy in writing to the Director of Radiology Education . The student will be referred to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for additi onal counseling in protective measures and will be assigned a prenatal radiation badge. B. Choose not to declare pregnancy - If the student elects not to declare pregnancy and to continue in the program , normal occ upational exposure limits will c ontinue to apply. The student must meet the academic requirements and clinical objectives with no accommodations made. C. Continue in the program with modification - The student would continue on a full-time or part-time status with reassignment of rotations** (as requested by the student) coordinated with the Clinical Coordinator. The student will be referred to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for additional counseling in protective measures and will be assigned a pren atal radiation badge . Any didactic or clinical requirements not completed as a result of pregnancy must be made up before graduation and before being permitted to take the registry. D. Continue in the program wit hout modification - The student would conti nue to attend both clinical and didactic classes as scheduled with no accommodations made. The student must be able to meet the academic requirements and clinical objectives to continue in the program. E. Withdraw declaration of pregnancy - If at any tim e the student decides to revoke her declaration of pregnancy, she may do so. This action requires written notification to the Radiation Safety Officer and the Director of Radiology Education . F. Request a leave of absence - Refer to \"Leave of Absence Policy\" G. Withdraw from the program and apply for re -entry at a later time - Refer to the program Withdrawal and Re -Entry policy For the occupational dose limit for the whole body of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year, which applies to occupationally exposed individuals, the risk is believed to be very low. Radiology students over the age of 18 are considered occupationally exposed individuals for the purposes of radiation protection. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has review ed the relevant scientific literature and has concluded that exposure of 0.5 rem (5 mSv) provides an adequate margin of protection for the embryo/fetus. Through proper instruction, strict adherence to safety precautions and through personnel monitoring, it is possible to limit occupational exposure to under 0.5 rem during the period of gestation. 41 edited 5/23 eml LEAVE OF ABSENCE - (MORE THAN 3 CONSECUTIVE DAYS ) Students are strongly encouraged to avoid lengthy absences from the educational program and to postpone elective surgery until completion of the course of study whenever possible. If a student is seen in the Emergency Department, is ill for two consecutive school days, or injured during or off school hours where a physician needs to be contacted, the Director of Radi ology Education may request written permission to return to the program and an Occupational Health visit may be required for evaluation prior to returning to the program. Students should only request a leave of absence in the most extreme circumstances. Students requesting a leave of absence must do so in writing before the leave is to be taken. All classes, academic and clinical, missed must be made up before the beginning of the next semester. Final approval of the Leave of Absence request rests with the Director of Radiology Education. Students are provided up to 15 calendar days for a leave of absence. Should more than 15 days be needed, the student will be required to re-apply apply for readmission the following year at the same point in time in order t o complete the program, space permitting. All course work must be completed for the semester in which the time is missed before the beginning of the next semester. Students who are unable to make up all time and course work may receive an \"I\" Incomplete fo r that term until all makeup work and time are completed. If the student is unable to make up all missed work and time before the end of the first week of the following semester the student will have to withdraw from the program and apply for readmission t he following year. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT To assure that the student conducts himself/herself in a manner appropriate to the dignity of the profession, the student will: Practice courtesy to all patients and their families, physicians, and hospital Associates in order to promote an environment conducive to quality patient care. Make every effort to protect the patients from unnecessary radiation. Practice ALARA. Protect t he patient's right to privacy and shall maintain all patient information in the strictest confidence. Students are required to complete the MWHC Confidentiality form Protect the public from any and all misinformation or misrepresentation. Conduct themselves professionally at all times to include, but not limited to: o Never discussing personal problems and/or social activities in the presence of a patient. o Never speaking or laughing obnoxiously and/or bo isterously in the presence of any patient. o Never eat, drink or chew gum in the presence of a patient. o Restrict telephone use for patient -related activities only, except in emergency personal situations. Maintain all facilities in a neat, clean, and safe manner. Place the care of the patient above all else. Remember students represent the school at all arranged events; therefore, any photograph s taken must be evaluated and approved by the faculty prior to public display. Postings of photographs or video tak en on MWHC property or at a n MWHC sponsored event must not be posted unless specifically authorized by MW HC Marketing and Communications. 42 edited 5/23 eml GENERAL PLAN FOR CLINICAL EDUCATION Each clinical education center has a Clinical Instructor responsible for superv ision. The Clinical Instructor, or a designated technologist, supervises the student in the clinical education center. Supervision may be direct or indirect, depending on the progress of the student in the program. Students are assigned to different cli nical education centers. Clinical assignments will begin on the sixth week of the fall semester . Students will rotate through the different diagnostic areas to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from theory to application of skills by performing diagno stic radiographic procedures. During the five-week MWHC MISR orientation , students are oriented to fire safety, infection control, back safety, and CPR. Following orientation, students begin attending clinical. At each site, students a re oriented to t he department during orientation . At the end of each week, students are evaluated using the appropriate clinical progress evaluation in Trajecsys. During initial rotations, students will be primarily engaged in observation. Students will become proficient and gain competence through practice and experience. The clinical competencies that follow are designed to prepare the student for job entry -level competence upon graduation. Specific category competency requirements are listed in the respecti ve clinical education course syllabus provided by the instructor as required by ARRT. Opportunities for attaining competence in pediatric, trauma, surgical, and bedside procedures are provided. Simulation is utilized for infrequent or limited volume exami nations and will comprise a minor component of clinical education. Opportunities are provided for observation in computed tomography, echo, interventional radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, mammography, radiation therapy, and ultras onography, during the final semester provided the student is on track to complete his/her ARRT competency requirements. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE Clinical experience is gained by attending five clinical courses during the five semesters of the program. Required clinical days will vary and are subject to change as deemed necessary by the Clinical Coordinator. CLINICAL ROTATIONS Students will be assigned to clinical areas on a rotational basis. Schedules are given to students and the site clinical instructors at the beginning of each semester. Clinical start times may begin between 5:00 am and 10:00 am; occasionally variances may occur. Student s are expected to stay in the clinical area assigned. Students may not \"swap\" assignments. 43 edited 5/23 eml Clinical Supervision Policy The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) requires that prior to a student attaining competency; th e student must function in a clinical setting under the DIRECT supervision of a qualified radiographer. The JRCERT defines a qualified radiographer as a technologist certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). All radiologic pr ocedures/examinations will be performed under the DIRECT supervision of a qualified radiographer until the student has obtained the required competency on a given procedure/examination. The level of supervision the student receives is determined by the student's level of competency. Students may only be tested for competency by an ARRT qualified radiographer. DIRECT SUPERVISION Until a student achieves and documents competency, clinical assignments shall be carried out under the direct supervision of qual ified radiographers. A qualified radiographer is a staff technologist who is ARRT registered and approved by the MWHC MISR faculty. This means that an ARRT registered technologist : Reviews the request for the examination and evaluates the readiness of the student to perform the examination. Evaluates the condition of the patient in relation to the student's knowledge. Is physically present in the exam room with the student to verify the patient, exam to be performed, patient position, anatomical marker plac ement, central ray, laterality, and technical factors. Reviews and approves the images. **Students are never allowed to perform portables or operating room cases alone. **Students are never allowed to repeat an image alone. A n ARRT registered technologist must always be present when a student is repeating an image. ** An ARRT registered technologist must always be present when a student is repeating an image and students must document all r epeated images in Trajecsys. **All images taken by students must be approved by an ARRT registered technologist prior to the images being sent to the PACS system. INDIRECT SUPERVISION After demonstrating competency, students may perform procedures under indirect supervision. For indirect supervision, a qualified radiographer is immediately available to assist students regardless of the level of student achievement. This means that the qualified radiographer is present in an area adjacent to the room or location where the radiographic procedure is being performed and is within calling distance without obstacles in the way. This applies to all areas where ionizing radiation equipment is in use. 44 edited 5/23 eml Example of inappropriate indirect supervisi on: If a technologist is in one room with a patient and a student is in another room with a patient this would not be considered indirect supervision because the technologist is not immediately available to the student. The technologist has a duty to provide care for the patient in their direct care and this presents an obstacle to providing indirect supervision to the student. Example of appropriate indirect supervision: If a student is in a room with a patient and the technologist is in the work cor e working on paperwork or other duties which could be stopped immediately and is within voice range of the student. REPEAT SUPERVISION In the event of an image must be repeated students must be under the direct supervision of a qualified radiographer. Thi s means that an ARRT registered technologist : Evaluates the previous image and discusses with the student how to correct the image. Is physically present in the exam room with the student to verify the patient, exam to be performed, patient position, anatomical marker placement, central ray, laterality, and technical factors. Reviews and approves the required correction BEFORE another exposure is completed . Example of inappropriate indirect supervision: If a technologist is in one room with a patient and a student is in another room with a patient this would not be considered indirect supervision because the technologist is not imme diately available to the student. The technologist has a duty to provide care for the patient in their direct care and this presents an obstacle to providing indirect supervision to the student. Example of appropriate indirect supervision: If a student is in a room with a patient and the technologist is in the work core working on paperwork or other duties which could be stopped immediately and is within voice range of the student. ** Students are never allowed to perform portables or operating room ca ses alone. ** Students are never allowed to repeat an image alone. A n ARRT registered technologist must always be present when a student is repeating an image **Students found in violation of the direct/indirect supervision policy will automatically drop one Clinical letter grade per occurrence and be placed on a step of discipline. ** Additionally, any student found to be in violation of the MWHC MISR Supervision Policy will be subject to disciplinary action as listed below. Initial Warnings (1st occurrence) Written Warnings (2nd occurrence) Suspension (1 -3 days) (3rd occurrence) Dismissal (4th occurrence) 45 edited 5/23 eml COMPETENCY EXAMS Per ARRT standards, students must successfully complete: Ten (10) mandatory general patient care activities Thirty -Six (36 ) mandatory imaging procedures Fifteen elective (15) procedures of thirty -four available elective imaging procedures to be selected from a list of procedures One (1) elective imaging procedure from the head section; and Two (2) elective imaging procedures from the fluoroscopy studies section. The MWHC Medical Imaging School of Radiology requires a total of 43 mandatory competency exams , 10 elective competency exams, (to include one elective imaging procedure from the head section and two electives from the fluoroscopy section ), 10 terminal competency exams, and 10 patient care competency exams be successfully completed by each student prior to being recommended for graduation (73 total). A list of competencies will be provided to each student and an official record of the student's competencies will be validated by the Clinical Coordinator in Trajecsys , however , it is the student's responsibility to keep track their own record s as well. The process for proving competency will be described later in this handbook. The following competencies are the general category clinical competencies required: Upper Extremity Lower Extremity Chest/Thorax Spine/Pelvis Geriatric/Pediatric Abdomen Fluoroscopy Mobile/Surgery Head Miscellaneous RAD 130 Clinical Education I 3 competencies RAD 132 Clinical Education II 15 competencies RAD 230 Clinical Education III 10 competencies RAD 232 Clinical Education IV 15 competencies RAD 234 Clinical Education V 10 competencies 10 t erminal competencies TERMINAL COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS Students must complete ten (10) terminal competency exams assigned by the clinical instructor or the clinical coordinator.

Observe - Student watches the technologist perform the exam, while in the room with the technologist (not standing behind a control panel). b. Assisted - Student assists the technologist in the performance of the exam by performing tasks such as placing or running cassettes, completing computer documentation, transporting or assisting the patient (this list is not all -inclusive). As students' progress in technical ability, an assist may serve as an observe as long as the student has participated in the entire exam. c. Practiced with major assistance Student performs the exam under direct supervision with major assistance. d. Practiced with minor assistance - Student performs the exam under direct supervision with minimal assistance. e. Perform - Student performs the exam under indirect supervision * Students a re required to use their personal markers when testing for competency 5. Must perform the exam without technologist assistance (lifting assistance by staff is permitted) 6. Pass the competency with a minimum grade of 85% 7. Answer five questions at the discretion of the technologist on anatomy and positioning of the exam. All competency exams will be considered pending until the final approval from the Clinical Coordinator as indicated by being included on the student's master competency file. Following the update on the master clinical file, the student may perform that procedure under indirect supervision with the exception of portable and OR exams. The Clinical Coordinator reserves the right to revoke competencies based on clinical performance and to assign clinical remediation as necessary.

Procedure A. Establishment of Reasonable Suspicion All associates who believe they may be impaired by drugs or alcohol, suspect that a co - worker may be impaired or who have reason to suspect diversion or noncompliance with this policy are expected to report their concerns to their supervisor. MedStar Health will remove a potentially impaire d associate from the workplace where there is reasonable suspicion that the associate may be under the influence of illicit drugs or alcohol at work, or when there is reasonable suspicion that an associate has been involved in diversion of drugs in the wor kplace. 58 Reasonable suspicion may be based on reports or direct observation of appearance, behavior, or conduct that includes, but is not limited to: slurred speech; glassy eyes; inability to perform tasks; sleeping or inability to stay awake; a ccident involving hospital property or on hospital premises; agitated or violent behavior; disorientation; loss of coordination; or odor of alcohol/drugs on breath or clothing. Reasonable suspicion may also be based on recommendations from investigators at the local site after investigation of evidence that includes, but is not limited to: indicators from diversion analytics software; reports from automated dispensing machines or electronic safes; discovery of physical evidence; possession of alcohol or ill egal drugs; unauthorized or inappropriate possession of controlled substances; discrepancies regarding narcotic counts or administration; or information from another credible source. B. Fair and Transparent Management of Cases 1. Associates who self-report potential impairment are placed on leave and treated with as much privacy as possible. MedStar Health offers a job -protected leave of absence, short -term disability benefits (pay), and continued health insurance coverage to all eligible associ ates in order to allow the associate to seek and receive appropriate treatment. 2. Associates who are suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace, are placed on suspension with pay pending completion of an investigation, which includes a urine drug test, and may include additional investigatory steps. a. This leave may be converted to a leave of absence with short -term disability benefits if the associate immediately seeks treatment (which is encouraged). 3. Associates who are susp ected of diverting drugs for sale or distribution to others will be placed on suspension with pay pending completion of an investigation. 4. Non-employed individuals are not eligible for employment -based benefits, such as leaves of absence, short -term disabi lity benefits or health insurance coverage. However, MedStar Health remains committed to encouraging all impaired individuals to receive effective treatment, and to considering each case on an individualized basis. 59 5. Where required by law, and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, MedStar Health will complete reporting to appropriate agencies, i.e., professional licensing boards, other State/Local agencies, etc. All reporting will be conducted in collaboration with Med Star Health's Office of the General Counsel. 6. If the associate seeks to return to work, a final decision on whether and under what conditions an associate returns will be made based on the totality of the facts and circumstances then known to MedStar Healt h. a. Factors that may be considered include, without limitation, whether the associate voluntarily self -reported the issue, whether the associate cooperated fully in MedStar Health's investigation, whether the associate's behavior placed patients or associa tes at risk, whether the associate violated legal, ethical, or behavior standards, whether the associate has successfully completed treatment and is committed to continuing in recovery, whether the associate's treating provider recommends return to the hea lthcare work environment, whether there is a suitable position available, and whether the associate's license (if any) remains intact. If MedStar Health concludes that an associate or non -employed individual diverted drugs for sale or distribution, the ass ociate or non -employed individual will be terminated and will not be eligible to return to work. b. Before returning to work, the associate must be cleared through Occupational Health as fit for duty, at which time consideration will be given to any required accommodations or on -going monitoring and treatment recommended by the associate's caregiver. Associates will be required to enter into, and comply with, a monitoring agreement as a condition of continued employment. Violation of the monitoring agreement may result in corrective action, up to and including dismissal. 7. MedStar Health will conduct an individualized assessment of each case using a small group of leaders with experience in managing diversion/impairment issues for similar associates. 8. To ensure future safety of patients and associates, MedStar Health will use dedicated peer review committees to monitor and oversee associate's or non - employed individual's compliance with monitoring agreements. These committees include a Physicians Health Committ ee (including residents, fellows and credentialed providers), a Nurses and Licensed Health Professionals Health Committee, and an Associates Health Committee. 60 Please contact your supervisor or Human Resources with any questions regarding this policy.

Other hospital personnel receive education in department meetings, in -services and use of a web -based learning system with specialized content related to emergency preparedness content (SiTEL). D. Community Integration. MWHC integrates with the community emergency preparedness and response plans through the District of Columbia Hospital Association's (DCHA) Emergency Preparedness Committee, participation in the DC Health & Medical Coalition (DCHMC). These groups act as a liaison between area hospitals and local, regional and federal agencies and are responsible for maintaining two emergency communication networks; the Hospital Mutual Aid Radio System (HMARS), Hospital Information System (HIS) web -based portal as well as having mutual aid agreements with area hospitals. 1. When external authorities (e.g., police, fire, EMS, etc.) need or are required to be notified, the appropriate contact and the condition for contact are included within the operating plan. Current telephone numbers are located in public directories while special telephone numbers are maintained as reference materials in the Operating Plan. Area hospitals are notified of a 64 disaster via the HMARS radio network. 2. Hospital personnel are identified in an emergency by displaying their hospital identification badges. Key personnel in the Hospital Incident Command System are also identified by a vest labeled with their role (i.e., Triage Unit Leader). 3. Assigning all available personnel in emergencies to cover all necessary staff positions is the joint responsibility of Section Chiefs along with the Staging Area Manager. The Hospital Command Center is responsible for coordina tion among all sections. E. Emergency Operations Plan. The Plan includes specific responses to identified threats. Within these specific response plans, the responsible party(ies) for evaluating the situation and, when appropriate, how to initiate the speci fic hospital response is identified (e.g., Code Orange, Code Purple, etc). The Plan encompasses the management of the following during emergency operations: 1. Communication, including event notification, activating the command system, notifying staff and e xternal agencies and assessing the effectiveness of communication within the facility as well as to external organizations. 2. Notification/Response. Hospital personnel are notified when an emergency response measure is initiated via multiple modalities. St aff is initially notified via pager. Personnel in -house are notified by public address announcements and Code StarPort messages. Key hospital departments also maintain contact information for personnel not in the hospital. A mass messaging/notification sys tem Everbridge, is also available. Registration is required of all MWHC Leadership. 3. Resources and Assets , including mobilizing and allocating responders, equipment, supplies, PPE, and transportation and acquisition of needed resources from external sour ces (government agencies, vendors, corporate and community partners). 4. Safety and Security , including management of possible vulnerabilities, control of access to the facility and the safety and security of all staff, patients and visitors. The Plan identi fies management of radioactive or chemical events and decontamination as well as the specific decontamination procedures and policies. OSHA's guidelines for First Receivers are the reference document for this part of the plan. 5. Staff Responsibilities, including issues related to staff support during incidents, including transportation, housing and meals. Incident stress debriefing is also available through the Employee Assistance Program. 6. Utilities Management, including alternative me ans of meeting essential building utilities: electricity, water, ventilation, fuel sources and medical air/gases/vacuum. The plan also identifies a backup internal and external communication system which include: a. Back -up telephone system (Centrex system) b. Portable Radios - internal system c. ASCOM/CISCO Wireless Telephones d. H-MARS - Hospital Mutual Aid Radio System e. Satellite telephones 65 f. Pagers g. E-mail h. Fax i. Mass messaging system (Everbridge) j. Internet (share -points such as StarPort, Crisis Resource Information and Communication System -CRICS and Hospital Information System - HIS). 7. Patient Clinical and Support Activities, including management of patient activities such as modifying or discontinui ng services, triage, readjusting patient flow, mortuary services, vulnerable populations and mental health needs. The Plan delineates the management of a hospital evacuation [both partial (horizontal) and complete (vertical)]. The evacuation plan was exten sively revised in 2018 to include patient tracking, fire evacuation routes, management of patient records and medications, and patient flow. 8. Recovery. The Plan outlines re -establishing normal operations following a disaster. 9. Evaluation. An annual eva luation of the Emergency Management Plan's objective, scope, performance, and effectiveness is completed by the Chair of the Emergency Management Committee and submitted to the Environment of Care Committee. VI. Orientation and Education Component Design. The orientation and education component pertaining to emergency management addresses the following criteria: A. Overview of the Emergency Management Plan. B. Hospital Incident Command structure and where/how the individual's role fits in. C. Importance of the indi vidual's role. D. Information needed to perform appropriately during emergency operations. 1. Communication methodologies during emergency operations. 2. Procedures for obtaining equipment and supplies. 3. Training protocols for specific incidents and situations. E. Obtaining assistance for personal matters. F. As part of annual requirements, personnel must demonstrate competencies in mandatory areas. Emergency Management is included in these documented competencies. New personnel receive mandatory Emergency Managemen t training in Hospital Orientation and within their respective areas of hire during the orientation process. This is validated annually through attendance at educational sessions as well as participation in planned drills and educational interviews. G. Affected staff will receive necessary education to ensure NIMS compliance. VII. Performance Measure Design. Performance standards, included as Attachment A, have been established to assist the Emergency Management Program in promoting a safe, controlled, comfortable 66 environment of care during emergency operations. The following areas were considered prior to selection of the current standard(s): A. Staff knowledge and skill B. The level of staff participation C. Monitoring and inspection activities D. Emergency and incident reporting procedures that specify when and to whom reports are communicated E. Inspection, preve ntive maintenance, and testing of critical operating components. VIII. Emergency Procedures Design. Emergency procedures are developed in each of the Environment of Care management or emergency operations plans and published in the Emergency Operations Plan. These procedures address the following: Mass Casualty Incident (external or internal) Code Orange Chemical / Hazardous Material Exposure Code Green Fire Code Red Evacuation (partial or complete) Code Black Infan t/Child Abduction Code Pink External environmental hazard (shelter in place) Code Purple Bomb Threat Code White Armed Assailant / Hostage Situation Code Silver Associate/medical staff situational awareness Code StarPort Loss of Utilities Weather Emergencies Code Grey Chemical Decontamination Radiological Decontamination Additional response plans are developed as new threats are identified by the Emergency Management Committee. IX. Implementation of the Management Plan. The Plan ensures timely implementation / response of the organization to a wide variety of emergency events, mass casualty incidents or natural disasters in accordance with the organizational mission and services, as well as applicable law and regulation s. This is assessed through training exercises, quarterly reports and the annual effectiveness report. A. Exercises. Subject to TJC Standards, the Emergency Management Plan is executed at least twice a year either in response to an actual emergency or in pla nned exercises. At least one exercise each year involves full hospital activation with integration of a community response and simulation of patient management. Each exercise minimally exercises the following core measures: 1. Communication, including event notification, activating the command system, notifying staff and external agencies and assessing the effectiveness of communication within the facility as well as to external campus, city and regional organizations. 67 2. Resources Mobilization and Allocation , including mobilizing and allocating responders, equipment, supplies, medical surge, PPE and acquisition of needed resources from external sources (government agencies, vendors, corporate and community partners). 3. Safety and Security , including control of access to the facility. 4. Staff Roles and Responsibilities, including role in the incident command system, department plan. 5. Utility Systems, including appropriate function and use of back -up systems, if needed. 6. Patient Clinical and Support Activities, including patient flow and availability and response of departments (i.e. ICU, OR, radiology, lab) 7. Observers are designated for each exercise in key locations: (i.e. HCC, ED) as well as departments that may be specifically targeted by the exercise objective s (i.e. Telephone Operators, Protective Services). 8. Each exercise is followed by a formal critique with all participants of the drill or event. Corrective action plans are established and are tracked and monitored by the Emergency Management Committee. Af ter Action Reports (AAR) and Improvement Plans (IP) are completed by the exercise coordinator and reported to the Emergency Management Committee on each incident or exercise that required implementation of all or part of the Emergency Operations Plan. Eac h AAR includes identification of the primary issues along with 'action items' to be addressed. AARs, along with quarterly reports on all performance improvement projects are presented to the Environment of Care Committee. X. Inspection, Testing, and Mainten ance Activities . Monthly inspections of the Hospital Command Center and Ready Room are performed. In addition, the Engineering Department maintains written procedures that include performance standards for inspecting, testing, and maintaining critical operating component s of utility systems. XI. Measurement systems. The Emergency Management Plan is part of the organization wide Information Collection and Evaluation System (ICES) for identifying and evaluating conditions in the environment of care. The ICES is used to aggre gate information from the Plan. This is part of the Safety Officer's effort to direct an ongoing, organization wide process to collect information about deficiencies and opportunities for improvement in environment of care management programs. It includes summaries of problems, failures, user errors, and relevant published reports hazards, as well as reports on findings, recommendations, actions taken, and results of measurement, all of which are presented to and discussed by the Environmental Safety Commi ttee. Monitoring compliance satisfies legal requirements, tests the program against regulatory and performance standards, and identifies opportunities for improvement. It also serves as a basis for the Environmental Safety Committee's annual evaluation of the objectives, scope, performance, and effectiveness of the Utility Systems Management Plan. 68 Attachment A EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FY 21 A.

PURPOSE: To prevent the transmission of microorganisms to patients and healthcare workers. II. POLICY: MedStar Washington Hospital Center promotes hand hygiene as an essential component in safe patient care. The expectation is that all associates will follow this policy 100% of the time in non-emergency situations. Compliance with hand hygiene policy meets National Patient Safety Goal 07.01.01 and the CDC Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings . III. SCOPE: This policy applies to all associates at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, (including private Physicians), contracted services personnel, volunteers and students, working across the continuum of care. All associates will be notified of this policy at th e time of hiring through new associate orientation. It is the responsibility of all associates, physicians, temporary staff, volunteers and students to follow this policy for the prevention of health -care associated infections. It is the responsibility of each department manager, director, and leader to ens ure that all aspects of this policy and procedure are followed. IV. DEFINITIONS: Antiseptic Hand Wash: Washing hands with water and soap or other detergents containing an antiseptic agent. Antiseptic Hand Rub: Applying an antiseptic hand -rub product to all surfaces of the hands to reduce the number of microorganisms present. Hand Hygiene: A simple and effective method of preventing the spread of pathogenic organisms via the hands. Hand hygiene applies to hand washing, antiseptic hand wash, antiseptic hand rub or surgical hand antisepsis. Hand Antisepsis: Refers to either antiseptic hand wash or antiseptic hand rub. Hand Cleaning Agents: a. Alcohol -based Hand Rub: An alcohol -containing preparation designed for application to the hands for reducing the number of viable microorganisms on the hands. In the United States, such preparations used contain 60% - 95% ethanol or isopropanol. b. Antimicrobial Soap : Soap (i.e., detergent) containing an antiseptic agent. c. Antiseptic Agent : Antimicrobial substances that are applied to the skin to reduce the number of microbial flora. Examples include alcohols, chlorhexidine, chlorine, hexachlorophene, chloroxylenol (PCM), and quaternary ammonium compounds. 76 d. Detergent: Detergents are compounds that provide a cleaning action. Although products used for handwashing or antiseptic hand wash in health -care settings represent various types of detergents, the term \" soap \" is used to refer to such detergents in this guideline. Patient Care Area: a. When a curtain/curtain track e xists: Environment beyond the curtain/curtain track threshold. b. When a curtain/curtain track does not exist: o In defined areas (e.g. an exam room): The doorway. o In open areas (e.g. hallway): The bed, stretcher, or chair that hold the patient, and any equipm ent that is dedicated to that patient. Surgical Hand Antisepsis: Antiseptic hand wash or antiseptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgery personnel to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations often le ave persistent antimicrobial activity. Visibly Soiled Hands: Hands showing visible dirt or visibly contaminated with proteinaceous material, blood or other body fluids (e.g., fecal material or urine). V. PRINCIPLES OF HAND HYGIENE a. GENERAL PRINCIPLES i. General soap removes most dirt and microorganisms from the superficial skin layers. Antiseptics control or kill microorganisms from the deep skin layers. Antimicrobial solutions are used within the hospital. ii. Handwashing is necessary in, but no t limited to, the following situations: 1. When hands are visibly soiled with dirt or organic material. iii. Hand antisepsis is necessary in, but not limited to, the following situations 1. When hands are already clean and not visibly soiled, to remove or destroy transient micro -organisms. iv. Hand hygiene (using alcohol -based hand rub or soap and water) must be done upon entering and exiting the Patient Care Area as described in the Definitions section. b. WHEN TO PERFORM HAND HYGIENE: i. Before and after entering or leaving the Patient Care Area as described in the \"DEFINITIONS\" section. ii. Before and after contact with inanimate objects (including but not limited to dedicated medical equipment, the bed or stretcher including bedding, or the tray table) in the immediate vicinity of the patient, and at the end of an interaction with a patient. iii. Before and after having direct contact with patients including intact skin (e.g., when taking a pulse or blood pressure, lifting a patient or performing other physical assessment or having d irect contact with a patient for any reason). iv. Before donning gloves and after removing gloves. v. Before and after performing an invasive or non -invasive procedure requiring clean or aseptic technique. vi. Before and after contact with body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non -intact skin and wounds. vii. When moving from a contaminated -body site to a clean -body site during patient care (e.g. changing a soiled dressing or performing perineal care and then handling a central line). Gloves should also be changed. viii. Before and after eating. ix. After using a restroom. 77 c. HOW TO PERFORM HAND HYGIENE i. Soap or antimicrobial soap and water: Soap or antimicrobial soap and water should be used: 1. When exiting a patient care area for an enteric patient. 2. When hands are visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids. 3. Before and after eating. 4. After using a restroom. 5. When washing hands with soap and water, wet hands first with water, apply an amount of product recommended by the manufacturer to hands, and rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a disposable towel or hand blower. If available, use towel to turn off the faucet. ii. Alcohol -based hand rub: Alcohol -based hand rub should be used: 1. If hands are not visibly soiled. 2. For routine hand hygiene. 3. When deconta minating hands with an alcohol -based hand rub, apply product to palm of one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until hands are dry. 4. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the volume of product to use. 5. A hospital approved pocket -sized alcohol -based hand rub may be utilized in areas where access to a wall unit may not be available. iii. Procedural Areas: 1. Interventional Procedures/Radiology, Operating Rooms, Labor Delivery and Cardiac Cath Lab Associates will obse rve the \"Surgical Hand Scrub (Perioperative)\" and/or the \"Surgical Hand Antisepsis procedures\" as described in Elsevier Nursing Skills. 2. NICU Associates will observe the Clinical Practice Guideline for Hand Antiseptics in the Neonate d. DRYING OF HANDS i. Paper towels or hand blowers should be within easy reach of the sink but beyond splash contamination. Hand blowers are restricted from patient care areas. ii. Lever -operated towel dispensers should be activated before beginning handwashing. e. NAIL CARE i. Do not wear artificial fingernails or ex tenders when having direct patient care contact. These items have been shown to pose a direct risk of infection (bacterial and fungal) to patients (Refer to Dress Code and Personal Appearance -HRP 302 ). ii. Fingernails should not be longer than \u00bc inch long for associates who provide direct patient care. iii. Chipped nail pol ish should be removed. f. GLOVE USE i. Perform hand hygiene before donning gloves. ii. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene after every patient interaction. iii. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient. iv. Do not wash gloves. v. Change gloves, including performing hand hygiene, during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean site. (e.g. changing a soiled dressing and then handling a central line). vi. Appropriate glove use is addressed in the MWHC's Standard Precautions Policy 78 g. HAND LOTION i. Some products interfere with persistence of skin antiseptics or glove integrity. ii. Associates are not allowed to bring in personal hand lotions for use in the hospit al setting. Contaminated hand lotions have been implicated in outbreaks of disease (primarily gram - negative rods) in healthcare facilities. Large bottles or poorly designed nozzles can become colonized, allowing for spread of microorganisms on hands of hea lthcare workers. iii. Associates with dermatitis related to hand hygiene or glove use are encouraged to report the problem to their supervisor and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). A plan for the associate will be created based on the severity of the dermat itis. A change in the type of hand hygiene agent and/or gloves used by the associate or work restrictions may take place only after the approval of OHS. h. STORAGE AND DISPENSING OF HAND CARE PRODUCTS i. Liquid products should be stored in closed containers. ii. Disposable containers should be used. 1. Do not add soap to a partially empty soap dispenser. The practice of \"topping off\" dispensers can lead to bacterial contamination of soap. i. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGNATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AREAS i. Associates in des ignated behavioral health areas may utilize an approved pocket alcohol -based hand rub where wall units are not available for safety. ii. Associates in designated behavioral health areas who are performing routine visual wellness checks, in which nothing is tou ched upon room entry/exit, will perform hand hygiene at the beginning and end of rounding. 1. Hand hygiene is required should the associate need to perform care or touch the patient care area during wellness rounds. iii. Hand hygiene will be performed at the start and end of distribution of meal trays to patients in a common area, but not in between each tray unless contact occurs. iv. Hand hygiene will be performed at the start and end of distribution of medication to patients in a common area via assembly line, but not in between each patient unless contact occurs. v. Hand hygiene for behavioral health patients is addressed in the Inpatient Psychiatry Hand Hygiene Policy. j. PATIENTS, FAMILY and VISITORS i. All family and visitors are encouraged to practice frequent hand hygiene, especially upon entry and exit of the patient care environment. VI. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT MONITORING Hand hygiene (HH) compliance will be audited by trained observers in all areas and compliance results reported quarterly. Observers will audit H H compliance while staff are entering and exiting the patient care area and score the observation as Yes or No based -on compliance. The following circumstances will not be considered non -compliant with HH policy when: a. An associate enters a patient care are a to response to an urgent/emergent situation - such as a code blue, rapid response, code BERT or behavioral health crisis, fall, unexpected or unplanned removal of life saving medical equipment, and does not perform hand hygiene. 79 b. An associate carries some thing into a patient care area and performs hand hygiene immediately after putting items down. c. An associate exits a patient care area, performs hand hygiene, does not touch anything and then enters another patient care area within 30 seconds of performing the exit hand hygiene. d. An associate touches a patient while helping him or her to ambulate at the patient care area threshold. e. An associate does not cross the curtain track. f. An EVS associate who, in the process of cleaning a patient room, goes back and for th to their cart, stationed immediately outside the patient room, for supplies without touching anything else, but performs hand hygiene when the task is complete (i.e. moving to a new location). g. A Food & Nutrition associate who, in delivering or retrievi ng patient trays, performs hand hygiene once in between trays without touching anything else other than the tray (hand hygiene upon exit will count as hand hygiene for entry of next room so long as nothing other than tray is touched). h. An associate moving c ontaminated equipment or linen to a dirty utility/linen room, if hand hygiene is performed upon exiting dirty utility/linen room. i. Associates in designated behavioral health areas performing specific tasks as described in the Special Considerations for Desi gnated Behavioral Health Areas section. VII.

Number: 212.05 Forms: Declaration of Pregnancy Form Effective Date of This Version: 7/1/2005 I. Scope This Standard Practice applies to all Washington Hospital Center employees, contract and agency staff. II. Policy and Practices A. Formally Declaring Pregnancy 1. WHC encourages any worker who is exposed to radiation in the course of performing job duties and who believes that she may be pregnant to formally declare her pregnancy. WHC acknowledges that any such declaration should only be on a voluntary basis because the worker desires the increased level of radiation protection safet y that will be provided. A Declared Pregnant Worker can revoke at any time and for any reason this declaration by formal written notification. WHC is committed to maintaining the radiation exposure of all workers \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA) . 2. WHC encourages any worker who believes that she may be pregnant or who is planning to become pregnant to review the instructions in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 8.13, \"Instruction Concerning Prenatal Radiation Exposure.\" Each female employee assigned a radiation monitor is given this information as part of the instruction prior to being assigned a film badge. Additional copies of Regulatory Guide 8.13 are available from the Radiation Safety Office. 3. By regulation, the deci sion to become a Declared Pregnant Worker is voluntary, must be declared in writing, and may be revoked (in writing) at any time for any reason by the worker. 4. Many occupational activities that may/could include radiation exposure at WHC do not result in annual exposures greater than 100 millirem (about 20% of the Declared Pregnant Worker limit). WHC would not change a Declared Pregnant Worker's work assignment if the exposure is expected to be lower than the 100 millirem requiring monitoring in 10 CFR Part 20. In the event that the exposure level may/could exceed 100 millirem requiring such monitoring, the supervisor with the advice of the Radiation Safety Department may make assignment changes to limit potential exposure. 5. WHC recognizes that many workers regard their pregnancy status as a personal matter, and WHC will make every effort to maintain the privacy of Declared Pregnant Workers within the limits of implementing the increased radiation protection safety requirements. This means Departmen t of Radiation Safety staff who are associated with providing dosimetry (film badges or TLD rings), providing radiation training relevant to 81 exposure of the embryo/fetus, and program oversight may be informed of the Declared Pregnant Worker's status. B. How the Declaration of Pregnancy is Made A declaration of pregnancy must be made in writing through the employee's supervisor to the Department of Radiation Safety. The employee contacts her supervisor to obtain a Declaration of Pregnancy Form (Exhibit 1) from the Department of Radiation Safety. C. Dosimetry Actions 1. When a declaration of pregnancy is received, the Department of Radiation Safety will evaluate the Declared Pregnant Worker's monitoring needs and ensure that adequate dosimetry is issued and processed in order to provide timely dose monitoring. 2. Records of declared pregnancies, associated revocations, doses (both the Declared Pregnant Worker and the embryo/fetus) must be maintained and reported as required by 10 CFR Part 20. 3. If it is determined that a Declared Pregnant Worker's embryo/fetus is not likely to receive a cumulative dose of 100 mrem from external radiation, or 100 mrem from internal radiation, it is not required by 10 CFR Part 20 to provide dosimetry. However, dosimetry ma y be provided to Declared Pregnant Workers who routinely access Restricted Areas. 4. The Radiation Safety Officer (or designee) will review and sign the Declaration of Pregnancy Form. III. Responsibilities A. Declared Pregnant Worker 1. Any work er who believes she may be pregnant and who desires the increased level of radiation protection provided by formally declaring her pregnancy must inform the Department of Radiation Safety through her supervisor, in writing, of her pregnancy. 2. The worke r contacting the Department of Radiation Safety or her supervisor initiates this process. The Department of Radiation Safety will provide a Declaration of Pregnancy Form which should be used to declare the pregnancy. 3. Upon travel to another facility w here the Declared Pregnant Worker could receive occupational exposure, the Declared Pregnant Worker should inform the other facility of her Declared Pregnant Worker status. 4. Any dose received at another facility must be reported to WHC by the Declared Pregnant Worker. 5. It is the Declared Pregnant Worker's responsibility to notify the Radiation Safety Department upon termination of her pregnancy declaration. This is accomplished in writing using the Declared Pregnant Worker form. B. Department of Radiation Safety Dosimetry 1. Evaluate the personnel dosimetry monitoring needs, ensure adequate participation in the Dosimetry Program, and provide timely dose monitoring for all Declared Pregnant Workers. 2. Review and maintain all record s of declared pregnancies and associated revocations. A record of dose received by the embryo/fetus must be maintained and reported to the Declared Pregnant Worker on an annual basis. 3. If a Declared Pregnant Worker indicates that additional informatio n is desired, or if the Declared Pregnant Worker could potentially exceed 500 mrem during the gestation period, the Department of Radiation 82 Safety will initiate appropriate action and ensure instruction is provided to the Declared Pregnant Worker. Individ ual instruction will be based on the Declared Pregnant Worker's request and potential to exceed any dose limit. 4. Maintain this policy and the Declaration of Pregnancy Form and ensure that applicable WHC staff receives initial and annual training on thi s policy. 5. Inform and copy documentation to Managed Disability of changes in the status of a Declared Pregnant Worker. C. Supervisor/Manager 1. Promptly have any employee who desires to declare a pregnancy complete the Declared Pregnant Worker declarati on form. 2. Contact Department of Radiation Safety to answer any questions that may arise concerning the policy and its implementation. 3. Written declarations of pregnancy must be forwarded to the Radiation Safety Officer. Retain a copy for department records. 4. Work with the Department of Radiation Safety to evaluate and modify work schedules and job responsibilities, if needed, to stay within dose limits.

The JRCERT awards accreditation to programs demonstrating substantial compliance with these STANDARDS . Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the JRCERT 85 Introductory Statement The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) Standards for an Accredited Educational Program in Radiography are designed to promote academic excellence, patient safety, and quality healthcare. The STANDARDS require a program to ar ticulate its purposes; to demonstrate that it has adequate human, physical, and financial resources effectively organized for the accomplishment of its purposes; to document its effectiveness in accomplishing these purposes; and to provide assurance that i t can continue to meet accreditation standards. The JRCERT accreditation process offers a means of providing assurance to the public that a program meets specific quality standards. The process helps to maintain program quality and stimulates program i mprovement through program assessment . There are six (6) standards. Each standard is titled and includes a narrative statement supported by specific objectives. Each objective, in turn, includes the following clarifying elements: Explanation - provides clarification on the intent and key details of the objective. Required Program Response - requires the program to provide a brief narrative and/or documentation that demonstrates compliance with the objective. Possible Site Visit or Evaluation Methods - identifies additional materials that may be examined and personnel who may be interviewed by the site visitors at the time of the on -site evaluation to help determine if the program has met the particular objective. Review of addit ional materials and/or interviews with listed personnel is at the discretion of the site visit team. Regarding each standard, the program must: Identify strengths related to each standard Identify opportunities for improvement related to each standard Describe the program's plan for addressing each opportunity for improvement Describe any progress already achieved in addressing each opportunity for improvement Provide any additio nal comments in relation to each standard The self -study report, as well as the results of the on -site evaluation conducted by the site visit team, will determine the program's compliance with the Standards by the JRCERT Board of Directors. 86 Standards for an Accredited Educational Program in Radiography Table of Contents Standard One: Accountability, Fair Practices, and Public Information The sponsoring institution and program promote accountability and fair practices in relation to students, faculty, and the public.
