Approximately 80 percent of the world's population depends on it. The World Health Organiza tion (WHO) recommends that Western healers and their traditional counterparts appreciate each other. Tr aditional healing is based on animalism, the belief that there is a universal soul that resides in and connects all things, animate and inanimate. Although human life is often defined in discrete physical, soci al, psychological, and spiritual terms, in traditional healing, spiritualism is paramount to its success. Th e individual's balance or lack of balance with the universe determines his or her well-being. The spiritu al world seems to be the supervising force of pharmacology. Healers acquire their abilities thr ough the intercession of cosmic powers. Psychotherapeutic professionals can enhance their skills by being more open to the therapeutic beliefs and practices of traditional healers. Many universities in the United States and other countries offer courses and programs in traditional healing, in order to help therapists learn how they can incorporate in their work some of the techniques used by healers in non-Western countries. More needs to be done to promote this effort, since the majority of people of the world will probably continue to rely on traditional medicine administered by traditional healers. At first blush, traditional and modern healers are dissimilar. However, in reality the techniques of therapy used every where in the wo rld have a lot in common. Citizens of a given culture favour certain types of therapies, because the methods are compatib le with their cultural values and expectations. 2. Healing: Mind, body, and spirit Corine V. Wilson, Ph.D. Candidate, California Coast University The Energy of Oneness is the universal truth that en ergy is in all things and that the source of that energy is the same for each of us. Knowing this tr uth is what gives us the clarity to truly facilitate healing. It is what allows the healing process to occur on a holistic and unconditional level. Understanding this truth gives us the freedom to choose from unlimited techniques and resources because we recognize the energy that connects them all. We acknowledge that the same Divine spark flows through the hands of the Reiki master, through the voice of the shaman, through the eyes of the mystic. The ancient wise ones understood the energy of oneness. Reverence for the old ways is not to imply neglecting modern advances. Rather, it is the combination of both that we as practitioners must honour and encourage on a global scale. It is no lo nger a question of whether or not energy healing or spirituality has a place in modern medicine. The qu estion today is: How can we best use these practices to enhance treatment? Our awareness has been raised to the point where we see beyond the flat dimensions of therapy. We now must ask: What tr aditional modalities can be implemented to help ensure healing of body and mind and spirit? And to that end there is one critical approach - we must step outside ourselves and connect to the energy of oneness. 2PANEL PRESENTATION TRADITIONAL HEALING FOR COMMUNITES OISE Library 3. Collaborative healing practices for communities facing and/or recovering from violent conflict Anne Goodman, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto There is a great need for community healing in the world today. Most violent conflicts are within , rather than between countries. When these conflicts end, wa rring communities are left with the need to develop healing and reconciliation practices that allow them to re-establish harmony and find ways to live together. In addition, many individuals, groups and communities are trapped in ongoing cycles of violence due to historic and current traumas, and systemic injustice, with issues facing First Nations in Canada being a particular case in point. Supposedly neutral models of healing commonly used in the aftermath of violent conflict all too often repli cate dominant values and assumptions. This paper proposes that because so many current and recent violent conf licts deal with identity issues, and because colonial practices and history are implicated in so many of the conflicts, healing the past, present and future will require a reclamation and rediscovery of healing practices based in tr aditional cultures. This paper also proposes a need for collaboration on the development of more inclusive healing practices. Using the context of InterChange, an international community-based peace- building organization co-founded by the author, the paper examines how practitioners in different parts of the world can work together to integrate traditional and modern healing practices. The paper w ill further examine how this collaboration can help people to develop identities based on shared values, attitudes and competencies, rather than simply on ethnicity, race or religion. 4. The role of Islamic spirituality and tradition in the healing of community Aisha Laureen Hamdan, Associate Professor, University of Sharjah In recent years, Muslims around the world have e ndured attacks from a variety of angles, including physical, psychological, social, moral, and religious. Crises and trauma pose a particular challenge to human beings as they attempt to cope, and this ofte n results in community suffering that is complex, profound, and in most cases, unattended. During these criti cal events in life, there is a propensity to rely upon spiritual beliefs, practices, and resources. Islam, as a way of life, outlines a comprehensive model of the human being encompassing the spiritual, psychol ogical, physical, and social aspects. As such, solutions to any problem are inherent within the system, including the possibility of healing for the community. The purpose of this paper is to first briefly discuss the position and importance of community within the Islamic faith tradition based u pon wisdom from religious texts (Qu'ran and Hadith [sayings of Prophet Muhammad, peac e and blessings be upon him]). The focus will then be on the ways in which Islamic spirituality and traditional approaches may be used to facilitate healing of the struggling community. Specific topics that will be discussed in clude healing beliefs, tr aditional practices, and methods to facilitate the transfer of this knowledge to community members. The ultimate goal is the realization of the concept of tawheed or belief in, and worship of the one true God, Allah. 5. The sustaining core of community in the Jewish healing tradition Laura Praglin, Associate Professor, University of Northern Iowa I will present aspects of my chapter on Jewish hea ling from the Moodley and West book on Integrating Traditional Healing Practices. I will briefly survey th e sustaining role of the Jewish community as the 3essential basis of Jewish healing practices since Biblical times. I will also consider the challenges of incorporating traditional Jewish ideas and practices into modern counselling and psychotherapy. If appropriate, I would welcom e expanding upon my discussion (p. 176 f.) about efforts to treat trauma in Holocaust survivors and its potential application to ot her cultures that have been impacted by war and genocide. I wish mainly to address what would be most interesting and relevant to those attending the conference. 6. Indigenous health and healing: Looking to now, moving forward Suzanne Stewart, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto Mental health within Canadian Indigenous communities is increasingly considered vital for individuals in order for them to use their full resources to heal from the legacy of colonization and to survive as distinct cultural peoples. Although critical, developing and maintaining mental health within community can be challenging. Despite disproportionately high rates of mental health problems in Native communities as compared to the rest of Canada, mental health ser vices are under-used by Native peoples. In order to address this challenge, research and practice of hea lth services could be constructed from a community- based holistic model. The results of this could also im prove the health status of Indigenous Canadians by providing data to validate the need for culturally a ppropriate and effective m odels of mental health. Concrete examples come from the author's current research, teaching, and community practice experiences. PARALLEL PAPER SESSIONS PAPER SESSION 1 Room 2-295 7. Traditional healers and counsellors in Buddhist Ladakh, Northwest India Uwe P. Gielen, Professor, St. Francis College, New York This paper argues that in spite of fundamental differences in cultural belief systems, many psychosocial functions of traditional healers and \"c ounsellors\" practicing in Upper Ladakh are similar to those of counsellors and healers trained in W estern scientific approaches. Upper Ladakh is a predominately Buddhist region situated in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Many of Ladakh's people and their healers have been pervasively influen ced by the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism. The healers include highly trained abbots ( Rinpoche ) and other monks of ). A comparison with psychotherapists and ment al health counsellors in modern societies suggests that the traditional healers in Ladakh fulfill many of the same functions as modern therapists. Although Ladakhi belief systems about treatment a nd healing diverge sharply from those taught in modern psychology and psychiatry, similar psychoso cial processes underlie the counselling activities of Ladakhi and Western counsellors and healers. It is concluded that many psychosocial processes and functions underlying counse lling and healing are similar across cultu res whereas relevant belief systems are far more variable and culture specific. 48. The role of repentance and forgiven ess in psychotherapy: Wisdom from Islam Aisha Laureen Hamdan , Associate Professor, University of Sharjah Research indicates that repentance and forgiven ess can be important healing elements in the psychotherapeutic process, particularly for patients dea ling with guilt, anxiety, anger or resentment. Most of the work has focused on Christian or Jewish populati ons, but limited informati on is available regarding repentance and forgiveness from the Islamic perspectiv e. The purpose of this paper is to present the wisdom of Islam related to repentance and forgiveness. This will include the definition of these terms, the processes involved, relevant Qur'anic text and Ahadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him), the effect of these on the i ndividual and his or her relationships, and their connection to the harmony and holism of Islam. Emph asis will be given to methods by which these tools may be integrated into psychotherapy with Muslim patients, utilizing the healing effects of spirituality and religious practice. Integration of these culturally- appropriate healing practices is more likely to be accepted by patients, enhancing the success of treatme nt outcomes. Examples will be provided from case studies. 9. Therapeutic strategies from Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island Renee Linklater, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Toronto Indigenous cultures contain vast resources for healing and wellness. Many Indigenous healthcare practitioners draw on their worldviews, teachings and cu ltural experiences to work with individuals in a client-therapist relationship. This paper will explore the therapeutic stra tegies that Indigenous healthcare practitioners are using in their practises to addr ess trauma, depression and experiences of parallel and multiple realities. These strategies have been gathered during doctoral research, which is entitled \"Decolonising trauma work: Indigenous prac titioners share stories and strategies.\" 10. Canadian Indigenous mental health and he aling practices: Narratives on integration with Western health services Suzanne Stewart, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto Teresa Beaulieu, MA Candidate, University of Toronto Canada's Indigenous population is a vulnerable group in the health care system, with specific mental health and healing needs that are not widely being met. Current health indicators present a dim and dismal view of Canadian Indigenous health status, including mental health. To address some of these inequities in health and health care, some Indigenous health organizations have recently developed services to mental health that include traditional cultural appro aches to healing. This study seeks to report on the link between traditional Indigenous hea ling practices and community mental health care delivery. The focus of the present research is to investig ate the successes and ch allenges faced by Indigenous counsellors who offer both Indigenous and Western forms of healing to clients in mental health service agencies, and get descriptive information from their c lients about success of such an approach. Using both a survey and a narrative methodology that is consistent with Indigenous oral traditions and storytelling, and grounded in a community partnership model, the research questi on is: \"What successes, challenges, and barriers do Indigenous counsellors and their clients experience when employing a combination of Indigenous and Western mental health approaches to healing with in the health care system ?\" Results will further knowledge by informing an Indigenous paradigm of health by creating and refining Indigenous epistemologies in research methodology and the use of traditional knowledges in health and research, improve the health status of Indigenous populati ons, and inform government policy on mental health service for Indigenous populations. 5PAPER SESSION 2 Room 2-212 11. Personal experiences of Indigenous counselling Steve Lang, Lecturer, Massey University, New Zealand This paper reflects an autoethnographic approach to research. I provide a case study of my experiences as a White counsellor, educator and cross-cultural tr auma therapist of 'counselling' working with Indigenous Maori 'therapists' in Aortearoa, New Zealand. The paper will seek to deconstruct the colonial author ship of terms like 't herapy,' 'counselling' a nd 'client,' to the exclusion of 'other'. The pape r will reconstruct bicu lturally responsive and inclusive paradigms, where the re -authoring of meanings is perfor med in partnershi p with Maori, the First People of Aotearoa, New Zealand. The im plications of this sh ift to decolonialised practice will be described by reference to a phenomenological study (Lang, 2008) of our own counsellor education programme as it converts to culture-centr ed therapeutic practices. The experiences, we the staff have, of working with di verse cultures re-locates the focus of our work away from Eurocentric definitions of counselli ng towards a more multiethnic/multicultural locus of control. The opportunity to work with Maori healers/counsellors provides a rare opportunity for praxis, and this has profound impacts on our training programme in terms of process and content. 12. A comparison of traditional Totonacos heal ers in Mexico with We stern-trained health providers Camilo Garc\u00eda, Natanael Rivera, Erika Gaona , Universidad Veracruzana, Mexico This is a study of the practices of women heal ers in a Totonaco community characterized by a high out migration. Totonaco is a culture which wa s developed in the center of the Mexican state of Veracruz, in the classic and post-classic peri od of MesoAmerica. Previous studies of this community have shown a high incidence of anxiet y, depression, and schizoid symptoms (Garc\u00eda, 2008). Although some health providers are available in the commun ity, these professionals seem to be trained under the Western models for health care delivery; thus, most of the effective services are linked mainly to th e local traditiona l healers who, in turn, are mainly women. Using a questionnaire designed for this particular st udy, 25 subjects were interviewed: three female healers, three physicians , three medical patients, three h ealers' patients, among others. In addition, fieldwork in the area was utilized as method to understa nd the broader so cial context. The interviews were focused on procedures, interv ention, healing ritual, a nd previous training of the healers of the health provide rs. The patients, on the other hand, were interviewed to assess their belief system associated with the rituals and practices and about their thoughts about the treatment efficacy. The results showed differences between Western trained health providers and the curanderos or tradi tional healers. Overall this study showed the relevance of cultural sensitivity and cultural competence shown by the traditional healers as oppos ed to their counterparts. 613. Between pundit and psychologist: Und erstanding the Indo-Trinidadian Hindu approach towards traditional and contemporary healing Sandili Maharaj-Ramdial, Psychoanalyst and Developmental Ps ychologist, Trinidad and Tobago This paper examines the beliefs of the Indo-Trin idadian and their choice of healing methods as offered by pundits and by psychologists. Given that many traditional healing practices are joining the mainstream of current healing alte rnatives in the Western, Caucasian- Christian world, it is interesting to observe the ambiguity that races who have these healing methods as part of their inherited culture, feel in prescribin g and using them after a century of 'shame' by colonialism. Research will be based primarily on patient cases over the last five years and an understanding of the social histor y and cultural identity of the Hindu community in the island in the last 100 years. The position of Indo-Trinidadia ns as indentured labourer s speaking a different language, with different religious and cultural pr actices and beliefs duri ng colonialism, and the influence this has had on developing their iden tity in 21st century Trinidad will be discussed. The presentation will include an introduction of the Trinidadia n population to reveal how religion, class and education play a significant part in how Indo-Tr inidadians view visits to a psychologist versus a family pundit when faced with mental or emotional distress. The objective of the presentation is to highli ght the complexity of factors that influence not just this population's choice, but the stat us of psychologists in presen t day Trinidadian society. 14. The Holy Quran: The best ther apy for psychological problems Noor A. Rosli, Ph.D. Candidate, Marquette University The Quran is a Holy book brought by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) more than a thousand years ago. The Holy Quran contains words from the Almighty God, Allah, who is the Creator of this world. The Holy Quran has a ment al and spiritual impact on people who recite it continuously. The Holy Quran is capable of re moving the cause of psychological problems like sadness, depression and worries. It is healing for the soul and spirit. The Holy Quran is not like any other reference book of medi cine. The Quran contains rules of guidance in promoting good health and healing (Athar, 2002). This paper will highlight the process of healing by reciting the Quran which may help people overcome their psychological problems. The words from the Almighty God that are contained in the Quran and the sayings from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) will give an explanation about the role of Quran as the best healing tool for psychological problems in Islamic psychotherapy. PAPER SESSION 3 Room 2-213 15. Finding a place for Indigenous knowledge and practice within a standards-based, person- centered curriculum: Journey of a tenure-track counsellor-educator Claire Sham Choy, Associate Professor, Ca lifornia State University In this presentation I will argue that although counselling skills such as empathy and listening are essential components for effective counselling and psyc hotherapy, counsellor e ducators and therapists must seek to incorporate Indigenous knowledge in to their practice. The historical knowledge and experience that shape language, thoughts, feelings, and behaviours must be considered when working 7with all clients, particularly those from non-Western b ackgrounds. In making this argument, first of all, I will provide the background and history that spar ked my interest, beginning with my exposure to knowledge and practice gained at OISE/UT. Next, I will share my experience of facing challenges of incorporating Indigenous knowledge in a person-centered counselling program while pursuing tenure. I will then focus on strategies I used to address th ese challenges such as incorporating study abroad experiences that emphasized exposure to components of the Indigenous experience. Finally, I will share the findings of a recent study examining the percepti ons of faculty and studen ts regarding Indigenous knowledge. 16. Islamic spirituality and Imam s' role as traditional healers Nazila Isgandarova, Chaplain, DMin Candidate, Wilfred Laurier Imams are the main providers of Islamic spiritual care. Although Imams do not have sacraments to administer and there are no formal rites to perform, devout Muslims consider their prayers reliable. In the case of terminal illness and death, many families turn to mosques or other Islamic institutions for help. The majority of Muslims prefer Imams to visit them in the hospital and guide them in their most difficult times. Imams take different role models during this process; they act as elders, counsellors, or just traditional healers. An Imam's therapeutic or healing relationship with a client is a face-to-face individual interaction that is mainly based on essential couns elling techniques: talking, modeling, and creating awareness in the client. In this paper, I will try to explore the more healing components of traditional healing practiced by Imams and how they practice to exorcise the spirit, which then frees the person from an affliction. 17. Integrating South Asian traditional healers into counselling and psychotherapy Aanchal Rai, Counsellor, Toronto The health related beliefs of South Asians residi ng in the West are strongly based upon their culture, traditions and lifestyle. These beliefs then become a foundation of the various resources utilized by them to cope with mental health concerns and disturban ces. As a result, their beliefs and resources differ from the mental health services provided by the practitioners in the West, resulting in a gap between their needs and commonly available resources. In this paper, I explore and document the role of South Asian traditional healers residing in Toronto, in order to encourage formulation of means to bridge the gap between the South Asian mental health needs and West ern forms of counselling. I use the data from my thesis project, where South Asian traditional healers were interviewed about their background, training, the South Asian traditional healing processes and th eir thoughts on collaboration with Western Mental Health practitioners. The results re vealed that these traditional healer s closely followed the South Asian traditional healing theories and cultural norms in their pr actices and suggest that they play a major role in the lives of South Asians. 18. Curandeiros and Agonias in the Azores: Traditional healers through the eyes of health care professionals Marie Morrison, Ph.D. candidate, University of British Columbia Birdie J. Bezanson, Psychologist, British Columbia Susan James, Associate Professor, University of British Columbia This study explored the perceptions of biomed ical and mental health practitioners towards curandeiros (traditional healers) and agonias (literally \"the agonies\") in th e Azorean Islands of Portugal. Agonias is a culture-specific idiom of distress, with symptoms ra nging from lack of air, burning from within, loss of 8sight to insomnia (Jam es & Prilleltensky, 2002). Agonias does not map well onto disorder nosology described by the DSM-IV-TR, although it is frequently misdiagnosed as anxiety and depression by health care providers in Canada (James, 2002 ). Semi-structured interviews informed by medical anthropology (Kleinman, 1988; Kleinman, Das, & Lock, 1997) were used to access health care providers' perceptions of curandeiros and agonias . Informants were 5 physicians, 5 nurses, and 3 psychologists, all Azorean. Thematic analysis allowed for the development of Indigenous categories of local meaning. Findings revealed strongly negative perceptions of traditiona l healers suggesting a dichotomy between the two approaches to healing. Informants presented simplifications of agonias , often equating agonias to anxiety disorders. This is surprisingly similar to research findings with North American health providers. This simplification is in sharp contrast to the varying and multifaceted descriptions of the syndrome by those who experience it, both in the Azores and in Canada. Implications for the roles of healers and health professionals will be discussed. PAPER SESSION 4 Room 2-286 19. When Morita therapy m eets solution-focused therapy Charles P. Chen, Associate Professor, University of Toronto This presentation explores the possibility of integr ating two therapeutic approaches, namely, Japanese Morita therapy and solution-focused therapy, in the helping process. It illustrates how major solution- focused counselling principles can be incorporated into Morita therapy, generating a more effective and time-efficient therapeutic intervention for clients w ith social anxiety and related difficulties. More specifically, the presentation will (a) introduce very br iefly the basic features of the solution-focused therapy and counselling, (b) provide a very brief background overview of Morita therapy, and (c) illustrate how major solution-focused counselling principl es can be utilized in Morita therapy, yielding an integrated and more effective and efficien t therapeutic intervention for positive change. 20. Mindfulness and marriage and family thera py: Implications for practice and training Laura Eubanks Gambrel, Ph.D. candidate, Virginia Polytechnic and State University The benefits of mindfulness interventions with indivi duals are being demonstrated by current research, as are correlations with mindfulness and improvements in relational satisfaction, empathy development, and more skilful communication. Within the context of th is research, this paper will explore the implications for integrating mindfulness, defined as non-judgemental awareness, into the field of marriage and family therapy. The historic context of mindfulness in wisdom traditions including Buddhism, Islam, and contemplative Christianity are explored. This pa per also examines models of family therapy and mindfulness training, techniques, and the therapist's st ance as possible vehicles for integrating systemic therapy and mindfulness. The benefits of mindfulness training for therapists including, improved client outcomes, enhanced therapeutic relationships, and decreased compassion fatigue are discussed. Finally, this paper argues for further research including th e relationship between spirituality and mindfulness. 921. Healing strategies for Canada's incarcerated Indigenous population Allison Reeves, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Toronto Edward Wissian, Owner of Neegan Seewin Native Learning In exposing colonization, systemic racism, and margin alization as social determinants of health, this presentation considers trends in incarceration among Indigenous peoples in Canada, and the circumstances through which individuals find themsel ves in prison. This presentation considers the possibilities for using a restorative justice framework as an alternative model of justice, as well as traditional healing practices within prisons that ar e rooted in Indigenous ways of knowing. These practices are intended to counteract discriminatory influences as individuals are brought into contact with the justice system, as well as throughout their experien ce within the prison setting, in an effort to incorporate \"decolonizing\" policies and pro cesses into the criminal justice system. 22. A father-daughter dialogue on the healing effects of Chinese fortune-telling Rosa Wu, Ph.D. candidate, University of Toronto The author's father once stated, \"Chinese people rather seek fortune tellers and their Gods for their misery than mental health counsellors\". This statement sparked a stimulating, heart-to-heart dialogue between the author, a Western-trained counselling student of Chinese/Taiwanese descent, and her father, a conventional politician who practices fortune-telling as a side occupation in Taiwan, regarding the healing effects of Chinese fortune-telling. The dialogue, at first glance, resembles a debate, in which both daughter and father attempt to defend their areas of expertise, while simultaneously cast doubt on each other's notion of healing. What follows in the di alogue is a reconciliatory tone of recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of their respective fields, and a striking realization that while their means differ, the end results of fortune-telling and counselling/psyc hotherapy are greatly similar. Specifically, the major types of Chinese fortune-telling will be introdu ced, along with the effects they have on the human psyche. These profound effects will then be compared to those generated by Wester n methods of healing. This poster aims to increase understanding and appreci ation of traditional healing practices in Chinese culture through a father-daughter dialogue in written form. PAPER SESSION 5 Room 2-296 23. Bhakti, devotional love and the healing process: An Indian perspective Suneet Varma, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Delhi The paper examines Bhakti in light of the classical Indian depiction of emotions, viz. - the Rasa Theory. Bhakti is viewed as a movement in the emotional lif e of the aspirant, from minor devotional states (survival/pleasure/ego orientation) , to major devotional states (love orientation). Drawing from Sri Aurobindo, a connection is then made between Bhakti and Psychic enfoldment. Devotional love provides the bedrock for a life lived in and from the Psychic. Fu rthermore, years of observation, introspection, and reflection have lead me to conclude that one of th e most essential pre-requisites for making an effective counsellor/therapist is being grounded in love, whic h ought to forever radiate from the being of the helping person. Traditionally in India, individuals turned to their g urus in times of crisis and suffering, and upon encountering the guru , the healing process begins immediat ely for the distressed individual because of the unconditional love and acceptance on the pa rt of the guru. This paper thus focuses on the nature of self-work which helps one to becoming more loving, therefore being in a better position to help others, and facilitating one's own evolution 10 24. Curanderismo , counselling psychology and ritual: Toward an integrative approach Rachel Hoogasian, MA candidate, Boston University In light of greater multicultural awareness in counse lling psychology, the prospect of utilizing Indigenous ideology and healing techniques has become more welcome. The use of rituals or ceremonies, characteristic of many Indigenous healing systems, is an area from which psychotherapy has still much to gain. Rituals in these traditional healing practices, combined with modern psychological knowledge have been therapeutically effective in finding a link be tween a client's behaviour and values, providing structure and outlets for expressing and working through overwhelming emotional struggles, and encouraging reintegration into the community. In this paper, Curanderismo , or Mexican folk healing will be presented as an Indigenous healing tradition that tr eats the ailing holistically through ceremonial acts or rituals. After this, psychological case studies i nvolving ritual as a therapeutic approach will be presented along side some specific healing ceremonies common to Curanderismo. The striking ritual similarities between these therapi es will be discussed within the fra mework of a proposed model that incorporates holistic ceremonial acts into psyc hotherapy as treatment techniques for counselling psychologists. 25. Clinical implications of collaboration between traditional healing and counselling in case of working with ethnic minority clients Saadia Akram, Ed.D candidate, University of Toronto Within the framework of healing practices, it is co mmonly noted that the clients' perception of illnesses and treatment expectations impact their treatment process. Most often, minority clients are reluctant to pursue treatments that are based exclusively on Wester n models because they find them 'artificial' and 'foreign' within their own socio-political and religion-cultural context. In most of the minority communities, there is interconnecte dness between culture, religion, comm unity and family in regards to finding support in times of psychological distress. Literature review also shows that they feel more comfortable in seeking support through friends and fa mily members and by practising traditional healing practices. Moreover, they have a strong belief on these traditional approaches and find them more convenient, reliable and accessible without any fear of being stigmatized or labelled with mental health 'diagnosis.' In this presentation two case studies from my clinical practice will be discussed where clients were offered space to use their religious/traditional hea ling practices in combination with Western model. Both of these clients expressed interest to include thei r religious practices as part of the already outlined therapeutic plan (i.e. based on Western model). As the result of opening door to sharing, listening, respecting and valuing their traditional religious practi ces, it led to establishing strong therapeutic alliance and great rapport to move 'together' further in th erapy. The combination of traditional and Western approaches bestowed upon them reassurance, trust and comfort to consider more 'closeness' with the psychotherapeutic treatment and also offered me 'i nsight' to work more closely with my clients. 26. Aboriginal people and bi-culturedness Angela Mashford-Pringle, Ph.D. candidate, University of Toronto Historical trauma has produced intergenerational mental health concerns. It is through historical trauma that Aboriginal people were forced to learn how to live in two worlds, or be bi-cultured. Being bi- cultured, living within a dominant culture and an I ndigenous one, can cause internal conflicts around everyday decisions. Understanding that Aboriginal people must reside in both and how to navigate within the two worlds can be a part of the healing process, as they understand that daily activities create internal conflict, which can lead to mental health pr oblems. To heal, Aboriginal people must learn how to 11wear a moccasin and a loafer. This awareness will he lp individuals, families, and communities to heal as they integrate and incorporate Aboriginal and Wester n healing methods to further work healing. Being bi-cultured accentuates the historical trauma causing furthe r internal conflict. Healers and therapists must act as helpers as to how to live bi-cultured to empow er Aboriginal clients to work from a positive place within two, sometimes conflicting, cultures. THE OISE/SSHRC HEALERS' PROJECT OISE Library 27. The role of traditional healers and healing in counselling, health promotion, and education Roy Moodley, Associate Professor, University of Toronto Patsy Sutherland, EdD candidate, University of Toronto Aanchal Rai, counsellor, Toronto Edna Aryee, Ph.D. candidate, University of Toronto Archbishop Deloris Seiveright In this presentation we will discuss the SSHRC-sponsor ed research on the work of African, Caribbean, and South Asian traditional healers and their healing pr actices in the Greater Toronto Area. Many of these healers and healing practices are excluded from the main stream culture; some are denied an existence and yet others are regarded as 'evil', as a result of racism, colonialism, and current dominant culture hegemony. Consequently, they have gone 'underground' and remain hi dden. Practices such as Animism, Voodoo, healing in the Black churches, Orisha, Ayur veda, meditation, and Yoga were part of this research. The interview itself covered six main topics: reasons for becoming a healer, the type of people who are treated (i.e., patient or client groups), the pr ocess of healing, the healer's training and practice, his or her role in health promotion and education, and his or her relationship to practitioners of Western approaches to health care. We will analyze our re sults using grounded theory, to identify themes that emerge from the interviews. In this presentation we will discuss the process we undertook to conduct the research, some of its findings, a brief statement from one of the healers. AFTERNOON KEYNOTES OISE Library 28. Counselling and psychotherapy use in traditio nal healing practice: practical cases from Kenya Simon Murangiri, Medical Herbalist, Tutor at Ke nya Institute of Organic Farming This presentation will cover the combined use of ps ychotherapy and traditional healing practices to address marital problems, a common death phobia and to instil discipline into the youth. It will also discuss the collaborative roles of resear cher and practitioner. A crucial ingr edient for effective research in traditional medicine is mutual respect; work should be done without one being regarded as a specialist and the other as an information provider. 1229. Pills and needles: Musings on traditional Chinese medicine in Canada Ted Lo, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto From a personal perspective, Dr. Lo will share his views on the potential bene fits of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Canadian hea lthcare with case examples. Issu es around the adoption of TCM in Canada will be discussed. The differences between TCM and conventional Western medicine will be presented, and the ways such differences may be ma naged will be explored. Tradition is dynamic and ever evolving. Incorporating traditional healing into modern healthcare can bring significant benefits to society, and wellbeing of its members. POSTER PRESENTATIONS OISE Library 30. Turkish Indigenous healing methods: The practice of visiting sacred tombs Deniz Cinarbas, Assistant Professor, University of Alberta The current poster presentation will review the liter ature and reveal the preliminary results from a qualitative study regarding the phe nomenon of visiting sacred places and tombs in Turkey. \u00c7arko lu and Toprak (2000) found that 52.7 percent of Turkish pa rticipants visit sacred places and tombs. Turkish people visit sacred places and tombs to pray and to give adak (i.e., to make vows) to a deceased religious leader (Koptagel- lal & Tuncer, 1981). Visiting sacred places and tombs is an Indigenous healing practice steeped in both Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs . Islamic scholars argue, however, that giving adak to a deceased person is against Islamic rules and adak should only be dedicated to Allah ( Kabirlere Kurban Adamak, n.d.). In agreement with Islamic scholars, Ar tun (n.d.) indicated that visiting sacred places and giving adak are in fact pre-Islamic practices. Before adopting Islam, Turks followed shamanistic and animistic belief systems (Artun, n.d.). According to an imistic beliefs, the souls of wise leaders continue to help and protect their people after death and thus, should be respected by giving gifts and food (Artun, n.d.). Today, visiting sacred places and tombs, and giving adak are practiced to heal mental illnesses, to alleviate marital and family problems, and to wish fo r a job or for marriage. Th e results of the research project will provide a better understanding of the visito rs' presenting issues, beliefs and their expectations from the practice. 31. Historical antecedents and contemporary applications of mindfulness in North America Jonathan Danson, MA candidate, University of Toronto Nina Mafrici, MA candidate, University of Toronto Traditional and alternative healing practuices , though historically and consistently marginalized, are gradually gaining credibility and beginning to flourish in the Western world. Therapeutic orientations that were once thought to be unfounded are receiving some empirical support in the psychological literature, sparking the interest of scholars, practitioners and the mainstream community. In particular, Buddhist ideals and conceptualizations of suffering have b een increasingly recognized and appreciated in the Western world, largely as the result of the work of Ca rl Jung. One of the most prominent manifestations of this popularization is the proliferation of mi ndfulness and mindfulness meditation pratice in North America. In this poster, the theoretical framework and practical applications of mindfulness are explored. Though based wholly in religous Buddhism, it is presente d not as a path to a Divine Being but rather as means to awareness and self-actualization. With a cl ear understanding of what it means to be mindful, the historical condition s that allowed for mindfulness to thrive are examined. The humanistic movement and Western interest in Buddhism after World War II are identified as two of the most crucial precipitating 13events, while the role Jon Kabat-Zinn in bringing mindfulness to the masses is highlited. Finally, the continuing evolution and integration of mindfulness in Western psychotherapy is considered. Looking beyond its success as a stand alone approach to heali ng, the incorporation of mindfulness into other established therapies is discussed in the context of future directions. 32. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia in isolated sessions of mindfulness meditation Sarah Horowitz, MA candidate, University of Toronto Mindfulness meditation, involving non-judgmental ongoing attention to the phenomena of the present, is increasingly used to treat various mental and physi cal problems. Previous studies implicate increased parasympathetic activity in meditation, but little physiological information has been collected on mindfulness meditation particularly. The present study i nvestigated respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), indexing parasympathetic activity, in 26 young adults during mindful ness meditation and quiet sitting, controlling for respiration rate. Respiration was significantly slower in meditation than sitting. Participants with prior meditation experience di splayed significant RSA increases during both sessions. Men (n=10) displayed significant RSA increases du ring meditation compared to sitting, even when controlling for respiration. These results support RSA as important to mindfulness meditation and encourage investigation of experience and sex effects. 33. African traditional healing and concept of the person Lonzozou Kpanake, Postdoctoral Fellow, McGill University Psychotherapies are centered on explicit talk about the self. Every system of psychotherapy thus depends on implicit models of the self, which in turn, are based on cultural concepts of the person. Although \"person\" is completely a social and cultural creati on, psychotherapy in Africa is based on Euro-American values and egocentric concepts of the person. As a result, Western forms of psychotherapy are of little relevance in Africa, while traditional healers are f ound to carry out practices of psychotherapeutic values that are more culturally accepted by people since they consider the way African people define themselves through their worldview, their cultural values, and thei r selfway. In this paper, African concepts of the person underlying traditional healing practice were e xplored. The person is understood in relation to the social world, the environment, and the cosmos. Me ntal illness is the result of a disturbance in the harmony between the individual and such pers on's agencies. Healing practice is grounded on connectedness, which is in turn associated with a h ealthy life. Traditional rituals have positive effect on mental health because they address this fundament al need, namely that of re-establishing links. Psychotherapy with African people s hould consider African concept of the person to determine how well it fits or conflicts with the concepts , values and way of life of the patient. 34. Yoga Therapy: A natural treatment for addictions Sarah Kinsley, MEd Candidate, University of Victoria This poster will explore the use of Yoga therapy, as a mindfulness-based practice, for those recovering and healing from various addicti ons. The poster will uncover the roots of Yoga psychology and provide practitioners with techniques that can be used with clients. These techniques can also be employed by therapists/healers as a form of holistic self-care. Partic ular focus will be on the author's work with various First Nations groups on Vancouver Isla nd. The term 'Yoga' is often tran slated to mean 'union' thus implying one's body/mind/spirit can be united by practic ing this ancient healing path from India. The poster aims to educate participants of the depth found in traditional Yoga psychology. In the west, Yoga is often regarded as a way to increase the size of one's biceps (focusing on the asanas/physical poses) 14whereas, in reality, Yoga is a way of being, which when practiced can lead to greater levels of self- awareness and self-acceptance. This awareness is crucial when worki ng with through addictions as those suffering often come to see first hand that they are more than their addictive mind-states and behaviour. It is paramount to note that addictions do not necessar ily involve a substance but can be a state of mind in which desire dominates. Examples will be provided on how this ancient, yet emerging, form of therapy has been helpful for many people who seek to live a more holistic, meaningful existence. 35. Culturally comprehensive psychotherapy: Modern trends and the migration of Buddist thought Nina Mafrici, MA candidate, University of Toronto Jonathan Danson, MA candidate, University of Toronto The notion of integrating traditional healing practi ces into Western counselling and psychotherapy has stimulated a wealth of interest and research over th e past several years. Specifically, in the last two decades many alternative or complimentary healing practices have emerged in reformulated and reconstituted ways in Western health care, often as a result of certain shortcomings in conventional medicine. Western therapists face a unique challenge in bridging cross-cultural boundaries through the process of integrating traditional healing, spiritual doctrines and religious practices into contemporary counselling and psychotherapeutic pr actice. This poster aims to expl ore Buddhisms as one of the most striking examples of spiritual integration into Western psychological thought. Beginning with an examination of the Buddha's life, his noble teachings , and his encounter with psychoanalytic theory in the 1950s, we attempt to draw para llels between Western psychologi cal thought and Buddhist philosophy. Commenting on the current integration of Buddhism into Western psychotherapy, we conclude with the challenges therapists face today and the importance of remaining attune to culturally-embedded values, norms and practices in our clinical encounters. 36. Living in the lotus flower: The effects of mi ndfulness meditation in psychotherapy with cancer populations Raha Mirian, MEd candidate, University of Toronto This poster highlights the benefits of using mindful ness meditation practices with cancer populations. In contrast to the prevailing Western bio-medical mo del, which embraces a mechanized and reductionism view of the individual, Eastern philosophical practices maintain a holistic approach to health and consider mental, physical, and spiritual well-being as interrela ted. Illness is accordingly viewed as the body's message to the person to redirect their life and re-e stablish balance within. Ra ther than searching for a cure to eliminate the manifestation of the body's me ssage, the individual learns that the expression itself carries great value. Patients are encouraged to tune in to their bodies, and reunite with the spiritual essence of their being, which becomes their cure. Mindful ness practices and spiritually-focused psychotherapy groups have proven highly beneficial in assisting can cer patients to successfully work through existential issues and achieve greater well-being. Studies have demonstrated benefits including decreased negative affect and increased positivity, a secure sense of in ner-self, non-judgmental awareness, and acceptance. Most significantly, feelings of connectedness to ot hers and to higher nature, meaningfulness, and increased spirituality have been documented. 37. How Mormon women reconcile their feminist attitudes within a patriarchal religion 15 Verlyne Nzojibwami, Counsellor, Calgary Nancy Arthur, Ph.D.., Professor, University of Calgary This poster will present the ways that Mormon wome n reconcile their feminist attitudes within a patriarchal religion. Thirteen women from six differe nt cities across Canada and the United States were interviewed. The findings suggest that the main co ping strategies include: (1) treating the patriarchal system as peripheral to one's faith, spiritual deve lopment and personal rela tionship with God, (2) reconstructing an idiosyncratic unders tanding of LDS theology that better fits with one's feminist beliefs, and (3) taking some form of action to move be yond the patriarchal struct ure and foster personal empowerment. Implications for counselling are considered with an emphasis on feminist principles and multicultural counselling competencies are suggested. 38. The dissection of spirituality from an integrative medicinal model Rob Roopa, MEd Candidate, University of Toronto A significant number of medical schools and psychiat ric institutions today are incorporating holistic approaches within their curriculum and are acknowledging the practice as legitimate rather than quackery. The collaboration of both practices to address the healthcare needs of a specific patient is termed integrative medicine. According to Hans Baer in Towards an Integrative Medicine, physicians have become increasingly aware of their patients' movement towards alternative approaches of Medicare. This movement is caused by the failure of biomedicine to cure some of the most prominent and widespread diseases that have effected us for decades. Patients ar e starting to lose faith in the medical system and thus, are seeking other alternatives for treatment. Baer argues that because of this movement, a number of physicians and psychiatrist are seeing this as a po tential to expand both their practice into holistic alternatives and expand their business using an integrative approach to medicine. However, the idea of an integrative approach almost fails from a social pe rspective. Although it may succeed in providing patients with different perspectives on how to treat their ailments, an integrative model only reinforces neoliberalism through the exploitation of holistic approaches and the forced compliance of having traditional practices conform their principles appropr iately to the medical model. The aim of this presentation is to explore how spirituality has been completely isolated from the integrative model and neglects the basis of what has made holis tic practices successful throughout history. 39. Ecology consciousness in a more-than-human-w orld: Psychological benefits of being with/in nature Gillian Smith, Ph.D. Candidate, Simon Fraser University This poster presentation is an exploration of what might be imagined if we were to necessitate a reunion between humans and nature, as if unfrozen from th e disembodied enchantment of the mechanistic worldview. Departing from a human-centered form of psychotherapy that has emerged from a human psyche that has devastated the planet and that h as resulted in substantial inequity of people around the globe, this presentation seeks to uncover what coul d be considered the \"dormant sensitivities\" of humanity, namely, deep and profound relation to th e \"planetary-other\". This presentation will demonstrate how these sensitivities have been suppressed over the last few centuries, and how they have consequently limited our ability to place analogous value on the more-than-human world. The aforementioned challenges to human healing have resu lted in a form of \"psychic numbing,\" the inability to feel and respond to human and planetary sufferi ng. The phenomenon of aesthetics and empathy for the natural world, as a dimension of the human psyche, is explored with its relevance to humanness and planetary healing. I conclude that a new form of heal ing is required in our manne r of psychotherapy, if we are to foster a will to calibrate human grace and ecological harmony. 16 40. The teachings of Tibetan Buddhist deities to modern psychotherapy: An analysis of the medicine Buddha and Demchog Ken Walton, MEd candidate, University of Toronto My poster will demonstrate how the various teachings of Tibetan Buddhist Deities can be incorporated within Western psychotherapy. The poster will focu s on two of the main deities in Vajrayana Buddhism which embody a healing and deeply psychically tr ansforming consciousness, the Medicine Buddha and Demchog. The teachings of the Medicine Buddha can be incorporated within psychotherapy to help therapists embody healing powers. The Medicine Buddha is the colour of deep blue space which represents the healing energy of the cosmos. Psyc hotherapists can learn to be empowered with this energy, and channel it into the healing of their clie nts' problems. The Medicine Buddha's hands are in the mudra position of Supreme Generosity and Meditati on. This demonstrates the therapeutic disposition of being able to actively heal othe rs, while simultaneously maintaining an inner calm state. The teachings of the wrathful Vajrayana deities, specifically De mchog, represent the dynamic tension within deep consciousness. Demchog is depicted in primal union with his female consort, representing the dialectic transformation of the deep psyche. Psychotherapists can use this energy to help clients heal deep psychic dynamic wounds. Demchog has 12 hands which hold t ools that enable him to break through ignorance, greed, and hatred. These tools can be applied to various psychotherapeutic techniques. 41. Health and healing in Guatemala Erin Wolfson, Breaking the Silence, Toronto The Mayan calendar is still seen today as an importan t 'teacher' in the lives of many Guatemalans. Spiritual healers or guides use this traditional wis dom in their 'healing work'. Mayan ceremonies are seen as an important tool to help people in their heali ng processes - through reflection, meditation, offerings, and reconciliation - connecting with ourselves, with our communities, our ancestors, Nature and the universe as a whole. Mayan \"Psychotherapy\" practices, as such, often take place around fire. Part of the work that I was doing this last year in Guatemala was to look at the role of ceremonies and other traditional Mayan practices in 'community healing'. I was living in Rabinal, a rural aboriginal community and working with a community nursing program for abor iginal rural youth that is rooted in traditional Mayan health and healing practices. This was see n as very important to the community as traditional healers - such as midwives and spiritual guides - still play an important role in offering guidance to over 80 percent of the population. Many people do be lieve that these practices, such as commemoration ceremonies, are also an important part of both of individual and community healing - especially in communities, like Rabinal, where people are still affect ed by violence and conflict. I would like to share through photos and (possibly) a short documentary my reflections and learnings from my year in Guatemala, and how I see this traditional knowledge a nd practices as relevant to the Canadian context. DAY TWO 17 PARALLEL WORKSHOPS WORKSHOP 1 Room 2-295 42. Finding the energy to heal: Emotional freedom techniques Patzia Gonzalez-Baz, Gestalt, Client Centered and Family C onstellations Psychotherapist, Advanced EFT practitioner EFT is a method used to release negative feelings natu rally. It is an emotional form of acupressure. This method is highly effective in reducing the impact of trauma, anxiety and stressful events, can deal with any negative emotion, and can be used with any age group. It is natural, drug-free and rapid. Until recently, the subtle energies that circulate throughout the body have been la rgely ignored by Western scientists. As a result, our use of them for emotiona l and spiritual healing has been sparse at best. EFT, however, considers these subtle energies to be the front running cause of emotional upsets. In this experiential workshop you will learn the EFT shortcut, the points that are used and the sequence. To facilitate learning the sequence, we will do an EFT exercise with our breathing\u2014most people do not breathe fully\u2014and check results before and after the exercise. We will also do an exercise with food cravings. While being \"tuned in\" to the problem, you will be guided to tap gen tly on certain acupuncture points as you verbalize key elements of the issue. The combination of tapping, verbalizing, and \"tuning in\" diffuses the negative charge of the emotion. This is often done so subtly, you may not feel a big bang, you will just suddenly feel \"normal\". It sounds too simp le to be true, yet it has worked time and time again! WORKSHOP 2 Room 2-212 43. The Inner Mongolian dance, Anda i: A workshop in Shamanic healing Catherine Kmita, Ph.D. candidate, University of Alberta Andai is a circle dance with scarves of the Khorchin Mongols in Inner Mongolia, China. It was originally used by shamans for a \"heavy disease\" among young wo men unable to marry a boy of their choosing, characterized by listlessness, lack of sleep, and lack of appetite. The ritual/dance was thereafter used for dozens of different purposes, such as bringing rain, celebrating national (Mongolian) culture, sending someone off, or for religious purposes. The dance is d esigned to raise energy to help the shaman with his or her work, but can also be used by the general popul ation if a shaman is unavailable. This workshop will consist of three parts. First, I will outline the hist orical origins of the dance and its transformations in interaction with the modernization process in Ch ina and relations with the Han Chinese and the international community. This section will be illustrate d with video footage of the dance. I will then demonstrate some of the common steps used in the da nce with the workshop participants. The participants will then join me in performing andai. Perhaps we can find an appropriate intention for the energy we will undoubtedly raise!

Therapeutic aspects of Indian classical dance Dimple Kaur, Principal, iMatter Institute of Counse lling & Behavioural Sciences, New Delhi The Indian dance therap y involves the use of Mudras (gestures) to attain therapeutic goals. This therapy helps to increase the emotional-physical unity in in dividuals affecting positive changes in the feelings, cognitions, behaviour and physical functioning. I use the psychosomatic relationships to make participants aware of their body and empower them to bring the changes desired by them. The workshop uses creative stories from Puranas and Vedas , thus exposing participants towards spirituality, rising above the mundane and leading th em towards self-actualization. While befriending their emotions, feelings and sentiments through mudras (gestures) and interacting with others, participants learn to understand themselves more effectively. The workshop framework of involved and experiential learning makes the entire process easy to adapt and understand w ith a lot of emphasis on self-goals, realization and healing. The process can be used effectively for h ealing depression, anxiety, low self esteem, ADHD and other common disorders. WORKSHOP 4 Room 2-286 45. Contemporary formulations of Reiki: history, theory, practice, and research Farah Jindani, Social worker, Toronto Janany Irathinam, Social worker, Toronto This presentation reviews research to date on Reiki and offers participants the opportunity to discuss this traditional healing method in relation to clinical practice. Reiki is a vibrational, or subtle energy therapy, most commonly facilitated by light touch, which is believed to balance the biofield and strengthen the body's ability to heal itself (Miles & True, 2003). Althoug h systematic study of efficacy is scant thus far, Reiki is increasingly used as an adjunct to conventio nal medical care, both in a nd out of hospital settings. This workshop will describe the practice and review the history and theory of Reiki, giving participants a context for the growing popularity of this healing m odality. Programs that incorporate Reiki into the clinical setting will be discussed, as well as important c onsiderations in setting up such a program. As the presenter is a clinical practitioner also trained in Reiki, the integration of this traditional method into clinical practice will also be discussed. The presente r will demonstrate and guide participants through exercises by which participants will understand that Reiki is a light-touch therapy which generates energy flow into the body to enhance and speed up the body's natural healing ability. This will be demonstrated by teaching participants how energy can be transm itted through a series of hand positions directly over the body. Key energy points, such as chakras and crys tal demonstrations with participants will occur. Finally, the research literature to da te on Reiki will be reviewed and eval uated, and directions for future Reiki research, spirituality, and practice will be suggested. KEYNOTE PRESENTATION OISE Library 19 46. Bear spends time in our dreams now: Magica l thinking, ritual, and spiritual considerations in counselling theory and practice Joseph Trimble, Ph.D., Professor, Western Washington University Bears have great spiritual significance for numer ous Indigenous societies and nations. Many believe the bear is the keeper of dreamtime, a nd through dreams knowledge, wisdom, and guidance are available to the person honoured by the bear's presen ce. When bears awake in one's dreams the dreamer can expect change and transformations in their lives. B ear medicine thus is believed to be a major healing source. One of the major impediments to the success of a psychosocial intervention with ethnocultural clients is the deeply rooted and enduring presence of folk wisdom, healing traditions, sacred rituals, and ancestral knowledge. Often hidden from the view of outsiders, sacred and ancient knowledge is a source for explanations of various events ranging from natura l phenomena to the cause and treatment of physical and psychological conditions. Counsellors may view magical thinking as unrealistic and thus an obstruction to intervention. Given this consideration, magical thinking , rituals, and their spiritual f acets and relevance for cultural empathy will form the major theme of the lecture. Magical thinking gives people the opportunity to explain and control what they believe is uncertain. Rituals, ceremonies, songs, daily routines, and an assortment of re lated activities give people the feeling they're not at the whim and mercy of the uncontrollable. What may be seen as mysterious, extraordinary, supernatural, mystical, or dreamlike by some counsellors is believed to be authentic, controllable, predictable, and comp rehensible by some clients. Challenging the legitimacy, validity, value, and infl uence of what is real for ethnocultural clients calls into question a counsellor's cultural sensiti vity, competence, and effectiveness. Conversely, counsellors who establish a deep and sensitive relationshi p with multicultural clients come to realize that magical thinking , spirituality, and ritual dominate their clients' worldviews. Depending on the counsellor's values and willingness to suspend judgment, in time trustworthiness, respect, reverence, rapport, benevolence, and integrity serve to prom ote cultural empathy and advance the counselling relationship. PAPER SESSIONS PAPER SESSION 1 Room 2-295 47. Healing the hostility: White mothers of non-White children and Maori women Tracy Robinson-Wood, Professor, Northeastern University, USA In qualitative interviews with 15 biological and adop tive White mothers of Non-White Children in New Zealand, one of the seven themes to emerge wa s hostility from Maori women experienced by White Mothers of Non-White Children. With a focus on the Marae as a center for Maori health and culture, this presentation will explore the racialized roots of this hostility among racially diverse women and discuss strategies for healing women's relationships towards strengthening the psychological and socio-emotional development of children of color with White mothers 48. Healing, divination and 'Obeah' in African derived religions in the Caribbean 20Frances Henry, Professor Emerita, York University, Toronto My presentation will discuss how African influenced re ligions in the Caribbean, specifically the Orisha and Spiritual Baptist Faiths, in Trinidad and elsewhere in the region, make use of a mixture of Christian and African religious rituals in attempting to heal their devotees mental, physical and spiritual disease. These religions rely strongly on African derived prac tices such as divination to provide answers to the problems presented by clients as well as more traditional and mainstream prayers and chants. I will describe and discuss some of the techniques obser ved and studied during my fieldwork in the Caribbean, where I was privileged to have worked clo sely with several religious leaders who were also major healers. Underpinning this discussion, will be the attempt to dismantle the negative beliefs and stereotypes about 'Obeah' as it pertains to A frican derived religious and healing practices. 49. Out of the jungle and onto the couch: Investigating Ayahuasca as a therapeutic tool Stephen Trichter , Psy. D., Clinical Psychologist Vegetalismo , the Indigenous shamanic healing tradition of the Amazon Basin, uses the visionary brew, ayahuasca, as a diagnostic tool towards healing the patient's interwoven mind, body, and spirit. Specifically, it uses a combination of plants and chanti ng to invoke the spirits to assist with purging out the energetic, psychic, physical, and emotional bl ockages in the patient. Ayahausca has found increasing popularity among Western spiritual seekers due to its reputation of creating profound spiritual and mystical states of consciousness. However, this popula rity and subsequent usage by Westerners brings its own challenges to adopting this shamanic tool. The in tegration of centuries-old shamanic practices into the context of the postmodern world requires a caref ul balance between traditional shamanic and Western ways of thought. The balance lies between the ability to recognize and absorb the perennial mystical wisdom unleashed by the brew, and its responsible and safe incorporation into a Western psychological and cultural framework. This presenta tion will look into original research on the spiritual and mystical affects of the brew on Western subj ects and examine the benefits and ri sks of integrating this Indigenous practice into counselling and psychotherapy. 50. Is there an American Indian psychology? Jeffrey King, Associate Professor, West ern Washington University There has been considerable deba te among psychologists and even among American Indian psychologists as to whether psychology and/or counselling take a signi ficantly different form wh en applied to American Indian tribal members. It is clear that a culturally-congruent psychotherapy with American Indians in many ways runs contrary to mainstream psychologi cal theories due to significant differences in world view, values, traditions, history and life-ways. This presentation notes the difficulties encountered when trying to conceptualize an over-arching theory of co unselling for American Indian s. However, the deeper underlying values of tribes are very similar to each ot her and yet very distinct from the Western European values that form much of our psychological theories. Traditional American Indian values are contrasted with those of Western European cultures to illustrate the fact that the world views, traditional values, concepts of self, well-being, healing, spirituality, an d relationships are very different for tribal people. These various differences are addressed, using terminolog y from various tribes to further illustrate these points. Finally, a general theory of an American Indian Psychology is presented with guidelines for providers in order to gain greater cultural competencies. PAPER SESSION TWO Room 2-212 21 51. Incorporating religious discourses in co unselling: Enhancing counsellor multicultural counselling competencies with African American clients Khan Bouba-Dalambaye, B.A., McGill University Anusha Kassan, Adjunct Instructor, McGill University There has been a rapid growth of culturally diver se populations in North America over the past thirty years (Suzuki et al., 2001). This growing diversity poses a challenge for counsellors, as traditional counselling approaches are not effective when u sed with racial/ethnic minority groups (Sue et al., 1982). Recently, an important focus has been placed on the development of Multicultural Counselling Competencies (MCC). The tripartite model of MCC, developed by Sue et al., (1992), represents the most widely used framework in the field of counsellin g psychology. According to these authors, cultural competence necessitates self-awareness, appropriate knowledge, and sensitive skills on the part of counsellors. Given this conceptualization, it can be ar gued that individuals' religiosity, which can play a salient or even pivotal role in their lives, needs to be addressed in counselling in order to ensure proficient MCC. A particular population for which this holds true is that of African Americans. Historically, the topic of religion has been absent from the domina nt discourse in counselling psychology (Pedersen, 2008). Individuals' religious beliefs can represent an important social , emotional, or financial resource. This affiliation with religion can be a crucial buffer against the effect s of stress and pathology (Smith & Richards, 2005). The goal of this paper is to examin e how counsellors can increase their understanding of clients' religiosity. By integrating religious discour ses in counselling, counsellors will expand their MCC. 52. Contributions to counselling and psychotherapy from traditional healing Marusia Kaweski, Ph.D. candidate, University of Saskatchewan Healing is a long-used and central concept in ps ychology. However, the discipline lacks developed discussions and critical analyses about healing, particul arly in its critical literature. Further, the meaning of healing is usually implied from illness assumpti ons (Seagull & Seagull, 1991; Mishara, 1995). The purpose of this critical research is to explore the understandings of healing in self-care from the perspective of the patient. Self-care is understudied in psychology healing literature, although it is directly connected to health attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, a nd the daily activities used to maintain and restore health (Moser & Watkins, 2008, p. 205). It al so comprises a key component of counselling and psychotherapy. To explore participant constructions of healing, I employ the life history narrative, which concerns development over the entire life course, and focuses on process and context that are important in healing (Chase, 2004, p.652). I focus specifically on meanings of narrated healing experiences for participants, the structure of narrative constructions a bout healing, and what the participants' perceive as the context that shapes the constructions of heali ng within their life story narratives. This research contributes to the knowledge base a bout lay understandings of healing a nd conceptualizations of healing within folk medical systems. These views differ from the meanings within the professional medical systems according to the particular goals and functi ons of each health care system. I also contribute to psychotherapy and counselling practice by raising con ceptual and methodological issues of investigating healing and their implications for the practitioner in a clinical setting. 53. Aboriginal traditional healing integration in the context of Canadian mental health Olga Oulanova, Ph.D. Candidate, University of Toronto 22Given that mainstream mental healthcare inadequate ly addresses the psychological needs of Indigenous clients, there is revival in the use of traditiona l healing among Canadian Aboriginal communities. In evaluating interventions with Aboriginal clients an argument is repeatedly made for incorporating traditional practices. However, c oncrete recommendations are missing on how traditional healing may be used conjointly with Western counselling. To address th is limitation, I interviewed nine Canadian mental health professionals who routinely carry out such integration by using both Western psychological interventions and Aboriginal traditional healing prac tices. Qualitative data from discussions of their integrative efforts were analyzed via the Grounde d Theory approach and four core themes were identified. 'Becoming a helper' described participants ' paths to practicing both traditional healing and counselling. 'Deciding when to integrate' addressed their assessment process pertaining to integration. 'Describing integrative efforts' ou tlined participants' interventions a nd identified three main areas of integrative work: incorporating traditional elements, using a specific approach, and referral/collaboration. 'Experience with integration' addressed participants ' own perception of their work, including challenges and barriers that they have encountered. A model is proposed that brings together these themes and illustrates participants' integrative efforts. A central im plication of this research is that integration cannot be removed from and appropr iated outside its intricate context. The findings are discussed with regard to providing adequate psychological services for Aboriginal clients. Broader implications for the role of culturally-grounded helping approaches in the mainstre am mental healthcare system are also addressed. 54. Traditional healers and healing practices in Nepal Prasad Pathak, Associate Professor, Tribhuwan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Nepalese traditional healers are known as Dhami/Jhakris and they act as mediators between the material world and the world of spirits. The healing traditions in Nepal are: 1. Ayurveda: the traditional health care providers are known as ayurvedic physicians who use elixirs, metal preparations and herbs to treat illness. 2. Tibetan Medicine: Known as Amchis . They use mountainous herbs in the treatment. 3. Faith Healing: They are supposed to diagnose the ty pe of spirit and either make an offering and placate the spirit or suck the offending spirit from the patient's body using a spirit bone usually the human femur. The ritual often also involves th e sacrifice of either a rooster or a black goat. The Nepal government has started hospitals of trad itional medicines. Our study showed that traditional healers are familiar with the social and cultural b ackground of the people, are accessible and respected. Our study included 150 patients (2003-2008) affected by various psychosomatic disorders. The study showed that modern medicine failed in conditions where behavioral, emo tional or spiritual factors had an important causative role. The study concludes that though allopathic medicines can address the symptoms of disease, only traditional medicine can heal conditi ons which can be traced to social or spiritual disorders. A closer collaboration between allopathic and traditional medical systems if properly organized can be of benefit to all concerned. Traditional healer s should also be made aware of modern allopathic practices and greater integration between the two systems in health care delivery is essential. PAPER SESSION THREE Room 2-213 23 55. Latinos and traditional healing: Countertransf erence conflicts to integrate healing practices and psychotherapy Ruth Lijtmaer, Ph.D., Faculty, Fairleigh Dickinson University, New Jersey Latino and non-Latino culturally sens itive therapists have responded to the dominant literature regarding spirituality, altar-making and folk healing, by highli ghting its cultural relevance, and its function as an adaptive strategy in situations of social and emoti onal stress. Spirituality differs from organized religion because it transcends religious affiliation. As a way of life, it helps many Latinos to deepen their sense of meaning and purpose. Illness is perceived as a nemesis of imbalance and the main goal of spirituality is \"sanacion\" (healing). Altar-making can help people expl ore spiritual themes in their lives, cope with bereavement and grief, help clients remember thei r loved ones and memorialize the living, among other functions. Latino healers invoke the help of spirits, sai nts and/or deities. They also prescribe remedies, herbs, prayers, and rituals. Because many individua ls experience regression when becoming ill, healing frequently requires mothering and nurturing. As part of alternative medicine, folk healing has an underlying assumption of spirituality that provides sufferers with a participatory experience of empowerment, authenticity, and enlarged self-identity when illness threatens thei r sense of intactness and connection to the world. A clinical vignette will hi ghlight a therapist's struggles to integrate traditional healing practices, the biomedical model and psychotherapy in a physically ill patient. 56. Traditional healing and psychotherapy in Togo Lonzozou Kpanake, Postdoctoral Fellow, McGill University In Africa, mental disorders are attributed to the activities of external causes su ch as evil spirits, attacks from witches, enemies and the deities. Over the years, mental health professionals in Togo (West Africa) employing predominantly Western forms of psychother apy find tensions and contradictions emerging between their own professional psychological theories and the mental illness understandings assumed by the patients consulting them. However, the traditional healers known by such names as nganga , boko , and koedu have been found to carry out practices of ps ychotherapeutic values that are more culturally accepted by people. In this paper, an African psychologist observed and interviewed two well-known traditional healers in villages in Togo to understand their therapeutic interventions. A large number of such practices were found to be of psychotherapeutic importance throug h the manipulation of the clients' cultural environment, prescription of symbolic rites, and integration of psyche, soma, and often the entire community. Such a therapy stresses the whole person' s change, rather than to produce an internal reorganization of the person's self. The need to inco rporate such holistic treatment into mental-health care in the country for the benefits of patients was emphasized. 57. Working with client's experience of shame: Lessons from traditional healing David Chiu, Graduate Student, University of British Columbia Marvin Westwood, Professor, University of British Columbia Marla Buchanan, Associate Professor, University of British Columbia Clients' affective experiences can both facilitate and hi nder the therapeutic process. In particular, clients who experience shame may withhold distressing aspect s of their lives from their therapist. Where psychotherapeutic approaches often place a high premium on verbal, emotional and behavioural expressiveness, and open and intimate disclosure, many significant and perhaps central client concerns may go unnoticed. Shame is therefore a focal determin ant of therapeutic outcomes that requires careful attention. This meta-theoretical paper considers how traditional Chinese and Aboriginal teachings may 24inform our therapeutic work with shame. To better understand ways of working with shame in psychotherapy, we examine research on the various antecedents of shame in different cultures. In traditional Chinese and Aboriginal cultures, shame ope rates as a form of social governance. Deviant behaviour is subject to public shaming by the culture . Shame is therefore a socio-cultural phenomenon. Its experience is intensified by the presence of an audi ence, whether actual or merely perceived. Given the cultural context in which shame originates, we argue that it can only be truly subjugated through cultural witnessing and validation. To illustrate this point , examples from traditional Chinese and Aboriginal teachings and methods of healing - including healing circles and lodges, public penitence, connecting with the cultural community - are examined. The imp lications of such practices for working with shame in psychotherapy are discussed. 58. Finding a path: An integrative model of Indigenous and Western mental health and healing Teresa Beaulieu, MA Candidate, University of Toronto Katherine Leblanc, Social Worker, Toronto Althea Prescod, Nurse, Toronto The experience of most First Nations people in Cana da is one of being caught between two worlds. The traditional understandings and approaches towards mental health inherent in Indigenous paradigms can be starkly different from the assumptions of the Euro-C anadian paradigm. Counsellors working with First Nations people must assist the client in forging a relationship between the two philosophies, through incorporating models and methods of care from each . A new model of integrated healing is presented, beginning with a traditional worldview, and blending in Western methodologies as appropriate. 59. Circle power: Integrating traditional form s of group work with counselling psychology curriculum Maura McIntyre, Adjunct Professor, University of Toronto In teaching a Master's level course on group work in counselling I position two group techniques based on Native American Healing Circles at the forefront of the curriculum as both readings and as experiential learning opportunities. The first is based in the traditi onal form of the Talking Circle; the second is based in the Inner Circle/Outer Circle. Assisting students to understand that the history of healing in groups began with Native peoples long before the discip lines of social work, counselling psychology and psychiatry were even established, and that that histor y has much to teach us about working with people in groups, is a necessary precursor to studying contempor ary group work approaches. The in-class rendering of the Talking Circle and the Inner Circle/Outer Circle allows students first hand experience with some of the personal, social, environmental and spiritual as pects of how groups are used for healing in First Nations culture. Understanding the power of the circle as a ceremonial site, the purposes of smudging, the discipline engendered by a talking stick, the potency of listening and silence and the elegance of the round-robin approach allow us as a class to both honour the tradition and experience the effectiveness of this traditional group work methodology. In this pape r I will detail the ways that I integrate these traditional forms of group work with the remainder of the group work curriculum and describe some of the successes, issues and pedagogical challenges that have emerged through the practice of this approach. PAPER SESSION 4 Room 2-286 25 60. Indigenous Polynesian counselling and the denial of death Keith Morrison, Rev. Dr., St. Isaac House of Prayer, New Zealand Indigenous Polynesian counselling addresses contradicti on and tension, and transforms them into ecstatic creativity attuned to recognition of primal reciprocit y. Reciprocity is recognized as operating at several levels: the personal, the social and the cosmic. Reci procity is seen as healthy life that is essentially eternal. Two types of \"counselling\" operate: the first can be considered to be preventative health-care and involve rituals practices to facilitate ecstatic self-tra nscendence into reciprocity through dance, trance and hysteria; and the second, health care to recover lost health/ reciprocity involving expressive dialogue and exorcism of subliminal conditioning. In all of these practices, death is normalized by being incorporated into the narrative through the spiritual realm of an cestors being made present along with the divine. The healer has divine authority that unites the material and spiritual realms and hence transcends death and its denial; hence also the source of tension and contradictions, 61. Tobacco ties: The relationship of 'the sacred' in research Jean -Paul Restoule, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto Debby Danard Wilson, Ph.D.. Candidate, University of Toronto In this proposed paper presentation, we are inspired to raise consciousness of the (spiritual) power of tobacco in a modern context and the responsibility of using tobacco as a research methodology. By sharing her own traditional knowledge and experience of using tobacco as a research methodology Debby hopes to bridge this cultural divide between traditi onal Aboriginal and euro-centric knowledge and ways of knowing. This presentation reviews our experien ces (journeys) of engaging in research that uses tobacco as a research protocol for eliciting information from Elders and Traditiona l People. Our learning emerged from a quite different beginning place. Jean-Paul 's initial project goal in 2006 was to speak to Aboriginal traditional teachers and Elders and identify how their cultural teachings and traditions might be applied to the development of res earch relationships and ethical protoc ols. It was anticipated that the results of this project would complement the po licy work undertaken by the Panel on Research Ethics Task Force Committee on Aboriginal Research (P RE-TACAR) to find existing Aboriginal community protocols and consult with Aboriginal researchers, communities, and people to develop more specific and suitable guidelines for the Tri Council Policy Statement on Ethical Research involving humans, particularly Section 6 on Aboriginal peoples. 62. Indigenous notions of mental illness in rural South Africa Tholene Sodi, Head of Department, University of Venda, South Africa Several studies have found that up to 70 percent of South Africans consult traditional healers at some point in their lives. The aim of this paper is: (i). to give a critical review of the literature on Indigenous healing and the treatment procedures that are used by tr aditional healers in South Africa and (ii) to present two Indigenous healers' explanations of a condition regarded as a state of social pollution. Known as \"senyama\" or \"sefifi\" (loosely translated to mean dar kness) this condition is believed to result in bad luck and experiences of ill health that can even lead to d eath. The paper is concluded by suggesting that there are definite psychological and public health dimensions associated w ith \"senyama\" and related culture conditions. 63. Japanese Indigenous knowledge and traditional healing 26Yumiko Kawano, MA candidate, University of Toronto By exploring \"Kototama\", an Indigenou s knowledge of Japan, it is clearly seen that all human beings can be \"medicine\". \"Kototama\" means that words carry our thoughts in their vibration. \"Kototama\"describes the heard and unheard vibrations we are always producing, whether through speaking or thinking. Furthermore, Kototoma describes the intimate relations hip between the material or physical world and these vibrating energies. In recent experiments conduct ed in Japan, the nature of \"Kototama\" was made visible: when water that had been exposed to the vibrations of various words and thoughts was frozen, the ice crystals formed regular or irregular patterns, refl ecting the positive or negative energy of the words. If it is acknowledged that about 70 percent of our body consists of water, we cannot then deny that the vibrations transmitted through our words and thoughts affect the well being of our physical bodies. In fact, many Indigenous communities all over the world a pply the power of words to their healing practices and recognized the healing qualities of water. In this presentation, I would like to show that every person has healing power and that this power depends on how aware we are of our strength. Moreover, I interrogated why these kinds of Indigenous knowledge has been marginalized, particularly in the academy, yet has persisted through over thousands of years by being passed down between generations. PAPER SESSION 5 Room 2-296 64. African Indigenous ways of healing: A Kenyan case study Njoki Wane, Associate Professor, University of Toronto Ancient African healing practices were founded upon holistic approach es, grounded on spiritual guidance embodied in Creator, the giver of life, harmony, balan ce, cosmic order, peace, and healing. To begin to make sense of healing practices in Africa one needs to understand the worldview of the African people and the complexities of each culture. As more and more people begin to embrace alternative modes of healing, this renaissance aids the mainstream thi nking by incorporating alternate knowledges to our non- holistic approaches, while concurrently aiding in the rebirth of self-dignity and self-worth among the holders of the old way. This presentation is based on an on-going research: Ethno-Medicine Practices in Seven Provinces in Kenya . The data presented reveal that Indigen ous healing practices have survived in spite of popularization of Western medical practices. In addition, these practices do not only involve work that only corrects the internal imbalances through wh ich disease can manifest within an individual, but emphasizes the re-establishment of individual harmony with their environment and their relationship with the natural cycles to which all life is subject to. 65. Application of Morita therapy for the treatm ent of male offenders of intimate violence and abuse Yoshiyuki Takano, Ph.D. Candidate, University of British Columbia This presentation examines the application of Japanes e traditional psychotherapy, Morita therapy (Morita, 1960) to the current treatment program for male offe nders who are abusive to their partners. Morita therapy has been in practice for over 50 years in Ja pan and has been applied in North American culture with success for over 20 years (Ishiyama, 1990). The application of Morita therapy will help men who are violent and abusive to their partners in two ways. First, Morita therapy w ill help them understand that uncomfortable feelings or \"inconvenient feelings\" (Ish iyama, 1990), such as anxiety, insecurity, and fears in their lives are a natural part of existential experien ces, and help them realize that these feelings are the manifestation of a desire for constructive living that could help them take actions in spite of their emotional states (Takano & Ishiyama, 2008). Second, Mo rita therapy can also a ddress the fact that men 27who are violent often have well-intentioned desires but make misguided efforts to build relationships (Jenkins, 1990). It emphasizes this discrepancy and helps men understand their yearnings for themselves and the relationships, and to take responsibility in making constructive efforts to build respectful relationship (Takano & Ishiyama, 2008). This appli cation of Japanese traditional Morita therapy is significant and holds great promise for effectiveness as a treatment modality for men who are violent and abusive to their partners, and works effectively esp ecially with Cognitive behavioural and invitational approaches. This will give counsellors and therapis ts more tools to draw from to promote engagement with men and to encourage them to ta ke responsibility for their actions. 66. Invoking the container: Using Reiki in the practice of psychotherapy Jill Lazenby, Associated Scholar, University of Toronto Reiki is a gentle and easy-to-learn energy-based heal ing modality from Japan. Both hands-on and distance healing methods are used to enhance a balancing flow of \"ki\" or life force energy, for physical, mental and emotional healing. This presentation focuses on how psychotherapists might use the methods of Reiki to both generate and reinforce the healing \"container\" in therapy. C oncrete examples and suggestions will be offered from the experience of a Jungian-inspire d psychotherapist who is also a practicing Reiki master. 67. Shielded minds: The paradox of youthful leadership Cynthia C. Wesley-Esquimaux, Faculty, University of Toronto Steven Koptie, MEd Candidate, University of Toronto The concept of Shielded Minds speaks to how the current relationshi p between Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state has been deliberately constructed to keep the current Aboriginal/Canadian Government political and social status quo \"upfront and working\" on behalf of entrenched federal and provincial policy objectives and to keep Indige nous populations across Canada at a peculiar disadvantage. Aboriginal people in Canada are poised on the edge of the 21st century armed with a traditional knowledge base, rapidly reconstructi ng cultural values and practices, na tional reclamation of languages, undeveloped on-reserve lands and human resources, and a growing demographic of potential young leaders. This paper looks to Aboriginal and no n-Aboriginal youth as the source of an emerging \"deep practice\" leadership model forming out of an ac tion based hybridized Indigenous framework for leadership and reconciliation called the Canadian R oots Exchange (CRE). The next steps for the Canadian Roots Exchange team and their cultura l and academic guide (me) will be outlined to demonstrate why this cultural leadership model might be considered as an exemplary model of Indigenous or \"wise practices\" in action. Finally, this paper will highlight the current state of youth engagement in Canada, especially in regards to A boriginal youth across this country, and examine the roadblocks, successes and the challenges, and the fa ilures of policy and practice when it comes to nurturing and supporting specific kinds of youthful \"deep practice\" leadership initiatives. PANEL PRESENTATION 28INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL HE ALING INTO COUNSELLING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY OISE Library 68. Challenges to integration of traditional he aling practices into counselling and psychotherapy Niyi Bojuwoye, Ph.D., University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa Arguments for the integration of tr aditional healthcare with Western-oriented healthcare practices seem to far outweigh those against it. The general contention is that integration would make healthcare practices more culturally relevant or context sensitive and ther efore more acceptable to people and at a cost they can afford. Moreover, since actual health seeking be haviours of Indigenous people also suggest high confidence around the practices of traditional healthcare, integration has great promise for optimization of resources through multiple approaches to healthcare pr actices which make for pooling of both cultural and Western oriented resources and I ndigenous knowledge relevant to e ffective health promotion. This way integration would be community-oriented, en suring full participation of people who would be empowered and be capable of taking responsibility for improving their own lives. However, while integration may be said to have very bright prospects, it is not without its challenges. A major constraint to integration is the disrespect and the negative a ttitudes to traditional healthcare by Western oriented practitioners. Traditional healthcare practices are percei ved to be characterized by incorrect diagnosis, imprecise dosage, low hygiene standard and with methods shrouded in secrecy, as well as, the absence of written records about patients. While the paper discusses these constraints in detail, it concludes that the challenges are not insurmountable. Some suggestions as to how the challenges can be overcome are offered. 69. Integrating Eastern spirituality & Western psychotherapy: Promise & pitfalls Waseem Alladin, Psy. D., Clinical Psychologist, United Kingdom There is much that is good and much that is questio nable in new age spirituality . What is needed is a model of spirituality for psychotherapy and mind-bod y medicine which allows practitioners to include spirituality in their work in a sound, integrated a nd meaningful way. The Bolletino model is used as a framework since it applies equally to believers, atheists and agnostics. Thus, spirituality is more than just believing in something: it is the way we look at th e world that is expressed in the way we live and the way we experience our lives. This approach is also compatible with humanistic and existential approaches to psychotherapy as it is with the newer forms of cognitive behavioural therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness based approaches. Ultimately, there are existential questions we are all concerned about : Why am I here? What am I doing with my life? Where am I going? But we rarely ask these questions until calamity such as death approaches or adversity strikes. Then we ask: Why me? Why now ? Why this? Only by embracing a more robust and sound spirituality and integrating it into psychotherapy can we claim to be empowering, enhancing and enabling both ourselves and our clients.

One of the key objectives of the centre is to facilita te research and scholarship on the integration and intersection of various marginalized identities so that counselling and psychotherapy can be conducted through a paradigm of multiple identities irrespective of particular counselling approaches. The centre is well positioned to undertake this mission as the major ity of the faculty is already undertaking research and teaching in the various areas of diversity, and th is expertise forms the basis for further research through funded and non-funded projects. The interdisciplinary nature of the centre and the engagement of faculty collaboration promote a rich environment and a creative clinical niche within whic h graduate students can be nurtured. This exposure to discourses of cultural differences juxtaposed with a variety of holistic approaches to psychotherapy forms a critical base for the study of diversity in counselling.
