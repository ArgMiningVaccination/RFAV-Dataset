During the visit we get to talk and a detailed history will be taken. Appropriate physical exams will be done and helpful laboratory tests may be ordered. This is often adequate time for a discussion, counseling, and an initial treatment plan. Herbal formulas, supplements, exercises, dietary instruction, and homeopathic remedies may be prescribed. Follow up naturopathic appointments typically will be a 25 or 45 minute office visit. Extended time return appointments for patients with many health concerns may be as long as 75 or 90 minutes in certain circumstances.

Traditional Chinese herbal formula(s) may be recommended. Follow up acupuncture appointments typically last 45 or 60 minutes. It often takes multiple treatments before graduating to a maintenance program. Acupuncture opens up the flow of energy (Qi) and blood, allowing your body to heal. This takes time. It may take several treatments before you note progress, this is normal for many people. Some people (those lucky ones!) are quite responsive and will notice improvement after one or two visits- but this is not the norm. Moxa, Gua-Sha, and/or Cupping may be done if indicated. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is an ancient medicine originating in China, dating back at least 2500 years. It is one of the oldest and longest enduring healthcare systems in the world. Chinese medicine, which includes: acupuncture, herbal medicine, nutrition, meditation, and massage, is a holistic medicine, which means that a person's physical body, as well as their mind and spirit, are treated. The whole person and their circumstances are taken into account to gain insight into their condition. Chinese medicine practitioners diagnose a person to find imbalances and focus on preventing illness as well as treating illness. How Does an Acupuncturist Determine Treatment? Chinese medicine practitioners carefully diagnose their patients by looking for signs of health and dysfunction. The practitioner pays attention to the patient's presenting signs and symptoms, medical history, review of systems, general constitution, palpation of the body and abdomen, and evaluation of the pulse and tongue to determine how to best treat. What actually happens during an Acupuncture treatment? Acupuncture treatment involves inserting very fine, sterile (one-time use) needles into sites on the body (acupuncture points). These acupuncture points are where neural pathways and blood vessels and capillaries accumulate. The stimulation of these points accesses the nervous system, circulatory system, endocrine system and other subtle communication systems in our bodies. What should I expect from acupuncture treatment? Acupuncture provides drug-free pain relief, regulates the nervous system and provides feelings of deep relaxation. It is an excellent preventative medicine, effectively treats numerous acute and chronic ailments, treats the root cause of disease as well as the presenting symptoms, and holistically treats a person's mind, body, and emotions. Is acupuncture treatment effective? There are many conditions for which Acupuncture treatments have been tested in controlled clinical trials and reported effective in recent literature. The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented these trials and they are available for review on their site. "}
