For me, and the majority of parents in this country, childhood immunisations are a rite of passage. Sure, we do our research before booking them in, but rapidly realise that any side effects pale into insignificance compared with the alternative - living in a country where children catch diseases we've thankfully only witnessed in period dramas since the wonders of immune science all but eradicated them. However, a small but vocal minority of parents are ignoring the facts and advice laid out in their trusty red book and opting out of the vaccine system altogether. And despite their own reliance on herd immunity to protect their children from serious illness, they're attempting to persuade other vulnerable new parents to follow their lead. But thanks to social media, it's no longer just casual chat by the swings: instead, anti-vaxxers are hitting up online parenting groups in their thousands to share false information about the risks of vaccination. In 1998, when Andrew Wakefield made the news with his now infamous research paper claiming that there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism (along with Crohns disease), social media didn't exist and we largely turned to our GPs, health visitors and own friends and family for advice and reassurance on all things parenting. By 2004, the paper had been officially discredited and in 2010, Wakefield was struck off from practicing medicine in the UK. And yet, more than 20 years on from its publication, his \"research\" is still routinely shared on social media, along with many other spurious claims from mysterious sources, for instance a supposed correlation between newborn vaccinations and the age when babies are most at risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). These claims have no scientific basis, but instantly strike fear in the hearts of vulnerable new parents who will do anything to protect their little ones from harm. [At Mush, the social app for mums](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/relationships/meet-women-set-mush-new-tinder-mums/) where I work as editor, we're working hard to [ clamp down on anti-vaxxers](https://letsmush.com/protecting-mums-anti-vax-scaremongering/). Many new parents post on our forums seeking reassurance about taking their babies for their first round of jabs - after all, no matter how seriously you take the science, it's still absolutely no fun seeing your innocent newborn getting poked with a series of needles. However, instead of the sisterly solidarity and Calpol banter they were hoping for, parents are increasingly finding themselves confronted with anti-vax propaganda; sometimes links to dodgy but official-looking websites and sometimes just questionable anecdotal evidence. To combat this and protect new parents, we now remove all anti-vax comments as well as blocking users who appear to have signed up only to spread this message. Mush isn't the only social network taking a stand: Facebook too are now reportedly working with health experts to consider their approach in handling vaccine misinformation. A quick Facebook search shows they'll have their work cut out: there are dozens of groups with names like Parents Against Vaccination and Natural Health Anti-Vaxx Community, which have racked up tens of thousands of members. Many of the members of these groups then infiltrate much larger general parenting groups to spread their \"natural\" and \"holistic\" views. In the darker corners of the web, some are even operating coordinated online attacks on prominent pro-vax experts, bombarding them with abuse and bad reviews designed to wreck their credibility. Unfortunately, anti-vax chat seems to be an epidemic in its own right that's having a frightening effect on childhood illnesses around the world; the latest NHS research shows that in 2018, the uptake of the MMR jab fell for the fourth year running, and is currently sitting at around 91pc with measles outbreaks rising across the UK and Europe. Worldwide, one child still dies every 20 seconds from a vaccine preventable disease. Aware that most parents simply don't have time to read the detailed scientific papers that would give them the confidence to vaccinate, The British Society of Immunology has released simple, social media friendly [infographics ](https://www.immunology.org/public-information/all-about-vaccines/vaccine-infographics)laying out the importance of vaccines in the hope of reversing the worrying trend. The Society's president, Professor Arne Akbar, says: \"Vaccination saves lives. It is one of the safest and most cost-effective methods we have to prevent the spread of disease. By vaccinating your child, you not only protect them as an individual from contracting these nasty diseases, but you also stop the disease spreading within your community. This shields vulnerable individuals, for example young babies, people with cancer and the elderly, from coming into contact with the disease. \"To ensure that everyone in our society continues to benefit from the protection that vaccines offer, we need to redouble efforts to ensure that immunisation services are accessible and that parents have ready access to reliable, evidence-based information on vaccination.\" Of course, becoming a parent is an emotional, overwhelming and confusing time full of difficult choices. The vaccination dilemma is one of the big ones, but there are also thousands of parents online who are just as passionate and vocal about contentious personal issues such as early weaning, formula feeding, co-sleeping, car seat safety, dummies and ear piercing. It's an endless list fraught with the opposing views of loving parents convinced that what's best for their baby is best for everyone else's too. But what we need to remember is that, unlike other parenting dilemmas, vaccinating is not merely a personal choice, it's a national health issue, that's in danger of becoming a national health crisis.
