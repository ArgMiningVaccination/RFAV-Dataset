We even have new scents each season! Other natural brands we carry include Dr. Bronner's, Kiss My Face, and local faves like Oregon Soap Company.

Mnuka honey is honey produced from the nectar of the mnuka tree, prized for its wound-healing and anti-bacterial benefits. Protein Powder Whether you're looking for a breakfast smoothie, filling snack midday, or protein-rich baked goods, we have the plant-based, bone broth/collagen, or whey protein to suit your needs. A Wellness staff member can help you pick the product that's ideal for you.
