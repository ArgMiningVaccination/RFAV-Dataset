Complete protocols for sample preparation, buffer preparation, electrophoresis, staining, and blotting are provided in this guide. For additional information, contact Technical Support (see page 56) or download the manuals from our website at www.invitrogen.com. For description of the NuPAGE \u00ae electrophoresis system, see page 6-7. Storage and Shelf Novex\u00aeBis-Tris Bis-Tris Gels have a shelf life of 12 when stored at 4-25C. The NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate Gels have a shelf life of 8 months when stored at 4 C. Do not freeze NuPAGE\u00ae Gels. Using expired gels or improperly stored gels may result in poor band resolution. Packaging The NuPAGE\u00ae Pre-Cast Gels are individually packaged in clear pouches with 10 mL of Packaging Buffer. Handling the Gels The Packaging Buffer contains low levels of residual acrylamide monomer and 0.02% sodium azide. Gloves should be worn at all time when handling gels. Warning: This product contains a chemical (acrylamide) known to the state of California to cause cancer. To obtain a SDS, see page 56. Intended Use For research use only. Not intended for human or animal diagnostic or therapeutic uses. 5 Description of the NuPAGE\u00ae Electrophoresis System Introduction The NuPAGE\u00ae Bis-Tris Electrophoresis System revolutionary neutral pH, pre-cast, discontinuous SDS-PAGE mi ni-gel system providing maximum stability of both proteins and gel matrix during electrophoresis, and better band resolution than other gel systems. The most widely used gel system for se parating a broad range of proteins by SDS-PAGE is the Laemmli system (Laemmli, 1970). The highly alkaline operating pH of the Laemmli system may cause band distortion, loss of resolution, or artifact bands. The major causes of poor band resolution with the Laemmli system are: Hydrolysis of polyacrylamide at the high gel casting pH of 8.7 resulting in a short shelf life of 4-6 weeks Chemical modifications such as deamination and alkylation of proteins due to the high pH (9.5) of the separating gel Reoxidation of reduced disulfides from cysteine containing proteins as the redox state of the gel is not constant Cleavage of Asp-Pro bond of the proteins when heated at 100 C in the Laemmli sample buffer, pH 5.2 (Kubo, 1995). Advantages of the NuPAGE\u00ae Electrophoresis System The neutral operating pH (pH 7.0) of the NuPAGE\u00ae Gels and buffers provide following advantages over the Laemmli system: Longer shelf life of 8-12 months due to improved gel stability (see page 5) Im proved protein stability during electrophoresis at neutral pH resulting in sharper band resolution and accurate results (Moos et al, 1998) Complete reduction of disulfides under mild heating conditions (70 C for 10 minutes) and absence of cleavage of Asp-Pro bonds using the NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample buffer (pH >7.0 at 70 C) Reduced state of the proteins main tained during electrophoresis and blotting of the proteins when using the NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant NuPAGE\u00ae Electrophoresis proteins NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate Pre-Cast Gels for separating large molecular weight proteins NuPAGE\u00ae LDS (Lithium dodecyl sulfate) Sample NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gels Continued on next page 6 the NuPAGE\u00ae Electrophoresis System, Continued NuPAGE\u00ae Bis-Tris Discontinuous Buffer involves three ions: Chloride () from the gel buffer and serves as a leading ion due to its high affinity to the anode relative to other anions in the system. The gel buffer ions are Bis-Tris+ and Cl (pH 6.4). MES or MOPS () serve as the trailing ion in the running buffer. The running buffer ions are Tris+, MOPS/MES, and dodecylsulfate (pH 7.3-7.7). Bis-Tris (+) is the common ion present in the gel buffer and running buffer. The combination of the lower pH gel buffer (pH 6.4) and the running buffer (pH 7.3-7.7) results in a significantly lower operating pH of 7 during electrophoresis. NuPAGE\u00ae Tris- Acetate Discontinuous Buffer System The buffer system involves three ions: Acetate () from the gel buffer and serves as a leading ion due to its high affinity to the anode relative to other anions in the system. The gel buffer ions are Tris+ and Acetate (pH 7.0). Tricine () from the running buffer serves as the trailing ion. The running buffer ions are Tris+, Tricine, and dodecylsulfate (pH 8.3). Tris (+) is the common ion present in the gel buffer and running buffer. The Tris-Acetate system also operates at a significantly lower operating pH of 8.1 during electrophoresis. Separation Range of Proteins The NuPAGE\u00ae Gels have a wider range of separation on a single gel and also separate proteins evenly through the low and high molecular weight ranges compared to existing gels. Due to these advantages, most proteins are well resolved on one of the five NuPAGE\u00ae gels (see Applications , page 9). By com bining any of the NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with the MES SDS or MOPS SDS Running Buffer, you can obtain six separation ranges for resolving proteins over a wide molecular weight range of 1-200 kDa. The NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate gels resolve proteins molecular weight range of 36-400 kDa. 7 NuPAGE\u00ae Gel Specifications Introduction The NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gel cassette is 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm in size, and designed for use with the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell and XCell6 MultiGel Unit information). NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Bis-Tris Gels are available for resolving 1-200 kDa, and NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast range of 36-400 kDa (depending upon the acrylamide percentage of the gel and buffer system being used). Refer to the Novex\u00ae Gel Migration Charts (page 54) to find the gel with the region of maximum resolution best suited for your sample. Specifications Gel Matrix: Acrylamide/Bisacrylamide Gel Thickness: 1.0 mm Gel Size: 8 cm \u00d7 8 cm Cassette Size: 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm Cassette Material: Styrene Copolymer (recycle code 7) Sample Well Configuration: 1, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17-well, 2D-well, and NuPAGE\u00ae Gel Formulations Pre-Cast Gels are available in different acrylamide concentrations (see the table below). The NuPAGE\u00ae Gels do not contain SDS . However, they are designed for performing denaturing gel electrophoresis (see Applications , next page). Gel Type Formulation Stacking Gel Separating Gel pH NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gel ranges from 3.8-5% depending on the region of the gel. 8 Gel Selection Choosing a NuPAGE\u00ae Gel for Your Application To obtain the best results, it is impo rtant to choose the correct gel percentage, buffer system, gel format, and thickn ess for your application. NuPAGE\u00ae Pre- Cast Gels are compatible with protei n sequencing using Edman sequencing from the gel, or from PVDF membranes. Review Applications (below), and Well Volume (page 10) to determine the type of gel that is best su ited for your application. R efer to the NuPAGE\u00ae Gel Migration Chart (page 54) to find the gel with the regi on of maximum resolution best suit ed for your sample. The leading protein molecules should migrate about 70% of th e length of gel for best resolution. Applications Separation of proteins over a wi de range of molecular weights Use NuPAGE\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with NuPAGE\u00ae MOPS SDS Running Buffer to resolve proteins (14-200 kDa) under denaturing conditions. Separation of low molecular weight proteins Use NuPAGE \u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with NuPAGE\u00ae MES SDS Running Buffer Buffer to resolve small molecular weight proteins (2-200 kDa) under denaturing conditions. Separation of high molecular weight proteins Use NuPAGE\u00ae Tris-Acetate Gels with NuPAGE\u00ae Tris-Acetate SDS Running Buffer to resolve high molecular weight proteins (36-400 kDa) under denaturing conditions, or with Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine Native Running Buffer to resolve high molecular weight protei ns under non-denaturing (native) conditions. Note: Do not use the NuPAGE\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with NuPAGE\u00ae MOPS or MES Running Buffer without SDS for native gel electrophoresis. This buffer system may generate excessive heat resulting in poor band resolution. The protein of interest may not migrate very well in a neutral pH environment if it is not charged. 2D separation of proteins The ZOOM\u00ae Gels are specifically designed for second dimension electrophoresis of 7.0 cm IPG strips. 9 Well Volume Recommended Loading Volumes The recommended loading volumes and protein load per band by the detection method are provided in the table below. Note: The 9- and 17-wells are compatible with any eight-channel pipette used for loading samples from 96-well plates. An additional lane is included for loading protein molecular weight standard. Maximum Protein Load Per Band by Detection Method Well Types Maximum Load Volume Coomassie Staining Silver Staining Immunoblotting /MT49/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 700 L 12 g/band /MT50/MT68/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 1.5 mm 400 L 600 L 12 g/band /MT73/MT80/MT71/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 7 cm IPG Strip N/A /MT57/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 28 L 0.5 g/band /MT49/MT48/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 1.5 mm 25 L 37 L 0.5 g/band /MT49/MT50/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 20 L 0.5 g/band /MT49/MT53/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT108 1.0 mm 1.5 mm 15 L 25 L 0.5 g/band /MT49/MT55/MT32/MT119/MT101/MT108/MT1081.0 mm 15 L 0.5 g/band Scale your sample load for the sensitivity of your silver staining kit. For use with the SilverQuest or SilverXpress \u00ae Silver Staining Kits, we recommend a protein load of 1 ng/band. Scale your sample load according to the sensitivity of your detection method. Choosing the Appropriate Well for Your Application Choose the type of well for your application based upon the volume of your sample. The more wells a comb has, and the thinner the gel is, the lower the sample loading volume. Note: Proteins transfer out of a 1.0 mm gel more easily than from a 1.5 mm gel. 10 Gel Staining Staining NuPAGE\u00ae Gels The most silver staining protocols. We recommend using the SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit or the SilverXpress\u00ae Silver Staining Kit (see pages The NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae with any of the standard Coomassie staining procedures. The protocols that are accelerated by heat are preferable as the heat serves as a \"fix\" for proteins, especially smaller peptides. The SimplyBlue SafeStain and Novex\u00ae Colloidal Coomassie Blue Staining Gels. The NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gels with copper or zinc staining, and fluorescent stains like the SYPRO\u00ae Ruby gel stain (see pages 28- 30) 11 Methods General Guidelines for Samples and Buffers Introduction General information on the sample buffer and reducing agent is provided below. For sample and buffer preparation protocols, see page 14. Instructions for preparing running buffers for denaturing and non-denaturing electrophoresis are provided on page 50-52. Recommended Buffers The recommended running buffer and sample buffer for each NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gel is listed in the table below. Prepare your sample in the appropriate sample buffer so that the final concentrat ion of the sample buffer is 1X. Running buffer must be diluted to 1X final concentration before use. See page 48 for ordering information on pre-mixed buffers. See pages 50-52 for recipes if you are preparing your own buffers. Gel Type Running Buffer Sample Buffer NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gel (SDS-PAGE) NuPAGE\u00ae MES or Tris-Glycine Native Sample Buffer NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer Use the NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer for preparing samples when performing denaturing gel electrophoresis with NuPAGE\u00ae Gels. The slightly alkaline pH of the NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer (pH 8.4) prov ides the optimal conditions for reduction of protein disulfid e bonds, and denaturation. The NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer is a 4X concentrated solution containing twice as much dodecylsulfate as the 2X concentration of Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine SDS or Tricine SDS Sample Buffer. The buffer also contains more glycerol, resulting in increased viscosity. Bring the NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer to room temperature (25\u00b0C) before use to make pipetting the buffer easier. Tracking Dye The NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer uses Coomassie G250 and Phenol Red as tracking dyes instead of bromophenol blue. Coomassie G250 gives a sharp dye front with both MES and MOPS SDS Running Buffers and migrates much closer to the moving ion front than bromophenol blue. Bromophenol blue runs more slowly than some peptides with the MES SDS Running Buffer. This ensures that small peptides do not run off the gel. The concentration of the tracking dye (Coomassie G250) is increased in the NuPAGE \u00ae LDS Sample Buffer to enhance viewing of the dye front. Continued on next page 12 General Guidelines for Samples and Buffers, Continued Reducing Agent Use the NuPAGE\u00ae Reducing Agent to prepare samples for reducing gel electrophoresis. The NuPAGE\u00ae Reducing Agent (10X) contains 500 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and is available in a ready-to-use, stabilized liquid form. As an alternative, -mercaptoethanol can be used with NuPAGE\u00ae Gels at a final concentration of 2.5%. Add the reducing agent to the sample up to an hour before loading the gel. Avoid storing reduced samples for long periods, even if they are frozen. Reoxidation of samples occur during storage and produce inconsistent results. NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant Use the proprietary NuPAGE \u00ae Antioxidant in the running buffer of the Upper (cathode) Buffer Chamber when performing electrophoresis under reducing conditions to prevent sample reoxidation and maintain the proteins in a reduced state. DTT and -mercaptoethanol tend to remain at the top of the gel, and do not co-migrate with the sample in the neutral pH environment of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels. Disulfide bonds are less reactive at neutral pH and less likely to reoxidize than in higher pH systems, but some reoxidization may occur during electrophoresis in the absence of an antioxidant, and cause band diffusion. The NuPAGE \u00ae Antioxidant migrates with the pr oteins during electrophoresis, and protects disulfide bonds and sensit ive amino acids (e.g., methionine and tryptophan) from oxidizing. The NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant is NOT compatible with gel systems other than the NuPAGE\u00ae system because the antioxidant is not efficient at the higher pHs of other gel systems. For best results, use the NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant with reduced and alkylated samples. /MT73/MT109/MT112/MT111/MT114/MT116/MT97/MT110/MT116 Do not use the NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant as a sample reducing agent. The antioxidant is not efficient in reducing di sulfide bonds on its own, and using it to reduce samples results in substantial ba ckground smearing in the lane due to partially reduced bands. NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer Three types of NuPAGE\u00ae Running Buffers are available for denaturing electrophoresis: NuPAGE\u00ae MES Running Buffer is used with NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels to resolve small molecular weight proteins NuPAGE\u00ae MOPS SDS Running Buffer is used with NuPAGE\u00ae Tris Gels to resolve mid-size proteins Buffer is used with NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate Gels to resolve high molecular weight proteins MES has a lower pKa than MOPS, making the NuPAGE\u00ae MES SDS Running Buffer faster than the NuPAGE\u00ae MOPS SDS Running Buffers. The difference in ion migration affects stacking and result s in a difference in protein separation range between these buffers. For native gel electrophoresis with NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate Gels, the 13 Preparing Buffers for Denaturing Electrophoresis Materials Supplied by the User The following reagents are needed to prepare samples for denaturing electrophoresis. Ordering information for pre-mixed buffers is on page 48. If you are preparing your own buffers, recipes are provided on page 50-52. Protein sample Deionized water For Sample Preparation NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer NuPAGE\u00ae Reducing Agent For Running Buffer Preparation NuPAGE \u00ae MES SDS Running Buffer (for small proteins on NuPAGE\u00ae Bis- Tris Gels) NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant Preparing Samples Instructions are provided below to prepare reduced or non-reduced samples for denaturing gel electrophoresis using the NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris or Tris- Acetate Gels. For reduced sample, add the reducing agent immediately prior to electrophoresis to obtain the best results. Reagent Reduced Sample Non-reduced Sample Sample x L x L NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer (4X) 2.5 L 2.5 L NuPAGE\u00ae Reducing Agent (10X) 1 L \u2014 Deionized Water to 6.5 L to 7.5 L Total Volume 10 L 10 L Running Reduced and Non-Reduced Samples For optimal results, we do not recommend running reduced and non-reduced samples on the same gel. If you do choose to run reduced and non-reduced samples on the same gel, follow these guidelines: Do not run reduced and non-reduced samples in adjacent lanes. The reducing agent may have a carry-over e ffect on the non-reduced samples if they are in close proximity. If you are running reduced and non-reduced samples on the same gel, omit the antioxidant (see page 13). The antioxidant will have a deleterious effect on the non-reduced sam ples. The bands will be sharper on NuPAGE\u00ae Gels relative to other gel systems, even without the use of the antioxidant. Continued on next page 14 Preparing Buffers for Denaturing Electrophoresis, Continued Heating Samples Heat the sample for denaturing electrop horesis (reduced or non-reduced) at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes for optimal results. Preparing Running Buffer Use 1X NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer for electrophoresis of denatured samples. Reducing Conditions 1. Prepare 1,000 mL of Running Buffer as follows: 20X NuPAGE \u00ae SDS Running Buffer (MES, MOPS, or Tris-Acetate) 50 mL Deionized Water 950 mL Total Volume 1,000 ml 2. Mix thoroughly and set aside 800 mL of the 1X NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer for use in the Lower (Outer) Buffer Chamber of the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell. 3. Add 500 L of NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant to 200 mL of 1X NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer from Step 1 for use in the Upper (Inner) Buffer Chamber of the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell just prior to starting electrophoresis. Mix thoroughly. Non-Reducing Conditions 1. Prepare 1,000 mL of Running Buffer as follows: 20X NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer (MES or MOPS) 50 mL Deionized Water 950 mL Total Volume 1,000 mL 2. Mix thoroughly. Fill the Upper and Lower Buffer Chamber of the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell with this Running Buffer. If the antioxidant is not added to the Upper Buffer Chamber, reoxidation of proteins during electrophoresis may cause certain bands to appear more diffuse. Prepare Running Buffer for the upper chamber with the antioxidant no longer than half an hour before use. Antioxidant diluted in Running Buffer looses effectiveness over time, resulting in gels that exhibit signs of reoxidation (slightly fuzzier bands). If 0.5 mL of antioxidant is added to the total amount of Running Buffer (for Upper and Lower Buffer Chambers) by accident, the amount of antioxidant falls below the effective concentration. Additional antioxidant can be added to increase the concentration (2.5 mL antioxidant in 1 L Running Buffer), but this is not recommended because high current is generated and the antioxidant in the Lower Buffer Chamber is wasted. 15 Preparing Buffers for Non-Denaturing Electrophoresis Materials Supplied by the User The following reagents are needed to prepare samples for non-denaturing electrophoresis Novex\u00ae Tris-Acetate Gels. Ordering information for pre-mixed buffers is on page 48. If you are preparing your own buffers, recipes a re provided on page 51-52. Protein sample Deionized water For Sample Preparation Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine Native Sample Buffer For Running Buffer Preparation Novex \u00ae Tris-Glycine Native Running Buffer Preparing Samples for Instructions are provided below to prep are samples for non-denaturing (native) Native Sample Buffer (2X) 5 L Deionized Water to 5 L Total Volume 10 L Do not heat samples for non-denaturing (native) electrophoresis. Preparing Running Buffer Use 1X Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine Native Running Buffer for electrophoresis of samples under non-denaturing (native) conditions. 1. Prepare 1,000 mL Native Running Buffer as follows: Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine Native Running Buffer (10X) 100 mL Deionized Water 900 mL Total Volume 1,000 mL 2. Mix thoroughly and use 800 mL of this Running Buffer in the Lower and Upper Buffer Chambers of the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell. Continued on next page 16 Electrophoresis of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels Introduction Instructions are provided below of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels using the XCell information on the XCell SureLock Mini- Cell, refer to the manual (IM-9003). This manual is available on our website at www.invitrogen.com or contact Technical Support (see page 56). If you are using any other electrophoresi s m ini-cell, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. /MT73/MT109/MT112/MT111/MT114/MT116/MT97/MT110/MT116 To ensure success with the NuPAGE\u00ae Electrophoresis System, remember the important points listed below: Wear protective gloves and safety glasses when handling gels. Under no circumstances should Tris-G lycine SDS buffers be used with NuPAGE\u00ae Gels for any denaturing gel electrophoresis (see page 46-47 for the outcome of your results using incorrect buffers). Only use NuPAGE\u00ae SDS buffers (see page 12). DO NOT BOIL sam ples. Heat samples at 70 C for 10 minutes (see page 15). Inner and Outer Buffer Cham bers must be filled with the recommended amount of running buffer to prevent excessive heating (see below). Procedure using XCell SureLock Mini-Cell XCell SureLock Mini-Cell require 200 mL for the Upper Buffer Chamber and 600 mL for the Lower Buffer Chamber. 1. Remove the NuPAGE\u00ae Gel from the pouch. 2. Rinse the gel cassette with deionized water. Peel off the tape from the bottom of the cassette. 3. Gently pull the comb out of the cassette in one smooth motion. 4. Rinse the sample wells with 1X NuPAGE\u00ae SDS Running Buffer. Invert the gel and shake to remove the buffer. Repeat two more times. 5. Orient the two gels in the Mini-Cell such that the notched \"well\" side of the cassette faces inwards toward the Buffer Core. Seat the gels on the bottom of the Mini-Cell and lock into place with the Gel Tension Wedge. Refer to the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell manual (IM-9003) for detailed instructions. Note: If you are running just one gel, us e the plastic Buffer Dam in place of the second gel cassette to form the Upper Buffer Chamber. 6. Fill the Upper Buffer Chamber with a small amount of the Running Buffer to check for tightness of seal. If you detect a leak from Upper to the Lower Buffer Chamber, discard the buffer, reseal the chamber, and check the seal again. 7. Once the seal is tight, fill the Upper Buffer Chamber (Inner) with the appropriate 1X Running Buffer. The buffer level must exceed the level of the wells. Continued on next page 17 Electrophoresis of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels, Continued Procedure using XCell SureLock Mini-Cell, continued Note: If you are running reduced samples, remember to fill the Upper Buffer Chamber with 200 mL of running buffer containing the NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant (see page 15). 8. Load an ap propriate volume of sample at the desired protein concentration onto the gel (see page 10 for recommended loading volumes). 9. Load appropriate protein molecular weight markers (see page 48 for ordering information). 10. Fill t he Lower (Outer) Buffer Chamber with 600 mL of the appropriate 1X Running Buffer. Electrophoresis Conditions Run your gels according to the following table: Gel Type Voltage Expected Current* Run Time NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with MES End: 7 mA/gel ~2 hours Run times may vary Recommended voltage for 9 and 17-well gels is 150-175 volts Procedure for NuPAGE\u00ae Turbo Protocol An optional accelerated process is available for achieving excellent separation and resolution in only 25 minutes when using NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels with MES SDS Running Buffer. The voltage is set at 250 V constant with an expected current of 130-150 mA per gel, and a run time of 25 minutes. Continued on next page 18 Opening Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast Gel Cassettes Removing the Gel after electrophoresis 1. After electrophoresis is complete, shut off the power, disconnect electrodes, and remove gel(s) from the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell. 2. Separate each of the three bonded side s of the cassette by inserting the Gel Knife into the gap between the two plastic plates that make up the cassette. The notched (\"well\") side of the cassette should face up. 3. Push down gently on the knife handle to separate the plates. Repeat on each side of the cassette until th e plates are completely separated. Caution : Use caution while inserting the Gel Knife between the two plates to avoid excessive pressure on the gel. 4. Carefully remove and discard the top plate, allowing the gel to rest on the bottom (slotted) plate. 5. If blotting, proceed to page 34 without removing the gel from the bottom plate. 6. If staining, remove the gel from the plate by one of the methods: Use the sharp edge of the Gel Knife to remove the gel foot from the bottom of the gel. Hold the Gel Knife at a 90\u00b0 angle, perpendicular to the gel a nd the slotted half of the cassette. Push down on the knife, and then repeat the motion across the gel to cut off the entire foot. Hold the plate and gel over a container with the gel facing downward and use the knife to carefully loosen one lower corner of the gel and allow the gel to peel away from the plate. Hold the plate and gel over a container with the gel facing downward. Gently push the Gel Knife through the slot in the cassette, until the gel peels away from the plate. Cut the gel foot off of the gel after fixing and staining, but before drying. 7. Fix and stain the gel as described on pages 20-27. 19 Silver Staining Introduction Instructions are provided below for silver staining the NuPAGE\u00ae Gels using the SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit and the SilverXpress\u00ae Silver Staining Kit (see page 49 for ordering information). If you are using any other silver stai ning kit, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. The NuPAGE\u00ae system is more effective in re ducing proteins and maintaining proteins in their reduced state. This may cause any minor contaminants present in the protein to be more visible under the sensitive silver staining techniques with the NuPAGE\u00ae system than in other systems.

Advantages of SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Staining SYPRO\u00ae Ruby provides the following advantages: Linear quantitation range of ov er three orders of magnitude Compatible with subsequent analysis of proteins by Edmanbased sequencing or mass spectromet ry in 1D Compatible with nondenaturing gels and IEF gels (basic protocol) Molecular Weight Calibration Guidelines and apparent molecular weight values for Novex\u00ae protein molecular weight standards are provided on page 43. Materials Supplied by the User Staining containers, 1 per gel (see below for details) Reagent-grade methanol Reagent-grade glacial acetic acid Trichloroacetic acid (for IEF gels only) Ultrapure water (18 megohm-cm recommended) Rotary shaker Powder-free latex or vinyl gloves Microwave oven (700-1200 W) (optional) Water bath set at 80\u00b0C (optional) /MT82/MT69/MT67/MT79/MT77/MT77/MT69/MT78/MT68/MT65/MT84/MT73/MT79/MT78 General considerations for the protocol include the following: Perform all fixation, staining, and wa shing steps with continuous, gentle agitation (e.g., on an orbital shaker at 50 rpm) We recommend polypropylene or polyca rbonate containers for staining. Glass dishes are not recommended. Staining containers should be meticulously clean to minimize contamination and other artifacts For convenience, gels may be left in fix solution overnight or longer For convenience, gels may be left in SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain indefinitely without overstaining, although speckling artifacts tend to increase over time As with any fluorescent stain, cover the gel container during staining and subsequent wash steps to exclude light Continued on next page 28 SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Staining, Continued Preparing Solutions for SYPRO \u00ae Ruby Staining Prepare the reagents as described below. If you are staining two gels, double the reagent volumes. Increase volumes 1.5-fold for 1.5mm thick gels. Fix Solution Methanol 100 mL Glacial Acetic Acid 14 mL Ultrapure water to 200 mL Fix Solution for IEF Gels Methanol 40 mL Trichloroacetic Acid 10 g Ultrapure water to 100 mL Wash Solution Methanol 10 mL Glacial Acetic Acid 7 mL Ultrapure water to 100 mL SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Basic Protocol The basic protocol results in the maximum signal strength and widest linear dynamic range for staining of denaturi ng gels, nondenaturing gels, and IEF gels. Sensitivity is in the 1 ng range for most proteins. 1. After electrophoresis, place the gel into a clean container with 100 mL of Fix Solution and agitate on an orbital shak er for 30 minutes. Pour off the used fix solution and repeat once more with fresh Fix Solution. Note: For IEF Gels, place the gel into a clean container with 100 mL of IEF Fix Solution and agitate on an orbital shaker for 3 hours. After fixing, perform 3 washes in ultrapure water for 10 minutes each, before proceeding to the staining step. 2. Pour off the used fix solution. 3. Add 60 mL of SYPRO \u00ae Ruby gel stain to the tray containing the gel. Agitate on an orbital shaker overnight. 4. Transfer the gel to a clean container and wash in 100 mL of Wash Solution for 30 minutes. The transfer step he lps minimize background staining irregularities and stain speckles on the gel. 5. Rinse the gel in ultrapure water for 5 minutes. Repeat the rinse a minimum of one more time to prevent possible corrosive damage to your imager. Note: If you are staining two gels, double the reagent volumes. Increase volumes 1.5-fold for 1.5mm thick gels. Visualization of SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Stained Gels Proteins stained with SYPRO\u00ae Ruby protein gel stain are readily visualized using a UV or blue-light source. The use of a photographic camera or CCD camera and the appropriate filters is essent ial to obtain the greatest sensitivity. Continued on next page 29 SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Staining, Continued SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Rapid Protocol The rapid protocol is optimized for Invitrogen NuPAGE\u00ae gels, and can be completed in 90 minutes. While the maximum fluorescence signal strength is lower than for the basic protocol, the re sults show excellent linearity and low background, with a lower limit of detectio n of 0.25 to 1 ng for most proteins. 1. After electrophoresis, place the gel into a clean a microwavable container with 100 mL of Fix Solution and agitate on an orbital shaker for 15 minutes. Pour off the used fix solution and repeat once more with fresh Fix Solution. 2. Pour off the used fix solution. 3. Add 60 mL of SYPRO \u00ae Ruby gel stain to the tray containing the gel. 4. Microwave 30 seconds, agitate 30 seconds to distribute heat evenly, then microwave another 30 seconds to reach 80-85\u00b0C, and agitate on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes. 5. Reheat the gel by microwaving a third time for 30 seconds and then agitate on an orbital shaker for 23 minutes for a total stain time of 30 minutes. Note: An acceptable alternative to the microwave procedure is to incubate the gel at 80\u00b0C in a shaking water bath for a total of 30 minutes. 6. Transfer the gel to a clean container and wash in 100 mL of Wash Solution for 30 minutes. The transfer step is necessary to avoid heating the destain solution, which may reduce stain sensitivity, and also helps minimize background staining irregularities and stain speckles on the gel. 7. Rinse the gel in ultrapure water for 5 minutes. Repeat the rinse a minimum of one more time to prevent possible corrosive damage to your imager. Note: If you are staining two gels, double the reagent volumes. Increase volumes 1.5-fold for 1.5mm thick gels. Heat the gel in the microwave on full power in increments of 30-45 seconds, until the stain reaches 80-85\u00b0C. Do not heat the fixative solution or other methanolic solutions in the microwave. Although SYPRO \u00ae Ruby stain solution is not flammable, use caution when microwaving SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain as the solution becomes very hot. Using SYPRO\u00ae Ruby Stain As a Post-Stain SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain can be used to post-stain gels stained with other gel stains such as Pro-Q\u00ae Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain, Pro-Q\u00aeEmerald 300 glycoprotein gel stain, Sapphire or InVision oligohistidine-tag gel stains, Pro-Q\u00ae Amber transmembrane protein gel st ain, or silver staining (such as Invitrogen SilverQuest or SilverXpress\u00ae stain). Always use SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain last, as the SYPRO\u00ae Ruby signal can dominate the signal from other stains. SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain does not work well as a post- stain for colorimetric stains such as Coomassie and silver stains. 30 Gel Drying Introduction Dry gels by passive evaporation (air -drying) or vacuum drying. Vacuum drying is faster than passive air-drying methods but often results in cracked gels due to the speed of dehydration. We recommend drying Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast gels using passive air-drying methods such as DryEase\u00ae Mini-Gel Drying System (see below). For applications that require vacuum drying, follow the recommendations on page 33 to minimize cracking of the gels. Do not leave Coomassie stained gels in Gel-Dry solution (or any equilibration solution containing >20% alcohol) for mo re than 5 minutes. Gels left in this solution for longer than 5 minutes lose band intensity and result in decreased sensitivity. Materials Supplied by the User You will need the following items for drying your gel (see page 48 for ordering information on Invitrogen products): DryEase\u00ae Mini-Gel Drying System Gel-Dry Drying Solution (or prepare your own gel drying solution containing 30% methanol and 5% glycerol) StainEase\u00ae Gel Staining Tray DryEase\u00ae Mini-Gel Drying System A brief gel drying protocol using the DryEase\u00ae Mini-Gel Drying System is provided below. For more details on this system, refer to the DryEase\u00ae Mini- Gel Drying System manual (IM-2380). This manual is available for download from our website at www.invitrogen.com or contact Technical Support (see page 56). Wear gloves while handling gels and gel drying solution. 1. After all staining and destaining st eps are complete, wash the destained gel(s) three times for two minutes ea ch time in deionized water (50 mL per mini-gel) on a rotary shaker. 2. Decant the water and add fresh Gel-Dry Drying Solution (35 mL per mini- gel). 3. Equilibrate the gel in the Gel-Dry Drying Solution by shaking the gel for 15-20 minutes in the StainEase\u00ae Gel Staining Tray or in a round container. Note : Do not equilibrate Coomassie stained gels in the Gel-Dry Drying Solution for more than 5 minutes to avoid losing band intensity. 4. Cut any rough edges off the gel (including the wells and the gel foot) using the Gel Knife or a razor blade. 5. Remove 2 sheets of cellophane per gel from the package. 6. Immerse one sheet of cellophane in the Gel-Dry Drying Solution. Allow 15-20 seconds for complete wetting before adding additional sheets. Do not soak the cellophane sheets for more than 2 minutes. Continued on next page 31 Gel Drying, Continued DryEase\u00ae Mini-Gel Drying System, continued 7. Place one side of the DryEase\u00ae Gel Drying Frame with the corner pin facing up, on the DryEase\u00ae Gel Drying Base. 8. Center a piece of pre-wetted cellophane from Step 5 over the base/frame combination, so the cellophane lays over the inner edge of the frame. 9. Lay the gel on the center of the cellophane sheet making sure no bubbles are trapped between the gel and the cellophane. Add some Gel-Dry Drying Solution to the surface of the cellophane, if necessary. 10. Carefully lay the second sheet of cellophan e over the gel so that no bubbles are trapped between the cellophane and the gel. Add some Gel-Dry Drying Solution if necessary. Gently smooth out any wrinkles in the assembly with a gloved hand. 11. Align the remaining frame so that its corn er pins fit into the appropriate holes on the bottom frame. Push the plastic clamps onto the four edges of the frames. 12. Lift the frame assembly from the DryEase \u00ae Gel Drying Base and pour off the excess solution from the base. 13. Place the gel dryer assembly upright on a benchtop. Be careful to avoid drafts as they can cause an uneven rate of dying which leads to cracking. Drying takes between 12-36 hours depending on humidity and gel thickness. 14. When the cellophane is dry to touch, remove the gel/cellophane sandwich from the drying frame. Trim off the excess cellophane. 15. Press the dried gel(s) between the pages of a notebook under light pressure for approximately 2 days so they remain flat for scanning, photography, display, and overhead projection. Continued on next page 32 Gel Drying, Continued Vacuum Drying General guidelines are provided below to minimize cracking during vacuum drying of gels. For detailed instructions, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Handle Gels with Care: Remove the gel from the cassette without breaking or tearing the edges. Small nicks or tears can act as a starting point for cracking. Remove the gel wells and foot off the bottom of the gel with a Gel Knife or a razor blade as described on page 19. Use the StainEase Staining Tray for staining and destaining gels. This tray is designed to facilitate the soluti on changing process without handling of gels. Use a Gel Drying Solution: We recommend equilibrating the gel in a gel drying solution such as Gel-Dry Gel Drying Solution for 10-30 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker before drying the gel. Gel-Dry Gel Drying Solution contains a proprietary non-glyc erol component to effectively regulate the rate of drying and prevent cracking. The gel drying solution does not interfere with autoradiography. To prepare your own gel drying solu tion, prepare a solution containing 30% methanol Note: Do not incubate Coomassie stained gels in gel drying solution for more than 5 minutes as the bands may fade. Remove Air Bubbles: Remove any air bubbles that may be trapped between the paper, gel, and plastic wrap by rolling a small glass pipette over the gel. Use additional gel drying solution to remove any air bubbles. Use Proper Gel Dryer Set-up: Place gel on the gel dryer with the plastic wrap facing up. Make sure the vacuum pump is in working condition, an d properly set up to form a tight seal when on. Use drying conditions for polyacrylamide gels, with the temperature increasing to a set value and holding fo r the duration of the drying cycle. We recommend drying mini-gels at 80 C for 2 hours. Ensure Gel is Completely Dry: The gel will crack if the vacuum seal of the heated gel dryer is broken prior to complete drying of the gel. To ensure the gel is completely dried before releasing the vacuum seal, follow these tips : Check the temperature of the gel The temperature of the dried gel should be the same as the temperature of the surrounding gel drying surface. If the temperature of the dried gel is cooler, then the gel is not completely dried. Check for moisture in the tubing connecting the gel dryer to the vacuum pump The gel is not completely dried if there is residual moisture in the tubing and additional drying time is required. 33 Western Blotting Introduction After performing electrophoresis, proteins can be transferred to membranes for subsequent analysis. Methods of transfer include wet, semi-wet, semi-dry, and dry blotting. Semi-dry blotting can be performed with the Novex\u00ae Semi-Dry Blotter other semi-dry blotter. For details on perf orming semi-dry blotting, see page 39 or refer to the manual for the Novex\u00ae Semi-Dry Blotter (25-0911). Dry blotting is performed with the iBlot\u00ae Gel Transfer Device. Refer to the manual for the iBlot\u00ae Dry Blotting System (25-0949) for details. Instructions are provided below for semi-wet blotting of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels using the XCell II Blot Module. For more information on the XCell II Blot Module, refer to the manual (IM-9051) availabl e at www.invitrogen.com or contact Technical Support (see page 56). NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant The NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant is added to the transfer buffer when blotting reduced proteins to prevent reoxidation and main tain proteins in a reduced state (see page 13). The anode electrochemistry is the major cause of reoxidation during blotting, though proteins are oxidized at a slower rate in the neutral pH environment of the NuPAGE\u00ae blotting system compared to higher pH blotting systems. NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer We recommend using the NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer for western transfer of NuPAGE\u00ae Gels to maintain the neutral pH environment established during NuPAGE\u00ae electrophoresis. The NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer protects against modification of amino acid side chains and is compatible with N-term inal protein sequencing using Edman degradation. Materials Supplied by the User In addition to the XCell II Blot Module, the following reagents are needed for blotting your gel (see page 48- 49 for ordering information on Invitrogen products): Bl otting membranes Filter paper II Blot module NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant for reduced samples MagicMark Western Protein Standard Deionized water Continued on next page 34 Western Blotting, Continued Preparing NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer For blotting NuPAGE\u00ae Gels, use 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer. If you are preparing your own transfer buffer see page 53 for a recipe. Prep are 1,000 mL of Transfer Buffer (20X) as follows: Reduced Samples Non-Reduced Samples NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer (20X) 50 mL 50 mL NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant 1 mL \u2014 Methanol 100 mL * 100 mL * Deionized Water 849 mL 850 mL Total Volume 1,000 mL 1,000 mL *NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer with 10% methanol provides optimal transfer of a single gel in the blot module. If you are transferring two gels in the blot module, increase the methanol content to 20% to ensure efficient transfer of both gels. Preparing Blotting Pads Use about 700 mL of 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer to soak the pads until they are saturated. Remove the air bubbles by squeezing the pads while they are submerged in buffer. Removing the air bubbles is essential as they can interfere with the transfer of biomolecules if not removed. Preparing Transfer Membrane and Filter Paper Cut the transfer membrane and filter paper to the dimensions of the gel, or use Novex\u00ae pre-cut membrane/filter pa per sandwiches (see page 48 for ordering inform ation. PVDF membrane \u2014Pre-wet PVDF membrane for 30 seconds in methanol, ethanol (95%), or isopropanol. Briefly rinse in deionized water, then place in a shallow dish with 50 mL of 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer for several minutes. Nitrocellulose \u2014Place the membrane directly into a shallow dish containing 50 mL of 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer for several minutes. Filter paper\u2014Soak the filter paper briefly in 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer immediately prior to use. Gel\u2014Use the gel immediately following the run. Do not soak the gel in transfer buffer. Continued on next page 35 Western Blotting, Continued Western Transfer Using the XCell II Blot Module Wear gloves while performing the blotti ng procedure to prevent contamination of gels and membranes, and exposure to irritants commonly used in electrotransfer. Transferring One Gel 1. After opening the gel cassette as described on page 19 remove wells with the Gel Knife. 2. Place a piece of pre-soaked filter paper on top of the gel, with the edge a bove the slot in the bottom of the cassette (leaving the foot of the gel uncovered). Keep the filter paper sa turated with the transfer buffer and remove all trapped air bubbles by gently rolling over the surface using a glass pipette as a roller. 3. Turn the plate over so the gel and filt er paper are facing downwards over a gloved hand or clean flat surface. 4. Use the Gel Knife to push the foot out of the slot in the plate, and separate the gel from the plate. 5. When the gel is on a flat surface, cut th e foot off the gel with the Gel Knife. 6. Wet the surface of the gel with transfer buffer and position the pre-soaked transfer membrane on the gel, ensuring all air bubbles have been removed. 7. Place another pre-soaked filter paper on top of the membrane. Remove any trapped air bubbles. 8. Place two soaked blotting pads into the cathode (-) core of the blot module. The cathode core is the deeper of the two cores and the corresponding electrode plate is a darker shade of gray. Carefully pick up the gel/membrane assembly and place on blotting pad such that the gel is closest to the surface of the cathode core (see Figure 1, next page). 9. Add enough pre-soaked blotting pads to raise the assembly 0.5 cm over the edge of cathode core. Place the anode (+) core on top of the pads. The gel/membrane assembly should be held securely between the two halves of the blot module ensuring complete contact of all components. 10. Position the gel/membrane assembly and blotting pads in the cathode core of the XCell II Blot Module to fit horizontally across the bottom of the unit. There should be a gap of appr oximately 1 cm at the top of the electrodes when the pads and assembly are in place. 11. Hold the blot module together firmly an d slide it into the guide rails on the Lower Buffer Chamber. The blot module fi ts into the unit one way, with the (+) sign at the upper left hand corner of the blot module, and the inverted gold post fitting into the connector on the right side of the Lower Buffer Chamber. 12. Place the Gel Tension Wedge so that it s vertical face is against the blot module. Lock the Gel Tension Wedge by pulling the lever forward. Continued on next page 36 Western Blotting, Continued Western Transfer Using the XCell II Blot Module, continued 13. Fill the blot module with 1X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer until the gel/membrane assembly is covered in Transfer Buffer. To avoid generating extra conductivity and heat, do not fill the chamber all the way to the top. 14. Fill the Lower Buffer Chamber with deionized water by pouring approximately 650 mL in the gap between the front of the blot module and the front of the Lower Buffer Chamber. The water level should reach approximately 2 cm from the top of th e Lower Buffer Chamber. This serves to dissipate heat produced during the run. 15. Place the lid on top of the unit. 16. With the power turned off, plug the red and black leads into the power supply. Refer to Recommended Transfer Conditions on the next page for transfer conditions. Transferring Two Gels in One Blot Module 1. Prepare 1X NuPAGE \u00ae Transfer Buffer containing 20% methanol as described on page 35. 2. Rep eat Steps 1-7 (previous page) twice to make two gel/membrane sandwiches. 3. Place two pre-soaked pads on cathode shell of blot module. Place the first gel/membrane assembly on the pads such that the gel faces the cathode plate. (See Figure 2). 4. Add another pre-soaked blotting pa d on top of first gel/membrane assembly. 5. Position second gel/membrane assembly on top of blotting pad with the gel facing the cathode side. 6. Proceed with Steps 8-13 from Transferring One Gel . 7. Refer to Recommended Transfer Conditions on the next page for transfer conditions. Figure 1 Figure next page 37 Western Blotting, Continued Recommended Transfer Conditions The transfer conditions for NuPAGE\u00ae Gels using the XCell II Blot Module are listed in the table below. Note : The expected current listed in the table is for transferring one gel. If you are transferring two gels in the blot module, the expected current will double.

If transferring two gels with the blot module, increa se the methanol content to 20% to ensure even and efficient transfer of both gels. Alternate Transfer Buffers The NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer (with NuPAGE Antioxidant for reduced samples) is the optimal buffer for western transfer of NuPAGE\u00ae gels. However, NuPAGE\u00ae Gels can be or TBE Transfer Buffer (1/2X). The NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant is less effective when added to the Tris-Glycine and TBE buffers due to the pH. Carbonate and CAPS transfer buffers are not recommended for blotting of NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Pre-Cast . The NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant is ineffective at pH >9 and will not work when used with the Carbonate or CAPS transfer buffers. Continued on next page 38 Western Blotting, Continued Semi-Dry transfer as efficiently with semi-dry blotting compared to blotting with the XCell II Blot Module. If you decide to use semi-dry blotting for NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris Gels, follow the protocol provided below to ensure efficient transfer of proteins. 1. Prepare 100 mL of 2X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer as follows: NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer (20X) 10.0 mL NuPAGE\u00ae Antioxidant (for reduced sample) 0.1 mL Methanol 10.0 mL Deionized Water to 100 mL Total Volume 100 mL 2. Soak the filter paper and transfer membrane in 2X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer. If you are using Novex\u00ae pre-cut membrane/filter sandwiches, use three pieces of filter paper (0.4 mm/filter in thickness) on each side of the gel/membrane assembly. If you are not using the Novex\u00ae pre-cut membrane/filter sandwiches, use two pieces of thick filter paper) on each side of the gel/membrane assembly. 3. Prepare 100 mL of 2X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer ((without methanol) 4. Equilibrate the gel in 2X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer (without methanol) for 10 minute with gentle agitation. Note : For transfer of large proteins (>100 kDa), equilibrate the gel with 2X NuPAGE\u00ae Transfer Buffer (without methanol) with 0.02-0.04% SDS. 5. Assemble the gel/membrane/filter paper sandwich on top of the anode plate (+) as follows: 6. Perform the transfer at 20 V for 30-60 minutes if using the Novex\u00ae Semi- Dry Blotter. Perform the transfer at 15 V constant for 15 minutes if you are using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot\u00ae Semi-Dry Transfer Cell. For other semi-dry transfer cells, recommendations. 39 Using ZOOM\u00ae Gels following isoelectric focusing of IPG strips.

Proceed to staining the second dimension gel using an appropriate method for the type of gel and sample amount. 41 Calibrating Protein Molecular Weight Introduction The molecular weight of a protein can be determined based upon its relative mobility by constructing a standard cu rve with protein standards of known molecular weights. The protein mobility in SDS-PAGE gels is dependent on the Length of the protein in its fully denatured state, SDS-PAGE buffer systems, and Secondary structure of the protein. The same molecular weight standard may have slightly different mobility, resulting in different apparent molecular weight when run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems. If you are using the Novex \u00ae protein molecular weight standards, see the apparent molecular weights of these standards in the NuPAGE\u00ae Gels listed on the next page to determine an apparent molecular weight of your protein. Protein Secondary Structure When using SDS-PAGE for molecular weig ht determination, slight deviations from the calculated molecular weight of a protein (calculated from the known amino acid sequence) can occur due to the retention of varying degrees of secondary structure in the protein, ev en in the presence of SDS. This phenomenon is observed in highly orga nized secondary structures (collagens, histones, or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins) and in peptides, where the effect of local secondary structure becomes magnified relative to the total size of the peptide. Buffer Systems Slight differences in protein mobilities also occur when the same proteins are run in different SDS-PAGE buffer system s. Each SDS-PAGE buffer system has a different pH, which affects the charge of a protein and its binding capacity for SDS. The degree of change in protein mobility is usually small in natural proteins but more pronounced with \"atyp ical\" or chemically modified proteins such as pre-stained standards. Continued on next page 42 Calibrating Protein Molecular Weight, Continued Assigned Apparent Molecular Weights The apparent molecular weight values for the Novex\u00ae protein standards in several buffer systems including the NuPAGE\u00ae buffer system are provided below. Use the one that matches your gel for the most accurate calibration of your protein. The following charts summarize the approximate molecular weight values for the Novex\u00ae protein molecular weight standards when run in the NuPAGE\u00ae Buffer System. You may generate calibration curves in your lab with any other manufacturer's standards.

Low or no current during the run Incomplete circuit Remove the tape from the bottom of the cassette prior to electrophoresis. Make sure the buffer covers the sample wells. Check the wire connections on the buffer core to make sure the connections are intact. Streaking of proteins Sample overload High salt concentration in the sample Sample precipitates Contaminants such as membranes or DNA complexes in the sample Load the appropriate amount of protein as described on page 10. Decrease the salt concentration of your sam ple using dialysis or gel filtration. Increase the concentration of SDS in your sample, if necessary to maintain the solubility of the protein. Centrifuge or clarify your sample to remove particulate contaminants. Dumbbell shaped bands after electrophoresis Loading a large volume of sample causes incomplete stacking of the entire sample. This effect is more intensified for larger proteins. Load the appropriate volume of sample per well as described on page 10. If your sample is too dilute, concentra te the sample using ultrafiltration.
