For conventional farms, there are many synthetic products available to kill microorganisms. However, there are strict rules about what can and cannot be used for organic and alternative farms. Read on to learn more about how to properly protect your organic/alternative farm! Cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing are all different. Cleaning removes visible debris like manure, dirt, and feed. Sanitizing is the next step up and removes bacteria from surfaces. Disinfection destroys germs and is the final step. It's most important to focus your cleaning and disinfection on the areas and items used for animals. This includes pens, stalls, and handling equipment. Heavy machinery, vehicles, and trailers used for animal transport should be cleaned and disinfected before traveling between animal areas. Your footwear is also important- remember to clean your shoes/boots after leaving areas where animals are kept, especially sick animals. This process should include a wash, scrub, and rinse, followed by a disinfectant. Finally, don't forget to clean the tools you used in cleaning and disinfection to remove any germs they picked up in the process! Before you get into cleaning and disinfection, it's important to check [The National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-M/part-205/subpart-G/subject-group-ECFR0ebc5d139b750cd/section-205.603) to ensure your products are allowed on USDA-certified organic and alternative farms. Generally, non-synthetic or \"natural\" substances are allowed, and synthetic substances are not. Always remember that all products used on USDA-certified organic farms, including those used for cleaning and disinfection, must be approved by the organic certifier and listed in the producer's Organic Systems Plan (OSP). A couple of common household products are allowed for use on organic and alternative farms: white vinegar and bleach. Vinegar is non-toxic and non-irritating. A solution of one part vinegar to one part water can be mixed in a spray bottle and used for general cleaning. It is recommended to let this mixture sit on the surface you are cleaning for 10 minutes. As with other cleaners and disinfectants, make sure to remove all organic material first, as dirt, hair, hay, and other materials can make them less effective. Liquid chlorine bleach is cheap, available, and effective as a disinfectant. Bleach solutions are a common method of disinfection on organic, alternative, and conventional farms! For general disinfection, add 1/3 cup of bleach to one gallon of water. This mixture should be made fresh each day. While vinegar and bleach are both allowed substances on organic and alternative farms, never mix bleach and vinegar as it will release toxic chlorine gas. Proper cleaning and disinfection can help keep your animals and customers healthy, building trust and your business. With the regulations on products used on organic and alternative farms, understanding what you can use is just as important as understanding how to use it.
