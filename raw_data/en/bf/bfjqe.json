Continuous evaluation of medicines' benefit and harm help to achieve the ultimate goal of safe and effective treatments available to patients. The guideline is intended to assist healthcare professionals in the reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of all registered health products, including medicines, old medicines, medical devices and in -vitro diagnostics (IVDs). For the purpose of this guideline: the terms \"holder of certificate of registration\" and and terms \"adverse drug reaction\" and \"reaction\". 1.1 The South African Health Products Regulatory (SAHPRA) SAHPRA is an entity of the National Department of Health, created by the South African Government to ensure that the health and well -being of human an d animal health is at its core. SAHPRA assumed the roles of both the Medicines Control Council (MCC) as well as the Directorate of Radiation Control (DRC) which were housed at the National Department of Health (NDoH). Subsequently, SAHPRA was constituted as an independent entity that reports to the National Minister of Health through its Board. SAHPRA is mandated by the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No. 101 of 1965) as amended, to regulate (i.e. monitor, evaluate, investigate, inspect, register and review) all health products and their use in South Africa. SAHPRA has also been delegated the task of overseeing radiatio n cont rol in South Africa. This function is governed by the Hazardous Substances Act (Act 15 of 1973) which aims to protect the public (workers, patients, etc.) against radiation used in both health settings and in industry. SAHPRA's function is therefore to promote public health and safety by ensuring that all medicines, medical devices and IVDs that are available and used in the South Africa are safe, effective and of good quality and acceptable performance. 1.2 The Pharmacovigilance obligation of the healthcare professional According to Regulation 40 of Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965) as amended: A health care pro fessional , veterinarian or any other person should inform the Authority, in the manner as determined by the Authority, of any: a) suspected ADR s; or b) new or existing safety, quality or effectiveness concerns, occurring as a result of the use of any medicine or scheduled substance. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 6 2 DEFINITIONS These terms may have other meaning under different context but the meaning that will be used in this guideline will be as defined in this document. 2.1 Abuse of medicine Abuse of medicine refers to the persistent or sporadic, international excessive use of medicines which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. 2.2 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or Adverse Reaction An adverse drug reaction (ADR) means a noxious and unin tended response to a medicine, including lack of efficacy, and which occurs at doses normally used in man and which can also result from overdose, misuse or abuse of a medicine. The reaction may be a known side effect of the medicin e or vaccine or it may be new and previously unrecogn ized. ADR can be caused by any therapeutic agent, including prescribed and over the counter (OTC) medicines, vaccines , and complementary medicines, and all of these should be reported. A reaction, contr ary to an event, is characterised by the occurrence of a suspected causal relationship between the medicine and the reaction, as determined by the reporter or a reviewing healthcare professional. The fact that the healthcare professional is making a report serves as an indication that the observed event may be caused by the medicine. 2.3 Adverse Event Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a medicine but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disea se temporarily associated with the use of a medicine, whether considered related to the medicine, or not. 2.4 Causality assessment Causality assessment is defined as the evaluation of the likelihood that a medicine was the causative agent of an observed a dverse drug reaction. 2.5 Complementary medicine Complementary medicine means any substance or mixture of substances that: a) originates from plants, fungi, algae, seaweeds, lichens, minerals, animals or other substance as determined by the Authority; b) is used or purporting to be suitable for use or manufactured or sold for use i. in maintaining, complementing or assisting the physical or mental state; or ii. to diagnose, treat, mitigate, modify, alleviate, or prevent disease or illness or the symptoms or signs thereof or abnormal physical or mental state of a human being or animal; and c) is used: i. as a health supplement; or ii. in accordance with those disciplines as determined by the Authority. Complementary medicines include western herbal medicines, traditional Chinese medicines, minerals, vitamins, probiotics, aromatherapy medicines, homeopathy medicines, etc. SAHPRA regulates complementary medicines but there are still medicines that are available on the market that have not as yet been r egistered. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 7 2.6 Congenital Anomalies Congenital anomalies are defined as structural and/or functional abnormalities, usually irreversible, that develop/occur during the period of conception and/or embryo -foetal development during one or more trimesters of pregnancy, affecting one or more of the following domains: genetic material, histology, anatomy, organ system, development, growth, differentiation, physiological function and/or metabolic function and/or homeostatic mechanisms which may be identifiable either prenatally and/or at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders, congenital defects or congenital malformations. 2.7 Consumer Consumer in relation to healthcare, means a person who uses or is a potential user of health services, as well as their family and caregivers. 2.8 Counterfeit medicine Counterfeit medicine means a medicine in respect of which a false representation has been made about its contents, identity or sour ce by any means including its labelling and packaging. 2.9 Clinical Trial A study performed to investigate the safety or efficacy of a medicine. For human medicines, these studies are carried out in human participants. 2.10 Dechallenge Dechallenge means withdrawal of a medicine from the patient's therapeutic regimen. Negative dechallenge means continued presence of an adverse experience after withdrawal of the medicine. Positive dechallenge means partial or complete disappearance of an a dverse event after withdrawal of the medicine. 2.11 eReporting eReporting is a module for VigiFlow\u00ae system, that allows for seamless electronic reporting of Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) directly from the source into VigiFlow\u00ae system. It reduces the workload of manual data entry from ADR paper forms into VigiFlow\u00ae system. 2.12 Essential Medicines List (EML) Clinical Guide The EML Clinical Guide is a National Department of Health Mobile Application which contains the Primary He alth Care Standard Treatment Guidelines, Hospital Level Adult Guidelines, Tertiary and Quaternary Level EML Recommendations and Essential Medici nes List for 2015. It includes an ADR reporting module which is used to report ADRs. 2.13 Healthcare Professional/Provider Healthcare professional or health care provider means a person providing health services in terms of any law, including in terms of the: Allied Health Professions Act, 1982 (Act No. 63 of 1982) Health Professions Act, 1982 (Act No. 56 of 1982) Nursing Act, 1978 (Act No. 50 of 1978); Pharmacy Act, 1974 (Act No. 53 of 1974) Dental Technicians Act, 1979 (Act No. 19 of 1979) 2.14 Hypothesis A hypothesis is an idea which is suggested as a possible explanation for a particular situation or condition, but which has not yet been proved to be correct . Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 8 2.15 Holder of a certificate of registration/applicant Holder of a certificate of registration means a person/company in whose name a registration certificate has been granted and who is responsible for all aspects of the medicine, including quality, safety, effectiveness and compliance with the conditions of registration. 2.16 Individual Case Safety Repor t (ICSR) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) is a document providing the most complete information related to an individual case at a certain point of time. ICSRs are used for reporti ng suspected adverse reactions to a medicine that occur in a single patient at a specific point in time. An individual case is the information provided by a primary source to describe suspected adverse reactions related to the administration of one or more medicine to an individual patient at a particular point of time. 2.17 Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Lack of efficacy is defined as failure to produce the expected outcome of which the medicine was indicated for. Lack of efficacy applies to registered medicines, including when used for an unapprove d indication. 2.18 Medication error Medication error is defined as failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient and includes: prescribing errors; dispensing errors; medicine preparation error; administration error and monitoring error. 2.19 Minimum information required for a report It is information required for a case to be deemed valid for data capturing and it includes the following: information about the patient, which medicine is suspected to have caused the reaction, the reaction that has occurred, and information about the reporter. A report may be nullified if it lacks the minimum information. For further information, required to ensure that the report is clinical ly meaningful, see point 5.4.1. 2.20 Pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance is defined as the science and activities concerned with the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse reactions to medicines (i.e. ADRs). The ultimate goal of this activity is to improve the safe and rational use of medicines, thereby improvi ng patient care and public health. 2.21 Post marketing surveillance Post marketing surveillance is the practice of monitoring the safety of a medicine, medical device or IVD after it has been released on the market and is an important part of the science of pharmacovigilance. Medicines are approved/authorized to be used by the public on the basis of clinical trials, which involve relatively small numbers of participants who have been selected for such purpose. Post -marketing surveillance is used to confirm or deny the safety of a medicine after it is used in the general population by lar ge numbers of people who have a wide variety of medical conditions by using approaches such as spontaneous ADR reporting procedures, pregnancy registries, etc. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 9 2.22 Product Quality Problem Product quality problems include concerns about the quality, authenticity, performance, or safety of any medicine or medical device. Problems with product quality may occur during manufacturing, distribution, or storage and include suspect counterfeit pro duct; product contamination; defective components; poor packaging or product mix-up; questionable stability; medical device malfunctions and labelling concerns. 2.23 Rechallenge Rechallenge means reintroduction of a product suspected of having caused an adverse event following a positive dechallenge. Negative rechallenge means failure of the medicine, when reintroduced, to produce signs or symptoms similar to those observed when the medicine was previously introduced. Positive rechallenge means reoccurrence of similar signs and symptoms upon reintroduction of a medicine. 2.24 Serious Adverse Drug Event or Adverse Drug Reaction A serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in an abortion, premature delivery, congenital anomaly/birth defects; results in persistent or significant disability/incapability; or is a medically si gnificant/ important event or reaction. The term \"life -threatening\" in the definition of \"serious\" refers to a reaction/event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction/event; it does not refer to an event which, hypothetically , might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised when deciding whether other situations are serious or not. Such instances could include medical events that may not be immediately life - threatening or r esult in death or hospitalisation, but which may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in the definition above. Examples include blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The term \"severe\" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event. This is not the same as \"serious', which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria. 2.25 Signal A signal refers to 'reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a medicine, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously'. Usually more than a single report is required to generate a s ignal, depending upon the seriousness of the event and the quality of the information. 2.26 Spontaneous ADR report A spontaneous report is a communication to a pharmaceutical company, regulatory authority or other organisation that describes a suspected adverse drug reaction in a patient given one or more medicines, and which does not derive from a study. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 10 2.27 Teratogen A teratogen is any substance/agent (e.g. medicine) that can harm/damage the sperm, ovum, the conceptus, developing embryo and/or foetus during one or more trimesters of pregnancy, affecting structure and/or function across one or more of the following domains: genetic material, histology, anatomy, organ system development, growth and differentiation, physiol ogical function and/or metabolic function and/or homeostatic mechanisms which may be detectable prenatally, at birth or later in life. 2.28 Unexpected adverse drug reaction An unexpected adverse drug reaction is one in which the nature, specificity, severity and outcome is not consistent with domestic labelling or holder of registration of ce rtificate or expected from the characteristics of the medicine. 2.29 VigiAccess\u00ae VigiAccess\u00ae is a web application that allows the public to access VigiBase\u00ae database and retrieve statistical data on the suspected adverse drug reactions of medicines reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring (PIDM). 2.30 VigiBase\u00ae VigiBase\u00ae is the WHO global database of individual case safety reports (ICSRs). It is developed and maintained by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) on behalf of WHO and its member countries. It consists of reports of adverse drug reactions to medicines and vaccin es received from member countries since 1968. It is updated with incoming case reports on a continuous basis. The purpose is to ensure that early signs of previously unknown medicines -related safety problems are identified as rapidly as possible. Contrary to VigiAccess\u00ae, consumers and healthcare professionals do not have access to VigiBase\u00ae database. 2.31 VigiFlow\u00ae VigiFlow\u00ae is a web -based ICSR management system that is available for use by national pharmacovigilance centres e.g. SAHPRA, of the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring. VigiFlow\u00ae supports the collection, processing and sharing of data of ICSRs to facili tate effective data analysis. 2.32 Vigilance Vigilance in relation to a medicine, medical device or IVD, means the continuous monitoring and evaluation of its safety, efficacy and performance profile and the management of any risk throughout its life-cycle. 2.33 VigiLyze\u00ae VigiLyze\u00ae is the search and analysis tool used to retrieve global ICSR data from VigiBase\u00ae database. 2.34 Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) UMC is located in Uppsala , Sweden and it is the field name for the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. UMC works by collecting, assessing and communicating information fr om member countries' national pharmacovigilance centres in regard to the benefits, harm, effectiveness and risks of medicines. UMC is responsible for: the co -ordination of WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring and its member countries; the collection, assessment and communication of information from member countries about the benefits, harms and risks of medicines and other substances used in medicines to impro ve patient therapy and public health worldwide; collaborating with member countries in the development and practice of the science of pharmacovigilance. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 11 2.35 World Health Organisation (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring (PIDM) The PIDM was established in 1968, to ensure that evidence about harm to patients was collected from as many sources as possible. This would enable individual countries to be alerted to patterns of harm that were emerging across the world and which might not be evident from their local data alone. The PIDM consists of a group of more than 150 member countries (South Africa became a m ember in 1992) that share the vision of safer and more effective use of medic ines. They work nationally and collaborate internationally to monitor and identify the harm caused by med icines, to reduce the risks to patients and to establish worldwide pharmac ovigilance standards and systems. UMC has been responsible for the technical and operational aspects of the programme since 1978. 3 PHARMACOVIGILANCE 3.1 Why is pharmacovigilance and reporting of ADRs important? When a health product is first registered and made available in South Africa, information about its safety and effectiveness is usually only available from clinical trials. Clinical trials, through different test phases (see Appendix A), provide informatio n about many of the possible adverse events associated with a health product, but do not detect all possible adverse events because they: usually do not continue for long enough to detect adverse events that take a long time to develop, do not include en ough patients to detect adverse events that occur rarely and do not include all of the different types of people who might eventually use the product and who might be more vulnerable to some adverse events, such as older people, children, pregnant women o r people with other medical conditions. Rare ADRs, occurring in only a small percentage of cases, after a long period of use or when a medicine interacts with a particular combination of other medicines or conditions, may not be detected during clinical t rials. For ADRs that were not discovered during clinical trials to be detected, investigated and communicated, and the appropriate action taken, it is therefore vital that post -marketing pharmacovigilance of all medicines is comprehensive. Effective pharma covigilance should take into account trends in use, as well as the occurrence of ADRs, enabling more effective advice to be given to those prescribing and using medicines and should ensure better standards of safety and efcacy. SAHPRA, like other Regulatory Authorities around the world, monitors the safety of health products to contribute to a better understanding of their possible adverse events when they are used outside the controlled conditions of clinical trials. Continuous reporting by health professionals and consumers provide important information for the pharmacovigilance system in South Africa. 3.2 Pharmacovigilance System in South African In order to prevent undesirable effects in patients due to sub -standard health products and inapprop riate or unsafe use of health products, an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) monitoring system was established in South Africa in 1987. This system is coordinated by the Regulatory Pharmacovigilance unit of SAHPRA, which consists of the main office in Pretoria a nd a satellite office, National Adverse Event Drug Monitoring Centre (NADEMC), situated in Cape Town's Groote -Schuur Hospital and attached to University of Cape Town's Clinical Pharmacology Division. The regulatory pharmacovigilance unit work in collaborat ion with programmatic units based at NDoH head office in Pretoria. The programmatic units are: the Extended Programme for Immunisation (EPI) unit the Department of Health Pharmacovigilance Centre for Public Health Programmes (DoH -PvPHP) Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 12 Table 1: Overarching Pharmacovigilance Bodies Characteristic Regulatory Public Health Programmes (PHP) Focal Point SAHPRA and National Adverse Drug Event Monitoring Centre (NADEMC) DoH-PvPHP EPI Medicines under focus All medicines available in the country HIV/AIDS and TB medicines Vaccines Objectives Ensure marketed medicines are safe, effective and of good quality in the interest of the public Minimise preventable harm and maintain public trust in the programmes and the medicines it employs Communication of results and corrective actions Through regulatory decision -making, market withdrawal, labeling changes, Public Health Advisories, dear healthcare professional letters (DHCPLs), Press Statements and safety alerts Epidemiological newsletters, press statements, guidelines, training and educational materials, local or international publications, infrastructural changes and changes in conditions of drug use The regulatory pharmacovigilance unit's key role is safety -monitoring of all health products available in the South African market. Its core activity is the collection and evaluation of ADR reports submitted by healthcare professionals , consumers and pharmaceutical companies in the country. The ultimate goal of this activity is to contribute to the rational and safe use of medicines and to continuously monitor the risks and benefits of all medicines available at every level of healthcare. Ensuring safety of medicines is the responsibility of all stakeholders invo lved in medicines chain. The diagram below indicate s different stakeholders involved in pharmacovigilance and their key responsibilities. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 13 Diagram 1: Professional groups/associations and their functions 4. PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING 4.1 How do healthcare professionals identify ADRs? 4.1.1 Obtain patient history and do a proper examination i. Take a proper history A full medical history should be done properly. Can this ADR be explained by other causes e.g. patient's underlying disease, other prescription medicine/s, OTC medicines or complementary medicines; toxins or foods ? It is essential that the patient is thoroughly investigated to decide what the actual cause of any new medical problem is. A medicine related cause should be considered, es pecially when other causes do not explain the patient's condition. Reporters Doctors Pharmacists Nurses Other Health Care Workers Consumers PEOPLE FUNCTIONS Reporting (Detection and Generation) Report side effects and suspected adverse events Manufacturers, License holders, Distributors and Wholesalers STRUCTURES Evaluators Regulatory Authorities and Pharmaceutical industries - i.e. Marketing Authorisation Holders Data Collation and Evaluation Collate data, conduct initial analysis Causality Analysis and Risk Determination Assess causal association between product and event and determine whether and what type of additional information is required to improve certainty of causal association. Assess risk through epidemiological studies. Decision Making and Appropriate Action Professional information amendments, warnings, scheduling changes, risk management, market withdrawal, product recall, etc. Pharmacovigilance Center Drug & Therapeutics Committee (DTC) Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee (PTC) Regulatory Authority Industry Health Services Professional Groups Advisory Committees Media Prevented Medicine - Related Harm Reduced medicine -related Morbidity and Mortality Improve Risk - Benefit Profile of Product Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 14 ii. Where necessary, do a thorough physical examination with appropriate laboratory, imaging and other relevant investigations Few medicines produce distinctive physical signs (exceptions inc lude fixed drug eruptions, steroid - induced dermal atrophy, acute extrapyramidal reactions); Laboratory tests are especially important if the medicine is considered e ssential in improving patient care or if the lab oratory test results will improve management of the patient; Try to describe the reaction as clearly as possible and where possible provide an accurate diagnosi s or pictures . 4.1.2 Obtain patient history and do a proper examination Some reactions occur immediately after being given a medicine while other reactions take time to develop; The time from the start of therapy to the time of onset of the suspected reaction must be logical. 4.1.3 Effect of dechallenge and rechallenge should be determined (when necessary) Positive dechallenge (partial or complete disappearance of a reaction when dechallenge occurs) is a strong, although not conclusive indication of a medicine induced reaction. Rechallenge (reintroducing the medicine after a decha llenge) is justifiable when the benefit of re -introducing the medicine to the patient outweighs the risk of recurrence of the reaction. This is rare. In some cases, the reaction may be more severe on repeat exposure. 4.1.4 Where possible, check the known pharmacology of the medicine Is the reaction known to occur with the particular medicine as stated in the professional information (previously known as package insert) or other reference? If the reaction is not documented in the professional information, it does not mean that the reaction cannot occur with that particular medicine. 4.2 What to report? ADRs resulting from prescription medicines, (OTC) medicines, complementary medicines and vaccines should be reported. Ideally serious, undocumented and unexpected ADRs are to be reported. If there is any doubt about whether or not an ADR has occurred and should be reported, it is always best practice to submit a report as causality does not need to have been established. i. ADRs in children All suspected ADRs occurring in children under the age of 18, should be reported regardless of whether the medicine is registered for use in children. ii. ADRs in the elderly Healthcare professionals should be particularly aware that the elderly may be more susceptible to adverse drug reactions and it is therefore important to monitor drug safety in this age group. Many elderly patients are more likely to be taking multiple medicines and may also metabolise them less effectively or be more sensitive t o their effects. iii. ADR reports on lack of efficacy Lack of efficacy with medicines used for the treatment of life -threatening diseases (e.g. antimicrobial agents), vaccines or contraceptives or other classes of medicines where lack of efficacy could result i n serious consequences, require reporting. Normal progression of disease does not imply lack of efficacy. The batch/lot number of the suspected medicine for a report of lack of efficacy must be included in the report. Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 15 iv. Complementary medicines The 'natural' content of complementary medicines means they are often considered to be 'safe' by the public who, along with many professionals, fail to recognise the potential potency of many such products. Patients and healthcare professionals should also be aware that interactions between complementary and other, prescribed or OTC, medicines can also cause unexpected reactions. It is therefore important that any suspected ADR which occurs from a complementary medicine is reported and that as much information about the ingredients and the source of the remedy are included. v. Delayed drug effects Some reactions may become manifest months or years after exposure. Any suspicion of such an association should always be reported. Examples of delayed reactions that might need to be reported include: kidney disease from long term usage of analgesics or n on-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); disabling and potentially permanent side effects which involve tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and central nervous system (i.e. tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, fatigue, memory impairment, sleep disorders, and impaired hearing, vision, taste and smell) following the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. vi. Interactions If an adverse effect is suspected to be relat ed to an interaction between two or more medicines, it should be reported as an adverse reaction. vii. Medication errors Medication errors, whether resulting in an adverse drug reaction or not, must be reported. viii. Overdose Suspected ADRs, associated with an over dose, should be reported, as well as other reactions that may have occurred due to the overdose. ix. Reports relating to pregnancy and breastfeeding The healthcare professional must report suspected ADRs related to pregnancy or breastfeeding regardless of whether the medicine is contra -indicated in pregnancy and/or lactation. x. Serious adverse drug reactions All serious suspected reactions must be reported. The side effects of an established medicine may be well known but if a serious reaction o ccurs it should always be reported regardless of whether it is expected or not. xi. Product quality problem Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report product quality problems, whether resulting in an adverse drug reaction or not. The batch/lot number o f the suspected medicines must be included in the report. xii. Teratogenicity and congenital anomalies The following information should be provided for reports on congenital anomalies or teratogenicity: age and sex of the infant; the birth date or the date on which the pregnancy was ended; (duration of pregnancy/gestational age of foetus/baby); date and/or duration of exposure to teratogen/substance/medicine in preconception period, and/or any or all trimesters of pregnancy; the teratogen/substance(s) or medic ine(s) exposed to and the dose in case of a medicine and reason(s) for exposure or treatment with the medicine(s) Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 16 the type of congenital anomaly/malformation/adverse event/ reaction noticed at or after birth, and the seriousness thereof whether the congenital anomaly/malformation/adverse event/reaction resulted in death, was life - threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, was a medically significant/important reaction/event or would have persistent and/or signi ficant disability/incapability consequences any adverse reactions experienced by the mother must be considered a new initial case report and should be reported separately. Suspected ADRs should also be reported in cases where a baby is born with a congen ital abnormality or where a pregnancy results in a malformed or aborted foetus and the report should include information of all medicines taken during pregnancy. Diagram 2: Flow diagram to show when an ADR must be reported. 4.3 When to report an ADR? A healthcare professional must report when they have identified an ADR suspected to have been caused by a medicine (including vaccines and complementary medicines), medical devices and IVDs. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected ADRs even when the y do not have all the facts or are uncertain that the medicine is definitely responsible for causing the reaction. However, healthcare professionals should note that even if all the facts are not available at the time of reporting, the minimum information required for a valid case (i.e. information about the patient, suspected medicine, the reaction and information about the reporter) should always be included in the report. Yes Is the patient a /an child /elderly/pregnant woman ? No Is it a serious reaction? Do you suspect an ADR? Are you unsure whether to report? No Yes Yes Yes Report Report Report Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 17 4.4 How to report? 4.4.1 How to report an ADR? Reporting of suspected ADRs can be done via the eReporting link available on the SAHPRA website. Alternatively, complete the Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)/Product Quality Problem Report Form (see Appendix B) available from the SAHPRA website (https://www.sahpra.org.za ) and email it to adr@sahpra.org.za . When completing the form, the he althcare professional should include the minimum information required for a case to be deemed valid, which is as follows: information about the patient: o patient's initials, o local identication/ reference number [any number or code that ident ies the patient to the reporter , but not to SAHPRA (e.g. hospital number; file number)], o gender , o age at time of the ADR or date of birth and o weight (if known), which medicine is suspected to have caused the reaction, o name (preferably proprietary name) , o dose, frequency and route used , o therapy date , o indication for use , o batch/lot number , o expiration date , the reaction that has occurred, o description of the reaction , o onset date of the reaction , o outcome of the reaction after use of the medicine was stopped or reduced , o information about the reaction, in instances where there is repeat exposure of the medicine , information about the reporter, o name or initials, email address and telephone number , o occupation , o health institution/facility . Further information that i s required to ensure that the report is clinically meaningful is as follows, but is not limited to: conco mitant medicines, therapy dates, other relevant patient information/ history , date of the report and relevant tests/laboratory data (if available) . These are important points to consider when reporting an ADR: It should be noted that by supplying these anonymised details a healthcare professional will not breach the confidentiality agreement they have with the patient. Although explicit consent from the patient is not required, it is best practice to inform the patient if a report will be submitted. Healthcare professionals should submit ALL the relevant information available at th e time of initial identification of an ADR, not only the minimum information required for a report. The attachment of discharge summaries, post -mortem reports, relevant laboratory data and other additional clinical data, is encouraged. Additional informati on, not available at the time of the initial report, should be provided when available, as a follow -up report (using the same reference number as the initial report) The healthcare professional who initially reported the suspected A DR is required to submit their n ames or Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 18 initials, institution, email address, telephone number and qualifications . 4.4.2 How to report an ADR? Please refer to the EPI SOP (see Appendix C). 4.4.3 Follow -up reports Any follow -up information from the healthcare professional relating to an initial ADR report submitted to SAHPRA, must be cross -referenced to the reference number (if applicable) on the initial report. The follow -up report which follows a previous (first) communication to SAHPRA must be clearly marke d that it is a follow up. This is the only reliable way to minimise duplication of reports, submitted by reporters, in the VigiFlow\u00ae system. 4.5 Who should report ADRs? All healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other health care professionals are requested to report all suspected adverse reactions to medicines (including vaccines, complementary medicines) particularly serious ADRs and those related to new medicines . Consumers should be encouraged to report all sus pected adverse drug reactions to their healthcare provider . It is vital to report an adverse drug reaction to the SAHPRA's Pharmacovigilance unit. 4.6 Where to report? All healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other health care professionals are requested to report all suspected adverse reactions to medicines (including vaccines, complementary medicines) particularly serious ADRs and those related to new medicines . Consumers should be encouraged to report all suspecte d adverse drug reactions. It is vital to report an adverse drug reaction to the SAHPRA's Pharmacovigilance unit. ADR reports should be sent to SAHPRA, Pretoria office by email: adr@sahpra.org.za ; or NADEMC (satellite of SAHPRA Pharmacovigilance unit) on fax: 021 448 6181 or relevant pharmaceutical company (contact details found on the outer package of the health product).

Communication to Healthcare Professionals Mar -2020 Guideline for Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting for Healthcare Professionals Page 19 Pharmacovigilance unit personnel need only to enter a small amount of data, this allows more time for the pharmacovigilance team to verify the coding and to conduct causality assessment of cases of interest. 4.7 What happens next? Once an ADR report has been received: SAHPRA (pharmacovigilance unit) staff capture the anonymised information on to the VigiFlow\u00ae system in a structured format; VigiFlow\u00ae system assigns a unique identification number; An acknowledgement letter (which quotes the unique identication n umber assigned to the report and the local/reference number) is sent to the reporter (provided they submitted their email address). The captured information for each report is checked for quality and comp leteness, before being sent to t he global database known as VigiBase\u00ae, where it is c onfidentially stored. At any point during this process the reporter may be asked by the S AHPRA pharmacovigilance unit to provide clarication or further information about the ADR report. The SAHPRA pharmacovigilance unit personnel, using referenced data f rom other sources (e.g. case reports in the literature; pre - and post -marketing clinical trials; epidemiological studies; record -linkage databases; data from other drug regulatory authorities) , conduct preliminary causality assessment and prepare reports on ADR cases with emerging drug safety problems . The report reviews are then present ed to the Pharmacovigilance Advisory Committee (an advisory committee of the Authority) for: signal detection; causality assessm ent between medicines and reported reactions and identification of possible risk factors contributing to the reaction. When safety concerns are identied, the overall ADR prole for the medicine is compared with the relevant therapeutic alternatives, and its benets in terms of efcacy, the therapeutic indication and target patient population(s). The Pharmacovigilance Advisory Committee advise the Authority on drug safety so that regulatory decisions can be made on whether changes in the use of a medicine are needed. Regulatory changes may include: product label change; product withdrawal/ suspension; dear healthcare professional letters (DHCPLs); press statements; medicines safety alerts; product restrictions (up -scheduling, limited packaging, limited prescribers) and educational programme.

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REPORTER? 5.1 Will reporting have any negative consequences on the healthcare profession or the patient? The adverse drug reaction report does not constitute an admission that the reporter or any other healthcare professional contributed to the adverse drug reaction in any way. The details of the report will be stored confidentially in VigiBase\u00ae database. The names of the reporter or any other health professionals named on a report and the patient will be removed before any details about a specific adverse drug reaction are used or communicated to others. The information obtained from the report will not be used for commercial purposes. The information is only meant to improve our understanding of safety in relation to the use of medicines in South Africa. 5.2 Confidentiality Strict confidentiality will be maintained by SAHPRA regarding the iden tities of the patient and the reporter.

APPENDICES APPENDIX A: CLINICAL TRIALS PROCESS FOR MEDICINES Clinical trials for pharmaceutical products are carried out in four phases, only moving from one phase to the next if the previous phase has shown promising results. The four 'ideal' phases are as follows: Phase I - the drug is tested on a small number of healthy volunteers to test how it is metabolised, whether it is safe for humans and to nd the best way of administering t he treatment. Phase II - a small number of patients are given the drug to test for side effects, activity and optimum dose, and to start comparing it to the current treatment or a placebo. Phase III - the drug is given to a larger group of patients for con tinued testing of safety and efcacy and to compare it with the current treatment or a placebo. These trials are nearly always randomised. Phase IV - this phase occurs once the drug has been licensed and checks for possible long -term side effects of the dr ug. It is also known as post -marketing surveillance.
