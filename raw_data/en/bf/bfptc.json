The NACC D is authorized to evaluate issues and programs and provide findings, advice, and recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support and enhance all -hazards public health and medical preparedness, response activities, and recovery aimed at meeting the unique needs of children, in a developmentally and socially appropriate manner, across the entire spectrum of their physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral wellbeing. The NACCD is required by section 2811A of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300hh -10b) as amended by the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (Public Law 112 - 66) and governed by the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App). The S ecretary of HHS has delegated the management and oversight of the NACCD to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The De signated Federal Official, Ms. Zhoowan Jackson , opened the meeting , conduct ed the roll call, and provided an overview of the requirements established in the FACA along with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for committee members who have been appointed by the Secretary of HHS as Special Government Employees. There were no potential conflicts of interest raised or recusals offered for this meeting. The public can participate in the work of the NACCD by attending public meetings, sending comments via email to NACCD @hhs.gov , or by volunteering to provide verbal remarks during allotted time periods in public meetings. When appropriate and time is available, public remarks that are submitted through the Q&A feature will be considered by the Board. Sweari ng-in and Induction Mr. Gregory Stewart from the HHS Office of Human Resources administered t he Oath of Office to the thirteen Special Government Employees. Page 3 of 24 ASPR Welcome Remark s1 1 These notes are a synopsis of verbal remarks rather than a transcript. Ms. Dawn O'Connell , Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Assistant Secretary O'Connell congratulated the NACCD voting and ex officio members, stressing the importance of partnership among HHS division and non -HHS agencies to promote and safeguard children's health in a whole -of-government approach. She highlighted the critical value of inputs from a wide variety of non -federal partners to advance the health and security of the nation's children in responding to and recovering from public health emergencies and disasters . Ms. O'Connell expressed appreciation for the numerous stakeholders and experts present at the meetings and supporting the work of the NACCD, including c hildren's hospitals , professional societies , state , local, regional, tribal and territorial public health authorities and leaders, schools, behavioral health and environmenta l health providers, and those who care for children with unique health care needs . The United States has reached a critical time to address the needs of children during disasters and HHS remains committed to protecting the health of our nation's children. We have experienc ed the most deadly and challenging public health emergency in modern times over the past two years and continue to learn a great deal. Though children are typically less severely affected by the SARS- COV 2 virus as compared to adults , children have been significantly affected by the pandemic. We have listened in Pediat ric Town Halls, during site visits and from interagency engagements that children's hospitals are operating at or above capacity and are experiencing staffing shortages. There are rare but important cases of children becoming critically ill with COVID -19 requiring ICU care and long -COVID is of great concern. The development of a COVID vaccine for children under five years old is still under study by FDA and we are looking forward to a potential decision soon. ASPR has been working hard to suppor t the public health and health care systems. Some examples, working across our ASPR -chaired interagency group to assess the current situation, develop and adapt response plans accordingly. ASPR is working closely with our two Pediatric Disaster Care Cent ers of Excellence grantees (Rainbow Babies and Children's at UCSF) to help in surge planning and collaboration, developing tools to advance the practice of region based pediatric disaster care, focusing on all hazards as well. Also collaborating with HHS-H RSA 's Regional Pediatric Pandemic Network working with Children's Hospitals to strengthen partnerships. ASPR has deployed the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) teams decompressing pediatric intensive care units; Project ECHO and ASPR TRACIE continu e as resources to highlight important solutions and best practices . The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA) continues to Page 4 of 24 advance an agenda for rapid development and deployment of medical countermeasures for childre n. In addition, the ASPR has recently appointed Dr. Meg Sullivan, a pediatrician, to serve as the chief medical officer of ASPR as part of her senior leadership team, and immediate office which underscores the importance of this work. Ms. O'Connell urged attention to the growing youth mental health crisis noting the U.S. Surgeon General's recently issued advisory outlining the urgent needs along with the recogn ition that mental and behavioral health are critical parts of overall health. The reduction of in -person schooling due to the pandemic, limited social opportunities, reduced access to health and social services, and the loss of caregivers have deeply impacted America's children. Youth with disabilities, LGBT+ youth, rural youth, youth involved with justice system and homeless youth, and immigrant community youth face disproportionate burdens from the pandemic. The NACCD convenes at an important time for our nation to emerge from this COVID pandemic better prepared for all -hazards adding strength and re siliency to systems that support our nation's most important asset, our children. Following Assistant Secretary O'Connell's remarks, Dr. Calderon highlighted the needs of pregnant women as one potential area of focus of the NACCD. Several members expressed a desire to align the work of the committee with ASPR priorities while not simply restating lessons learned that have yet to be implemented. Dr. Chung offered that pediatric preparedn ess has come a long way in recent years, suggesting that focusing efforts on engaging with local, tribal, and territorial governments and response networks will help advance pediatric preparedness even more. Committee members stressed the need to build on and continue the relationships formed between state, local, and federal governments, pediatric networks, public health departments, schools, and community groups during the COVID -19 pandemic to advance future preparedness. NACCD members also pointed to the child mental health crisis as an important issue related to disasters, which would require e ngaging with schools and pediatricians . Ms. O'Connell welcomed and introduce d Senators Bob Casey (D -PA) and Patty Murray (D- WA) for remarks , noting both Senators as tireless advocate s for children and families and champions for the establishment of the NACCD working hard to get it codified in the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Adv ancing Innovations Act to ensure that its work on behalf of children would continue for years to come. Page 5 of 24 Remarks from Senator Bob Casey (D -PA)2 2 Due to scheduling requirements, Senator Casey spoke to the board members just before the public meeting was officially opened. and Senator Patty Murray (D -WA) The senior Senator from Pennsylvania Bob Casey welcomed the newly appointed committee members and commented on his efforts to codify the National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters into legislation and noted his longtime advocacy for children, child health, and education. Senator Ca sey noted that this is a critical time for America's children. The COVID -19 pandemic has impacted many Pennsylvanians, with greater than 40,000 deaths in the state. Children will be affected by these losses for years. School -aged children have fallen behin d on math and reading due to pandemic -era school changes. Senator Casey also spoke on the trauma of COVID -19 and the ways in which the pandemic has exacerbated the child mental health crisis. Senator Casey noted that the NACCD's work will be important to e nsure that children's needs are considered at all levels of policy making. He closed his remarks with a thank you to the committee and for the work the NACCD will do to improve the lives of children. As Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pe nsions Committee (HELP) committee and former teacher at multiple levels, Senator Patty Murray from Washington has worked to make sure COVID -19 testing is widely available to schools and children. The Senator mentioned her work to help codify the National A dvisory Committee on Children and Disasters (NACCD) into legislation and emphasized that our nation's future response efforts must consider needs of children at all levels. As the pandemic ends, Senator Murray noted that this committee plays an important role in making sure our children remain healthy. The Senator mentioned the serious challenge of the child mental health crisis and rising suicidality of youth , noting the pandemic has tragically upended the lives of over 167,000 children who lost a parent o r a caregiver to COVID -19 including some who lost both parents as well as the deepening existing societal inequities that have been exacerbated for children of color or children with disabilities from families who are struggling due to the pandemic. Sena tor Murray also noted she is working on legislation to strength en all-hazard preparedness, expanding access to care, nutrition, trauma resources, family resources to stay safe and healthy. Introduction of the Committee Members The committee members introduced themselves during the inaugural meeting , emphasizing their pr ofessional backgrounds and interests related to the NACCD mission. Appendix 1 contains details for each of the committee members present. Page 6 of 24 Presentations Children's Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery - Lessons Learned in COVID -19 Pandemic Michael Anderson, MD , MBA, FAAP, FCCM, FAARC, Senior Advisor (CTR), ASPR Office of Emergency Management and Medical Operations3 3 Dr. Anderson's viewpoints and observations are not the official position of HHS or ASPR. M eg Sullivan, MD, MPH, Acting Chief Medical Officer, ASPR Dr. Anderson is a pediatric ICU physician, serving as a Senior Advisor (Contractor) in ASPR. Dr. Anderson presented a brief background and overview on children and disasters, experience from the COVID -19 pandemic respon se and potential areas of focus for the NACCD. Children are our succession plan and the most important asset that the nation has. Representing 22% of the population, children are vulnerable with unique physiologic, social and developmental needs when fa ced with crisis. The journey towards readiness preparing for the needs of children has been long and important. The previous work of the National Commission on Children and Disasters, the HHS Children's Interagency Leadership on Disasters (CHILD) Working Group, FEMA's Advisory Group, the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMS- C) EIIC, along with all the private sector partners such as the American Academy of Pediatrics , Children's Hospital Association, National Pediatric Disaster Coalitions and Save the Children has produced recommendations that have moved this work forward so that that NACCD is not starting from ground zero. The following topic areas are of importance for any continued discussion on how to handle preparing for events regarding children and disasters: reunification, health equity; stability of medical home; psychosocial triage, treatment and impacts; family preparation; children with special health care needs; coalition and role of children's hospitals; rapid development medical countermeasures for children; education and drills focused on children; collaboration between private sector, public health, country/state and federal resources. In the current COVID- 19 pandemic pediatric response, there has been an enormous amount of collabo rative work to address the pediatric surge issues. Recognizing some 900 kids under the age of 18 have died from COVID -19 and thousands more have been hospitalized, the long -term ramifications of the virus and illness are going to take some time to figure out - what does Page 7 of 24 MISC do long -term to cardiovascular stability in kids and what does long COVID mean in children. With CDC, HRSA, NIH and others, ASPR chairs a weekly interagency workgroup on pediatric surge working together with private sector partners review data from across the nation to assess the current situation and determine what we can do from the federal side to make sure kids are as adequately protected. Because pediatric beds are such a small percentage of overall resources, this spike has really strained the system - staff shortages and burn out, ER volumes at record numbers, the mental health crisis affecting kids across the nation. We also know that every region is different (what's true in Ohio was not necessarily true on the west coast) , having the ASPR Regional Emergency Coordinators in the field trying to figure out what the current resources are and speaking with the Pediatric Disaster Centers of Excellence (PDCOEs) weekly providing ground truth and real -time intelligence as to what t hey are seeing has been a valuable tool for the national response along with the ASPR's regional town hall meetings and site visits. Getting better at figuring out true data within a surge is going to be important for example to distinguish those admitte d for COVID -19 vs. with COVID -19 (because they are sick with COVID vs. picked up on routine screening). Also understanding the true pediatric ICU capacity - what's the role of community hospitals and the role of children's hospitals. While the urban are as with 300 bed children's hospitals that have really felt the strain, what's going on in the rural community areas that have a 10 -bed pediatric ward and maybe one step- down bed wanting to do the best for kids under enormous amounts of stress must be acknowledged. There are innovative ways of coordinating care for kids happening across the country as seen in Vermont with the American Academy of Pediatrics daily calls; Denver Children's Hospitals with their re -assignment of staff resources; Michigan's use of telemedicine in community hospital triage and support; and Connecticut's state -led mental health coordination approach. The COVID vaccine rollout for age 5 -12 is in the 30% range fully vaccinated still a lot of good work to do. Getting vaccine for kids 6 months to five years of age is a major priority for HHS and the nation as the ASPR O'Connell mentioned. In Feb ruary 2022 having one treatment for outpatient kids with COVID (intravenous Remdesivir for kids less than 12) pales in comparison to what we have for adults - two monoclonal antibodies and oral antivirals coming. Must continue to push the agenda for rapid development and deployment of medical countermeasures for children Dr. Anderso n proposed a list of issues for the NACCD to begin considering, though this is not intended to be a limitation on other issues : 1. R esponse/surge elements a. N DMS capabilities Page 8 of 24 b. Inter -state; intra -state response c. Telehealth support d. Education e. Medical home stability and integration f. Mental health capacity g. Health equity 2. Obtaining useful data a. Pediatric capacity b. Disease burden 3. Medical countermeasures a. Rapid development b. BARDA agenda 4. Coalitions and preparedness a. PDCOE/RDHRS pilot projects b. Long- term model and support Following Dr. Anderson, Dr. Sullivan (Chief Medical Officer, ASPR) highlighted the i mportance and effectiveness of partnerships in the response efforts at the local, state and federal levels . As a pediatrician and public health professional who spent much of the first two years of the pandemic on the ground in North Carolina at the local level helping to lead the COVID -19 response, she saw firsthand many of the challenges highlighted by other speakers , specifically the impacts of mental health and disparities in health outcomes affecting children and families . There is a n eed to solidify and build upon partnerships and to engage and learn from experts as we work to address the challenges going forward . The ASPR and her team are committed to working with this committee to help address and prepare for these unique challenges. AS PR Pediatric Disaster Care Centers of Excellence Andrew Garrett, MD, MPH, Senior Advisor (IPA), ASPR, Emergency Management and Medical Operations Dr . Garrett presented on the r egional Pediatric Disasters Centers of Excellence (PDCoE). HHS has been both leader and partner in pediatric disaster preparedness and s upports communities with disaster response operations upon request , while also s triving for equitable access for children to countermeasures, therapeutics, and vaccines. HHS has had an important role in developing information and sharing such actionable information. ASPR also supports cooperative agreements that highlight this critical regional preparedness strateg y and to achieve scalable disaster health care capabilities. The Western States Alliance for Pediatric Emergency Management (WRAP -EM) and Eastern Great Lakes Pediatric Consortium for Disaster Response (E GLPCDR) were the two regional pilot Page 9 of 24 projects awarded in 2019 under the PDC oE cooperative agreement . The projects brought together stakeholders from multistate regions that include medical and behavioral health, legal and emergency management, emergency services, police and fire departments, legal, and public health. The goal was to find and share tools, information, and resources to reduce the impact of trauma, emerging infectious diseases, burns, etc . Following the creation, they had to shift almost immediately into COVID -19 response. S ince the inception the centers have hosted series of meetings that are open to the public and convened tabletop exercises. W hen asked about deployable assets specific to pediatrics, Dr. Garret t stated that there is a role for local preparedness and federal support . There is still work that can be done to expand state and local jurisdictions to work together for disaster planning and preparedness. A singular approach cannot work in handling all different disasters. D r. Garrett was asked what he envisioned would be next for the pilot projects and how to address all the areas that are severely underserved . Dr. Garrett specified his answer would be a personal one. The next step would be to identify what direction this project would take. It could be entirely federal or a hybrid of federal, local, and regional layered approach. Identifying needs would be the most important first step, not to assume what will be requested but wait for actual requests from experts. Federal staff would have to work with experts on the ground and regional stakeholders who know the situation to codevelop with them what they need. HR SA Regional Pandemic Preparedness Network (RPPN) Sara Kinsman, MD, PhD, Director of the Division of Child and Family Health, Maternal and Child Health Bureau , HRSA D r. Kinsman stated that HRSA's mission is to improve the health and well -being of America's mothers, children, and families. HRSA's vision is to help build an America where all mothers, children, and families are thriving and reach their full potential. The bureau supports the maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting programs, or MIECHV programs, the healthy start home visiting programs, and the T itle V maternal and child health block grant. Together, these programs reach 92% of all pregnant women, 98% of infants, and 60% of children nationwide. MCHB's Division of C hild, Adolescent and Family Health mission is to advance health promotion, strengthen approaches to injury prevention, and improve and expand emergency medical services and emergency preparedness for children, adolescents , and their families. T he RPPN coordinates the Nation's children's hospitals and their communities in preparing for and responding to global health threats, including the coordination, preparation, response, and real- time dissemination of research -informed pediatric care for future pan demics. The Network Page 10 of 24 is comprised of five children's hospitals and their affiliated university pediatric partners in geographically diverse areas across the United States that work collaboratively across institutions to plan and implement the work of this c ooperative agreement. The Pediatrics Pandemic Network coordinates the Nation's children's hospitals and other pediatric experts to strengthen partnerships with existing local, state, regional, and national emergency preparedness systems to ensure the needs of all children are addressed within preparedness and response activities. When asked about safe births during catastrophes , Dr. Kinsman emphasized the importance of planning for safe birthing even during disasters. Ad dressing the Long -term Mental Hea lth Impact of COVID -19 on Children and Families Melissa Brymer, PhD, Psy.D., UCLA -Duke University National Center for Child Traumatic Stress T he National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) was created by Congress in 2000 as part of the Children's Health Act to raise the standard of care and increase access to services for children and families who experience or witness traumatic events. This unique network of frontline providers, family members, researchers, and national partners is committed to changing the course of children's lives by improving their care and moving scientific gains quickly into practice across the U.S. The NCTSN is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and coordinated b y the UCLA -Duke University National Center for Child Traumatic Stress (NCCTS) . Understanding the impacts of C OVID -19 has been a t wo-year endeavor by surveying network partners , having conversations about how families and kids are impacted by covid , and understanding h ow to prioritize or narrow do wn the scope . From this endeavor five think tanks were created centering on : grief and loss; disparities; schools; suicides and substance abuse; and maltreatment and interpersonal violence. There is a need to focus on grief from loss of primary or secondary caretakers. A disproportionate number of children have lost loved ones in African American , Latino, and Native populations. Traditional end -of-life rituals have been disrupted. Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a new diagnosis , is common in children whose families have faced COVID -19 related hardships. There is a direct need to help children having difficulties in grieving access adequate mental health care and support caregivers of bereaved children. The is an increased risk of substance use and suicide among youth. Evidence suggests an increase in intentional self- harm. Emergency rooms are full and delay care for kids who are at risk for suicidality. The a vailability of drugs has changed and isolation for youth mean s there are fewer people to call for treatment. A drastic disruption in service delivery was also noted . There is also a higher risk of suicide among African American youth. Page 11 of 24 Maltreatment and interpersonal violence and having to shelter in place with abusers is a major concern . Job loss, financial strain, food insecurity, and housing issues, are all stressors that worsen treatment and interpersonal violence. Children in government -run facilities such as juvenile detenti on and foster homes are having to face increased disruptions in familial visits and disruption in care from staff. School systems are strugglin g with disrupted routines. Services for disabled students are less readily adaptable to virtual provision and r educed school -based services. For youth across the board there are lost milestones and a loss in education . Public Comments In the Federal Register Notice of this Public Meeting, members of the p ublic were offered the opportunity to both provide written comments and to address the NACCD in person on the topic of needs, challenges, opportunities, and priorities for the upcoming work of the NACCD to address the unique needs of children and families in dis asters - preparedness, response and recovery . Comment: Pediatric preparedness needs to be at the forefront of preparedness and response planning . Lessons learned from the COVID- 19 pandemic provide an opportunity within emergency and trauma care systems to plan more effectively and evaluate existing strategies, policies, and procedures to better address the needs of children. Stakeholders suggested improving regional- level disaster response through increased training opportunities. Comment: M enta l health and chronic diseases will be important to address during disaster response . Stakeholders suggested a holistic and trauma -informed approach for addressing pediatric chronic health conditions and the vulnerable populations who may be most affected with consideration given to connecting children, adolescents, and families to support groups and social services. Stakeholders queried how the committee will plan to address health equity and the downstream effects of the pandemic on education, healthcare, mental health, and traumatic stress. The public emphasized the need to build resilience for children and their families to mitigate the effects of all- hazard disasters. Comment: Streamlining of FDA requirements to make MCMs for children more rapidly available during the pandemic were critical and the NACCD could focus efforts to enable broader MCM access for children and their families. Page 12 of 24 These subject matter experts addressed the NACCD during the meeting: C.J. Huff , Ed.D , Retired Public School Superintendent; Special Advisor for Education and Community Leadership, Safe and Sound Schools; Founder, Bright Futures, Joplin, MO. Dr. Huff worked as a superintendent in Joplin, Missouri during public health emergencies and has experience coordina ting response with HHS and FEMA. He gave a brief overview of his experience in recovery efforts during Hurricanes Maria and Michael and his deployment to support wildfire recovery as it relates to school systems. Dr. Huff remarked that it is important to take care of our nation's educators and their long -term mental health, in addition to children's mental health. He underscored the importance of schools during recovery. He recognized the difficulties in mounting a regional response and getting communities to work together; advancing connections made during COVID- 19 and bringing communities together before a disaster happens will be essential. He closed by stating that resilient youth are only as resilient as the communities that support them, so community resilience should be a priority for the NACCD. Kevin Arthur , UCEM, CHEC II, Manger, Emergency Management Programs, Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Arthur has experience as an emergency manager in children's healthcare and briefly highlighted his work in establishing the pediatric readiness network in his region of Utah. He noted the importance of ensuring the needs of children are met from the momen t disaster strikes and through recovery. His network in Utah offers pediatric disaster training and has unique experience in rural frontier and tribal areas. The readiness group works with Utah's Emergency Medical Services for Children program to provide monthly evidence - based lectures to expand expertise and training on topics and makes these trainings accessible online. Mr. Arthur stated that a multidisciplinary approach to readiness is essential for critical access facilities. He closed by stating that we must be able to meet the needs of children in areas that are lower resourced and provide resources to caregivers. Deanna Dahl -Grove, MD, FAAP , Professor of Pediatrics, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH . Dr. Dahl -Grove is a pediatric emergency physician in the Division of Emergency Medicine at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. She is the Principal Investigator of one of ASPR's Pediatric Centers of Excellence. He r center has worked to curate educational tools and infographics and has worked with family networks to assist families during response. She noted that her center has worked regionally during response and expanded the number of individuals trained in trau ma-informed care. Her team has created a hazard vulnerability tool for hospitals to better understand their level of emergency preparedness for children and families; Dr. Dahl - Grove commented on the importance of regional response networks during response and leveraging partnerships. She looks forward to continuing to support the work of the ASPR Page 13 of 24 Pediatric Centers of Excellence and collaborat ing with states to improve the national framework to address the needs of children during disasters. Steven Krug , MD, Chair of Council on Children and Disasters, American Academy of Pediatrics, Washington, DC . Dr. Krug serves as Chair of the Council on Children and Disasters at the American Academy of Pediatrics. He encouraged ASPR to leverage the NACCD's expertise going forward to ensure that children are included at all levels of the disaster cycle, from preparedness to recovery. He noted t hat the NACCD should focus on best practices and implementation science. He offered that the NACCD should elevate health equity in preparedness and response planning, noting that not all children are affected equally during disasters. Dr. Krug also considered the status of medical countermeasures available to children and offered that the Committee consider child access to therapeutics going forward. Dr. Krug noted the growing child and adolescent mental health crisis and highlighted this as an area where t he NACCD can help. He closed his remarks with a discussion on misinformation and the public's lack of trust in evidence -based decision making; he suggested the NACCD work to address mistrust of public health. Wrap -Up Regarding immediate next steps with the Committee, Ms. Jackson indicated plans for monthly administrative meetings which are non -public starting in March where the first order of business will be selecting a Chairperson for the Committee. Once the NACCD determines the priority issues/topics it will focus on, working groups will be established for committee members to deliberate and propose recommendations that will be share d with the public. The NAACD anticipates two public meetings a year. The next public meeting will occur in the fall/winter. Questions captured from the Zoom Q&A, chat and NACCD resource mailbox will be made available to the Committee. Additional questions or follow -up should be directed to the NACCD@hhs.gov . The meeting adjourned at approximately 4:01 pm EST. PRE-DECISIONAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Page 14 of 24 Appendix 1: Meet the Committee Members Voting Members Claire L.
