I originally started to see her to resolve some digestive issues and to see if she could help with secondary infertility (unexplained). With her advice (a few changes to my diet and a few supplements), my digestion issues dramatically improved within about 30 days. With my fertility journey, the short version is, I became pregnant within 6 months of my first appointment after trying to conceive our second child for almost 4 years! With her advice and guidance, my cycles started to return to their normal length and shortly after, I found out I was pregnant. Dr. Allen continued to provide guidance throughout my pregnancy (which was a wonderful pregnancy) and I had a wonderful birthing experience (unmedicated vbac after about 6 hours of labor). My son is a healthy laid back child. I don't think I would be holding my easy going son today if it were not for her support, guidance and knowledge. She listens with compassion and her recommendations are practical and more importantly, effective.
