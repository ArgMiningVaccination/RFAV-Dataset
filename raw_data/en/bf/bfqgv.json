FERPA information (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, discussed in Chapter 7) . The notice must list and briefly describe the information and tell students how to obtain it. It must be provided on an individual basis through an appropriate mailing or publication, including direct mailing through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronic mail. Posting on an Internet or intranet website does not constitute a notice. Web dissemination A school may meet the requirements for the general disclosures and the EADA, security, and fire safety reports by posting the information online. Enrolled students or current employees\u2014 the school may post the information on an Internet website or an intranet website that is reasonably accessible to its students and employees. Prospective students or prospective employees \u2014the school may post the information on an Internet website. A school that uses Internet or intranet disclosure for this purpose must include in its annual notice to enrolled students the exact electronic address of the information and a statement that the school will provide a paper copy of the information on request.Consumer information HEA Sec. 485(f); 20 USC 1092 of school staff: 34 CFR 668.44Consumer Information & School Reports This chapter describes information that a school must disclose to the public and report to the Department. This is information about: financial aid; the school's campus, facilities, student athletes, and gainful employment programs; as well as campus security and fire safety, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, and programs about them. The chapter also discusses counseling for students receiving FSA loans and disclosures that must be made for private education loans. Additonal disclosure requirements that are specific to disbursements of FSA loans are described in Volume 4. Suggestions for disseminating HEA-required information The National Postsecondary Education Cooperative (NPEC) issued Information Required to Be Disclosed Under the Higher Education Act of 1965: Suggestions for Dissemination (NPEC 2010-831). This publication is available at http://nces.ed.gov . Note: NPEC was established by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1995 as a voluntary organization comprising federal agencies, postsecondary schools, associations, and others with an interest in postsecondary education data collection. The information and opinions in NPEC publications do not necessarily represent the policy or views of the U.S. Department of Education.Sample notice of FERPA rights You can find a sample notification at ED's FERPA website: HB August 2014With Internet or intranet distribution of the security and fire safety reports to current employees, a school must distribute to them by October 1 of each year a notice that includes a statement of the reports' availability, the exact electronic address at which they are posted, a brief description of their contents, and a statement that the school will provide a paper copy of the reports upon request. The same information must be included in a notice to prospective students and employees if a school decides to use the Web to provide annual security or fire safety reports to them. The difference is that there is no annual date for distribution of this notice; also note that the school must use an Internet, rather than an intranet, site. Availability of employees for information dissemination purposes A school must designate an employee or group of employees who shall be available on a full-time basis to assist enrolled or prospective students in obtaining information on the school, financial assistance, graduation and completion rates, security policies, and crime statistics, as described in the following sections. If the school designates one person, he shall be available upon reasonable notice to any enrolled or prospective student throughout the normal administrative working hours of the school. If more than one person is designated, their combined work schedules must be arranged so that at least one of them is available upon reasonable notice throughout the normal administrative working hours of the school. The Department may waive this requirement if the school's total enrollment or the portion participating in the FSA programs is too small to necessitate an employee or group of employees being available on a full-time basis. The school must request this waiver from the Department. GENERAL STUDENT DISCLOSURES A school must make the following information available to any enrolled or prospective student through appropriate publications, mailings, or electronic media. Financial assistance available to students At a minimum, the school must publish and make readily available to current and prospective students a description of all the federal, state, local, private, and institutional need-based and non-need-based student financial assistance programs available to them. For each of these financial aid programs, the information provided by the school must describe the procedures and forms by which students apply for assistance, the student eligibility requirements, the criteria for selecting recipients from the group of eligible applicants, and the criteria for determining the amount of a student's award.Civil penalty In addition to limiting, suspending, or terminating the participation of any school that fails to comply with the consumer information requirements, the Department may impose civil fines of up to $27,500 for each violation. Civil penalty Sec. 487(c)(3)(B) of the HEA Explaining verification requirements Although it is not among the financial aid disclosures given to all students, you should be aware of the following information that must be provided in writing to students who are selected for verification: 1. Documents required for verification. 2. Student responsibilities\u2014including correction procedures, deadlines for completing any actions required, and the consequences of missing the deadlines. 3.

We provide comprehensive student aid information to students and their families through the Student Aid on the Web site ( http:// studentaid.ed.gov ). Colleges and high schools may order bulk quantities of student/borrower publications such as the College Preparation Checklist from the FSA Pubs website ( www.fsapubs.gov ). Statutory requirement: HEA Sec. 485 College affordability website The Department's College Affordability and Transparency Center (www.collegecost.ed.gov/ ) contains information for students, parents, and policymakers about costs at America's colleges. The website allows users to view schools by sector with the highest and lowest tuition and net prices (the price of attendance after considering all grant and scholarship aid). It has the College Scorecard, which displays the typical student cost, graduation rate, loan default rate, and median borrowing amount for the school one types in. The site also links to the net price calculators for many schools and to the College Navigator website, which allows students to search for schools they might want to attend according to various criteria.Prospective student One who has requested from an eligible school information about enrolling there or who has been contacted by the school directly, or indirectly through advertising, about enrolling.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-104 FSA HB August Tuition and fees charged to full-time and part-time students.

A list of postsecondary schools with which the school has established an articulation agreement.Net Price Calculator All Title IV schools that enroll full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduate students must have on their website a net price calculator. The net price is defined as the cost of attendance minus the average yearly grant and scholarship aid. The calculator provides estimated net price information to current and prospective students and should be based, as much as possible, on their individual circumstances. ED's National Center for Education Statistics has developed a template that schools can use to create their own customized net price calculator, or they can develop their own calculator. If they develop their own, it must include at a minimum the same data elements found in the Department's calculator template. The Net Price Calculator Information Center at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ resource/net_price_calculator.asp provides the template as well as FAQs, a zipped file with links to other schools' calculators, and resources for schools to develop their own calculators. See also GEN-13-07.

(This information is to be provided through a website or other means.) Sample statement of penalties for copyright infringement A school may use this sample statement to meet the requirement that it disseminate a summary of the penalties for violating federal copyright law. The use of this sample summary is optional. Summary of Civil and Criminal Penalties for Violation of Federal Copyright Laws Copyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United States Code). These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file-sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement. Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or \"statutory\" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For \"willful\" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees. For details, see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505. Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense. For more information, please see the website of the U.S. Copyright Office at www.copyright.gov .Financial Aid Shopping Sheet The Shopping Sheet is a resource to help consumers understand their educational costs and the aid available to meet those costs. It is a single page the Department developed that may be used as a stand-alone award letter or as a cover sheet with an institution's existing award letter. The standard format helps consumers easily compare the cost of attendance and aid awards across schools. Use of the Shopping Sheet is voluntary, though we encourage institutions to adopt it for their students. Also, for schools that receive federal funds under the military and veterans educational benefits programs, use of the Shopping Sheet helps meet a disclosure requirement of Executive Order 13607 (see the end of Chapter 3 ). See www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/ guid/aid-offer/index.html for more information, including links to guidance and implementation resources, and see DCL GEN-13-26 for the latest template and specifications.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-106 FSA HB August 2014COMPLETION, GRADUATION, TRANSFER, RETENTION, AND PLACEMENT RATES (STUDENT RIGHT-TO-KNOW) Each year a school must determine the completion or graduation rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students and report it to the Department via the IPEDS website (see sidebar). If the school's mission includes providing substantial preparation for students to enroll in another eligible school, it must also determine the transfer-out rate of its certificate- or degree-seeking, first-time, full-time undergraduate students. The annual rates are based on the 12-month period that ended August 31 of the prior year. The rates will track the outcomes for students for whom 150% of the normal time for completion or graduation has elapsed. Normal time is the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically four years for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution, two years for an associate degree in a standard term-based institution, and the various scheduled times for certificate programs. (See the IPEDS instructions for further details on calculating the rate.) A school must make these annual rates available to the public no later than July 1st. With requests from prospective students, the information must be made available prior to them enrolling or entering into any financial obligation with the school. Retention, placement, & post-graduate study The school must also provide information on Its retention rate reported to IPEDS. The information must be made available to prospective students requesting it prior to them enrolling or entering into any financial obligation with the institution. The placement of, and types of employment obtained by, graduates of the school's degree or certificate programs. Placement rate information may be gathered from state data systems, alumni or student satisfaction surveys, the school's placement rate for any program, if it calculates such a rate, or other relevant sources. If the school calculates a placement rate, it must disclose that rate. For any 4-year program at the school, the types of graduate and professional education in which its graduates enroll. This information may be gathered from state data systems, alumni or student satisfaction surveys, or other relevant sources. In the case of placement information and the types of graduate and professional education, the school must identify the source of the information as well as any time frames and methodology associated with it.Reporting rates to IPEDS The graduation, completion, and transfer-out rates are reported through the Department's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) website. The IPEDS survey is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). More information is at www.nces.ed.gov/ IPEDS . Survey forms, instructions, FAQs, worksheets, and other infomation are posted at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/ VisIndex.aspx . Information can only be reported to this system by the school's designated \"keyholder.\" Schools may change keyholders any time during the year by contacting the IPEDS Help Desk at 1-877-225-2568 or ipedshelp@rti.org or by contacting Tara Lawley 202-502-7476 IPEDS Universe Coordinator Rm 8113B 1990 K St NW Washington, DC 20006 Optional calculations In addition to calculating the completion or graduation rate as described, a school may, but is not required to 1. Calculate a completion or graduation rate for students who transfer into the school; 2. Calculate a completion or graduation rate for students who have left school to serve in the armed forces, on official church missions, or with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps, or who are totally and permanently disabled; and 3. Calculate a transfer-out rate, even if the school determines that its mission does not include providing substantial preparation for its students to enroll in another eligible school. 34 CFR 668.45(f)Ch. 6\u2014Consumer Information & School 668.45DISCLOSURES AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS A school must disclose certain information about each of its gainful employment programs to prospective students: the occupations that the program prepares students to enter (by occupation name and SOC code), with links to occupational profiles on the O*NET website (see sidebar); the program length (the normal time to complete the program); the on-time graduation rate for students completing the program; the tuition and fees the school charges a student for completing the program within normal time, the cost of room and board if applicable, and the typical costs for books and supplies (unless those costs are included as part of tuition and fees); the job placement rate for students completing the program; the median loan debt incurred by students who completed the program (separately by FSA loans, private educational loans, and institutional financing plans, as described later); and other information the Department provided to the school about the program. Your school may include information on other costs, such as transportation and living expenses, but it must provide a Web link or access to the cost information discussed earlier. Disseminating information about gainful employment programs The school must include the required information in promotional materials it makes available to prospective students and post the information on its websites. The information must be provided in a simple and meaningful manner on the homepage of the school's program website in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used Web search applications. An open format is one that is platform-independent, is machine-readable, and is made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the reuse of that information. Any other webpage containing general, academic, or admissions information about the program must provide a prominent and direct link to the single webpage that contains all the required information. Median loan debt As noted, schools must disclose the median loan debt incurred by students who complete a gainful employment program. The disclosure must show the school's calculation of median debt\u2014broken down by debt from FSA (Direct and FFEL) loans, private education loans, and institutional financing\u2014until the Department provides that information.CIP & SOC codes Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes are developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes are listed on the Occupational Information Network (www.onetonline.org ). You may identify the occupations for each of your programs by entering the program's full 6-digit crosswalk ). Your school may provide Web links to a representative sample of the identified occupations (by name and SOC code) for which its graduates typically find employment within a few years after completing the program.Additional information on IFAP The Gainful Employment page on IFAP includes links to frequently asked questions and resources such as electronic announcments, webinars, and regulatory materials. http://ifap.ed.gov/ GainfulEmploymentInfo/Copyright information The sample statement and other copyright requirements are included in GEN 10-08. See Chapter 7 for the requirement to develop copyright policies: 34 CFR 668.43(a)(10)College Navigator site Note that your school's graduation rates are displayed on the IPEDS College Navigator site. http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator Retention rates 34 2014-20152-108 FSA HB August 2014Placement rates The placement rates for students completing a gainful employment program are to be determined under a methodology developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) when that methodology is available. In the meantime, if the school is required by its accrediting agency or state to calculate a placement rate on a program basis, it must disclose the rate under this section and identify the accrediting agency or state agency under whose requirements the rate was calculated. If the accrediting agency or state requires a school to calculate a placement rate at the institutional level or other than a program basis, the school must use the accrediting agency or state methodology to calculate a placement rate for the program and disclose that rate. CAMPUS CRIME & SAFETY INFORMATION A school must distribute annual campus security reports to its students and employees. If it maintains on-campus student housing, it must also disseminate an annual fire safety report. The reports that are disseminated to the school community must include descriptions of the school's policies, procedures, and programs. These reports must include the campus security and fire safety statistics reported to the Department each year (explained later in this section). Crime log Schools must have policies that encourage complete, timely reporting of all crimes to the campus police and appropriate law enforcement agencies. If they have a campus police or security department, they must keep a written, easily understood, daily crime log. The log must list any crime by the date it was reported to the campus police or security department and that occurred on campus, in a noncampus building, on public or a noncampus property, or within the police or security department's patrol jurisdiction. The log must also include the nature, date, time, and general location of each crime and the disposition of the complaint if known. The school must make an entry or an addition to an entry to the log within two business days (Monday-Friday, except days when the school is closed) of the report of the information to the campus police or security department unless that disclosure is prohibited by law or would jeopardize the confidentiality of the victim. A school may withhold one or more of the required pieces of information if there is clear and convincing evidence that the release of the information would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, or result in the destruction of evidence.GE Disclosure Template 34 CFR 668.6(b)(2)(iv) Effective January 31, 2014, schools must use the GE Disclosure Template developed by the Department (http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/ reg/hearulemaking/2009/ negreg-summerfall.html ) to create webpages with the required disclosure information for their gainful employment programs. For each GE program, you will enter your OPEID and the CIP code and credential level of the program. You will include other information about the program, and the template will produce the disclosure page that you will host on your website. The homepage for the GE program must have a prominent link to that disclosure page, and any other webpage that has general, academic, or admissions information about the program must have a prominent link to either the program homepage or the disclosure page. See the electronic announcement from 11/22/13 for more information and a link to the Department's template website. Calculating the on-time graduation (completion) rate 34 CFR 668.6(c) The above regulation explains how to calculate an on-time completion rate for GE programs: for the most recently completed award year, divide the number of students who completed the GE program within normal time by the total number of students who completed the program, and multiply the result by 100%. Example: The court reporting program at Krieger University is a GE program. During the 2013-2014 award year, 140 students completed the program, and 105 of them completed in normal time. Divide 105 by 140 to get .75. Then multiply .75 by 100% to get 75%, which is the completion rate for this program.Ch. 6\u2014Consumer Information & School Reports 2-109 FSA HB August 2014However, the school must disclose any information withheld for any of these reasons once the adverse effect is no longer likely to occur. The school must make the crime log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours. The school must make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Fire safety A school that has any on-campus student housing facility must maintain a written, easily understood log that records, by the date that the fire was reported, any fire that occurred in an on-campus student housing facility. This log must include the nature, date, time, and general location of each fire. The school must: make an entry or an addition to an entry to the log within two business days of the receipt of the information, make the fire log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours, and make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. A school must annually submit a copy of the fire safety statistics to the Department and include the fire safety statistics in its annual report to the campus community. Annual submission of campus security & fire safety statistics Each year in the late summer, the Department sends a letter and a certificate to the school's president or chief executive officer. The certificate includes the user ID and password needed to access the Campus Safety and Security Survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/security ), where schools submit statistics for the crimes described in the margin note and for fire safety (see below). The website explains how to tabulate these statistics. Schools with any on-campus student housing facility must submit annual fire safety statistics to the Department. The report must include statistics on the number and causes of fires, as well as fire-related injuries, death, and property damage for each on-campus student housing facility during the three most recent calendar years for which data are available. The fire safety statistics are due at the same time as the crime statistics.Crimes to be reported to campus community 34 CFR 688.46(c)(1) (i) Criminal homicide: (A) Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.

(8) Plans for future improvements in fire safety, if determined necessary by the institution. Bookstores and safety reporting If a school contracts with an entity to provide bookstore services and the bookstore is located on-campus, or if it is in any off-campus building or property owned or controlled by the school, the school must include the bookstore among the locations for which it reports campus crime and safety information as provided in 34 CFR 668.46. For more information on campus safety reporting requirements, see The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting . DCL GEN-12-21Crime & fire data on the Web The Department posts the campus crime statistics and fire safety statistics for participating schools on the Web at: http://ope.ed.gov/security/ Crime statistics are also posted on the Department's College Navigator site: http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/ Fire safety Fire safety requirements were added by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 HEA 485(i) 34 CFR 668.49Distributing security and fire safety reports to enrolled students & current employees By October 1 of each year, a school must distribute to all enrolled students and current employees its annual security report and fire safety reports through appropriate publications and mailings including direct mailing to each individual through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or electronic mail; a publication or publications provided directly to each individual; or posting on an Internet or intranet website (see conditions for Web distribution at the beginning of this chapter). The two reports can be published together or separately. If published together, the title of the document must clearly state that it contains both the Annual Security Report and the Annual Fire Safety Report. If published separately, each report must contain information on how to directly access the other report. Disseminating reports to prospective students & employees For each of the reports, the school must provide a notice to prospective students and prospective employees that includes a statement of the report's availability, a description of its contents, and an opportunity to request a copy. A school must provide its annual security report and annual fire safety report, upon request, to a prospective student or prospective employee. If the school chooses to provide either its annual security report or annual fire safety report to prospective students and prospective employees by posting the disclosure on an Internet website, the school must follow the procedures for Web dissemination described earlier.Definitions On-campus student housing facility \u2014a dormitory or other residential facility for students that is located on a school's campus. Campus \u2014any building or property owned or controlled by a school within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area and used by the school in direct support of, or in a manner related to, its educational purposes, including residence halls.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-112 FSA HB August 2014Missing persons procedures A school that provides on-campus student housing must establish a missing student notification policy and include a description of the policy in its annual security report to the campus community. The policy must include a list of titles of the persons or organizations to which students, employees, or other individuals should report that a student has been missing for 24 hours; require that any missing student report be referred immediately to the school's police or campus security department (if the school doesn't have such a department, it must refer the report to the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area); and include an option for each student to identify a contact person or persons whom the school shall notify within 24 hours of a determination (by the school's police or campus security department or the local law enforcement agency) that the student is missing. Students must be advised that their contact information will be registered confidentially, that this information will be accessible only to authorized campus Clery/Campus Security Act The full title of the Clery Act is the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. It has been amended several times, most recently by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) enacted March 7, 2013. Among other provisions, VAWA requires institutions to compile statistics for certain crimes that are reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies, including incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Schools must also include certain policies, procedures, and programs pertaining to these crimes in their annual security reports. Beginning with the annual security report schools issue by October 1, 2014, these crime statistics must be included for calendar years 2011, 2012, and 2013, and they will also be reported to the Department through the web-based data collection in October 2014. Final regulations to implement these statutory changes to the Clery Act will not be effective until the Department completes the rule- making process. Until those regulations are issued, we expect schools to make a good faith effort to comply with the statutory requirements and effective date and to include statistics for the new crime categories for calendar year 2013 in the annual security report due in October 2014. But we understand that a school might not have complete statistics for the year when those must be reported to the Department. See the electronic announcement from May 29, 2013. HEA Sec. 485(f) 20 U.S.C. 1092(f) 34 CFR 668.46Sample statement of availability Schools may use the following sample notice from the Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting (www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/ handbook.pdf ) to inform students and employees of the availability of its Combined Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report: CNO University is committed to assisting all members of the CNO community in providing for their own safety and security. The annual security and fire safety compliance document is available on the UPD website at http://_______.edu If you would like to receive the combined Annual Security and Fire Safety Report that contains this information, you can stop by the University Police Department at 2033 Canal Street, NW, Mercer Building, Washington, DC, 20052 or you can request that a copy be mailed to you by calling (XXX) XXX-XXXX. The website and booklet contain information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures, and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. They also contain information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by CNO; and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. This information is required by law and is provided by The CNO University Police Department.Ch. 6\u2014Consumer Information & School Reports 2-113 FSA HB August 2014officials, and that it may not be disclosed, except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation; if they are under 18 years of age and not emancipated, the school must notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing, in addition to notifying any additional contact person designated by the student; and the school will notify the local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing unless the local law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student is missing. When a student who resides in an on-campus student housing facility is determined to have been missing for 24 hours, the school must notify within 24 hours the contact person (if the student has designated one), and the student's custodial parent or guardian (if the student is less than 18 years old and is not emancipated). In all cases, the school must inform the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area within 24 hours that the student is missing. Emergency response & evacuation A school must develop emergency response and evacuation procedures and include a description of its procedures in its annual security report to the campus community. A school must develop procedures to immediately notify the campus community upon the confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on the campus. At a minimum, schools must have procedures to confirm that a significant emergency or dangerous situation (as described above) exists; determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community to receive a notification, the content of the notification; and to initiate the notification system; disseminate emergency information to the larger community; and test the emergency response and evacuation procedures on at least an annual basis, including announced or unannounced tests. The school must compile a list of the titles of those persons or organizations responsible for determining whether an emergency or dangerous situation exists and who are authorized to initiate the notification process and include this information in the annual report.Missing persons procedures\u2014 private right of action The requirements for a school to establish missing persons procedures do not provide a private right of action to any person to enforce a provision of the subsection or create a cause of action against any institution of higher education or any employee of the institution for any civil liability. HEA section 485(j)Handbook for campus crime reporting To assist schools in fully complying with the Clery Act, the Department has developed The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting . The handbook defines the categories of crime and procedures for reporting them, as well as the requirements for timely warnings and maintenance of a daily crime log. The handbook is available at: www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/ campus.html . Definition of \"test\" Regularly scheduled drills, exercises, and appropriate follow-through activities designed for assessment and evaluation of emergency plans and capabilities. Publicizing procedures The school must publicize its emergency response and evacuation procedures in conjunction with at least one test per calendar year. The school must document each test with a description of the exercise, stating the date and time, and indicating whether it was announced or unannounced.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-114 FSA HB August 2014In an emergency or a dangerous situation, a school must, without delay and accounting for the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate the notification system unless issuing a notification will, in the judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. Timely warning & emergency notification A school must, in a manner that is timely and will aid in the prevention of similar crimes, report to the campus community on crimes that are included in campus crime statistics, such as arson, robbery, burglary, motor vehicle theft, aggravated assault, criminal homicides, and sex offenses (see a full listing in the sidebar on page 109), or reported to local police agencies or to campus security authorities (as identified under the school's statement of current campus policies), and considered by the school to represent a threat to students and employees. A school is not required to provide a timely warning with respect to crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, a school must follow its emergency notification procedures. A school that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the school must provide adequate follow-up information to the community as needed. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION A school that participates in the FSA programs must provide to its students, faculty, and employees information to prevent drug and alcohol abuse, and it must also have a drug and alcohol prevention program, as discussed later. In addition, a school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must have a drug-free awareness program for its employees that includes a notice to them of unlawful activities and the actions the school will take against an employee who violates these prohibitions. Information to be included in drug prevention materials for students and employees A school must provide the following in its materials: information on preventing drug and alcohol abuse; standards of conduct that clearly prohibit, at a minimum, the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of drugs and alcohol by students and employees on the school's property or as part of the school's activities;Drug-Free Workplace The FSA requirements are derived from the 1989 Amendments to the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Acts of 1986 and 1988. See Public Law 101-226. Because a school applies for and receives its Campus-Based allocation directly from the Department, the school is considered to be a federal grant recipient and as such is required to make a good faith effort on a continuing basis to maintain a drug-free workplace. 34 CFR Part 84 Also see the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690)Drug and alcohol prevention Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (Public Law 101-226) Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690) 34 CFR 84 Government-Wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace 34 CFR 86 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention 34 CFR 668.14(c) Notice of penalties A school must provide to every student, upon enrollment, a separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice with information on the penalties associated with drug-related offenses (see Volume 1 of the Handbook for a description of the penalties). Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 HEA section 485(k)Ch. 6\u2014Consumer Information & School Reports 2-115 FSA HB August 2014 a description of the sanctions under local, state, and federal law for unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol; a description of any drug and alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation programs available to students and employees; a description of the health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and alcohol; and a clear statement that the school will impose sanctions on students and employees for violations of the standards of conduct (consistent with local, state, and federal law) and a description of these sanctions, up to and including expulsion, termination of employment, and referral for prosecution. Distribution of materials to all students and employees The school may include this information in publications such as student or employee handbooks, provided that these publications are distributed to each student and employee. Merely making drug prevention materials available to those who wish to take them is not sufficient. The school must use a method that will reach every student and employee, such as the method used to distribute grade reports or paychecks. The school must distribute these materials annually. If new students enroll or new employees are hired after the initial distribution for the year, the school must make sure that they also receive the materials. Drug & alcohol abuse prevention program Every participating school must certify that on the date it signs the Program Participation Agreement it has a drug and acohol abuse prevention program in operation that is accessible to any officer, employee, or student at the school. The program adopted by the school must include an annual distribution to all students, faculty, and staff of information concerning drug and alcohol abuse and the school's prevention program. A school must review its program once every two years to determine its effectiveness and to ensure that its sanctions are being enforced. As a part of this biennial review, the school must determine the number of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities that occur on a school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities and that are reported to campus officials; and the number and type of sanctions that are imposed by the school as a result of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities on the school's campus or as part of any of the school's activities. The school must make available upon request the results of the review as well as the data and methods supporting its conclusions. If a school does not certify that it has a prevention program or fails to carry out a prevention program, the Department may terminate any or all forms of federal financial aid to the school and may require it to repay any or all federal financial aid that it received while not in compliance.Drug & alcohol abuse prevention programs These requirements are found in 34 CFR 86\u2014Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention. The regulations published in the Federal Register , August 16, 1990, offer a number of suggestions for developing a drug prevention program. Measuring the effectiveness of prevention programs The effectiveness of a school's prevention program may be measured by tracking the number of drug- and alcohol-related disciplinary actions, treatment referrals, and incidents recorded by campus police or other law enforcement officials. You may also find it useful to track the number of students or employees attending self-help or other counseling groups related to alcohol or drug abuse and to survey student, faculty, and employee attitudes and perceptions about the drug and alcohol problem on campus. Failure to have a prevention program 34 CFR 86.301Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-116 FSA HB August 2014Drug-Free Workplace requirements for Campus-Based schools A school that participates in the Campus-Based Programs must take certain steps to provide a drug-free workplace, including establishing a drug-free awareness program to provide information to employees, distributing a notice to its employees of prohibited unlawful activities and the school's planned actions against an employee who violates these prohibitions, and notifying the Department and taking appropriate action when it learns of an employee's conviction under any criminal drug statute. A school's administrative cost allowance may be used to help defray related expenses, such as the cost of printing informational materials given to employees. The administrative cost allowance is discussed in Volume 6: Campus-Based Programs . The drug-free workplace requirements apply to all offices and departments of a school that receives Campus-Based funds. Organizations that contract with the school are considered subgrantees not subject to the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act. INFORMATION ABOUT ATHLETICS Report on athletic program participation rates & financial support The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) requires a school that has an intercollegiate athletic program to make prospective students aware of its commitment to providing equitable athletic opportunities for its male and female students. As part of this requirement, each fall schools must make certain information available to students, prospective students, and the public in easily accessible places and must also report the information to the Department. The annual report, officially called The Report on Athletic Program Participation Rates and Financial Support Data and commonly referred to as the EADA Report, must include information on the number of male and female full-time undergraduate students that attended the school (undergraduate students are those who are consistently designated as such by the school), the total amount and ratio of athletically related student aid awarded to male athletes compared to female athletes, the expenses incurred by the school for men's and women's sports, total annual revenues for men's or women's sports, the annual school salary of non-volunteer head coaches and assistant coaches for men's and women's teams, and for each varsity team in intercollegiate competition, the number and gender of participants and coaches, operating expenses, etc. A school must publish its EADA report by October 15 and make it available upon request to students, prospective students, and the public. Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) HEA Section 485(e) and (g) 668.41(g) 34 CFR 668.47 EADA data on the Web The Department posts the EADA reports for participating schools on the Web at: http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/Additional sources of information The following resources are available for schools that are developing prevention programs: The Drug Free Workplace Helpline\u2014 Provides information to private entities about workplace programs and drug testing. Proprietary and private nonprofit schools may use this line (1- 800-967-5752). www.workplace.samhsa.gov/ Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration\u2014SAMHSA (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services) Treatment and Referral Hotline 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357) Publications: http://store.samhsa.gov/homeCh. HB August 2014For example, a school may make hard copies of the report available in intercollegiate athletic offices, admissions offices, or libraries, or by providing a copy to all students in their electronic mailbox. A school must provide the report promptly to anyone who requests the information. For example, a school may not refuse to provide a copy of the report to the news media, and the school may not require an individual requesting the information to come to the school to view the report. A school may not charge a fee for the information. A school must submit its equity in athletics report to the Department via the EADA survey website ( https://surveys.ope.ed.gov/athletics ) annually within 15 days of making it available to students, prospective students, and the public. Note that a password and user ID are required for use of this website. They are sent by the Department to the chief administrator at the school. For help with this site, contact eadahelp@westat.com . For specific categories and reporting rules, please see the EADA User's Guide for the online survey. Completion & graduation rates for student athletes Schools that offer athletically-related student aid must produce an annual report that includes: The number of students, categorized by race and gender, who attended the school in the year prior to the submission of the report. The number of the students above who received athletically-related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer- out rate of all the entering, certificate- or degree-seeking, full- time, undergraduate students described in 34 CFR \u00a7668.45(a)(1), categorized by race and gender. The completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate of the entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1) who received athletically-related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate for the four most recent completing or graduating classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45(a)(1), (3), and (4), categorized by race and gender. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has. The average completion or graduation rate and, if applicable, transfer-out rate of the four most recent completing or graduating classes of entering students described in \u00a7668.45 (a)(1) who received athletically-related student aid, categorized by race and gender within each sport. If a school has rates for fewer than four of those classes, it must disclose the rates it has. A school must provide this report to prospective student athletes, their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor (see the sidebar Waiver of completion/ graduation data calculation A school does not have to calculate and make available its completion or graduation rate (and, if applicable, transfer-out rate) if it is a member of an athletic association or conference that has voluntarily published completion or graduation rate data or has agreed to publish data and ED has granted a waiver of the requirements to provide these rates to coaches and guidance counselors. To receive a waiver, your school or its athletic association or conference must submit a written application to ED that explains why it believes the data the athletic association or conference publishes are accurate and substantially comparable to the information required by this section. Even if the waiver is granted, your school must comply with the requirements of \u00a7668.41(d)(3) (upon request, providing its retention rate to a prospective student) and (f) (providing retention rates and completion or graduation rates for prospective student athletes and their parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor). 34 CFR 668.45(e)(1) Definitions Undergraduate students\u2014 For purposes of \u00a7668.45 and 668.48 (completion and graduation rates for students and student athletes) only, means students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program, an associate degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate. 34 CFR 668.41(a) Certificate or degree-seeking student \u2014a student enrolled in a course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a degree or certificate.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-118 FSA HB August 2014exception). The school must also submit this report to the Department each year by July 1 through the IPEDS website. The definition of athletically-related student aid used here is the same definition that is also used for the EADA disclosure requirements. The definitions of certificate- or degree-seeking students, first-time undergraduate students, undergraduate students, and normal time are the same as those used for the calculation of completion or graduation and transfer-out rates for a school's general student body cohort. TEXTBOOK INFORMATION To the maximum extent practicable, a school must post verified textbook pricing information for both required and recommended materials for all classes (i.e., not just the school's online classes) on the schedule that the school has posted online. This pricing information must include the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and retail price for all required and recommended textbooks and supplemental materials for each course listed in the institution's course schedule used for preregistration and registration. If the ISBN is not available, the pricing information must include the publisher and copyright date, as well as the title and author. If the school determines that disclosure of this pricing information is not practicable, it may substitute the designation \"To Be Determined (TBD)\" in lieu of the required pricing information. If applicable, the school must include on its written course schedule a reference to the textbook information available on its Internet schedule and the Internet address for that schedule. Schools are encouraged to provide information on renting textbooks, purchasing used textbooks, textbook buy-back programs, and alternative content delivery programs. A school must provide the following information to its bookstore if the bookstore requests it: the school's course schedule for the subsequent academic period; and for each course or class offered, the information it must include on its Internet course schedule for required and recommended textbooks and supplemental material, the number of students enrolled, and the maximum student enrollment. LOAN COUNSELING Entrance counseling Before making the first disbursement of a loan to a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan borrower, a school must ensure that the student has received entrance counseling or document that he has received a prior Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan or Federal Stafford or SLS Loan. Similarly, a school must ensure that a graduate or professional student who DL online counseling Students can take loan entrance and exit counseling at https://studentloans.gov . Your school can sign up to receive regular reports of the students who complete online counseling. If your school documents that students have completed ED's online counseling, it has satisfied its responsibility for electronic counseling.Loan counseling in regulations DL: 34 CFR 685.304 Perkins: 34 CFR 674.16(a)Textbook information The statutory requirement regarding textbook disclosures was described in DCL GEN-08-12. Further guidance was given in GEN-10-09. Also note that the law requires textbook publishers to provide information to faculty about pricing, copyright dates of previous editions, content revisions, alternate formats, etc. HEA section 133Exception to providing completion/ graduation rates for student athletes A school does not have to provide a report on completion or graduation rates to the prospective student athlete and the athlete's parents, high school coach, and guidance counselor, if\u2014 (A) The institution is a member of a national collegiate athletic association, (B) The association compiles data on behalf of its member institutions, which ED determines are substantially comparable to those required by \u00a7668.48(a), and (C) The association distributes the compilation to all secondary schools in the United States. 34 CFR 668.41(f)Ch. 6\u2014Consumer Information & School Reports 2-119 FSA HB August 2014is borrowing a Direct PLUS Loan has received entrance counseling, unless he received a prior graduate/professional Direct or Federal PLUS Loan. There are similar counseling and disclosure requirements for Perkins loans (see Volume 6 ). Loan counseling is not required for parent PLUS borrowers. Counseling methods The Direct Loan Program offers both entrance and exit counseling on the Web (see sidebar). Your school may also elect to provide entrance counseling through an in-person session or by providing a separate written form to the student that she signs and returns to the school. If your staff are conducting in-person counseling sessions, charts, handouts, audiovisual materials, and question-and-answer sessions can help convey the information in a more dynamic manner. We also recommend the use of written tests or interactive programs to ensure that the student understands the terms and conditions of his loans. Regardless of the counseling methods your school uses, it must document that the student received and understood entrance and exit counseling, and it must ensure that an individual with expertise in the FSA programs is reasonably available shortly after the counseling to answer the student's questions. Providing borrower information at separation The personal information collected for exit counseling must be provided to the student's loan servicer within 60 days. A student authorizes her school to release information to lenders in the loan promissory note she signed. No further permission is needed. Students who complete loan exit counseling online at www.studentloans.gov fulfill this requirement; NSLDS provides the completion information to the loan holders. Exit counseling follow up If the student borrower drops out without notifying your school, you must confirm that the student has completed online counseling or mail exit counseling material to the borrower at his last known address. It is also acceptable to email the information to the borrower at his home (not school) email address, if you have that address. Note that you may send the print or PDF version of the Exit Counseling Guide for Federal Student Loan Borrowers to satisfy the exit counseling requirement. The material must be mailed or emailed within 30 days of your learning that a borrower has withdrawn or failed to participate in an exit counseling session. When mailing exit materials to students who have left school, you're not required to use certified mail with a return receipt requested, but you must document in their file that the materials were sent.

Also, all recipients must receive TEACH Grant exit counseling, which is on the NSLDS Student Access site ( www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA ). You will receive reports from NSLDS on all students who have completed TEACH exit counseling. If they don't complete exit counseling on the NSLDS website, you must ensure that the counseling is provided either in person, through interactive electronic means, or by mailing written counseling materials (such as the PDF version of the exit counseling program on the NSLDS website) to their last known address. With an unannounced withdrawal of a grant recipient from school (or from a TEACH Grant-eligible program), you must provide this counseling within 30 days of learning of the withdrawal. Counseling for correspondence and study-abroad students If the student has enrolled in a study-abroad program (approved by a U.S. school for credit) or a correspondence or distance learning program and has not previously received an FFEL or Direct Loan at that school, the school must document that the student has completed online entrance counseling that meets FSA requirements or provide entrance counseling information by mail before releasing loan money. In the case of exit counseling for correspondence programs or study abroad programs, the school may mail or email the borrower written counseling materials within 30 days after the borrower completes the program, with a request that he provide the contact and personal information that would ordinarily have been collected through the counseling process. Providing additional information Your school can take additional steps to counsel students, for example, in developing a budget, estimating need for loans, and planning for repayment. You can reinforce messages to borrowers; with each disbursement you can remind them about the importance of SAP, planning for future employment, and staying in touch with the loan servicer. More ideas for loan counseling are given in the \"Sample Default Management and Prevention Plan.\" Financial literacy \u2014you should provide borrowers with counseling at various stages of enrollment, interactive tools to manage debt, repayment options, school contact information, and information about the income potential of occupations relevant to their course of study. You can offer this information through a variety of media such as face-to-face counseling, classes, publications, e-tutorials, emailed newsletters, and supplements to award letters. At-risk students \u2014You should identify and provide special counseling for at-risk students, such as those who withdraw prematurely from their educational programs, who do not meet SAP standards, or both.Private education loan definition The definition of a private education loan given at the beginning of this section is based on the definition given in the Federal Reserve System regulations, which excludes some forms of credit, including: (1) An extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, a reverse mortgage transaction, a residential mortgage transaction, or any other loan that is secured by real property or a dwelling; or (2) An extension of credit in which the educational institution is the lender if\u2014 (i) The term of the extension of credit is 90 days or less; or (ii) An interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the extension of credit is one year or less, even if the credit is payable in more than four installments. 12 CFR 226.46(b)(5) Authority: 20 USC 1019 Private education loans 34 CFR 668.14(b)(28) and (29) Requirements for preferred lender list 34 CFR 601.10 Self-certification form 34 CFR 601.11(d) Information required to complete the self-certification form 34 CFR 668.14(b)(29)TEACH Grant counseling Students receive initial and subsequent counseling via the TEACH website before they receive the grant. They complete exit counseling on the NSLDS Student Access site (www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/ ). Schools are responsible for TEACH recipients receiving exit counseling when they are no longer enrolled in the program. See NSLDS Newsletter #33 on http:// ifap.ed.gov for information on TEACH exit counseling and on related reporting tools on the NSLDS Professional Access site ( www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_FAP/ ).Ch. Reports 2-123 FSA HB August 2014The most recent sample default plan was an attachment to GEN-05- 14 and is also available under \"Default Prevention Resources\" on the IFAP website. PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS A private education loan is a non-FSA loan that is made to a borrower expressly for postsecondary education expenses, regardless of whether the loan is provided through the educational institution that the student attends or directly to the borrower from the private educational lender. (See the sidebar definition on the previous page for exclusions.) Private education loans made by schools include Public Health Service Loans, such as Health Professions Student Loans. However, Federal Perkins Loans are not considered to be private educational loans. If a private education loan is part of a preferred lender arrangement, it is subject to the rules for those arrangements (described later in this section). Disclosures required for private education loans A school or affiliated organization that provides information regarding a private education loan from a lender to a prospective borrower must provide the following disclosures, even if it does not participate in a preferred lender arrangement. The private education loan disclosures must provide the prospective borrower with the information required by 15 U.S.C. 1638(e)(1) [12 CFR 226.47(a) in the the Federal Reserve System regulations], and inform the prospective borrower that she may qualify for FSA loans or other assistance from the FSA programs and that the terms and conditions of an FSA loan may be more favorable than the provisions of private education loans. The school or affiliate must ensure that information about private education loans is presented in such a manner as to be distinct from information about FSA loans. The school must, upon the request of the applicant, discuss with her the availability of federal, state, and institutional student financial aid. Self-certification form for private education loans A lender must obtain a signed, completed self-certification form from the loan applicant before initiating a private education loan. The applicant may obtain a copy of the self-certification form from the private lender and submit it to your school for completion or confirmation. Your school may also, at its option, provide the information needed to complete the form directly to the lender.Self-certification form for private education loans Schools must provide the Private Education Loan Applicant Self- Certification (see DCL GEN-13-15) upon request from the loan applicant. A school may post an exact copy of the self-certification form on its website for applicants to download, or it may provide them a paper copy directly. The self-certification must be printed by the school or lender with black ink on white paper. The typeface, point size, and general presentation of the form may not be changed from the version approved by OMB. The only changes that may be made to the self-certification form are: Bold type in section headings may be removed, and bold or italic type may be added to the instructions. Schools and lenders may use any blank spaces at the top, bottom, or sides of the form for bar coding or other school/lender-specific information. However, such space may not be used to include the student's or parent's Social Security number. Public health service loans Loans made under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act are considered to be private education loans, including Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL) Primary Care Loan (PCL) Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Nursing Student Loan (NSL) These loans are administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration ( www.hrsa.gov ). Preferred lenders & code of conduct Note that the code of conduct discussed in Chapter 3 prohibits school staff from steering borrowers to particular lenders or delaying loan certifications.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-124 FSA HB August 2014If the loan applicant (the student or parent) requests a copy of the self-certification form from your school, you must provide it. He may also request, if the student has been enrolled or admitted to your school, that you complete section 2 before providing him the form. You must do that to the extent that you have the information. Section 2 of the form collects the student's cost of attendance (see Volume 3, Chapter 2 ), the estimated financial assistance (EFA), and the difference between them. The EFA includes, for students who have completed the FAFSA, the amounts of aid that replace the EFC, which you determined according to the rules in Volume 3, Chapter 9 ; it does not include the private education loan(s) that the self-certification form is for. Schools as private lenders Note that if a school solicits, makes, or extends private education loans, it is considered to be a private educational lender that is subject to the Federal Reserve's regulations on private educational lenders. When the school is the private education lender, it must complete and provide the self-certification form to the loan applicant and subsequently obtain the signed form from the applicant before consummating the private education loan. In some cases a school may be making more than one private education loan to an applicant. For example, a school may be providing a loan funded by the school (or from donor-directed contributions) and a Public Health Service loan. In such cases, the school can provide one self-certification form to the applicant. Preferred lender lists For any year in which the school has a preferred lender arrangement, it will at least annually compile, maintain, and make available for students attending the school and the families of such students a list in print or other medium of the specific lenders for private education loans that the school recommends, promotes, or endorses in accordance with such preferred lender arrangement. The school's preferred lender list must fully disclose why it participates in a preferred lender arrangement with each lender on the preferred lender list, particularly with respect to terms and conditions or provisions favorable to the borrower and that the students attending the school (or their families) do not have to borrow from a lender on the preferred lender list and when available, the information identified on a model disclosure form to be developed by the Department for each type of education loan that is offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students or their families. The preferred lender list must also prominently disclose the method and criteria used by the school in selecting lenders to ensure that such lenders are selected on the basis of the best interests of the borrowers, includingPreferred lenders 34 CFR 601.10 1638(e)(11) As enacted in HEA section 153(a)(2)(A) Truth in Lending Act, section 128(e)(11) Institution-affiliated organization definition 34 CFR 601.2 (1) Any organization that\u2014 (i) Is directly or indirectly related to a covered institution; and (ii) Is engaged in the practice of recommending, promoting, or endorsing education loans for students attending such covered institution or the families of such students. (2) An institution-affiliated organization\u2014 (i) May include an alumni organization, athletic organization, foundation, or social, academic, or professional organization of a covered institution; and (ii) Does not include any lender with respect to any education loan secured, made, or extended by such lender.Use of school or lender name 34 CFR 612 20 USC 1019a(a)(2)-(a)(3) Preferred lender arrangement definition 6\u2014Consumer Information & School Reports 2-125 FSA HB August 2014 payment of origination or other fees on behalf of the borrower, highly competitive interest rates or other terms and conditions or provisions of FSA loans or private education loans, high-quality servicing for such loans, or additional benefits beyond the standard terms and conditions or provisions for such loans. The preferred lender list must indicate, for each listed lender, whether the lender is or is not an affiliate of each other lender on the preferred lender list. If a lender is an affiliate of another lender on the preferred lender list, the listing must describe the details of this affiliation. Preferred lender disclosures For each type of private education loan offered under a preferred lender arrangement, a school (or school-affiliated organization) must disclose the maximum amount of FSA grant and loan aid available to students in an easy-to-understand format, the Truth in Lending information [15 USC 1638(e)(11)] for each type of private education loan offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students and their families, and when available, the information identified on a model disclosure form to be developed by the Department for each type of education loan that is offered through a preferred lender arrangement to the school's students or their families. The school must disseminate this information on its website and in all informational materials such as publications, mailings, or electronic messages or materials that are distributed to prospective or current students and their families and describe financial aid that is available at an institution of higher education. Use of institution & lender name A school or school-affiliated organization that participates in a preferred lender arrangement regarding private education loans must not agree to the lender's use of its name, emblem, mascot, or logo in the marketing of private education loans to students attending the school in any way that implies that the loan is offered or made by the school or its affiliate instead of the lender. This prohibition also applies to other words, pictures, or symbols readily identified with the school or affiliate. The school or its affiliate must also ensure that the name of the lender is displayed in all information and documentation related to the private education loans described in this section.Preferred lender lists The school is required to exercise a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to compile the preferred lender list, without prejudice and for the sole benefit of the school's students and their families and not deny or otherwise impede the borrower's choice of a lender for those borrowers who choose a lender that is not included on the preferred lender list.

Reports 2-127 FSA HB August 2014MISREPRESENTATION Misrepresentation is defined as a false, incorrect, or misleading statement made directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting agency, a state agency, or the Department. A misleading statement includes any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive. A statement is any communication made in writing, visually, orally, or through other means. This definition applies to statements made by an eligible school, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the eligible institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services. Misrepresentation includes the dissemination of a student endorsement or testimonial that a student gives either under duress or because the school required the student to make such an endorsement or testimonial to participate in a program. A school, one of its representatives, or a related party (see above) engages in substantial misrepresentation when it does so about the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Substantial misrepresentation is defined as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Substantial misrepresentations are prohibited in all forms, including those made in any advertising or promotional materials or in the marketing or sale of courses or programs of instruction offered by the institution. REPORTING INFORMATION ON FOREIGN SOURCES & GIFTS Federal law requires most 2-year and 4-year postsecondary schools (whether or not they are eligible to participate in the FSA programs) to report ownership or control by foreign sources and contracts with or gifts from the same foreign source that, alone or combined, have a value of $250,000 or more for a calendar year. Who must report A school (and each campus of a multi-campus school) must report this information if it is legally authorized to provide a program beyond the secondary level within a state, provides a program that awards a bachelor's degree or a more advanced degree, or provides at least a two-year program acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree, is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, and is extended any federal financial aid (directly or indirectly through another entity or person) or receives support from the extension of any such federal assistance to the school's sub-units.Sanctions If the Department determines that an eligible institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, it may revoke the eligible institution's program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified under 34 CFR 668.13(c); impose limitations on the institution's participation in the FSA programs if the institution is provisionally certified under 34 CFR 668.13(c); deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution; or initiate a proceeding against the eligible institution under subpart G of 34 CFR 668.Misrepresentation 34 CFR Subpart CFR 668.71 Misrepresenting 668.72 Misrepresenting financial 34 CFR 668.73 Employability of graduates 34 CFR 668.74 Relationship with the Department of Education Where to report foreign gift information Foreign gift, contract, and ownership or control reports must be submitted to the FSA School Participation Teams using FSA's electronic application (E-App) found at www.eligcert.ed.gov .

You may then submit your report. Alternative reporting In lieu of the reporting requirements listed: If a school is in a state that has substantially similar laws for public disclosure of gifts from, or contracts with, a foreign source, a copy of the report to the state may be filed with the Department. The school must provide the Department with a statement from the appropriate state official indicating that the school has met the state requirements. If another department, agency, or bureau of the executive branch of the federal government has substantially similar requirements for public disclosure of gifts from or contracts with a foreign source, the school may submit a copy of this report to the Department. ANTI-LOBBYING PROVISIONS Prohibition on use of FSA funds FSA funds may not be used to pay any person for trying to influence a member of Congress or an employee of a member of Congress, or an officer or employee of Congress or any agency. This prohibition applies to the making of a federal grant or loan, awarding federal contracts, and entering into federal cooperative agreements, as well as to the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. In addition, FSA funds may not be used to hire a registered lobbyist or to pay any person or entity for securing an earmark. Schools receiving FSA funds will have to certify their compliance with these requirements annually. Campus-Based disclosure If a school that receives more than $100,000 in Campus-Based funds has used non-federal funds to pay any person for lobbying activities in connection with the Campus-Based Programs, the school must submit a disclosure form (Standard Form LLL) to the Department. The school must update this disclosure at least quarterly and when changes occur. The disclosure form must be signed by the chief executive officer (CEO) or other individual who has the authority to sign on behalf of the entire school. A school is advised to retain a copy in its files.For additional information & alternative reporting Contact the School Participation Team for your state. Contact information for these teams is on the IFAP website (http://ifap.ed.gov ), under \"Help- Contact Information.\" ACA may not be used for association membership A school may not use its administrative cost allowance (ACA) to pay for its membership in professional associations (such as the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the National Association of College and University Business Officers, etc.), regardless of whether the association engages in lobbying activities. Prohibition on use of FSA funds HEOA 2008 section 119 (no corresponding HEA section) Effective date: August 14, 2008 Anti-lobbying certification & disclosure Section 319 of Pub. L. 101-121, enacted October 23, 1989, amended title 31, United States Code, by adding a new section 1352, entitled \"Limitation on Use of Appropriated Funds to Influence Certain Federal Contracting and Financial Transactions,'' commonly known as the Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment. As a result of that legislation, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued interim final common regulations on February 26, 1990, for implementing and complying with the law. See 34 CFR Part 82.Volume 2\u2014School Eligibility and Operations 2014-20152-130 FSA HB August 2014The school must require that this certification be included in the award documents for all subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans, and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly. VOTER REGISTRATION Schools in most states and the District of Columbia must make a good faith effort to distribute voter registration forms to their students. (Schools in Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming are exempt from this requirement.) The school must make the voter registration forms widely available to its students. It must individually distribute the forms to its degree- or certificate-seeking (FSA-eligible) students. The school can mail paper copies, or, alternatively, it may distribute voter registration forms by electronically transmitting to each student a message containing an acceptable voter registration form or an Internet address where that form can be downloaded. The electronic message must be devoted exclusively to voter registration. In states where this condition applies, schools must request voter registration forms from the state 120 days prior to the state's deadline for registering to vote. This provision applies to general and special elections for federal office and to the elections of governors and other chief executives within a state. If a school does not receive the forms within 60 days prior to the deadline for registering to vote in the state, it is not liable for failing to meet the requirement during that election year.Applicability of voter registration requirement The voter registration requirement was included in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (also known as the \"NVRA\" or \"motor voter law\"). In essence, if a participating school is located in a state that requires voter registration prior to election day and/or does not allow the ability to register at the time of voting, then the school must make a good faith effort to distribute voter registration forms to its students. The Department of Justice identified the states that meet these criteria; the requirements of the NVRA apply to 44 states and the District of Columbia. Six states\u2014Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming\u2014are exempt from the NVRA. Likewise, the territories are not covered by the NVRA (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa). \u2014From U.S. Department of Justice, \"Questions and Answers\" on \"The Voter Registration Requirements of Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the National Voter "}
