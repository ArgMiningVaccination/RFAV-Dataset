[The paper by Burt et al.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2748796), just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (and [summarized on the MedPage Today web site](https://www.medpagetoday.com/endocrinology/osteoporosis/81832)), reports data from a total of 311 otherwise healthy, adult patients. The patients were randomized to receive one of three daily doses of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) for a total of 3 years: - 400 IU per day (n = 109) - 4,000 IU per day (n = 100) - 10,000 IU per day (n = 102) Calcium supplements were also provided to participants with a dietary calcium intake of < 1,200 mg per day. No one was randomized to a placebo instead of a daily dose of vitamin D. The core result of the paper was that not one of the three doses of vitamin D prevented bone loss, and \u2014 furthermore \u2014 there was actually a decline in the radial volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) that increased with the dose of vitamin D over a 3-year period compared to baseline levels: - For patients randomized to 400 IU, the loss in BMD was -1.2 percent. - For patients randomized to 4,000 IU, the loss was -2.4 percent. - For patients randomized to 10,000 IU, the loss was -3.5 percent. The authors conclude that: Among healthy adults, treatment with vitamin D for 3 years at a dose of 4,000 IU per day or 10,000 IU per day, compared with 400 IU per day, resulted in statistically significant lower radial BMD; tibial BMD was significantly lower only with the 10,000 IU per day dose. There were no significant differences in bone strength at either the radius or tibia. These findings do not support a benefit of high-dose vitamin D supplementation for bone health. It has long been argued by some that giving patients with prostate cancer very high doses of vitamin D would be beneficial to their bone health and minimize bone loss. While this paper by Burt et al. cannot be said to disprove such arguments, it should be noted that it causes the hypothesis to be called further into question. It should also be noted that Burt et al. were expecting a very different result, which was that high doses of vitamin D would be beneficial in preventing bone loss in otherwise healthy patients. This turned out very clearly not to be the case! Once again, this is a paper that clearly demonstrates the importance of seeking and obtaining level 1 evidence for hypotheses that may seem \u2014 to many \u2014 to be \"obvious\". The human body is a very complex organism; it will always tend to respond to treatment in ways that are balanced back toward the \"normal\". In this particular case, the use of high doses of vitamin D appear to have come with higher levels of risk than benefit over a period of 3 years. Your sitemaster is not surprised by this finding. He has long expressed concerns about the use of very high doses of vitamin D and the suggestion that these were necessarily beneficial in the management of prostate cancer. Filed under: [Living "}
