Understanding predictors of social cognition in young adults with autism spectrum disorder 2. Early detection of social delay in the first year of life 3. Improving the assessment of neurodevelopment and well - being in children attending hospital and community services Project (100 words) 1. Autism spectrum disorders are associated with difficulties in understanding the emotions of others. The aim of this study is to explore the cognitive and physiological predictors of social cognition in young adults with autism spectrum disorder. A battery of tests has been collected o f cognitive and physiological assessments and well validated measures of social cognition (emotion recognition, theory of mind). The student will need to assist collection of data and analysis to determine features of cognition and physiology that contribu te to social cognition. Comparisons against collected neurotypical control and psychiatric control populations will be made. 2. Social delay associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder can typically be identified by 18 months of age. There is growing recognition that early markers of speech, physiological reactivity and eye gaze responsiveness may help identify such delay in the first year of life. The aim of this project is to review the literature relating to early life social detection and to collect data in a sample of children attending high risk screening clinics for markers of social delay. Data will be compared against a typica lly developing cohort. The project may provide insights into social development in the first year of life, with potential for earlier detection than what is currently possible. 3. There is a growing need to improve the assessment of children attending neu rodevelopmental clinics. The aim of this project is to examine one aspect of the assessment process (physiology, eye tracking, child social and cognitive development, anxiety, parental mental health) and examine how this contributes to the diagnosis of Aut ism Spectrum Disorder in these clinics and links to disability. The student will be able to choose a domain that is of particular interest to them and integrate the collection of data into existing platforms at Westmead Children's Hospital. 11 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Anatomy and Histology Honours 2021 Laboratory Behavioural Neurobiology Laboratory Head Dr David Mor Supervisor Dr David Mor Email address David.mor@sydney.edu.au Phone 02 86278874 Location Camperdown Zoom ID code Project name Alteration CRF receptors expression in cognitive dysfunction following chronic stress Project (100 words) Physical or psychological stress have direct effect s on cognitive process es such as behavioural flexibility and motivation. These symptoms characterise many stress -related pathologies such as depression and anxiety disorders. The neural circuitry regulating these processes include forebrain structures such as the prefrontal corte x and striatum . These circuits are highly regulated by monoamine projections such as dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline from the brainstem. My Lab focuses on how stress and pain alter the interactions between the CRF system and the brainstem monoaminerg ic nuclei, leading to altered forebrain function and dysfunctions in behavioural flexibility, decision making and motivation. 12 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Anatomy and Histology Honours 2021 Laboratory Neurodegeneration Laboratory Laboratory Head Eleanor Eleanor Drummond Email address Eleanor.drummond@sydney.edu.au Phone 9351 0597 Location Brain & Mind Centre Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/96709880390 Project name Identifying Proteins that Cause Selective Vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease Project (100 words) One of the most intriguing features of Alzheimer's disease is that some brain regions are particularly vulnerable in disease, while others remain unaffected. Why this happens is unknown. We are currently using proteomics to identify the protein changes in human brain tissue examine this question. In this honours project you will analyse our recently generated proteomic results to identify key proteins responsible for selective vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease. You will then use multiplexed immunohistoc hemistry to confirm these key protein differences in human brain tissue and to determine if these proteins co -localize with neuropathological features in early Alzheimer's disease. Results from this project has the potential to identify new drug targets fo r early stage Alzheimer's disease. 13 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Anatomy and Histology Honours 2021 Laboratory Lens Research Laboratory Laboratory Head Professor Frank J.

In this study students will learn how to culture iPSCs, retinal organoids and microglia cells to form complex organoids. These models will then be used to investigate Birdshot Uveitis, a progressive retinal inflammation, in the dish. Our hypo thesis is that Uveitis microglia and retinal organoids will have different markers of inflammation when compared to control cells. The student will be exposed to a number of techniques, such as RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and cytokines screenings. The results will aid the development of new therapies for Uveitis. Developing a novel treatment for blindness using electrical stimulation and cell therapy. Summary: Many degenerative diseases of the eye due to loss of photoreceptor cells lead to progressive vision impairment and eventually total blindness. For advanced conditions, where the light - sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina have been lost, cell therap y by cell transplantation is one of the only options. Proof -of-concept studies have demonstrated that transplantation of photoreceptor cells can rescue vision. However, integration of the transplanted cells with the endogenous retinal circuitry is not effi cient. Thus, innovative approaches to improve the connectivity of transplanted cells are essential in order to move to clinical trials. There is also convincing evidence from numerous studies that electrical stimulation (E -Stim) improves cell migration, pr oliferation, and axonal outgrowth. In this study the student will evaluate the effect of E-Stim on stem cell -derived retinal organoids in vitro to test the hypothesis that E -Stim enhances their maturation. 19 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Zoellner Lab Laboratory Head Prof Hans Zoellner Supervisor Dr Belal Chami Email address Belal.chami@sydney.edu.au Phone 0420901899 Location Westmead Adult Hospital - Centre of Oral Health Zoom ID code 988 3416 4740 Project (100 words) Myeloperoxidase and NET formation in IBD patient samples. The relationship between oxidative stress/damage in the evolution of tissue damage in acute and chronic inf lammatory conditions, namely Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is critical in developing new strategies to treat these diseases. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), produced primarily by neutrophils, is known to produce a powerful two-electron oxidant called hypocholoro us acid (HOCl) which is linked to host -tissue damage in various disease settings including rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarctions and IBD. Interestingly, MPO has recently been shown to be crucial to the development of neutrophil extracellular t raps - a DNA/elastase scaffold backbone embedded with histones and myeloperoxidase which has demonstrated antimicrobial activity. Despite this, little is known regarding its role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral Submucosal Fi brosis: The IL -33/IL -induced fibrosis. Oral Submucosal Fibrosis(OSF)is a chronic fibrinolytic oral condition with malignant propensity. In moderate and severe cases,OSF significantly impairs oral function with patients report ing impairment of mastication due to stiffing of associated muscoskeletal muscles. Inappropriate fibrinolytic activity of fibroblasts in the oral muscoa is the central pathophysiological characteristic of the disease. Recently, a new member of the IL -1 superfamily, IL -33, has been discovered and a subsequent plethora of reports have highlighted it's role in several fibrinolytic conditions. Moreover, the IL -33/IL -13 axis has recently been shown to induce collagen III dep osition in subcutaneous fibrosis. This research has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of OSF. 20 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Directed Evolution Laboratory Head Dr Daniel Hesselson Supervisor Dr Daniel Hesselson Email address d.hesselson@centenary.org.au Phone 0404456830 Location Centenary Institute - CPC Level 5 Zoom ID code 483 118 6836 TWE4OFRyQ04ra0o0elVwdjJNN2Qxdz09 Project name Blocking follistatin in ovarian cancer to prevent chemoresistance and recurrence Project (100 words) In the Directed Evolution laboratory, we harness the power of Darwinian selection to evolve proteins with new therapeutic activities. We have discovered that that blocking follistatin activity could increase the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to primary chemotherapeutics. However, existing anti -follistatin antibodies lack the potency to fully neutralise follistatin activity in vivo. Thus, we will evolve high affinity single -domain antibodies (nanobodies) against follistatin, to disrupt its signalling. This w ork will pave the way for new adjunctive therapies which could enhance the efficacy of primary chemotherapeutics in a wide range of cancers. 21 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Laboratory Head Dr Ellis Patrick Supervisor Dr Ellis Patrick Email address Ellis.patrick@sydney.edu.au Phone 0402 159 424 Location Westmead and/or Camperdown Zoom ID code 988 4248 9754 Project name Data -intensive science to understand the molecular aetiology of disease.

This project is based on a number of strategies in our lab to genetically alter the kidney to improve its function including using kidneys deficient in GSDM and MHC. It is also looking at strategies to enhance immune tolerance, including cytokine based expansion of Tregs and the development of screens for chemicals that enhance Tregs. It will involve skills in genetics, immunology and animal models of transplantation. 23 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Centre for Immunology and Allergy Research / Immunogenetics Laboratory Head Dr Grant Parnell Supervisor Dr Grant Parnell Email address grant.parnell@sydney.edu.au Phone 0423 349 286 Location The Westmead Institute for Medical Research Zoom ID code 96564465122 Project name Vitamin D and the Immune System in Multiple Sclerosis Project (100 words) The genetic and environmental evidence that vitamin D activity is low in M ultiple Sclerosis is compelling, but in clinical trials supplementation has not proven effective. We have discovered feature s of vitamin D response that indicate the form of vitamin D used in supplementation is unlikely to be useful. Here we aim to find out how to avoid these limits to response by tracking the vitamin D pathway in immune cells, especially identifying the proces ses important in making immune cells less active. This should lead to better ways to exploit vitamin D for therapy . Techniques used: qPCR, flow -cytometry, next -gen sequencing, bioinformatics. SCHOOL MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Telomere Length Regulation Laboratory Head Prof Hilda Pickett Supervisor Prof Hilda Pickett Email address hpickett@cmri.org.au 8865 2928 Location Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead Zoom ID code https://cmri.zoom.us/j/99439123444?pwd=RzVJY202cmVWb09FUStnc3M2RExYQT09 Project name Telomere dynamics in cancer cells Project (100 words) Telomeres are specialized DNA and protein structures at the ends of human chromosomes that function to maintain the integrity of the DNA. Telomeres shorten with each round of cellular division, and telomere length is indicative of the proliferative potential of the cell . Two distinct mechanisms exist to counteract telomere shortening.

Telomeres shorten with each round of cellular division, and telomere length is indicative of the proliferative potential of the cell . Two distinct mechanisms exist to counteract telomere shortening. First, the enzyme telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA onto the chromosome ends. Second, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) uses homologous recombination -directed pathways to extend telomeres. We offer a variety of projects investigating telomere length regulation, DNA damage and repair pathways at telomeres, and therapeutic opportunities that target telomeres in cancer cells. 26 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Centre for Kidney Research, Kids Research Westmead Laboratory Head Professor Stephen Alexander Supervisor Dr Hugh McCarthy/Dr Yuan Min Wang Email address Hugh.McCarthy@sydney.edu.au Phone 02 98453430 Location Centre for Kidney Research Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/97752030836 Project name Genetics and Immunology of Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome Project (100 words) The aim of the project is to investigate the circulating factors in patients with nephrotic syndrome and their effect on the main cell of the kidney filter: the podocyte.

Cancer cell immortality is dependent on the maintenance of chromosomal end structures called telomeres, which function to ensure chromosomal stability in replicating cells. Our Group's research is focused on characterizing the diversity of mechanisms involved in telom ere maintenance, identifying biomarkers of different telomere maintenance mechanisms and investigating strategies for undermining telomere maintenance as a therapeutic approach for cancer. Therapeutic exploitation of the mechanisms involved in cell immorta lity holds promise for a broad spectrum of malignancies, including rare sarcomas that have not been addressed by the new generation of molecular targeted therapeutics. 30 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory HSV and Vaccine Adjuvants Group Laboratory Head Prof Tony Cunningham Supervisor Dr Kerrie Sandgren Email address kerrie.sandgren@sydney.edu.au Phone 0422 126 681 Location The Westmead Institute Zoom ID code 986 6343 0898 Project name How does the promising vaccine adjuvant AS01 work in humans? Project (100 words) Part of our lab's research is focused on improving vaccines. A new, vaccine for shingles has proven to be outstandingly effective, even in older adults (>70 years old), who typically respond weakl y to vaccination. We are intrigued to know whether the immune - stimulating component of this vaccine (the adjuvant AS01) may be used in other vaccines to boost their efficacy. This may be particularly important in the development of a COVID -19 vaccine, as older adults are the most vulnerable to severe COVID -19 disease and may not respond well to the first round of available vaccines. We have a collaboration with the global pharma developers to test AS01B in extracted human lymph nodes to investigate how it works. This knowledge could facilitate the development of new vaccine s or improve existing vaccines to be more effective, particularly in the ageing population. 31 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Herpes Neuropathogenesis Laboratory Head Monica Miranda -Saksena Kevin Danastas Email address kevin.danastas@sydney.edu.au Phone 02 8627 3627 Location Westmead Institute for Medical Research Zoom ID code Project name Immune response against HSV -1 infections in nerves Project (100 words) HSV-1 causes lifelong infections, hiding from the host immune system in sensory nerves.

Please see below Project The replication stress response and genome instability. Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer. A major driver of genome instability in oncogenesis is DNA \"replication stress\". Replication stress is broadly defined as any phenomena that negatively impacts copying of the genetic material and can arise throug h exogenous (e.g. low nutrient environment, genotoxic agents) or endogenous (e.g. oncogene expression) sources. Cells cope with replication stress through the \"replication stress response\" which arrests cell growth and mediates repair of the underlying les ions. Because tumour cells typically have high levels of endogenous replication stress, targeting the replication stress response is an opportunistic target in cancer therapy. Our research focuses on three aspects of the replication stress response. 1) U nderstanding how physical forces inside the nucleus alter nuclear architecture to mediate replication stress repair; 2) Understanding how chromatin is altered in the nuclear environment to enable replication stress repair; and 3) Understanding how replicat ion stress is mediated in rapidly dividing pluripotent stem cells. Opportunities are available in all three trajectories and projects will be tailored to applicants' interests and strengths on an individual basis. Cell death in radiotherapy . Radiation therapy is responsible for 40% of cancer cures. Development of new technologies enables administration of high dose radiation within precise spatial targeting to kill tumour cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. While it is clear hi gh dose radiation therapy kills cells, the mechanism of cell death, and the genetic pathways that promote radiation therapy sensitivity and resistance are unknown. Our research is focused on creating a roadmap that will determine with certainty how tumour cells die following ART. To do this, we are determining the role of DNA damage response and repair pathways, cell cycle regulation, inflammatory signalling, and environmental factors in radiation therapy induced cell death. Opportunities are available in t his project will be tailored to applicants' interests and strengths on an individual bas is. 45 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Cell Biology Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute Laboratory Head Professor Tracy Bryan Co-Supervisor Dr Ashley Harman Email address tbryan@cmri.org.au Phone 02 8865 Location CMRI, Westmead Zoom ID code 934 1508 6809 Project name Investigating the links between telomerase and the DNA damage response in cancer cells Project (100 words) The enzyme telomerase counteracts telomere shortening in a majority of cancers, allowing for unlimited cell division. Most normal cells do not express telomerase, so inhibition of telomerase is a promising avenue for development of specific anti -cancer treatments. Telomerase action can be inhibited by blocking the cellular pathways that recruit telomerase to telomeres . This process is highly regulated, but factors that regulate it are incompletely understood. We have demonstrated that the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres is controlled by the pathways that regulate the cellular response to DNA damage. This project will elucidate the mechanistic links between these two vital cellular pathways, using advanced microscopy techniques, genome editing and biochemical analyses. 46 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Molecular Mycology Research Laboratory, CIDM Laboratory Head Prof Wieland Meyer Supervisor Prof Wieland Meyer, Dr Michelle Bull, Dr. Laszlo Irinyi, Dr Belinda Chapmen Email address wieland.meyer@sydney.edu.au Dr L. 86273431 Location Westmead Institute for Medical Research and Quantal Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/92643376757 20/10/2020 from 10.30 -11.30 am Project name(s) Project 1: Improving rapid species ident ification of clinically relevant fungi from beach sand using DNA Metabarcoding with MinION Sequencing Project 2: Finding the link between the environment and the patient - environmental sampling and phylogenetic studies Project (100 words) Project 1: Taxonomic resolution of fungi from high -throughput sequencing (HTS) of complex fungal communities is currently limited by the use of short DNA reads and single amplicon targets. The most commonly used HTS technology enables sample multiplexing but sample analysis remains expensive and time consuming. The MinION sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore offers a platform for quicker fungal community analysis with improved species resolution by utilising long DNA reads and multiple amplicon targets. This Honou rs project will generate mock fungal communities of clinically relevant fungi derived from beach sand to benchmark species resolution using the primary and secondary ITS -DNA fungal barcodes and compare different bioinformatics pipelines. A multi -amplicon D NA sequencing approach will then be applied to evaluate the contribution of organic matter load to the prevalence of clinically important fungal species distribution and diversity in Sydney beach sand. Project 2: Yeasts of the articial genus Candida include plant endophytes, insect symbionts, and opportunistic human pathogens. A better knowledge on the evolutionary relationships of Candida species is vital to understand the ecology, clinical relevance, and diagnosis of these yeasts. Recently, we studied the phylogeny of selected Candida species, with special emphasis on clinical isolates, using the sequence of five genes. We showed six major clades resolving part of the Candida phylogeny. However, the genus Candida is complex and need more study. Now our next objective is to increase the number of strains obtained from the environment to gain a better robustness of the phylogeny of this genus and also to understand the relationship between environment and clinical i nfections. For this reason, the first part of this project will be to collect as many samples as possible from a number of environmental sources: soil, flowers, plants, hospital environment and isolate the cultures in specific media. The second part of thi s project will be to identify these strains to the species level, using molecular techniques, find new species and to study their phylogeny relationships within the artificial genus Candida , to improve the phylogenetic overall resolution. 47 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Applied Medical Science Honours 2021 Laboratory Centre for Kidney Research Kids Research Westmead Laboratory Head Professor Stephen Alexander Supervisor Dr Yuan Min Wang Email address Yuan.wang@health.nsw.gov.au Phone 98453106 Location Centre for Kidney Research Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/97752030836 Project name 1.

In this project we explore the impact of intron retention on mirtron expression by analyzing multi -omics data of chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Project 3: Core transcriptional networks are essential drivers and determinants of cell -fate transitions. To date, our mechanistic understanding of these essential regulatory layers is very limited, especially in the context of trans -differentiation, despite being one of the most promising therapeutic cell replacement strategies in regenerative me dicine. In this project we will reconstruct gene - regulatory networks involving non-coding RNAs and mRNAs that drive trans -differentiation of human cells and identify key alternative splicing events during cell -fate transitions. 55 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Biomedical Informatics and Digital Health Honours 2021 Laboratory Neurogenetics and Epigenetics Research Group Laboratory Head Associate Professor John Kwok Supervisor Dr Zac Chatterton Email address zac.chatterton@sydney.edu.au Phone 0435 218 832 Location Brain and Mind Centre Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/93210563091 Project name Epigenetics of the Human Brain Project (100 words) Our research aims to reduce the burden of neurodegenerative diseases by understanding gen omics/ epigenomics.

Project (100 words) The lung is one of the most important organs exposed to environmental pollution and pathogens. Lung inflammation and disease is a leading cause of death and disability globally, and an overlooked area is the intersection of silicosis and tuberculosis (TB). Well -known as a disease of miners and stonemasons, silicosis has resurged in the sandstone basin which cups the Sydney region and continues to afflict millions of workers in hazardous occu pations around the world. Silicosis predisposes to TB and patients with silicosis who develop active TB have poor outcomes. As 25% of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosi s, this is a serious problem. The mechanisms by which sil icosis impacts the body's defenses against mycobacteria are poorly understood. This project will use a mouse model of silicosis and mycobacterial infection to examine how silicosis affects innate (dendritic cell and macrophage) and adaptive immune response s.

Project (100 words) Project 1 . Alcohol -related brain injury (ARBI) results in the widespread loss of white matter and regional neuronal loss. There have been a number of genetic risk factors identified that promote alcohol abuse but it is unclear if and how genetic factors influence the extent and severity of ARBI. Our la boratory has genotyped post-mortem brain tissue from 300 alcoholics and controls. In this project we intend to determine whether common variants of genes expressed in microglia and oligodendrocyte, in particular, affect ARBD and then select high -risk and l ow-risk donors for functional studies using immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques. Project 2. Alcohol -related brain injury (ARBI) results in deficits in attention and working memory. The major pathological correlate is the widespread loss of white matter. White matter is chiefly composed of myelin, a lipid rich insulating layer around axons. Our laboratory has recently use mass spectrometry (MS) and MS Imaging to define the changes in lipid profiles in post -mortem brain tissue from individuals with ARBI. In this project we want to determine if and how statins, that lower peripheral cholesterol levels and are also anti -inflammatory, affect lipids in ARBI.

We also discovered that changes in histone methylation enable glioblastoma stem cells to induce dormancy in order to survive treatments with chemotherapeutic drugs. This project will investigate epigenetic mechanisms of glioblastoma dormancy, focusing on histone demethylases and develop novel approaches to eradicate dormant glioblastoma cells. 84 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pathology Honours 2021 Laboratory Northcott Neuroscience Laboratory, ANZAC Research Institute Laboratory Head Professor Marina Kennerson Supervisor Professor Marina Kennerson Email address marina.kennerson@sydney.edu.au Phone 9767 9119 Location ANZAC Research Institute Gate 3 Hospital Rd, Concord 2139 Zoom ID code 942 7927 6933 Project nam e Investigating the Cellular Mechanisms Causing the Death of Motor Neurons Project (100 words) I am team leader of the Gene Discovery and Translational Genomics Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies Program at the ANZAC Research Institute.

We have seen that the T2DM heart undergoes molecular adaptations that subsequently increase cell death, even prior to a cardiovascular event. Our group aims to characterize these adaptations in T2DM hearts to determine the molecular 'priming' that results in poor outcomes in response to cardiovascular stress. By improving our understanding of the changes unique to diabetic hearts, we can provide develop pharmacological interventions to improve cardiovascular outcomes for these patients. 87 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pathology Honours 2021 Laboratory Immunopathology Laboratory, Discipline of Pathology Laboratory Head Professor Nicholas King Supervisor Professor Nicholas King Email address nicholas.king@sydney.edu.au Phone 0422 008 747 Location Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/91894736938 Project name Using IMPs to reduce inflammation in virus infections Project (100 words) Why the immune response causes lethal damage to the host is unknown, but many viruses, including mosquito -borne flaviviruses (e.g., dengue, zika or West Nile viruses), influenza and coronaviruses induce an over-exuberant immune response, resulting in severe illness, even death. In our laboratory, we can interfere with this response by using immune -modifying nanoparticles (IMPs). This reduces the massive inflammation by sidelining blood monocytes (macrophages of the blood) in the spleen, and turns them into anti -inflammatory cells. This in turn also reduces their migration to e.g., the brain. We believe these quietens the immune response. We are investigating this change in detail at the cellular and molecular level. Understanding how this works could give us an additional weapon in highly inflammatory disease. 88 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pathology Honours 2021 Laboratory Platelet Biology/Thrombosis Research Unit: Heart Research Institute [in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Signalling & Drug Discovery Unit] Laboratory Head Shaun Jackson Supervisor Simone Schoenwaelder, Xuyu (Johnny) Liu, Jessica Maclean, address jessica.maclean@hri.org.au ; xuyu.liu@hri.org.au Phone 8627 04117 ; 0408 393 630 Location Level 3 East, Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code https://uni - safer anti -clotting agents derived from \"Mother Nature\" for the treatment of stroke Project (100 words) The Thrombosis Research Group aims to understand events leading to occlusion of both macro - and micro - vasculature, precipitating thrombosis and ischaemia reperfusion injury (IR) in cardiovascular disease . To approach these research questions, we examine t he interactions between blood cells and injured blood vessels, in vitro and ex vivo, as well as in vivo using mouse models of thrombosis, ischaemic stroke and IR injury. We combine these approaches with cutting -edge technologies including: Advanced microsc opy techniques (intravital imaging, confocal, TIRF, super resolution, 2 and genome editing; Omic studies; and Biomechanical studies. Projects include : (i) A new thromboinflammatory mechanism triggered by dying endothelium and platelets; (ii) Understanding mechanisms leading to microvascular dysfunction and poor cerebral perfusion in stroke; (iii) Discovery/ preclinical development of novel antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant treatment s for stroke. Project details: Thrombin is by far the most robust activator of blood clotting in both physiological haemostasis and pathological thrombotic response. Fibrin clots contain a large amount of thrombin, which is released into the circulation f ollowing administration of clot busting drugs to treat stroke (rtPA, thrombolysis). This pool of thrombin remains highly active and is responsible for the rethrombosis. While a strong rationale exists for the use of thrombin inhibitors as effective antithr ombotic agents in enhancing clot lysis, all current thrombin inhibitors lead to severe bleeding complications, precluding their use in stroke, due to risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. We have identified novel anticlotting agents derived from naturally occurring proteins found in saliva of the bush tick. Our studies have demonstrated that these bug -derived proteins are able to dissolve blood clots in a disease model of thrombosis with fewer bleeding complications. This project will characterise the mechanis ms use by this novel anti -clotting protein to safely dampen thrombin generation, and test whether administration of this novel drug in combination with rtPA provides for a safe approach to treatment of thromboembolic diseases such as stroke in the future. 89 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pathology Honours 2021 Laboratory Cancer Metastasis and Tumour Microenvironment Zaklina Kovacevic Email address zaklina.kovacevic@sydney.edu.au Phone 0415 720 902 Location Medical Foundation Building K25 Zoom ID code 970 0156 6101 https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/97001566101 Project name Investigating the cross -talk between cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment. Project (100 words) Late recurrence is a significant clinica l problem for breast cancer (BC) patients. A major contributor to BC recurrence and metastasis is the tumour microenvironment (TME), with stromal cells producing growth factors that promote metastasis. At the bone metastatic niche, BC cells can remain dormant for many years before being re -activated by surrounding stroma. Importantly, tumour cells can \"re -program\" surrounding stromal cells to ensure a favourable TME. This project will investigate the ro le of the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 in BC cell dormancy and communication with the TME, which may lead to a novel strategy to overcome BC recurrence. 90 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pharmacology Honours 2021 Laboratory Chemical Biology in Drug Design Laboratory Laboratory Head Professor Rachel Codd Supervisor Professor Rachel Codd Email address rachel.codd@sydney.edu.au Phone 9351 6738 Location Molecular Bioscience Building G08 Zoom ID code 921 3126 2629 Project name 1. Dissecting the enzyme -mediated biosynthesis of therapeutics 2. Streamlining the labeling of radio -metal imaging agents Project (100 words) Project 1. This project aims to understand the capacity to use enzymes to produce new fragments and molecules to inspire pathways towards generating new therapeutics. This is significant since this could: (i) open access to more structurally diverse molecules with n ew properties; and (ii) circumvent the need to use complex multi -step chemical syntheses. This project will study the enzyme DesC from the DesABCD cluster that directs the biosynthesis of clinical bacterial metabolites known as 'siderophores'. Siderophores have a high affinity towards iron(III) and are used to manage secondary iron overload disease in patients with transfusion -dependent blood disorders. You will produce recombinant DesC in partnership with a collaborating laboratory and prepare using simple and robust chemical syntheses a group of different substrates as a prelude to examining the enzyme -mediated production of new siderophore molecular fragments. This cross -discipline project will support knowledge gain and skills development across molecula r biology, chemical biology, and chemistry. Project 2. The ability to capture high -definition images of cancer is important for patient diagnosis, treatment and follow -up. Radiometal -based imaging agents are useful in this capacity, with a new radiometal - zirconium -89 - gathering traction for immunological positron -emission tomography (PET) imaging. Ongoing improvements to the use of these agents requires technology advances in the design of organic compounds, known as 'ligands' tailored for each radiometa l and in efficient ligand production and radiolabeling processes. This project will explore a new technology predicted to support the efficient radiolabeling of ligands with zirconium -89. The cross -discipline project will provide the student with new knowl edge of chemical synthesis, analytical chemistry and innovation in technology development for medical imaging. The student will ideally have completed a major in (Medicinal)/Chemistry . 91 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Pharmacology Honours 2021 Laboratory Woolcock Institute of Medical R esearch Laboratory Head Prof Ron Grunstein Supervisor A/Prof Craig Phillips Email address craig.phillips@sydney.edu.au Phone 91140004 Location Woolcock Institute - Glebe Zoom ID code Project name Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy for exploring the neurovascular basis for cognitive deficits in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) Project (100 words) OSA is a sleep related breathing disorder characterised by intermittent hypoxia and frag mented sleep.

Our discovery that beta cells secrete insulin via a synaptic -like connection with blood vessels in the islet challenges accepted models of insulin secretion. Ongoing work in the lab is showing the synapse changes in type 2 diabetes, suggesting it may be significant in disease. The next step in this work is to prove that functional interactions in the synapse have significance for the control of insulin secretion. To this end, in this project we will stain for the key proteins in the beta cell synapse and use super resolution microscopy to determine their relative position. This approach will be complemented by live -cell two -photon imaging of insulin secretion. The outcomes of the project will be significant for both understanding and treatment of diabetes. 2) Refining cell -based therapies to cure type 1 diabetes.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play important roles in the physiological functioning of blood vessels, and their dysfunction may lead to vascular diseas e. Increased dysfunctional VSMCs leads to attempts at repair by continued proliferation, reducing the population of progenitor cells, and leading to premature ageing through the critical shortening of telomeres - the protective ends of DNA. Markers of cellu lar ageing include cell senescence and DNA damage. In this project we will examine the DNA damage response in VSMCs to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification. 111 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Islet Biology and Metabolism Group Laboratory Head Melkam Kebede Supervisor Belinda Yau Email address Belinda.yau@sydney.edu.au Phone 0415 838 782 Location Charles Perkins Centre, 5 West Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/99121823133 Project name Pathways to beta -cell failure in Type 2 Diabetes Project (100 words) The insulin -producing beta -cells of the pancreas undergo huge metabolic cha nges in the progression to diabetes. In the face of genetic factors and environmental stressors such as obesity, whole body insulin resistance drives the beta -cells into a state of compensation. Beta -cells increase their insulin production and secretion in their efforts to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. However, eventual beta -cell dysfunction - in the mitochondria, the ER, and the insulin secretory pathway - can all result in beta -cell failure, and ultimately Type 2 diabetes. Our project aims to study key metabolic pathways - identifying novel target proteins - in the switch between beta -cell compensation and failure. 112 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Parkinson's Disease Research Clinic, Brain & Mind Centre Laboratory Head Prof Simon Lewis Supervisor Dr Claire O'Callaghan Email address claire.ocallaghan@sydney.edu.au Phone 0402 245 053 Location Brain and Mind Centre , 94 Mallett Street, Camperdown, 2050 Zoom ID code Meeting ID: 918 6999 5305 Project name Neuroimaging in Parkinson's disease visual hallucinations Project (100 words) Visual hallucinations are a common and intriguing symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Our goal is to identify genes and molecular pathways that are fundamentally linked to metabolic diseases. 115 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory James Lab - Metabolic Cybernetics Laboratory Head Prof David James Supervisor Primary supervisor: Prof David James Co-supervisor: Dr Jacqueline Stoeckli Email address david.james@sydney.edu.au jacqueline.stoeckli@sydney.edu.au Phone +61 2 86275731 Location Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code Meeting ID: 912 0010 8092 Project name Mechanism by which insulin regulates lipolysis in adipocytes Project (100 words) One of the most important actions of insulin in mammals is to suppress lipolysis or fatty acid release in adipocytes. Indeed, an impairment in this process may play a major role in diseases including non -alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis. We have recently discovered a novel regulator of lipolysis in fat cells. This project will explore how insulin regulates the funct ion of this protein to coordinate the release of fatty acids from the lipid droplet. Students will learn basic cell biology techniques, molecular cloning and the use of mass spectrometry to measure protein -protein interactions. 116 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory James Lab - Metabolic Cybernetics Laboratory Head Prof David James Supervisor Primary supervisor: Prof David James Co-supervisor: Dr Sean Humphrey & Dr Alexis Diaz Email address david.james@sydney.edu.au sean.humphrey@sydney.edu.au alexis.diaz@sydney.edu.au Phone +61 2 8627 5731 Location Charles Centre Zoom ID code Meeting ID: 912 0010 8092 Project name Mechanism of insulin resistance Project (100 words) Insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development of a number of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovas cular disease and some cancers. Our group has discovered several links between how nutrients are processed and insulin resistance. This project aims to investigate the molecular basis for how mitochondrial metabolism affects insulin responses. Students wil l learn a wide range of techniques including molecular biology, cell culture, metabolic/biochemical assays, mitochondrial bioenergetics, microscopy and western blotting. 117 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Cardiovascular Control Laboratory Laboratory Head Dr Jaimie Supervisor Jaimie Polson Email address Jaimie.polson@sydney.edu.au Phone Anderson Stuart N640 Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/93553876715 Project name Effect of pharmaceutical drugs on embryonic cardiovascular function in vitro and in vivo Project (100 words) Many drugs taken during pregnancy can cause hypoxia in the embryo, with potentially devasting outcomes in both the short - and long-term. Hypoxia can be caused by direct effects on the embryonic heart, that reduce cardiac output despite a normal oxygen level, or indirectly by slow ing the blood flow through the placenta to reduce embryonic blood oxygenation. This project will examine the effects of some drugs on embryonic heart rate (measured by ECG and mechanical movements) using whole rat embryo culture in vitro and on embryonic a nd placental blood flow using high frequency ultrasound in vivo.

Diet is a potential e nvironmental factor that could be implicated i n MS. Dr Piccio's group has shown that intermittent fasting (IF) ameliorate s experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) , the main MS animal model. They have investigated s everal mechanisms, including changes in blood adipokines and i n the gut microbiome , all leading to a reduction of inflammation. The project will study the effects of diet on immune cells, circulating metabolites or metabolites derived from the gut microbiote in the EAE model. 119 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Nutritional Immunometabolism Laboratory Head A/Prof Laurence Macia Laurence Macia Email address Laurence.macia@sydney.edu.au Phone 02 8627 6525 Location Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code 93693897751 Project name Manipulate Diet and Gut microbiota to treat diseases Project (100 words) The recent rise of non -communicable diseases in developed countries such as autoimmune diseases and allergies remain unexplained. Changes in the nutritional landscape with the high consumption of unbalanced diets and processed food, as well as detrimental changes in the gut microbiota are believed to contribute to disease development. My team investigates the relationship between dietary components , gut bacteria and immune function to define novel strategies to prevent and treat diseases. During Honours you will identify the potential health benefits of defined gut bacteria as well as the mechanisms involved. 120 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Developmental Physiology Laboratory Laboratory Head A/Prof Margot Day Supervisor A/Prof Margot Day Email address Margot.day@sydney.edu.au Phone 9036 3312 Location Medical Foundation Building ( Rm 232) Zoom ID code 987 7707 5086 Project name Improving assisted reproduction Project (100 words) 4% of babies born in Australia result from assisted reproduction involving fertilization and culture of the embryo in vitro. The embryo cultur e environment can cause significant alterations in gene expression, epigenetics, metabolism and cell proliferation during preimplantation development and that these alterations may have effects on later life. Our studies aim to help us to understand the impact of the culture environment on pre -implantation embryonic development in order to improve reproductive outcomes via assisted reproduction . We study the physiological processes involved in fertilization of the oocyte and proliferation o f the cells in the preimplantation embryo. We use a range of techniques including in vitro fertilization, isolation and culture of preimplantation mouse embryos, gene expression, cell signalling, electrophysiology and live cell imaging. 121 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Developmental & Cancer Biology Laboratory Laboratory Head A/Prof Matt Naylor Supervisor A/Prof Matt Naylor Email address matthew.naylor@sydney.edu.au Phone 02 9351 4267 Location Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code Please contact me directly for more information as I am teaching during the Honours information session Project name Characterisation of novel regulators of breast & prostate cancer Project (100 words) Control of cell fate and normal cell function is critical during development and is perturbed during carcinogenesis and tumour progression. We have devel oped a number of new mouse and cell based models to investigate a novel function for a number of new targets not previously implicated in breast or prostate cancer. Techniques employed can include a combination of in vitro based techniques such as cell cul ture, morphology, migration, proliferation and biochemical assays, shRNA, and in vivo based approaches such as genetic mouse models and xenografts.

Project (100 words) Repetitive, or intermittent, hypoxia caused by repetitive airway collapse, is a key feature of OSA. Patients with OSA frequently develop additional cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. It is imperative that we understand the mechanisms driving these pathological cardiometabolic changes so that we can detect OSA earl ier and develop more effective treatment strategies for the future. Work from our lab has shown that the early cardiometabolic effects of intermittent hypoxia are dependent upon a neuropeptide acting at its receptors in specific areas of the brain and spin al cord. We hypothesise that neuropeptides are driving the chronic, maladaptive responses, leading to hypertension and development of type 2 diabetes in human OSA conditions. In this project you will be using rodents that will undergo an intermittent hypoxia protocol with and without pharmacological or genetic manipulation of central neurotransmission. You will assess the effects of these manipulations on blood pressure and glucose homeostasis. At the conclusion of the physiological experi ments tissues and blood will be collected for further assessment of the neurocircuitry involved, and the downstream effects on target organs. This will use a range of techniques including small animal surgery, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, qPCR, Western Blo t, and metabolomics. 123 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Kebede Islet Biology and Metabolism Melkam Kebede Supervisor Melkam Kebede and Belinda Yau Email address melkam.kebede@sydney.edu.au Phone 8627 0164 Location Charles Perkins Centre, Level 5 west Zoom ID code 99121823133 Project name Insulin Secretory Granules and Diabetes Project (100 words) High amounts of circulating proinsulin levels and reduced insulin response to a glucose challenge have been associated with human type 2 diabetes. Insulin is produced as a precursor, proinsulin, which is processed to mature insulin. Under normal conditions , only mature insulin is secreted into the blood stream in response to a rise in blood glucose levels. In patients with type 2 diabetes, an increased demand for insulin (usually from insulin resistance) confronts a failure of beta -cells to meet this demand . A common characteristic of this failure is a reduction in glucose stimulated mature insulin secretion and increased proinsulin secretion. This can be due to defects in proinsulin sorting into secretory vesicles prior to its processing to mature insulin. The mechanism of proinsulin sorting into secretory vesicles is unknown and this project aims to study novel candidate proteins, that may be responsible for this process. Insights from this work could lead to the development of novel therapeutic a pproaches aimed at proper trafficking of proinsulin resulting in efficient processing to insulin and hence availability of insulin for secretion. 124 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Sleep and Circadian Group, Woolcock Institute Laboratory Head Ron Grunstein Supervisor Ron Grunstein Email address ron.grunstein@sydney.edu.au Phone 9114 Woolcock Institute, Glebe Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/92921595803 Project name Sleep Spindles and Sleep Apnea in Schizophrenia and Controls Project (100 words) Sleep spindles are bursts of neural oscillatory activity generated by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) during stage 2 NREM sleep. Spindles play an essential role in both sensory processing and long-term memory consolidation. Sleep spindle abnormalities occur commonly in schizophrenia and we hypothes ise this is worse in patients with co -existing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We have a database of sleep studies in patients with schizophrenia with and without OSA and controls. The project involves measuring spindle characteristics in the EEG to determi ne the influence of sleep apnea in schizophrenia using well established automated analytics in our centre. 125 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Solon -Biet Laboratory Head Dr Samantha Dr Samantha Solon -Biet Email address Samantha.biet@sydney.edu.au Phone 0404 329 445 Location D17 Level 4 East Zoom ID code 97698428309 Project name Diet, sex and fertility - Project (100 words) Our team is running a large macronutritional trial in mice exploring how diet can be used to optimize fertility, offspring and maternal health , and lifespan . Recently, we found that the simple act of mating can trick the body into thinking it is pregnant, a phenomenon called 'pseudopregnancy'. In this project, you will work in our team and lead your own research project investigating how diet interacts with mating to drive body composition, hormonal fluctuations, and fertility in mice. 126 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Thrombosis Research Group Laboratory Head Shaun Jackson Shaun Jackson; Yuan; Mike Wu Email address shaun.jackson@sydney.edu.au ; yuping.yuan@hri.org.au mike.wu@hri.org.au Location Level 3 East, Charles Perkins Centre Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/9675888429?pwd=eStlRVpnekNLVEtDYVVSVVl6d3Z0UT09 Password: Project name Cell death pathways regulating vascular dysfunction Project (100 words) The Thrombosis Research Group aims to understand the events leading to blood vessel occlusion of the macro - and micro - vasculature, precipitating thrombosis and ischaemia reperfusion injury (IR) in cardiovascular disease . There is increasing evidence that genetically -regulated cell de ath pathways (necroptosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy) play an important role in regulating the cardiovascular system in health and disease. We have recently uncovered new roles for apoptosis and necroptosis in regulating microvascular dysfunction du ring IR injury. Our ongoing studies aim to identify/characterise the cell death pathways promoting IR injury, and identify/test novel therapeutic targets which may reduce the impact of IR injury on end-organ function (heart, brain and gut). This is particu larly important given that dysregulation of these pathways may also help explain the vascular problems experienced by COVID -19 patients. Our approach to these research questions is to examine interactions between blood cells (platelets, leukocytes, erythrocytes) and injured blood vessels (primarily endothelial cells), in vitro and ex vivo, as well as in vivo using mouse models of thrombosis, ischaemic stroke and IR injury. We combine these approaches with cutting -edge technologies including: Advanced microscopy techniques (intravital imaging, confocal, TIRF, super resolution, Biomechanics/microfluidics, biomembrane force probe (BFP) studies. Current projects include : (i) Investigating a new thromboinflammatory mechanism triggered by dying endothelium and platelets; (ii) Understanding mechanisms leading to microvascular dysfunction and poor cerebral perfusion in stroke; (iii) Discove ry/preclinical development of n ovel antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant treatments for stroke.

Large clinical trials have shown that systemically delivered broad -spectrum immunotherapies can compromise patient immune function. Immunotherapy localisation to sites of disease may increase effectiveness and safety, revolutionising the treatment of CVD. This project will design and develop new bioactive vascular materials that modulate local inflammation, representing a promising new way to treat underlying pathology, thereby establishing safe, effective, and lasting immunotherapies. The project will include design and engineering of bioactive material s urface coatings, evaluation in cell culture models, with the potential for evaluation of devices in established pre -clinical models. The focus will be to increase our understanding of how materials can be designed to reduce pathological inflammation. 128 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Blood Cell Development Lab Laboratory Head Stuart Fraser Supervisor Stuart Fraser Email address Stuart.fraser@sydney.edu.au Phone 9036 -3313 Location Medical Foundation Building Zoom ID code https://uni -sydney.zoom.us/j/93651709337 Project name Bursting Chordoma's Bubble Project (100 words) Chordoma is a rare, life -threatening spinal cord tumour . Chordoma, the termed physaliferous vacuoles (PV). We have discovered a transporter and a potassium channel regulates the formation of PV. When Bgt1/SLC6A12 was inhibited, chordoma cells rapidly apopto se.

The mdx line of mice has a similar mutation and serves as a model for studying potential treatments for DMD. We h ave recently found that muscle damage can be reduced in mdx mice by injecting an adeno - associated viral vector that encodes Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK; Trajanovska et al 2019 Journal of Physiology 597, 4831 - 4850 ). This project will study the effects of A AV vectors that encode other components of the MuSK signaling pathway to develop this a potential new therapy for DMD. 130 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES Physiology Honours 2021 Laboratory Embryonic Stem Cell Laboratory Laboratory Head Dr Michael Morris Supervisor Dr Michael Morris Email address m.morris@sydney.edu.au Phone 9036 3276 Location Medical Foundation Building Zoom ID code 977 269 6272 Project name Modelling early embryo development and neurogenesis using embryonic stem cells Project (100 words) Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type of the developing embryo and adult. So, they are invaluable in understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive normal development and can provide a window into what happens during abnormal development. ES cells also have great potential in treating a large number of currently incurable or poorly treatable human diseases and injuries, including neuropathies, brain and spinal injuries, muscular diseases, and diabetes. We use ES cells as an in vitro model to understand the key molecular mechanisms underpinning critical developmental milestones forming the nervous system. 131 SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES AMED General Q&A Andrew Harman \"AMED "}
