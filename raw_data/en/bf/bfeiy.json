Homeopathy is an ancient school of medicine, which functions on the principle of \"similia similibus curentar i.e. like cure likes\". Created by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796.

The active element from these substances is extracted in specific ways and processed into tablets, ointments, gels, and drops. HOW HOMEOPATHY WORKS ?? The philosophy behind the working of homeopathy is that stimulates the immune system, thus helping the body to recover on its own.

For e.g. If two persons are taking medicine for similar disease condition then there are high chances that their homeopathic doctor will prescribe them different medicine. What differentiates this system of medicine from a different system is a person's personality and emotions. Therefore if a Homeopathic doctor is taking a detailed case history, in-depth talk about your stress level, other physical symptoms, family history, and relationship history.
