Reichhart1,* 1UdS IBMC CNRS, Strasbourg, France The adaptive immune system with its antibodies, B and T cells arose around 500 million years ago in the rst vertebrates and inall invertebrates, the defence mechanisms are purely innate. We have been working since 1985 on the innate immune system, using Drosophila as a model system. In Drosophila ,a ni n f e c t i o np r o - vokes the rapid synthesis of powerful antibiotic peptides. As anexample, the basal level of expression of the antifungal peptide DROSOMYCIN is increased a thousand fold within 30 min of septic injury. The control of this expression involves at least twopathways that, for sake of simplicity, I refer to as the TOLL and theIMD pathways. The paramount role of the TOLL and IMD path- ways in the host defence of Drosophila is illustrated by experiments in which mutant flies are challenged with fungi or bacteria. InTOLL-decient mutants, survival to fungal, but not to bacterial infection, is severely compromised. By contrast, IMD mutants are markedly affected by bacterial infections but resist fungi. In ver-tebrates, recognition of microbes by the innate immune system takesplace at the cellular level by a family of transmembrane receptors homolog to Drosophila Toll, namely the Toll like receptors or TLRs. In Drosophila however, these recognition events take place in the open circulatory system via soluble excreted recognitionproteins like the peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). In turn, these recognition steps must be conveyed onto Toll by extra- cellular proteolytic signalling pathways. Upstream zing Gram-negative microbial determinants. We are now interested in how these two pathways are activated and regulated. Although anatomy of the Drosophila immune system differs widely from the vertebrate immune system,we will discuss the possibility that the fruit fly, with its powerful genetics and simple organization, could become a new paradigm to study inflammation. PL2 KL-02 NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN INFLAMMATION: THE EXAMPLE OF ENDOGENOUS GAS J. L. Wallace1,* 1Farncombe Digestive Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada Over the past three decades, there has been a growing appreciation of the physiological and pathophysiological importance of endogenous gaseous mediators, such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulde. All three gases were initially considered poisons, but theirphysiological importance is now unquestionable. H 2S exerts a number of anti-inflammatory effects, including suppression of leukocyteadherence to the vascular endothelium, edema formation and NfKB activation. It also promotes resolution of inflammation and promotes wound healing. H 2S may therefore be exploited in the design of more effective and/or less toxic anti-inflammatory compounds. In recentyears, we have attempted to achieve this using hydrogen sulde- releasing moieties, covalently linked to a number of different anti- inflammatory drugs. For example, mesalamine is the rst-line therapyfor inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis),but it is a weak drug, with doses of up to 4 g per day required. An H2S- releasing derivative of mesalamine (ATB-429) was shown to be sig- nicantly more potent in two models of colitis. In addition to reducinginflammation, ATB-429 suppressed expression of a number colonic tissue. Another class of thera- peutics we have focused on is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs). While very effective at reducing pain and inflammation, these drugs continue to be limited in their utility by signicant toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract (the advent of selective COX-2 inhibitorshas been only a modest advance in this regard). Several H 2S-releasing NSAIDs have been developed and tested extensively. ATB-346 is an H2S-releasing derivative of naproxen. It exhibits comparable anti- inflammatory and analgesic effects to naproxen, but does not produceany detectable GI injury in a variety of rodent models, including some inwhich gastrointestinal mucosal defence is severely impaired. More- over, rather than impairing the healing of pre-existing ulcers, as is seen with naproxen and other NSAIDs, ATB-346 signicantly enhancedhealing. This approach could be taken to modify a wide range of drugs, as has been done with nitric oxide-releasing therapeutic agents. PL3 KL-03 Unit, MICA Department, INRA, Jouy-en-Josas, France The incidence of chronic diseases is steadily rising over the past decades. Perturbations of gut microbial communities have been sug- gested in many of these. The main objective of the MetaHIT consortium is to explore associations of the bacterial genes, genomesor communities from the human gut with two chronic diseases, obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases. We developed a powerful new approach, Quantitative Metagenomics, to visualize the gut bac-teria present in any individual. It is based on two main elements, thereference gene catalog of the gut bacterial genes and the high throughput sequencing of the total stool DNA. The reference gene catalog was established by massive Illumina sequencing of total fecalDNA from 124 individuals of European origin. It contains 3.3 millionnon-redundant genes, 150-fold more than encoded by our own gen- ome. It captures over 85% of the genes from our cohort and includes about 80% of those found in previous studies of smaller scope, carriedout in Japan and the US. This indicates that it represents well the human intestinal metagenome and has become known as our other genome (Qin et al. in Nature 464:59-65, 2010). Two case/controlstudies, one of obese and lean individuals and the other of theulcerative colitis patients and family matched controls will be pre- sented. They reveal links between bacterial diversity and inflammation, which may be relevant to numerous pathologies. Fur-thermore, they unveil association of bacterial species to chronicInflamm. Res. S5 123disease. The species have a diagnostic/prognostic potential well above that of the alleles of our own genome, suggesting that personalizedmedicine should target, in preference, our other genome. PL4 KL-04 SENESCENCE AND INFLAMMATION: NEW LINKS, NEW TARGETS J. Campisi1,2,* 1Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, USA,2Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA Cellular senescence is a powerful anti-cancer mechanism by which cells undergo a permanent arrest of cell proliferation (growth). Cellular senescence is also thought to cause or contribute to aging. How can thesame process have such apparently incongruous effects (tumor suppres- sion and aging)? The senescence growth arrest is accompanied by large-scale changes in gene expression. One outcome of these changes is a robust increase inthe expression and secretion of numerous cytokines, growth factors and proteases, which we term the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). A striking feature of the SASP is that many SASP componentsare potent pro-inflammatory proteins. Inflammation, of course, drivesvirtually every major age-related disease, including, ironically, cancer. As an inflammatory response, cellular senescence also entails the expression of proteins that signal the immune system and targets senes-cent cells for clearance. Some senescent cells, however, escape immuneclearance. Understanding how some senescent cells evade immune clearance provides novel targets for interventions aimed at facilitating the destruction of senescent cells by the immune system. Recent ndingsshow that the SASP is primarily a DNA damage response (DDR) that may have evolved to allow damaged cells to communicate their com- promised state to the surrounding tissue. The DDR engages a number ofstress-responsive pathways that collaborate to stimulate These pathways include well-known transcriptional regu- lators of such as NF- jB. They also include novel pathways that act at the level of translation, such as the mTOR pathway. These newdata identify novel targets for suppressing the deleterious (pro-inflam-matory) effects of cellular senescence, while preserving its benecial (tumor suppressive) effects.

Hirota1 1Division of Molecular Immunology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK Interleukin 17 is a cytokine with central involvement in inflammatory immune responses. It is primarily produced by Th17 CD4 T cells, asubset of TCR cdT cells and some NKT cells. Over the past few years it has become clear that the production of IL-17 is regulated at multiple levels\u2014both positively and negatively\u2014to control itsactivity which when dysregulated can initiate pathogenic immunity and result in a variety of autoimmune syndromes. Cytokine produc-tion by Th17 effector cells is not a stable parameter, but instead appears to be modulated on several levels. As more states of CD4 T cell differentiation are uncovered, their flexibility is also beginning tobe recognized. Components that control the plasticity of CD4 T cellpopulations include environmental influences at tissue sites, tran- scriptional circuitry and chromatin modications. Understanding the rules that underlie adaptation and flexibility of T cell responses willbe an essential part for future intervention strategies in human diseasestates.

EDUC2 MICRORNAS AS NEW PLAYERS OF INFLAMMATION B. Mari, R. Rezzonicco, L. E. Zaragosi, N. Pottier, expression at a post-transcrip- tional level by binding to complementary target mRNAs. They are involved into many aspects of immune system development, from hematopoiesis to activation of innate and adaptive immune response toinfection. They also mediate complex multi-cellular regulations, forinstance during regeneration of airway and skin epithelia . Epithelial- mesenchymal interactions, which are critical during vertebrate embryo development, and for maintenance of homeostasis in adult tissues, aremodulated by miRNAs. Thus, miR-155 factor (KGF, FGF-7), a member of the broblast growth factor (FGF) family, was established as a target inhuman lung broblasts. In vivo experiments using a mouse model of lung brosis have shown that miR-155 expression level is indeed cor- related with the degree of lung brosis. miRNA dysregulation is alsocentral to the development and pathophysiology of many cancers. Wehave recently highlighted the importance of miR-210 and of its tran- scriptional regulation by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) lung cancer. Over-expression of miR-210 at latestages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer causes an alteration of cellviability, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the apparition of an aberrant Expression a specic signature that includes several subunits of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complexes I andII. The transcript coding for one of these ETC components, SDHD, a subunit of Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) is miR-210-mediated mito- chondrial targeting of SDHDwas able to activate HIF-1, in line with previous studies linking loss-of- function SDH mutations to HIF-1 activation. miR-210 can thus regulate mitochondrial function by targeting key ETC components genes withimportant consequences on cell metabolism, survival and modulation ofHIF-1 activity. We will discuss our current understanding of these general regulatory mechanisms, focusing on their involvement in inflammation. Triboulet et al. Science. 2007;315:1579-82. Pottier et al. PLoS One.

SYMPOSIUM News and goods to map and treat inflammatory bowel disease (SY01) SY-01 MAPPING THE GENES FOR IBD Diderot, Ho pital Robert Debre \u00b4, Paris, France The genetic component of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) is among the best known for complex genetic disorders. The role of genes in Crohn's Disease (CD) appears to be stronger than in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) as demonstrated by the percentages offamilial cases [8-10% (CD) vs. 6-8% (UC)] and monozygotic twins [20-50% (CD) vs. 2-6% (UC)]. Gene hunting was rarely fruitful in the past when using the functional candidate gene approach (e.g. HLA genes in UC), or linkage studies(e.g. NOD2 and SLC22A4/5 in CD). Conversely, the genome wideassociation studies (GWAS) have now provided more than 70 sus- ceptibility genes for CD and more than 40 for UC in few years. These genes dene some key biological functions like innateimmunity and autophagy for CD and Th17 T-cell orientation for both diseases. However, despite of these important successes, GWAS failed to explain more than 25% of the heritability of IBDsuggesting that the additional genetic variations, gene-gene or gene-environment interaction and stochastic events may play a role in the predisposition to IBD.SY-02 NOD PROTEINS CONTROL EARLY INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES AT THE INTESTINAL MUCOSA IMPORTANTFOR PATHOGEN CLEARANCE 1Depts. of Immunology,2Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, 3Department of Laboratory Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Nod1 and Nod2 are pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system that detect peptidoglycan (PG) from the bacterial cell wall and trigger inflammation. Although both of these members of the Nod-likereceptor (NLR) family respond to PG they respond to distinct sub-structures of this complex microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP). Indeed, Nod1 recognizes diaminopimelic acid-containing Gram-negative Nod2 detects muramyl dipeptide, which is the minimal fragmentof PG common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Detection of these muropeptides by Nod1 and Nod2 triggers a signal transduction cascade that culminates in the activation of NF jB and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, Nod1 and Nod2 have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in particular Nod2 has been associated with Crohn's disease, yet a clearunderstanding of how dysfunctional Nod activation leads to aberrantinflammation is still lacking. While much of our previous work has focused on dissection of Nod signalling in in vitro and ex vivo models, our current interest is to understand how Nods function at the mucosalsurface of the gastrointestinal tract and how they orchestrate inflam-mation and combat enteric infection. Specically, we are interested in using bacterial colitis models, including the Citrobacter rodentium and streptomycin-treated Salmonella typhimurium models to probe Nod responses at the level of the intestinal mucosa. Our overall goal is tounderstand how Nod activation orchestrates mucosal responses and to delineate the functional importance of Nod triggering in order to gain a more complete understanding of their role in IBD. SY-03 CAN WE PLAY WITH GUT MICROBIOTA TO TREAT P. Langella1,*, L. \u00b42, H. Sokol3, P. Seksik3 A high decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of Firmicutes (one of two main phyla of the normal human gut microbiota) in Crohn'sdisease (CD) patients was previously described [1, 2]. Faecalibacte- rium prausnitzii is one of the dominant species of the Firmicutes phylum in the human gut. We rst determined the composition of themucosa associated microbiota of ileal CD patients at the time of sur-gical resection and 6 months later. We found that a proportion of F.Inflamm. Res. S7 123prausnitzii on resected ileal Crohn's with a higher risk of endoscopic postoperative recurrence at 6 months. Wethus hypothesized that F. prausnitzii could display anti-inflammatory effects. We thus analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of F. pra- usnitzii in both in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro PBMCs stimulation byF. prausnitzii led to lower and higher IL-10 Oral administration of either liveF. prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBScolitis. These anti-inflammatory effects are most probably partly due tosecreted metabolites able to block NF- jB activation and IL-8 pro- duction. We are now evaluating whether these properties are or not a general trait of F. prausnitzii species by isolating and testing other strains. In order to decipher the interactions between F. prausnitzii and the host, animal models with simplied microbiota are actually developed. We are also trying to identify the anti-inflammatory mol- ecules in the supernatant of F. prausnitzii and the bacterial genes encoding these molecules. Finally, this knowledge might be useful for the application of probiotics or pharmacological molecules in CD for which the current treatments are poorly effective and merely aimed atmaintenance of the disease. Counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. pra- usnitzii as a probiotic is thus a promising strategy in CD treatment. 1. Sokol et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2006;12:106-11. 2. Manichanh et al.

Clement1,* 1INSERM, U France; Cordeliers, Universite \u00b4Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris6, UMRS 872, Paris, France The increase in circulating inflammatory factors found in obese subjects and the discovery of macrophage accumulation in human adipose tissue has opened a new eld of research in obesity. This allowed reconsidering aspects of obesity physiopathology. The socalled ''low grade'' inflammatory state is characterized by the mod- erate but chronic systemic rise of an increasing panel of molecules. Asmall or even modest reduction of weight, known to ameliorate obesity associated risks, signicantly reduces circulating inflamma- tory markers. However knowledge regarding the molecules linkingobesity to its complications is still lacking. White adipose tissuecontributes signicantly to low-grade inflammation in obesity. This tissue is composed of mature adipocytes, precursors (preadipocytes), endothelial cells, macrophages, mast cells, blood vessels, nerves andlymphatic and connective tissue. The phenotype, amount and biologyof adipose tissue components are altered profoundly in human obesity. The evaluation of transcriptomic interactions characterizing the obese adipose tissue demonstrated the strong relationship linkinginflammatory processes to extra cellular matrix remodelling compo-nents. Our group showed that interstitial brosis accumulates in obese adipose tissue as in many organs affected by low-grade inflammation in chronic diseases (i.e. liver, lung, kidney pathologies). In addition,to structural and biological alterations of adipose tissue, there are perturbations of its dialogue with central (i.e. brain) and peripheral organs (i.e. muscle, intestine, liver, bone, vessels) via multiple signalsincluding inflammatory mediators. The aim of this lecture is to dis-cuss up-to-date current knowledge regarding the importance of inflammation and adipose tissue remodelling especially in human obesity. A clinical angle will be taken. SY-06 THE MULTIFACETED ROLE OF ADIPONECTIN U. Mu \u00a8ller-Ladner1,*, K. P. Frommer1,C .B u Gie\u00dfen, Kerckhoff-Klinik, Bad Nauheim, Germany, 2Department of Internal Medicine I, Reegensburg, *Department of Experimental Rheumatology, UniversityHospital Zu \u00a8rich, Switzerland Adipose tissue is a structural component of many organs including skin, the intestine and the joints. The dominant cell type, theadipocyte but also other mesenchymal cells, produce highly bio-active substances, the so called adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines include a growing number adiponectin, resistin, leptin, and visfatin/PBEF. In addition, adipo-kines are able to actively modulate inflammation and the innate immune system. Besides stimulating IL-6 and MMP-3, adiponectin enhances RANKL expression in osteoblasts whereas expres-sion Recombinant human resistin increases secretion pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and in murine and human macrophages. In addition, human endothelial cells are activated by recombinant human resistinleading to increased expression of endothelin-1 and several adhe-sion molecules as well as chemokines in these cells. Visfatin or pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF) activates human leu- kocytes and to induce co-stimulatory cytokines such visfatin protects broblasts and neutrophils from apoptosis. Taken together, there is increasing evidence thatadipokines produced by cells driving synovial pathophysiologyactively take part in inflammatory, matrix destructive and brotic processes in rheumatic diseases.S8 Inflamm. Res. 123SY-07 THE ROLE OF IMMUNE CELLS is recognized as a low grade chronic inflammatory state. Several inflammatory factors are known to directly interact with insulin signaling pathway leading to insulin resistance. Such an effect is thought to contribute to the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes.Increasing evidences show that the adipose tissue (AT) itself is the site and the source of inflammation. Indeed, accumulation of innate and adaptive immune cells is observed in AT of various murine models ofobesity (genetic and diet-induced obesity) as well as in human withincreased adiposity index. Initial studies focused on adipose tissue macrophages (ATM). Characterization of human ATM (hATM) phenotypes and roles showed that hATM impact hAT remodeling,including adipocyte differentiation, angiogenesis and brosis.Through these local effects, ATMs may limit the AT capacity to buffer the toxic fatty acids into neutral triglycerides in adipocytes and thereby contribute to the ectopic lipid deposit into metabolic active tissuesleading to insulin resistance. Kinetics studies of immune cells traf-cking in AT clearly showed that T lymphocytes accumulate in mice AT before ATMs. The proportion of adipose tissue lymphocytes (ATL) subsets, including T lymphocytes, Th1 helper andcytotoxic T cells, are modulated with AT development. Analysis of the role of hATLs showed that hATL-derived secretions including inter- feron interfered with insulin-mediated up-regulation of the keylipogenic enzymes in adipocytes. Therefore, accumulation and acti-vation of ATLs appears to be the primary event involved in obesity- associated inflammation and several recent evidences suggest that such an event might be related to cell-mediated immune response.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Only afew bacterial phyla have adapted to this predominantly anaerobic environment, but hundreds of different species create an ecosystem that affects many facets of the host's physiology. Recent data showhow particular symbionts are involved in the maturation of theimmune system, in the intestine and beyond, and how dysbiosis, or alteration of that community, can deregulate immunity and lead to immunopathology. The extensive and dynamic interactions betweenthe symbionts and the immune system are key to homeostasis and health, and require all the blends of so-called regulatory and pro- inflammatory immune reactions. Unfortunately, pro-inflammatoryimmunity leading to the generation of Th17 cells has been mainlyassociated with its role in immunopathology. Here I discuss the view that the immune system in general, and type 17 immunity in particular, develop to maintain the equilibrium of the host with its symbionts. SY-09 REGULATORY T CELLS AND TH17 MEDIATED INFLAMMATION A. Y. Rudensky1,* 1Immunology Program and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg cells) play a critical role in immune homeostasis by opposing immune-mediated inflammation in the context of autoimmunity, responses to infection, cancer, allergy, and interactions with commensal microbiota at the environmental inter-faces. Transcription factor Foxp3 orchestrates differentiation andInflamm. Res. S9 123function of these cells. Our studies suggest that Foxp3 cooperates with other regulators of gene expression and co-factors to ensure themaintenance of its own expression and Treg cell suppressor function under basal and inflammatory conditions. In this regard, the ability of Treg cells to suppress Th17 mediated inflammatory responses in theintestines is dependent upon IL-10 receptor mediated activation oftranscription factor Stat3 and its cooperation with Foxp3. SY-10 EFFECTOR AND REGULATORY T CELLSIN INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING DISEASES (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the brain and spinal cord leading to damage of nerve bers resulting in neurological impairment and decits. The cause of MS is still mostly unknown. Demyelination in the centralnervous system in MS is thought to be mainly mediated by T helper 1cells, although this dogma is currently heavily discussed since recent evidence suggests an active pathogenic role of T helper 17 and CD8 T cells in MS, which recapitulates earlier suggestions that virus may havepathogenic role in MS. The contribution of regulatory CD4 Foxp3+ T cells in the control of the disease is also controversial. Currently the unraveling of immune-mediated pathogenesis in MS relies mostly onanimal models. So far there is not one animal model that reflects allaspects seen in MS, but still the many different models are very suitable for targeting specic aspects of this disease. By using rodent models we pinpointed several cellular and molecular pathways of potential relevancefor human inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Thelessons learned from these models will be discussed.

U. 1Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland Apoptosis is the most common form of physiological cell death and required for normal development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with various path- ological conditions. In inflammation, for example, inhibition ofapoptosis of inflammatory cells is a common phenomenon and essential to effectively ght against pathogens. On the other hand, specic tissue cells frequently undergo apoptosis in association withinflammatory responses that may cause or at least contribute toorgan dysfunction. In contrast to apoptosis, autophagy is a cellular survival mechanism and usually induced when cells are exposed to stress. In infectious diseases, autophagy degrades intracellularpathogens and promotes cellular survival during pathogen invasion.Autophagy has also been shown to be involved in MHC class I and II antigen presentation, and may be required for the induction of self-tolerance. In addition, there is evidence that autophagy mayprovide negative feedback to dampen inflammatory signalling. Therefore, defects in autophagy may lead to autoimmunity. More- over, in certain instances, induction of autophagy may including apoptosis, autophagic pathways. Taken together, apoptosis and autophagy are critical to the overall fate of the cell and play important roles in immunity and inflammation. SY-12 IMMUNOGENIC DEATH: CELL BIOLOGICAL AND pital Europe \u00b4en George Pompidou, Paris, France Physiological cell death, which occurs as a continuous byproduct of cellular turnover, is non-immunogenic or even tolerogenic, thereby avoiding autoimmunity. However, cancer cell death elicitedby radiotherapy and some chemotherapeutic agents such as anth-racyclines and oxaliplatin can be immunogenic. Immunogenic death involves changes in the composition of the cell surface, as well as the release of soluble immunogenic signals that occur in adened temporal sequence. This 'key' then operates on a series ofreceptors expressed by dendritic cells (DC, the 'lock') to allow for the presentation of tumor antigens to T cells and for the initiation of a productive immune response. Immunogenic cell death ischaracterized by the early cell surface exposure of calreticulin, which determines the uptake of tumor antigens by DC. The late release of the protein high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), whichacts on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is required for the presentationof antigens from dying tumor cells. In addition, the release of ATP from dying cells causes the P2RX7 purinergic receptor-dependent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in DC, to release polarize tumor antigen-S10 123specic CD8 T cells towards a Tc1 cytokine pattern. We postulate that the immune system determines the long-term success of anti-cancer therapies, and that this immune response is dictated by immunogenic tumor cell death. Thus, therapeutic failure can result from failure to undergo immunogenic cell death (rather than celldeath as such). Thus, agents that fail to induce immunogenic celldeath cannot yield a long-term success in cancer therapy. More- over, tumors that are intrinsically unable to undergo immunogenic cell death are incurable. Importantly, it appears that mitochondrialevents determine whether cancer cells die or not in response tochemotherapy, while an endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) response combined with autophagy determines whether this cell death is perceived as immunogenic. We suggest a series of strat-egies to restore the immunogenicity of cell death in the context ofdecient ER stress and autophagy.

Recently linear ubiquitin chains, assembled by a complex containing HOIL-1 and HOIP, were implicated in TNF signalling, yet their in vivo rel-evance remained uncertain. We identied Sharpin as a third component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, recruited to the CD40 and TNF receptor signalling complexes together with itsother constituents, HOIL-1 and HOIP. Mass spectrometry of thenative TNF receptor signalling complex revealed RIP1 and NEMO to be linearly ubiquitinated. Mutation of the Sharpin gene causes chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm ) in mice characterised by derived cells which were rendered sensitive to TNF-induced death. Importantly, Tnfgene deciency prevented skin lesions in cpdm mice. We conclude that by enabling linear ubiquitination in the TNFreceptor signalling complex Sharpin interferes with TNF-induced cell death and, thereby, prevents inflammation. Our results provide in vivo evidence for the relevance of linear ubiquitination in preventinginflammation and regulating immune signalling.OC-008 THE NUCLEAR PROTEIN MNDA MODULATES MCL-1 EXPRESSION AND NEUTROPHIL APOPTOSIS IN SEPSIS See Oral Communication Session section for abstract page 37 OC-009NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC RELOCALIZATION OF THE PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN (PCNA) DURING DIFFERENTIATIONIS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS ANTIAPOPTOTIC ACTIVITY IN MATURE NEUTROPHIL: IDENTIFICATION OF A NUCLEAR EXPORTSEQUENCE See Oral Communication Session section for abstract page 37 OC-010 EFFECT OF NEUTROPHIL EXTRACELLULAR TRAPS ON DENDRITIC CELL MATURATION See Oral Communication Session section for abstract page 37 Inflammatory cells: neutrophils and macrophages (SY05) SY-14 RESPONSE M. A. Cassatella1,* 1Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, Section of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy Historically, neutrophils have been considered as innate immune cells with an anti-infectious and pro-inflammatory function, due to their ability to phagocytose and to produce powerful antimicrobial peptides, proteolyticenzymes and reactive oxygen intermed pected biological features of polymorphonuclear neutrophils have been uncovered. Indeed, it has been shown that in addition to their pivotal role inthe defence against pathogens, neutrophils also display a high degree ofplasticity as well as contribute to the c ontrol of adaptive immune responses. For instance, various experimental models have validated that, after migration to an infection site, neutroph ils are stimulated by the causative agent to produce not only proinflammatory which are chemo-attractive for neutrophils, followed by a second wave of selected CCL chemokines,for instance, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL20, that serve an inInflamm.

In addition, neutrophils were recentlydemonstrated to directly interact with immune and non-immune cell types, including dendritic cells (DC), NK cells, iNKT cells, polarized T cells and mesenchymal cells, a feature which greatly emphasizes their capacity tocontribute as orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunity. All these novelaspects of the biology of neutrophils will be exhaustively covered, with particular emphasis on the more recent advances. Disclosure of interest: None declared. SY-15 HOW HUMAN NEUTROPHILS KILL INGESTED MICROBES W. M. Nauseef1,* 1Inflammation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs, Iowa City VA Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa, United States Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) represent an essential cellular component of innate host defense against infection. Upon engagement with a suitably opsonized microbe, PMN ingest andconne the organism in a specialized compartment, the phagosome,where cytotoxins can be delivered. Concomitant with phagocytosis, there is coordinated assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase, the source of oxidants to fuel microbial killing, and fusion of PMNgranules, a source of a host of proteolytic enzymes and antimicrobialproteins. Prominent among the granule proteins delivered to the phagosome is myeloperoxidase (MPO), a hemeprotein uniquely able to generate hypochlorous acid (bleach), a potent antimicrobial agent,in the presence of H 2O2. Although optimal PMN microbicidal activity relies on MPO-mediated production of HOCl and its capacity to modify microbial targets, efcient killing and degradation of ingested organisms reflects the coordinated activities of many bioactive species.The mechanisms underlying the generation and antimicrobial action in phagosomes will be highlighted, as will specic synergies between sol- uble circulating proteins and PMN responses that collaborate to eradicateinvading microbes. Lastly, it is critical to recognize that many ingestedmicrobes immediately sense and respond transcriptionally to the cyto- toxins present in the phagosome. Successful microbial reactions allow ingested microbes such as staphylococci to survive and cause persistentinfection. Only by understanding the molecular basis for the dynamicinteractions between host and microbe will novel advances in antimi- crobial therapy be made. SY-16 MACROPHAGE HETEROGENEITY DURING INFECTIOUS DISEASES D. M. Mosser1,* 1Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, and the Maryland Pathogen Research Institute, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA Tissue macrophages can change their physiology in response to a variety of endogenous and exogenous signals generated in tissue. Many inflammatory signals can promote a classical macrophage activation state, characterized by the production of myriad inflammatory cytokines.These classically activated macrophages are an important component of host defense, but they are also responsible for host tissue damage duringautoimmune diseases. We and others have identied signals that can 'reprogram' macrophages to assume physiologies that are quite distinct from activated macrophages. We have identied a so-called' 'regulatory macrophage' that produces high levels of the anti-inflam-matory cytokine, IL-10. These cells are potent down-regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses and they can prevent or reverse auto- immune pathology. The 'reprogramming' step involves the activation ofthe Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, ERK, which leads to histonephosphorylation and chromatin remodeling at the IL-10 promoter. Regulatory macrophages secrete high levels of IL-10 but little to unde- tectable amounts of IL-12. Work is on-going to identify the varioussignals that can reprogram these cells to become regulatory macrophagesand to discover biochemical markers that are specic to regulatory macrophages. The manipulation of the various macrophage subpopula- tions may lead to new approaches to diminish autoimmune pathologies,or conversely to develop more effective immune responses during vaccination.

The existence of a microbiome-brain communication was conrmed in adoptive transfer experiments where behavioral traits of one murine strain wereinduced in germ free recipients of another strain, following coloni- zation with cecal bacteria. These results indicate that the intestinal microbiome communicates with the host enteric nervous system toalter visceral pain responses by an inflammation-dependent mecha-nism, and with the brain to alter behavior by an inflammation- independent mechanism. These ndings may explain the frequent co- existence of pain and altered behavior in functional and inflammatoryGI diseases. SY-18 NEW TARGETS FOR INFLAMMATORY PAIN: TRPV1 AND TRPA1 S. D. Brain1,* 1Centre of Integrative Biomedicine and Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building, Waterloo Campus, London, UK Approximately 30% of arthritic patients consider that their medicines could be improved, especially in terms of pain relief. The work in thislaboratory has concentrated on providing evidence for role of membersof the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, especially TRPV1 and TRPA1 in murine models of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Our rst study revealed a role for the TRPV1 receptor in attenuating thermal hyper-algesia and inflammatory swelling in a model of CFA-inducedinflammation, in a situation where TNF alevels remained high. Inter- estingly, we also showed that capsaicin induced TRPV1-dependent vasoconstriction in the knee and the consequences of this are at presentunknown. Further studies enabled a link between TNF alevels and TRPV1-dependent hyperalgesia to be made, a mechanism that is dependent on COX-2 and other cytokines, as well as TRPV1. Morerecently we have gained evidence that TRPA1 is also involved inmediating pain. In this case TRPA1 is important in mediating mechanical-induced hyperalgesia, an anti-hyperalgesic effect that appears independent of an effect on inflammation. Keeble et al.

P. Geppetti1,* 1Headache Center, University Hospital-Careggi and Department of Preclinical and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Florence,Italy Migraine is a highly prevalent chronic condition characterized by disabling attacks of pulsating head pain associated with nausea andvomiting, as well as other symptoms. The pathogenesis of migraine is still unknown, however, recent evidence supports the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the pathway which resultsin headache and the associated symptoms of migraine attack. Therole of CGRP released from the central terminals of trigeminal neurons and other dorsal root ganglion neurons is still uncertain, whereas CGRP released from peripheral and perivascular endings ofthese neurons causes a marked and prolonged arterial vasodilatation.CGRP receptor antagonists have been found to ameliorate the migraine attack. It is possible that blockade of the hitherto not well dened central actions, or of the well known vasodilator effect ofCGRP of the peptide, are key mechanisms for migraine treatment. Aseries of agents identied as triggers of migraine attacks have been found to release CGRP, and through this mechanism to produce meningeal vasodilatation. These include, among many other agents,ethanol, which acts via the sensitization of the transient receptor potential vanilloi-1 (TRPV1) channel, or ingredients of cigarette smoke via the TRPA (ankyrin)-1 channel. TRPA1 activation andCGRP release are umbellulone, a compoundcontained in Umbellularia californica , known also as the headache tree because, beginning rst with the Native Americans, all the way through present times, the scent of its leaves has been recognized asa cause of headache. Sir Thomas Lewis in 1936 proposed that a pro-inflammatory substance was released from nocifensive neurons to produce vasodilatation and sensitization of these neurons to painful stimuli. Recent acquisition strongly suggests that this substance isCGRP, which via these, and possibly additional mechanisms, plays a major role in migraine mechanism.

On the other hand, the synovial broblasts have beenconsidered for a long time as innocent bystanders or just as effector cells responding to the stimulation of immune cells. However, in recent years we and others have been showing that synovial bro-blasts (SF) are not only part of the innate immune system by theexpression of Toll-like and NOD receptors, but also active and aggressively growing cells [1] participating in the spreading of the disease [2]. Since the RASF remain active after removing them fromthe inflammatory milieu we searched for endogenous factors andepigenetic mechanisms of regulation [3]. In this regard we could show that RASF are hypomethylated cells residing in a hyperacetylated synovial tissue and are characterized by a distinct pattern of miRNAexpression [4]. 1.

Mocsai1,* 1Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University School of Medicine, Budapest, Hungary Neutrophils are critical components of innate immunity but their improper activation may also lead to tissue damage during auto- immune inflammation. Integrins and immunoreceptors play criticalroles in neutrophil activation, as well as in the neutrophil-mediatedeffector phase of various autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Our results indicate a surprising similarity between integrin and immu-noreceptor signal transduction pathways C c2 (PLC c2). The molecules also appear to participate in b2integrin-mediated acti- vation of macrophages. Furthermore, DAP12/FcR c, Syk and are also required for osteoclast development and osteoclast-mediatedbone resorption. Taken together, a signal transduction pathwayreminiscent of that utilized by classical immunoreceptors mediates non-immunoreceptor signaling processes such as integrin signaling or osteoclast development and function. To test whether the abovepathway also participates in pathological processes, we tested thedevelopment of K/BxN serum transfer arthritis, an autoantibody- mediated arthritis model, in various genetically decient mouse strains. Our results indicate that Src-family kinases, Syk and PLC c2 are all required for the autoantibody-mediated effector phase of this disease. Components of this pathway may prove to be suitable targets of the pharmacological therapy of autoantibody-mediateddiseases such as certain subsets of rheumatoid arthritis. SY-22 THE EVOLUTION OF THE DISEASE-SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE IN (PRE)-ARTHRITIS:CAN WE IDENTIFY A MASTERSWITCH DETERMINING THE ONSET OF IMMUNE MEDIATED INFLAMMATORY DISEASES? R. Toes1,* 1Dept. of Rheumatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are a very distinctive feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The presence of these antibodies is highly predictive for both the development of RA andthe extent of associated joint destruction. Recent evidence indicatesthat well-known genetic risk factors for RA: the HLA-DRB1 alleles inantly with positive RA. These reports,together with the nding that ACPA can exacerbate arthritis inmice, suggest that anti-peptidylcitrulline immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Studies investi- gating at which point in time ACPA rst appear, have revealedthat these antibodies can often be detected several years beforedisease onset. The mere presence of ACPA therefore does not appear to be sufcient to precipitate disease. An explanation for this observation could be that the anti-citrullinated protein immuneresponse rst needs to mature more fully, in the course of which ACPA could acquire distinct characteristics which are instrumental in mediating tissue damage. Taking into consideration that ACPAcan be detected before the clinical diagnosis of RA, and that thepresence of ACPA is strongly associated with disease progression, we hypothesized that epitope spreading, avidity maturation and/or isotype usage of the ACPA response may play a role in the evo-lution of the disease. Our data reveal that broadening of isotype-usage and Epitope spreading with recognition of more citrullinated antigens occurs before onset of RA and that immunological dif- ferences in these ACPA are associated with the future diseasecourse.S14 Inflamm.

H. Krause1,* 1Medical Faculty and University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland NOX enzymes are a gene family of reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2014generating NADPH oxidases. In mammals, 7 They transport electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the membrane and attach it to oxygen to form superoxide and down-stream ROS, includinghydrogen peroxide. ROS are key players in inflammation, howeverin contrast with classical views, they have not only proinflamma- tory, but also antiinflammatory properties. I will discuss the two aspects. Concerning the proinflammatory properties of NOX-derivedROS and will discuss ROS-mediated neuroinflammation and -degeneration, commonly seen in a variety of diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, ALS, stroke and epilepsy. Concerning the antiinflammatory properties of NOX-derived ROS, I will discuss hyperinflammation and increasedautoimmune disease in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, a deciency in NOX2 or subunits thereof), as well as in mouse models of CGD. I will then discuss redox-sensitive signalingpathways which might account for the complex role of NOX- derived ROS in inflammation.SY-24 IKK/NF- JB SIGNALLING IN CHRONIC INFLAMMATION M. Pasparakis1,* 1Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Intracellular signal transduction pathways activated downstream of pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors play a critical rolefor the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The NF- jB pathway is one of the most important signalling cascades activated by cytokine and innate immune receptors. NF- jB regulates cellular responses to infection, injury and other stressful conditions requiringrapid reprogramming of gene expression. NF- jB activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, particularly chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer. NF- jB activation is mediated by the IjB kinase (IKK), which consists of two catalytic subunits, IKK1 (IKKa) and IKK2 (IKK b), named NF- jB Essential Modulator (NEMO) or IKK c. In vivo studies in genetic mouse models provided experimental evidence for the fundamental functions of NF- jB signalling in inflammation. Using tissue specic ablation of IKK subunits we have studied the role of NF- jB for the maintenance of immune homeostasis in epithelial surfaces. Epidermal keratinocyte specic blockade of NF- jB signalling caused strong inflammatory skin lesions resembling human psoriasis. Moreover, epithelial cell specicblockade of canonical NF- jB activation caused severe chronic inflammatory colitis. These results revealed that NF- jB signalling in epithelial cells plays a critical role for the maintenance of immunehomeostasis in epithelial tissues. Our current experiments investigatethe mechanisms by which NF- jB signalling acts in epithelial cells to regulate tissue homeostasis and prevent the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. The results of our most recent studies will be discussed. SY-25 NEW TARGETS IN INNATE IMMUNE SIGNALING FOR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPEUTICS L. A. J. O'Neill1,* 1School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland In the eld of inflammation research, the most important advances in the past 10 years has been in the uncovering of multiple pathways involved in innate immunity. There are now 7 distinct receptor families that sense microbial products and in some cases products of inflamed tissues, andtrigger the innate response, which includes induction of pro-inflam-matory mediators as well as effector mechanisms in host defence. The best characterised are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Genetic variation inseveral of these components has been linked to inflammatory diseases, notably in the TLR system and in the NLR protein Nalp3 and associated proteins. Work on knockout mice and the use of inhibitors continues tovalidate some of these proteins in disease. From work on Nalp3 therehas also been a resurgence of interest in the IL1 system as a key driver of inflammation in diseases such as gout and diabetes (both Type I and Type II). IL1 family members such as IL1beta, IL1alpha, IL18 and IL33are providing important information on the role of Th17, Th1 and Th2cells in disease. For investigators interested in signal transduction, the area has proved very fruitful in terms of the discovery of new signalling pathways and processes. We now have a good understanding of theInflamm. Res. S15 123major components activated by TLRs, notably the TIR domain-con- taining adapters that initiate signalling following recruitment to TIRdomains within the TLRs themselves, the IRAK family of protein kinases that are then recruited, and a series of ubiquitination and phosphorylation reactions that ultimately lead to the activation oftranscription factors such as NF-kappaB and IRF family members.Furthermore inhibitory mechanisms are also being revealed that are likely to important for resolution of inflammation, notably miRNAs such as miR21. As we continue to unravel the molecular details of theseprocesses, new therapeutic options will present themselves.

N. A. Recchiuti1, S. Krishnamoorthy1, Chiang1 and Injury, Department of Anesthesia, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, BWH and Harvard Medical School, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston,MA, USA Mechanisms controlling resolution of acute inflammation are of wide interest. The resolvins and other pro-resolving mediators arebiosynthesized from polyunsaturated essential fatty acids in lution phase to promote resolution and homeostasis (Serhan in Am JPath 2010). In this presentation, we will review recent evidence for the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in self-limited acute inflammatory exudates, the resolvin receptors identied in murine and human systems. Using real-timePCR analysis, we report that in resolving exudates that from interval (R i)b y*4 include both ALX/FPR2 and GPR32, these miRNAs were regulated (P \\0.05) by RvD1 at concentrations as low as 10 nM. Hence, isolated human macrophages exposed to RvD1recapitulate the in vivo circuit obtained during the resolution phase of murine peritonitis. In addition, RvD1-miRNAs identied in these studies target cytokines and proteins involved in the immune system,e.g. miR-146b targeted NF- jB signaling, and miR-219 targeted 5-lipoxygenase production. These results indicate that resolvins regulate specic miRNAs target genes that are involved in resolution. Moreover, they establish a novel resolution circuit involvingRvD1 receptor-dependent regulation of specic miRNAs in vitro and invivo, which demonstrate the ability of pro-resolving GPCRs to regulate miR that impact inflammation-resolution.

SY-27 GLUCOCORTICOIDS CUT SHORT THE CONCERT OF INFLAMMATION THROUGH THE RELEASEOF ANNEXIN A1 M. Perretti1,* 1William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine, London, UK The process of acute inflammation relies on the active engagement of a series of pro-resolving mediators to assure its temporal and spatial completion. Within the ever-increasing group of players of the reso-lution of inflammation, a special place is occupied by cortisol.Appreciation of the role of cortisol in preventing the over-shooting of the host response to inflammation (Munck's theory) provides strong scientic bases to the widespread application of synthetic glucocorti-coids in several pathologies. Thus, the striking efcacy of glucocorticoids suggests that mimicking a pathway operative in the resolution of inflammation is a viable approach for anti-inflammatorytherapy in man. Can we harness this knowledge any further? Gluco-corticoids modulate, among many others, the protein termed Annexin A1 (AnxA1) as well as its receptor, termed FPR2/ALX. In fact, rapid (non-genomic) mobilization of AnxA1 and gene induction of FPR2/ALX are observed in myeloid cells and become operational to affectS16 Inflamm.

In view of this 'duet'glucocorticoids and AnxA1/FPR2, we propose that detailed under- standing of how the AnxA1/FPR2 pair impacts on experimental inflammation, and human cell biology, can provide novel indication fordrug discovery programmes. Such a proposition is reinforced by thenotion that potent anti-inflammatory lipids of the lipoxins and resolvins families can also signal via FPR2/ALX. Proof-of-concept studies in Fpr2 decient mice reiterate the validity of this approach.

Greaves1,* 1Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK Acute inflammation is characterized by the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells. The recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes tosites of inflammation is orchestrated by a range of inflammatory medi- ators including chemoattractant cytokines. Failure to properly resolve acute inflammation leads to chronic inflammation, the pathologicalprocess that underlies many important diseases including angina, arthritisand inflammatory bowel disease. Work in the Greaves Lab has shown that the macrophage chemoattractant cytokine chemerin (TIG2) acting through G can mediate macrophage matrix molecule Fibronectin. While full-length chemerin is a potent mediator of macrophage chemotaxis we have shown that proteolyticdigestion fragments of chemerin can act as potent anti-inflammatory mediators that enhance macrophage uptake of microbial debris and apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly we have shown thatpolyclonal antibodies that specically block the chemoattractant effectsof full length chemerin and the anti-inflammatory effects of chemerin- derived C-terminal peptides lead to increased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in a self resolving model of zymosan peritonitis.

Raffaele University and Research Institute, Milano, Italy HMGB1 is the prime example of a danger signal that originates from the damaged self rather than from invading pathogens. HMGB1 is pas-sively released by cells that die traumatically, and actively secreted by severely distressed cells and by activated cells of the innate immunity system. HMGB1 is thus the archetypal Damage Associated MolecularPattern molecule, or DAMP. Notably, HMGB1 signals via TLR4, thereceptor for LPS, the archetypal Pathogen Associated Molecular Pat- tern molecule. In addition, HMGB1 forms highly inflammatory complexes with single-stranded DNA, LPS, IL-1 band nucleosomes, which interact with TLR9, TLR4, IL-1R and TLR2 receptors, respec-tively. The ability to act both alone and in combination with other inflammatory signals may be ideally designed to govern the choice between the sacrice or reconstruction of tissues, as required by thepresence or absence of pathogens. SY-30 COUPLING OF DEAD CELL RECOGNITIONTO ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY DENDRITIC CELLS C. Reis e Sousa1,* 1Immunobiology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom Cell death can be sensed by dendritic cells (DC) and contribute to adaptive immunity against cell-associated antigens. We have been studying recognition pathways that allow DC to sense dead cells andpresent cell-associated antigens to T cells. One pathway involves S17 123C-type lectin DNGR-1, kinase. DNGR-1 is selectively expressed by CD8 a+DC in mouse and their equivalents in human, a sub-group of DC that possesses specialised properties including a unique propensity to phagocytose dead cell debris and to crosspresent exogenous antigens cells. DNGR-1 signalling via Syk in CD8 a+mouse DC appears to regulate the retrieval and crosspresentation of dead cell-associated antigens and may also be involved in the activation of DC by dead cells. The study of DNGR-1 helps build a picture of the receptors andsignalling pathways that regulate DC responses to self alterations andhas applications in immunotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases. SY-31 DANGER SIGNAL ACTIVATING THEINFLAMMASOME IN PULMONARY INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS N. Riteau1, L. Baron1, Gombaul1, CNRS, U991, Universite \u00b4de Rennes1, France The molecular which lung injury triggers inflamma- tion and brosis remain poorly understood. We reported that Nlrp3inflammasome activation and IL-1R1 signaling were required forbleomycin-induced inflammation and brosis in mice. Now investi- gating endogenous molecules released after lung injury, we acid and extracellular adenosine tri-phosphate (eATP) are lung inflammation and brosis. Uric acid and ATP are locally released upon bleomycin- induced injury and involved in IL-1 bproduction, lung inflammation and brosis. Fibrotic patients have elevated ATP content in BALF incomparison to control individuals. Since uric acid or silica crystals and soluble ATP are involved both in Nlrp3 activation and lung brotic diseases, we investigated whether ATP and purinergic sig-naling may be a corner stone of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation byparticulate activators. We show that uric acid and silica crystals induce the active release of intracellular ATP by epithelial cells or macrophages in vitro. Moreover, IL-1 bmaturation and secretion by macrophages upon crystals depend on purinergic signaling through autocrine purinergic receptor loops. Our results suggest that uric acid and silica crystals are competent to induce maturation and secretion ofIL-1bthrough a process that involves as a rst event the extracellular release of endogenous ATP and as a second event the signaling through several purinergic receptors that triggers the activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome. In conclusion, we propose that blocking puri-nergic signaling could represent a novel strategy to reduce lunginflammation and brosis.

Weyand1,* 1Professor of Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, CA, United States Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory blood vessel disease that primarily affects the aorta and its branches. Clinical manifestations include blindness, stroke, aortic aneurysm and failure-to-thrive. At a molecular level, GCA is characterized by the apparently unopposedstimulation of T cell immunity ordinarily mobilized to ght infection.The typical lesion is a granulomatous inltrate that injures the blood vessel wall and leads to intimal hyperplasia and luminal occlusion. Early stages of the disease involve activation of wall-embedded den-dritic cells which express a broad spectrum of pattern recognition receptors and respond to PAMPs and DAMPs. In humanized mice engrafted with human aorta and human T cells GCA can be elicitedthough initial stimulation with PAMPs. T cells recruited into thegranulomatous lesions include Th1 and Th17 cells. The contribution of Th1 and Th17 cells to the disease process has been examined in patients undergoing two successive artery biopsies. Th17 cells arerapidly responsive to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroidswhereas Th1 cells persist in the inflamed arteries despite continuous treatment. In treated patients vessel-wall inflammation represents a ''pure'' Th1 response. In untreated patients, antigen-presenting cells inthe arteries produce IL-12, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-23. IL-12 production is resistant to corticosteroid therapy and promotes chronic vasculitis in the absence of Th17 responses.S18 Inflamm. Res. 123Conclusion: Multiple T cell lineages contribute to vasculitis with Th1 and Th17 cells being separable based on their susceptibility to steroid-induced immunosuppression. We conclude that at least two immune- activation cascades are functional in GCA and propose that the dis- ease instigators eliciting Th1 Birmingham, United Kingdom ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a complex disease with a strong underlying autoimmune diathesis. Its precise aetiology is unknown butcontributions from heritable factors acting through a polygenic contri-bution from relatively common variants, and environmental factors, including drugs, silica and infectious agents, seems certain. These factors may be linked through epigenetic modication of histone marks. Thepathogenic mechanisms that are triggered involve diverse cell types, inflammatory mediators and signalling cascades. Autoantibodies to proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase and LAMP-2 are described that canengage with their autoantigenic targets when expressed at the neutrophilsurface membrane after neutrophil priming or within neutrophil extra- cellular traps (NETS). Autoantibodies can activate neutrophils and promote neutrophil-endothelial interactions that initiate vascular dam-age. Components of the alternative complement pathway are alsoimplemented as injury enhancers. The adaptive immune system is believed to be fundamental to development of autoimmune responses in AAV. Multiple changes in circulating T cell populations have beendescribed. The Th17 subset may contribute since there are increasedserum IL-17 and IL-23 levels during acute disease, increased autoanti- gen-specic IL-17-producing cells during disease remission and in animal models of anti-myeloperoxidase glomerulonephritis, mice de-cient in IL-17A are protected. Interest in B cells increased markedly after efcacy in AAV of B cell depletion was demonstrated. The precise role of B cells in vasculitis still needs to be claried, whether as precursors toantibody-producing plasma cells, antigen presenting cells, providers ofcytokines and growth factors or other roles. That BLyS levels are increased in patients with active ANCA vasculitis may also perpetuate autoimmune B cells. Translating increasing knowledge of pathogenesisinto better therapies for patients with AAV remains the challenge. The author is now Vice-President, ImmunoInflammation CEDD, the therapeutic armamen- tarium for systemic vasculitides. These therapeutics well dened indications andawaited results, but also now some more specically targeted mono- clonal antibodies, like anti-IL5 and anti-IgE for Churg-Strauss syndrome. However, the exact indications of these latter new agents, as well as their optimal dosage and duration, are not yet precisely dened.Therefore, at present, they are mostly prescribed for patients withdisease refractory to conventional therapy, with promising results. Results of international ongoing trials will tell us in the few next years whether they may also have a place as rst line treatments. The rstresults show that rituximab is as effective as cyclophosphamide (RAVEstudy, not published) to induce remission of Wegener's granulomato- sis. Rituximab is now under evaluation for maintenance therapy. Other biotherapies have been evaluated. If etanercept does not seem effective,to maintain remission, infliximab is effective in severe and refractoryANCA-associated vasculitis. However relapses occur as soon the drug is stopped. It seems now reasonable to expect dramatic changes in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis with a larger place forbiotherapies.

SY-36 THERAPIES IN OSTEOARTHRITIS S. B. Abramson1,* 1NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States Osteoarthritis is often a progressive and disabling disease, which occurs in the setting of a variety of risk factors\u2014such as advancing age, obesity, and trauma\u2014that conspire to incite a cascade ofpathophysiologic events within joint tissues. An important emerg-ing theme in osteoarthritis is a broadening of focus from a disease of cartilage to one of the 'whole joint'. The synovium, bone, and cartilage are each involved in pathologic processes that lead toprogressive joint degeneration. Additional themes that haveemerged over the past decade are novel mechanisms of cartilage degradation and repair, the relationship between biomechanics and biochemical pathways, the importance of inflammation, and therole played by genetics. In this review we summarize currentscientic understanding of osteoarthritis and examine the pathobi- ologic mechanisms that contribute to progressive disease.

Apoptosis ofgranulocytes occurs during the normal resolution process, renders these cells unresponsive to further stimulation and marks them for removal by phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) by mechanisms thatswitch the phenotype of macrophages from pro- to anti-inflammatory.Although there is little doubt that apoptosis plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes, its precise role in inflammatory diseases is only recently being unravelled. The ndingsthat modulation of can cellapoptosis and augmenting phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells willbe discussed. We propose that by dening novel mechanisms that selectively accelerate neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis together with those that promote phagocyte clearance of apoptotic granulo-cytes will provide the scientic foundation for innovative approachesto the therapy of human inflammatory diseases.S20 Inflamm. Res. 123SY-39 TARGETING PROSTAGLANDIN E PRODUCTION AND SIGNALING: WHERE ARE WE IN 2011? L.J. Crofford1,* 1University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States PGE 2is the dominant PG induced during the early phases of inflam- mation due to the dramatic increase in levels of and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in response topro-inflammatory the inflammatory program. Pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 2using NSAIDs also inhibits cytokine-stimulated up- regulation of mPGES-1 expression, thereby enhancing their anti- inflammatory effects. This mechanism proceeds via the interaction ofPGE 2and its EP2 and EP4 receptors and can be compensated by direct application of PGE 2, EP2 or EP4 agonists, or by activating cAMP using forskolin. In addition to classical anti-inflammatory effects, PGE 2 acting via the EP4 receptor modulates the immune response promoting changes in the cytokine prole of antigen presenting cells to facilitate the IL-23/IL-17 axis important for autoimmune inflammatory diseases. In addition to inhibition of PGE 2, NSAIDs also inhibit production of other PG, such as PGI 2and PGD 2. Since these PG, especially PGI 2, contribute to inflammation and pain, NSAID therapeutic effectiveness could relate in part to this lack of specicity. However, lack of speci- city towards pro-inflammatory cytokines undoubtedly contributes toadverse effects. Inhibition of PGI 2, for example, may contribute to thrombophilia and atherogenesis as suggested by murine models. At present, it is unclear if specic inhibitors of mPGES-1 or EP4 receptors will be effective anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic agents inhumans. Development of drugs that inhibit mPGES-1 are hampered by species differences in activity leading to difculties in implementation of murine models. However, experiments in PGES-1 null mice dem-onstrate that this strategy may yield promising results different frominhibition of COX-2. For example, mPGES-1 genetic deletion has important effects on neurons and microglia in a model of neuropathic pain that appear to be mediated via COX-1 rather than COX-2. Fur-thermore, mPGES-1 null mice appear protected from atherogenesis.Alternate strategies for inhibiting PGE 2activity have now focused on EP4 receptor antagonists. In addition to showing promise in some animal models of arthritis and pain, EP4 receptor antagonists appear toinhibit platelet aggregation. Together, these properties suggest that EP4 receptor antagonism is another potential new therapeutic strategy for inflammation and pain. SY-40 ''INSIDE-OUT'' SIGNALING OF SPHINGOSINE- 1-PHOSPHATE: THERAPEUTIC TARGETS S. Spiegel1,*, 1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA, United States Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent sphingolipid mediator formed leading to formationof S1P, which is exported by specic transporters to activate its own receptors in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, a process, known as ''inside out signaling'' by S1P, is important for many of theimmune cell functions known to be regulated by S1P and the diversityof these functions is explained by the repertoire of S1PR expression on various immune cells.

Res. S21 123SP-01 MECHANISMS OF INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES TO INFLUENZA VIRUS M. Si-Tahar1,* 1Institut Pasteur, Paris, France Influenza A virus (IAV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious acute respiratory disease that causes epidemics and considerable mortality annually. The viral replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is considered a potent activator ofthe innate anti-viral immune response. Bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for IAV. We previously used an in vitro approach to establish a role for the pattern-recog-nition Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 in the immune response of lungepithelial cells to IAV-derived dsRNA and we demonstrated that in vivo, IAV-TLR3 interaction critically contributes to viral pathology. However, additional cellular dsRNA-recognition proteins have beenimplicated as key sensors of viral infection. These include twocaspase recruiting domain-containing RNA helicases, i.e. the reti- protein and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA-5) protein. In this context, wefurther demonstrated that the sensing of IAV by TLR3, RIG-I andMDA-5 clearly differs. Indeed, TLR3 activation appears critical for the induction of a pro-inflammatory response whereas RIG-I (but not MDA-5) activation is rather essential for the induction of a typeI interferon-dependent antiviral response. Finally, we established that the innate immune response triggered by IAV is negatively regulated by the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) 1 andSOCS3 proteins through a RIG-I/IFNAR-dependent pathway. SP-02 MECHANISMS OF LUNG INFLAMMATORY DISEASE INDUCED BY PATHOGENS T. Hussell1,* 1Imperial College London, National Heart and Lung Institute, Leukocyte Biology, London, United Kingdom The activity of innate immunity is not simply dictated by the presence of an antigen but also by the balance between negative regulatory and immune potentiator pathways. Even in the absence of an antigen, innateimmunity can ''inflame'' if negative regulators are absent. This restingstate is adaptable and dictated by environmental influences, host genetics and past infection history. A return to homeostasis post inflammation may therefore not leave the tissue in an identical state tothat prior to the inflammatory event. We show that respiratory patho-gens cause long term modication of the lung microenvironment by a de-sensitisation to bacterial products and an increase in the myeloid negative regulator CD200R. These two events prevent subsequentinflammatory damage while the lung is healing but also may predisposeto bacterial colonisation of the lower respiratory tract. This modulation of lung homeostasis also occurs with prior non-infectious inflammatory events. In murine models exposed to the common allergen house dustmite (HDM), Streptococcus pneumoniae persists, becomes invasive and systemic and leads to mortality, whereas healthy mice clear the infection without untoward consequences. We identify the molecularmechanisms associated with bacterial susceptibility by showing thedisruption of bacterial recognition by pattern recognition receptors due to sequestration or diversion of key receptors or downstream signalling components in the HDM-remodelled lung. A deeper understanding ofthe consequences arising from innate immune cell alteration duringacute and chronic inflammation and the subsequent development ofbacterial complications has important implications for future drug development. SP-03 IMMUNO-MODULATION BY THE NORMAL Laboratories, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland We harbor an enormous load of commensal bacteria in our intestines, which are physically excluded from entering the body by a single layer of epithelial cells and overlying mucus. The mucosal immune system isstrategically situated in very close proximity to this massive load ofbacteria, which can provide a wealth of stimuli for maturation and shaping of the immune system. Comparing germ-free mice, which lack all intestinal bacteria, to mice that are specically colonized with adened bacterial population clearly demonstrates that the presence of bacteria has strong immunomodulatory effects on both the mucosal and systemic immune systems. It is known that small numbers of livebacteria can penetrate past the epithelial cell barrier. The majority ofbacteria that do penetrate are efciently phagocytosed and killed by intestinal macrophages. In addition, dendritic cells can carry bacteria to the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes where they stimulate Bcells to switch to IgA. The numbers of IgA plasma cells in the laminapropria and the concentration of secretory IgA in the lumen of the gut both increase dramatically following colonization and some of the IgA that is induced is highly specic for the bacteria present in the flora. Wehave also found that intestinal CD4 +T cells also increase dramatically in response to the intestinal flora but overt inflammation, and the dif- ferentiation of T H1o rT H17 effector cells, is inhibited by commensal- dependent activation and expansion of colonic lamina propria regula-tory T cells. Furthermore, we have shown that impaired bacterial killing due to innate immune deciencies leads to induction of a systemic antibody response, which can compensate for decreased innateresponsiveness and protects clean mice from death. Importantly, thiscontinuum between the innate and adaptive immune systems may also underlie the observed over reactivity to the intestinal microflora that is observed in inflammatory bowel disease.

McKay1,* 1Gastrointestinal Research Group, Snyder Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic debilitating disorders, the incidences of which are increasing in westernized societies and for which there are no cures. Over the last decade, we, and others, haveshown that infection with helminth parasites signicantly modies theoutcome of concomitant disease in animal models, and models of IBD in particular.

Ongoing investigations in which he function and anti-colitic properties of AAMs are being investigated will be discussed. SP-05 SUPPRESSION OF EPITHELIAL PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALINGBY INTESTINAL PROTOZOA A.G. Buret1,* 1Inflammation Research Network, Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Numerous reports have described how acute infections may trigger inflammatory responses. Conversely, recent discoveries highlighted the remarkable ability of some parasites to downregulate host immu-nity and minimize pathology, particularly with parasitic Helminthes.Less is known on how Protozoa may tone down immunity. Research into these mechanisms, and into the causative products, will be key to the development of new anti-infectives, but, perhaps even moreimportantly, novel interventions against autoimmune and inflamma- tory diseases. Complement lysis by extracellular Protozoa as well as modulation of the phagosomal compartment by intracellular parasiteshave been well In addition, cysteine proteases of variousProtozoa, including Entamoeba histoloytica, are able to inhibit cellular immune responses in the intestine of the host, at least in part by modu- lating host prostaglandin synthesis and cleaving chemotactic cytokines.A TNF-aand them producers of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and TGF- b. Similarly, upon activation by TLR's, dendritic cells exposed to Giardia produce more IL-10 and less IL-12, perhaps by modulating the release of lipoxins, as shown with Toxoplasma .Giardia is the most common cause of waterborne parasitic diarrhea worldwide. For reasons that remain obscure, the parasite doesnot trigger any overt inflammatory cell inltration in the intestine. In addition to the effects on dentritic cells, ongoing research points to novel epithelial immuno-modulatory events. Indeed, Giardia is able to inhibit IL-1-induced CXCL8 production by intestinal epithelial cells via post-translational mechanisms. Recent reports indicate that the production of diarrheal symptoms caused by Giardia infection may vary with between geographical areas of the World, and perhaps even protect againstdiarrhea. In view of the signicance of community acquired diarrhea-genic microbes, including E. coli pathotypes, as a cause of diarrhea in these endemic areas, interactions between Giardia, and pathogenic E. coli may represent an interesting avenue for future studies. Researchneeds to address whether and how enteric Protozoa such as Giardia may modulate host interactions with concurrent pathogens, as well as toassess its effects on the normal host microflora.

Trauma patients are characterized by an easy to determine starting point, by comparisonwith sepsis.1. Inflammatory markers in trauma patients. The immune response to trauma belongs to what has been described as the sterile inflammation. Trauma is responsible for aninflammatory response difcult to distinguish from inflammatoryresponse to infection. Besides classical inflammatory markers such as CRP and procalcitonin, endogenous molecules termed damage asso- ciated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved, as these hostderived nonmicrobial stimuli are released following tissue injury and have similar functions as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in terms of their ability to activate proinflammatory path-ways. Among DAMPs, proteins such as S100 A8 and A9 have beenrecently studied in this context. 2. Other biomarkers utilization in trauma patients. Biomarkers of organ lesion/failure. All the organ can be involved in trauma and the list of biomarkers is non specic of trauma.

Martin1,* 1Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Many protein-reactive chemicals can cause allergic contact dermati- tis. This inflammatory skin disease is mediated by contact allergen-specic T cells. In order to trigger the adaptive immune response contact allergens must rst activate the innate immune system to induce skin inflammation. Recent studies have revealed that contactallergen-mediated skin inflammation closely resembles the innateimmune response to infection. Intriguingly, contact allergens activate similar innate immune mechanisms as microbial pathogens. Thus, metallic nickel ions can directly bind to human Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) and activate signal transduction. Some organic contactallergens indirectly activate TLR2 and TLR4 by causing the gener- ation of endogenous ligands including breakdown products of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronic acid in the skin. Further-more, by triggering the release of ATP from skin cells contactallergens activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the ATP receptorP2X 7. In addition, oxidative stress responses result from contact allergen encounter. The tight collaborative interplay of these innateimmune and stress responses has important implications for the development of causative treatment strategies for allergic contact dermatitis and for the development of animal-free in vitro methods forthe identication of contact allergens.

Huaux1,* 1Louvain centre for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), of Experimental and Clinical Research (IREC), Universite \u00b4 catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium The paradigm that pulmonary inflammation drives brogenesis has been challenged and it is proposed that, in some cases, the pathologicalprocess is mediated by alternative mechanisms in particle-related lung diseases. Our studies demonstrated that silica-induced lung brosis in mice results from the action of the immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-band IL-10 produced to limit the development of chronic inflammation. TGF-band IL-10 induce lung collagen deposition when overexpressed in silica-treated mice. It is generally accepted that TGF- band IL-10 are essential for regulatory T lymphocyte (T reg) expansion and immuno-suppressive activity. We demonstrated that T regs are recruited tocontrol inflammatory responses induced by silica particles. The per- sistent accumulation of immunosuppressive T regs in the lungs also contributes to pulmonary brosis by stimulating broblasts through thesecretion of growth factors. In conclusion, immunosuppressive responses may also contribute to particle-induced lung brosis and represent an additional etiopathogenic pathway of lung brosis.

We have carried cellular experiments in order to determine novel mechanisms of toxicity of these pollutants and in vivo studies in an attempt to correlatethe kinetics of these pollutants with biological and clinical parameters.The cellular response to the influx of potentially toxic xenobiotics is initiated by xenobiotics receptors. We have focused on the dioxin receptor (Arylhydrocarbon Receptor, AhR) and on its ligands.

These mechanisms provide a molecular basis for developingnovel therapeutic strategies against bone destruction in arthritis.RANKL signals the cell through numerous immunomodulatory mol- ecules such as TRAF6, NF- jB, of activated T cells (NFAT) c1. NFATc1 activation requires calcium signaling, tyrosine-based (DAP12). FcRcand DAP12 associate with multiple immunoreceptors such as OSCAR and TREM-2, which thus function as costimulatory receptorsfor RANK. Recent advances in the understanding of osteoclast regu- lation and osteoclast-targeted therapy will be discussed.

Ueha1 1Department of Molecular Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, JapanDisrupted bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and delayed immune reconstitution are life-threatening complications of cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, how GVHD impairs BM hematopoiesis has been largely unknown. Using several mouse models of MHC-mismatched allo-HSCT, we exploredthe effects of GVHD on the possible targets in BM, HSCs andhematopoietic niches. Lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with T cell depleted BM cells (TCD-BM) supplemented with T cells from allogeneic donor mice to induce GVHD. We rst analyzed in MHC I- and found that the BM hematopoiesis, especially the B-lymphopoiesis, was severely impaired in the GVHD mice. The B-lymphopoiesis was also impaired in MHC GVHD. This ina CD4 dominant minor mismatched model. Re-transplantation experiments revealed that GVHD-affected BM contains substantial number that Histological analysis of GVHD-affected BM revealed that osteoblasts were completely lost within 7 daysafter allo-HSCT. Accordingly, expression of mRNA decreased in GVHD-affected BM. Moreover, the bone formation determined by bone histomorphometry was completelyimpaired in the GVHD mice. Administration of anti-CD4 antibody inthe early time largely prevented BM-GVHD, while preserving GVL/ T effects. In conclusion, our study provides the rst evidence for the destruction of osteoblastic niches mediated by allogeneic CD4 Tcells during GVHD. The new concept of BM-GVHD would provide an explanation for disrupted hematopoiesis and delayed immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT and may bring novel preventive andtherapeutic strategies for GVHD.

Sharma1,2, J. Allison2,3,4,* 1MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,2Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy,3Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 4Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States We conducted extensive pre-clinical studies in mouse models which showed that blockade of the inhibitory signals mediated by CTLA-4 inT cells, either alone or in combination with a variety of immunologicand conventional therapies, led to tumor rejection and long-lived immunity. Ipilimumab, an antibody to human CTLA-4 developed by Medarex (now Bristol Meyers-Squibb) has been given to over 4,000patients in clinical trials and objective responses have been observed inmelanoma, prostate, kidney, ovarian, and lung cancer. A recent report documented an increase in survival of patients with advancedInflamm. Res. S25 123melanoma treated with Ipilimumab in a randomized placebo con- trolled trial, the rst drug of any type to do so, with more than 20% ofpatients alive for over 4 years after treatment. While this trial docu- ments that CTLA-4 blockade can lead to durable responses in patients, there is clearly a need to increase the response rate. We have thatadministration of anti-CTLA-4 results in an increase of the frequencyof CD4 T cells that express ICOS in both the tumor tissue and blood of bladder cancer patients. The ICOS + population contained effector CD4 T cells that made IFN cuponmstimulation with peptides from NY- ESO-1. We subsequently showed that survival of advanced melanomapatients treated with Ipilimumab had sustained elevation of ICOS + CD4 T cells ( [twofold for 12 weeks) had signicantly greater survival than those with no or transient increases. Together, these datasuggested to us that ICOS might play an important role in the thera-peutic effects of CTLA-4 blockade. To test this we used a mouse model of melanoma. We found that the efcacy of anti-CTLA-4 was markedly diminished in mice that were decient in either ICOS orICOS ligand (ICOSL), conrming that the ICOS/ICOSL pathway plays a critical role in anti-CTLA-4 therapy. These observations led us to test the possibility that engagement of ICOS could enhance theefcacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy. To this end we transduced mouseB16F10 melanoma cells with a cDNA encoding ICOSL or a control construct. B16ICOSL + cells (Ivax) and control B16 cells were irra- diated and used alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 to treatmice bearing established B16F10 tumors. We found that combinationof the IVAX with anti-CTLA-4 was markedly more effective than the control vaccine plus anti-CTLA-4 or that of any single treatment alone. The increase in therapeutic efcacy was accompanied by amarked in increase in the density and functionality of CD4 and CD8 T cells within the tumor. These results suggest a novel strategy for manipulating the immune system to enhance anti-tumor responses:checkpoint blockade coupled with provision of agonist signals ICOS to enhance costimulation. SP-17 AND OF CANCER R.D. Schreiber1,* 1Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States Cancer Immunoediting is the process by which the immune system controls and shapes cancer. We originally envisaged that cancer im-munoediting would occur in three phases: Elimination (also known as cancer immunosurveillance, the host protective phase of the process), Equilibrium (the phase in which tumor cells that survive immuneelimination remain under immunologic growth control resulting in astate of functional tumor dormancy) and Escape (the phase where clinically apparent tumors emerge because immune sculpting of the tumor cells has produced variants that display either reduced immu-nogenicity or enhanced immunosuppressive activity). Strongexperimental data has now been obtained using mouse models of cancer to demonstrate the existence of each phase of the cancer im- munoediting process and compelling clinical data suggests that asimilar process may also occur during the evolution of certain types of human cancer. Our efforts now focus on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie each phase of cancer immu-noediting and identifying the critical checkpoints that regulateprogression from one phase of the process to the next. This approach has helped identify the nature of antigens seen by immunity in nascent developing cancers and has further shown that immunoselection is amajor mechanism of immunoediting. Moreover, we have found thatedited tumors can still be controlled by the immune system if naturalmechanisms that prevent autoimmunity are suspended. As reported by others, we have conrmed that inhibition of CTLA-4 induces ejectionof edited MCA sarcomas. However, we have also found that inhibi- tion of PD-L1 does the same, although by perhaps different mechanisms. These differences will be discussed. SP-18 INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND AUTOCRINE TUMOR-PROMOTING NETWORKS F. Balkwill1,* 1Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom A complex network of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines reg- ulates communication between the malignant cells and supportingstroma in most experimental and human cancers. There is ample evidence from animal models that individual members of this cyto- kine network and their intracellular signalling pathways can makemalignant to apoptosis, can stimulate a tumor-pro- moting leukocyte inltrate that may also suppress anti- cancer immune responses, and can regulate angiogenesis. Of all the indi-vidual cytokines and chemokines that have been implicated in tumorgrowth and spread, the most convincing and extensive animal model data relates to the cytokines TNF- a, IL-6 and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 ligand, are co-expressed and co-regulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and human ovarian cancer biopsies. We have named this co-regulation the TNF network. High levels of expression of TNF network gene pathways in cell lines andovarian cancer biopsies is signicantly associated with pathways andprocess important to cancer growth and spread including angiogen- esis, cell adhesion, stromal development and the immune cell inltrate. In ovarian cancer biopsies high levels of malignant cellstaining for TNF network members related to poor prognosis. To translate these observations to clinical practice we have focused on IL-6, conducting a phase II trial of the anti-human IL-6 antibodyCNTO328 in women with relapsed ovarian cancer. Our resultsshowed that IL-6 may be a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer with multiple actions within the tumor microenvironment. Inflammation in severe sepsis: from bench to bedside (SP06) Symposium sponsored by the (Socie \u00b4te\u00b4de Re \u00b4animation Langue OF BACTERIA DURINGSEPSIS J. Pugin1,* 1Intensive Care, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland Bacteria are recognized by human tissues via an array of receptors present mainly at the surface of cells of the innate immune system. These receptors have evolved with the capacity to recognize and bindconserved bacterial molecules, different from ''self'' molecules.S26 Inflamm. Res. 123Among these receptors are the ''Toll-like (TLRs), and associated molecules such as CD14 and MD-2, but also receptorsimportant for the clearance of bacteria or bacterial products such as scavenger and mannose receptors. TLRs recognize bacterial endo- toxin TLR4, MyD88 to NF- jB activation. TLR4, but also TLR3 activate also a non-MyD88 pathway, leading to the production of b-interferon. The step of recognition of (bacterial) PAMPs by TLRs is therefore essential to initiate an inflammatoryresponse. TLRs have been also identied as key receptors in antigen presenting cells, boosting the adaptive immune system. Some TLRs are also expressed in non-professional immune cells such as endo-thelial and epithelial cells, and ligation of those TLRs can also initiate inflammatory responses in tissues. Most studies addressing TLR specicity have been performed using puried bacterial ligands andtransfected cells. Only a few studies have investigated PAMPs andtheir receptors in mediating human cell activation using whole bac- teria. Bacteria are essentially sensed by human immune cells as whole microorganisms. PAMPs can also stimulate immune cells in the formof microparticles and soluble mediators released from bacteria. Thepredominant PAMPs stimulating TLRs are largely unknown in the context of a whole bacterium. Using either TLR-transfected cells or human leukocytes, endothelial cells, or epithelial withspecic anti-TLRs, -MD-2, and -CD14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we have determined the contribution of cell-surface TLRs and their accessory proteins toward cellular responses to prototypicGram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains responsible forhuman septic shock. We have shown that whole Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria activate human leukocytes, endothelial, and epithelial cells through TLRs and thesereceptors with specic mAbs efciently abrogated cell activation inresponse to their exposure to whole bacteria. TLR4 is the main TLR involved in cell activation by Gram-negative bacteria. In the absence of TLR4 or at high concentration of Gram-negative bacteria, TLR2was also activated. Higher concentrations of Grampositive bacteriawere needed to activate cells in a TLR2-dependent fashion. This activation appeared to be completely TLR4/MD-2 independent. These results largely conrm studies performed in genetically modied miceand demonstrate that antibody blockade of CD14 and TLRs can potentially decrease excessive and detrimental inflammation in response to bacteria, making it an attractive therapeutic avenue toexplore in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Indeed, duringthe initial phase of shock, the blockade of TLR-dependent hyperac- tivation of cells without interfering with CD14-dependent internalization of bacteria and bacterial products might be benecial.Interfering with the initial inflammatory response with TLR antago-nists carries also the theoretical risk of bacterial overgrowth, a problem that should be minimized by an appropriate antibiotic ther- apy, particularly in patients with severe bacterial infection and septicshock. Work is underway to determine how leukocytes from pre- mature babies recognize and get activated by bacteria, as well as immature neutrophils in adults, a prominent circulating cell type inpatients with septic shock. These results will be presented. Elson G,Dunn-Siegrist I, Daubeuf B, Pugin J. Contribution of Toll-like receptors to the innate immune response to Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria.

Annane1,* of Versailles Saint Raymond Poincare \u00b4Hospital (AP-HP), Garches, France The brain mediates via the autonomic nervous system and neuro- hormones the growth and proliferation of most if not all tissues involved in immunity, and all immune cells have membrane orcytosolic receptors for a number of neuromediators. The systemic inflammatory response to infection results in brain activation, which subsequently generates appropriate anti-inflammatory response.However, excess in pro-inflammatory mediators entering the braincan cause cerebral damage. In turn, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous and neuro-endocrine systems may alter immunity in a vicious circle resulting in metabolic derangements and organ failure. Twomajor pathways allow organs system, and the vagus nerve . CVOs are lacking a blood-brain barrier. Thus, they permit a direct communication between brain and blood stream.Some CVOs are located in the vicinity of neuroendocrine structuresas and others are located close to brainstem autonomic centres. Thus, blood borne cytokines enter the brain through these areas, which express receptors for cytokines and bacterial fragments. In addition,specic carriers allow circulating cytokines reach hypothalamic nuclei. Circulating terminating with subsequent stimulation of thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Efferent the vagusnerve, termed 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway', releases in the vicinity of macrophages within the reticulo- endothelial system and leads to cellular deactivation and inhibition ofcytokine release. The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems arethought to work hand-in-hand to modulate inflammatory responses. Diffuse endothelial activation induced by sepsis may result in blood- brain barrier breakdown allowing circulating mediators to entermassively into the brain. They induce expression of CD40 and adhesion molecules on brain endothelial cells. NF-kappa-B induced over-expression of iNOS further increases blood-brain barrier per-meability. Components of innate and adaptive immune systems areexpressed in the brain during LPS challenge. They are rst expressed within the CVOs, and then spread to deeper areas of the brain con- trolling neuroendocrine and autonomic functions. Toll-like receptors(TLR)4, TLR2 cells, such asmicroglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at rest and after exposure to LPS. Whether TLRs are expressed in neurones remains contro- versial. Endotoxin also up-regulates the iNOS in the brain, NO which behaves as a neurotoxic effector. Pros- taglandins and purines, such as ATP and adenosine, are further key mediators in brain response to sepsis, particularly inducing fever. Anumber of other mediators may be involved in the cerebral immuneresponse, such as migrating activating factor, superoxide radicals and carbon monoxide. Exposureto LPS may cause apoptosis of brain cells via dysfunction of mito-chondrial respiration, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappa-B pathways, and release or accumulation of calcium and reactive oxygen species. In septic shock, post-mortem studiesshowed autonomic centres and the hippocampus. Cell culture experiments indicate an important role for microglial cells in immunesurveillance, host defense and tissue repair. Indeed, they clear apop- totic cells and downregulate cytokines and encephalitogenic and medullary autonomic centre output. Neu-rotoxic substances such as ammonium, or amino acids may also beinvolved. Prolonged LPS-exposure impaired synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability of pyramid neurons in the hippocampus, involved in behavioural and emotional systems. Finally, neurotrans-mitters and neurohormones modulate cerebral expression ofinflammatory mediators. The nal behavioural, neuroendocrine and autonomic responses are therefore variable because they depend on a complex and spatio-temporally organized process that involves bothstimulatory and inhibitory pathways. SP-21 GENETIC, SEPSIS AND INFLAMMATION J.P. Mira1,* 1Paris, France Severe sepsis continues to be a major and increasing heath care burden worldwide. Despite aggressive organ support and optimalmicrobial therapy, sepsis remains the commonest cause of death in ICU with an overall mortality rate of 25-40%. The relative failure of conventional therapeutic strategies has stimulated a major interest inthe development of new research axes, such as identication ofgenetic factors that influence sepsis susceptibility, therapeutic response, or outcome. Genetically-determined differences in host immune responses against pathogens might explain why some peopleget sick and die when they encounter a pathogen whereas others stayperfectly healthy. Explosion of knowledge both in human genomics and in host inflammatory response explains the increasing interest in immunogenetics over the last 15 years. Indeed, twin and adopteestudies have suggested more than 20 years ago, that host genetic factors are major determinants of susceptibility to infectious diseases in humans. Recently, candidate gene studies and human genome wideanalysis have been used to identify infectious diseases susceptibilityand resistance genes. Rarely, a single gene defect has been directly related to devastating consequences such as interferon-gamma receptor mutations leading to fatal infections with ubiquitous myco-bacteria. For clinical practice, gene polymorphisms of specicimmunological or physiological mediators appear to be of major importance. These genetic variants, which modify the regulation or function of either Pathogen Recognition Receptors or inflammatorymediators, have been associated with susceptibility and/or outcome of severe sepsis and septic shock. All steps of the host response to bacteria clearance have been shown to be potentially affected bygenetic factors. However genetic studies in sepsis have producedcontradictory results related in part to methodological faults. Improved adherence to published guidelines of good study design will help to ensure that genetic epidemiology contributes to a betterclassication of the heterogeneous septic population. The impact ofthese ndings on the understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis and on the design of future preventive and therapeutic strategiesshould also be considerable. New trends in the control of lung inflammation (SP07) Symposium sponsored by the BIS (Brasilian Inflammation Society) SP-22 MODULATION OF THE MG, Brazil Pulmonary brosis is a chronic respiratory disease with lethal conse- quences. Fibrosis may be triggered by a series of inflammatoryconditions that usually precedes deposition of collagen in the lung parenchyma. Bleomycin-induced lung brosis in mice is the most commonly used model to study the pathogenesis of Pulmonary Fibrosis.Bleomycin instillation results in oxidative damage to the DNA of the alveolar epithelium and promotes cytokine release, which subsequently drives recruitment and activation of leukocytes in the airways. Leu-kocyte transmigration into the airways contributes to the chronicationof the inflammatory process by inducing the production of cytokines, triggering broblast proliferation and excessive collagen deposition. Studies conducted by our group has shown that blockade of the che-mokine receptor CXCR2 prevents development of brosis induced bybleomycin in mice. Importantly, blockade of CXCR2 was also pro- tective even when started many days after induction of disease, suggesting it may be useful therapeutically in huams. The reduction ofpulmonary brosis in those animals treated with CXCR2 inhibitors was associate with inhibition of angiogenesis. Similarly, preventive or therapeutic blockade of CCL3 with a chemokine binding protein -CCL3 (Evasin -1)decreased pulmonary brosis, an effect associate with decreased migration of leukocytes into the airways and reduced pro- duction of pro-brogenic cytokines. Chemokine receptors may signal via PI3 K c. PI3 K cdeciency led to attenuation of lung angiogenesis, reduction in leukocyte influx into the airways, decreased lung brosisand increased animal survival. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3 K c caused functional changes in leukocytes, endothelial cells and bro- blasts in vitro, suggesting that PI3 K cplays a role in multiple levels in the context of pulmonary brosis. More recently, we evaluated the roleof Bradykinin receptors, B1 and B2, during the development of pul- monary brosis. B1R deciency caused an increase in lung leukocyte influx, inflammatory cytokines and increased loss weight, and accel-erated and increased mortality (100%) induced by bleomycin. However, B2R deciency was associated with decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and protected mice fromlethality, weight loss, inflammation and brosis. These results unravel anovel role of B2 receptor in controlling inflammation and brosis after bleomycin challenge and suggest that B2 receptors may be interesting targets in the control of pulmonary brosis in humans.S28 Inflamm. Res. 123SP-23 ROLE OF France Inflammasome activation with the production of IL-1 breceived substantial attention recently in inflammatory disease, but the role ofinflammasome in the pathogenesis of asthma is not clear. Using anadjuvant-free model of allergic lung inflammation induced by oval- bumin, we investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome. We nd that allergic airway inflammation depends on NLRP3-ASC complexproducing IL-1 b. Dendritic cell recruitment into lymph nodes, vation of Th2 lymphocytes in the cytokines and chemokines including IL-33 and TSLP are reduced in the absence of NLRP3 and contribute to a dramatic reduction of allergic inflam-mation. Absence of NLRP3 and IL-1 bis associated with reduced expression of other cytokines as IL-13, IL-33, inflammasome is released upon ovalbumin challenge. Further-more, the critical role of IL-1R1 signaling in allergic inflammation is conrmed in IL-1R1, IL-1 band IL-1 adecient mice suggesting an additional role of IL-1 a. By contrast t using the potent adjuvant alum during antigen immunization causes NLPR3 and IL-1R1 independentallergic asthma. In conclusion, NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to IL-1 production is critical for the induction of a Th2 inflammatory allergic response, and the NLPR3 dependence of anallergic response may be determined by the adjuvant.

Valotta1, P. Jurgilas1, M. R. Silva1 1Laboratory of Inflammation, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil The importance of developing new animal models to assess the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant asthma has been stressed. Since following repeated allergen provocations, several features of asthma appeared less marked in many mice strains (Balb/c, C57blk6 and others) as compared to A/J mice, we have investigatedthe sensitiveness of mice of strain A/J to allergic provocations in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (DEX) treatment. Animals were sensitized on days 0 and 14 by a mixture of Al(OH)3 andovalbumin (OVA), and challenged for 2 or 4 consecutive days starting at day 19 post-sensitization. The animals were subjected to treatment with DEX (3 mg/kg, oral), or vehicle, 1 h before each provocation.Invasive methodology was employed for measurement of AHR. Peribronchial leukocyte inltration and subepithelial airway brosiswere analyzed by histomorphometry. Cytokines and chemokines were assessed by ELISA. All changes were done 24 h after the last chal- lenge. Our ndings show that A/J mice developed asthma-likepathological changes that become resistant to DEX treatment as theyare exacerbated by successive provocations. Since, the expression of GATA-3 also appeared increased and less sensitive to DEX, it is not unlikely that an overexpression of GATA-3 may contribute to thestate of GC refractoriness seen in this model. This study suggests theexistence of a causative relationship between steroid resistance and continued inflammation.

Female rats are relatively resistant to end-organinjury caused by hemorrhagic shock and gut from female animals ismore resistant than the males's to the deleterious effects of ischemic injury. Nitric oxide (NO) is a dual mediator of gut trauma-induced lung injury, but interaction of estradiol and NO is still not clear. Herewe assessed the effect of E2 on the lung and intestinal inflammationafter intestinal I/R and its interaction with the inducible NOS (iNOS) pathway. Anesthetized rats were subjected to occlusion of the supe- rior mesenteric artery (SMA) for 45 min, followed by 2 h ofreperfusion.

E2 reverted the increased LVP, but not IVP nor MPO. Aminoguanidine alone reduced LVP in OVXrats, but failed to do so when associated to E2. Aminoguanidine usedin non-OVX rats markedly exacerbated LVP endog- enous NO probably reduces the vascular effects of intestinal I/R. In addition, the NO-donor L-arginine imitated E2 since it reduced ALI after intestinal I/R. In conrmation, male rats treated with E2 were also protected.

Auto-inflammatory diseases (SP08) Symposium sponsored by the SNFMI (National Society of Internal Medicine) SP-27 THE CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF AUTO-INFLAMMATORY DISEASES K. Stankovic de re \u00b4decine, Paris, France The auto-inflammatory diseases encompass a large group of inflam- matory disorders dened as Mendelian genetic diseases involving theinnate immune system, and especially interfering with the regulation of Interleukin 1 pathway. The core group of these diseases is represented by hereditary recurrent fever syndromes: Familial Mediterranean fever;Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome; thecryopyrinopathies (Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome or CAPS) which include familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle- Wells syndrome, and Chronic infantile syndrome, and the deciency of the interleukin 1-receptor antagonist.All these disorders are characterized by recurrent episodes of inflam- matory attacks manifested by fever, local inflammatory symptoms due to serositis involving mainly the abdomen, the musculo-skeletal sys-tem, the thorax, and the skin, and an elevation of acute-phase proteinssuch as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA). Spec- icities characterize each of these entities. Other diseases sharing the Mendelian pattern of inheritance but not the intermittent character canbe also considered as auto-inflammatory diseases such as pyogenicarthritis pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome, Majeed syndrome, Ghosal syndrome. The concept of auto-inflammation is expanded to diseases in which innate immunity dysregulation isinvolved but without a Mendelian genetic basis such as atherosclerosisor gout; or disorders which share the implication of genes involved in Mendelian recurrent fever syndromes such as Crohn disease; ordiseases which mimick the attack feature such as Still's disease.Key words: Auto-inflammatory diseases, clinical aspects.

So far, few studies have investigated susceptibility locifor complex AIS. However, major advances have been made in the characterization of monogenic AIS. Five genes have been involved in the rst-recognized and most common AIS called hereditary recurrentfevers (HRF) and, depending on the denition of so-called AIS, 5-10additional genes have been shown to be responsible for these disor- ders. Genetic testing allows conrmation of the diagnosis, avoids years of unsuccessful investigations, and permits targeted therapy, aswell as genetic counselling. However, molecular analyses also show some limitations. (1) Most variations correspond to missense muta- tions whose deleterious effect remains often difcult to ascertain insporadic cases due to the lack of appropriate functional assays. Inaddition, for several variations identied in HRF genes, it is not clear whether they are simple polymorphisms, confer a milder phenotype, or act as modiers for other inflammatory loci. (2) Many patients withfamilial Mediterranean fever\u2014FMF\u2014(the most frequent monogenicAIS) carry only one mutation in the disease-causing gene ( MEFV ); this questions the recessive model of inheritance of FMF, although this observation depends on the clinical denition of the disease.

Res. 123Several approaches can be used identify new AIS genes: clas- sical linkage studies, homozygosity mapping, as well as candidategene approaches.

Tuesday June 28th, 2011 Translational research strategies in inflammation (SP09) Symposium sponsored by the SCIL (Society for Cytokines, Inflammation and Leukocytes) SP-30 ANTI Maini1 1Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, London, United Kingdom The discovery of anti TNF therapy, now routinely used in the treat- ment of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple diseases, was founded onseveral premises. First a hypothesis is that cytokines were important autoimmunity. Secondly the most accessible tissue to test was rheu- matoid synovium. Thirdly by 1987/88 the molecular biologyrevolution had led to the cloning of multiple cytokine cDNAs,enabling the analysis of cytokine expression. Fourth, improved cul- ture systems enabled the upregulated cytokine expression to be analysed and TNF emerged as a therapeutic target, with testedreproducibility. But the success is limited: there are no cures. Furtherwork is need to address the reasons why this is so, and potential synergistic approaches may improve efcacy but at unknown risk. Importantly the cytokine analysis in diseased tissue approach hasbeen successfully used by Claudia Monaco to show that upregulated cytokines are important in atherosclerosis, especially in Respiratory Medicine, Alfred Hospital, and Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia Allergic diseases constitute major and growing health burdens worldwide. Th2-polarised immune responses to allergens drive the adverse reactions, notably IL-4 which induces IgE class switching andmast cell inflammatory mediator release and IL-5 which promotes local eosinophil activation. Allergen specic immunotherapy (SIT) can modify the natural course of allergic diseases. Conventionally thistreatment is given subcutaneously but recently sublingual-swallowallergen-specic immunotherapy (SLIT) is gaining popularity, withmeta-analyses conrming long lasting clinical efcacy with decreased adverse events. Data on the immunological mechanisms underlyingeffective SLIT are emerging. The most convincing studies to date indicate that SLIT induces decreased allergen-stimulated T-cell pro- liferation, immune deviation (decreased IL-4 and IL-5 T cell anergy antibodies (allergen-specic IgG 4), and induction of regulatory T cells, as have been established for subcutaneous injection immunotherapy. Peripheral T-cell toler-ance to allergens is an important mechanism for maintaininghomeostasis in healthy individuals and in clinically efcacious allergen-specic immunotherapy. It is likely that functional naturally- and peripherally- are important in effec- tive SLIT. Additionally, there is evidence that the oral mucosa presents distinct regulatory features with oral Langerhans-like DC playing a major role. The precise molecular delineation of the aller-gen-DC receptor interaction which favours tolerance induction and whether particular adjuvants specically tailored for the sublingual route will allow improved allergen formulations and delivery strate-gies for greater efcacy of treatment remain to be determined. SP-32 THE ROLE OF AIRWAYS INFLAMMATION IN DEVELOPMENT OF PERSISTENT ASTHMADURING CHILDHOOD: EMERGING TARGETS FOR ASTHMA PREVENTION P.G. Holt1,* 1Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia Epidemiological evidence from several independent groups suggests that the development of what eventually becomes chronic asthma iscommonly initiated in early childhood, driven by a range of envi-ronmental factors which confer varying degrees of risk. Two factors stand out from the perspective of potential intervention targets. Firstly, the association between allergic sensitization to aeroallergens(as marked by IgE production) and asthma development has been recognised for many years, and in this context atopy can function as an independent risk factor. Secondly, early lower respiratory tractinfection, particularly severe infection marked by inflammatorysymptoms (wheeze and/or fever), also operates as an independent risk factor, and risk increases as a function of infection frequency. Moreover, maximum risk is encountered when these inflammatorypathways intersect, i.e., in children experiencing both sensitizationand severe lower respiratory tract infections. This suggests direct interaction between these risk factors which results in inflammation- mediated disturbance in the maturation of normal respiratory func-tions. These interactions also appear to operate when levels of IgE arerelatively low, within the range commonly encountered transiently in up to 50% of the normal infant population. Ongoing studies in our lab on viral-induced severe asthma exacerbations provide a plausibleexplanation for these interactions, notably ''recruitment'' of under- lying IgE-associated allergen-specic Th2 immunity into the inflammatory milieu of the infected airway via the innate immuneresponse against the virus, which is mediated by upregulation of highafnity IgE-receptor expression on local airway mucosal Dendritic Cells. Additionally, it is becoming evident that mucosal dwelling bacteria also play a role in early asthma pathogenesis, and recentevidence on the nature of their participation will also be presented.Inflamm.

Adcock1,* 1NHLI, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom Epigenetics, as the name implies, is used to describe the events that alter cell, organ whole animal phenotype that does not require changes in DNA sequence. It has been proposed to account for muchof the missing heritability in many diseases including asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway. In addition to asthma, other airways diseases such as COPD and pulmonary brosis havebeen proposed to have epigenetic in cellfunction involve co-ordinated post-translational modications of histones and DNA including changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation/methylation. These changes are under the control ofseveral enzymes and enzyme complexes that write, read and erasethese epigenetic marks. Epigenetic changes occur through life in response to environmental, physiological and pathological signals and may affect asthma susceptibility. For example, increasing the dietarycontent of methyl donors can increase asthma susceptibility and inflammatory components associated with airway hyperresponsive- ness in animal models of asthma. Furthermore, changes in lungfunction and airway inflammation in response to environmental pol-lutants such as trafc/diesel pollution and cigarette smoking have been linked to changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation. It is hoped that the development of novel drugs that target thesewriters, erasers and readers may produce novel therapeutic agents forchronic inflammatory diseases and at least cancer.SP-36 NEW TOOLS FOR EPIGENETICS-FUTURE THERAPEUTICS C. Bounta1,* 1Oxford, United Kingdom Abstract not available at the time of printing. Atherosclerosis: the role of inflammation (SP11) Symposium sponsored Weber1,* 1Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Ludwig-Maximilians- University (LMU) Munich, Munich, Germany Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall that is characterized by a disturbed equilibrium of immune responses and lipid accumulation, leading to the development of plaques. The ath- erogenic influx of mononuclear cells, namely monocytes and T-cells,and the interaction of antigen-presenting cells, T cells and monocytes isorchestrated by chemokines and their receptors. Studies using gene- decient mice and antagonists based on peptides and small molecules have generated insight into targeting chemokine-receptor axes fortreating atherosclerosis, which might complement lipid-lowering strategies and risk factor modulation. Combined inhibition of multiple chemokine axes could interfere with the contributions of chemokines todisease progression at specic cells, stages or sites. In addition, therecently characterized heterophilic interactions of chemokines might present a novel target for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. SP-38 THE MACROPHAGE IN METABOLIC CONTROL Lille, France Macrophages play a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis. After recruitment in the sub-endothelial space, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, accumulate lipids thus forming foam cells andsecrete pro-inflammatory and matrix-degrading factors, thus contrib-uting to plaque development, inflammation and instability. Recently, aS32 Inflamm. Res. 123role for macrophages in adipose tissue dysfunction related to obesity and diabetes has also been demonstrated. Therefore, pharmacologicalmodulation of macrophage functions represents an attractive strategy for the prevention and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular dis- eases related to atherosclerosis. Macrophages are heterogeneous cells,which adapt their response to While Th1cytokines M2 pheno- type. In recent years, the role of ligand-activated nuclear receptors, suchas the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors of macrophage polarization, lipid homeostasis and immune-inflammatory responses has been studied extensively. It has been shown that PPAR cpromotes the differentia- tion of monocytes into anti-inflammatory humansand mice, while a role for PPAR b/din this process has been reported only in mice. Our ndings show that, in contrast to PPAR c, expression of PPAR aand PPAR bdoverall do not correlate with the expression of M2 markers in human atherosclerotic lesions, whereas a positive correlation with genes of lipid metabolism exists. Moreover, unlike PPARc, PPAR aor PPAR bdactivation does not influence human monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages in vitro. Thus, PPAR a and PPAR b/ddo not appear to modulate the alternative differentiation of human macrophages, whereas PPAR cexerts anti-inflammatory actions by stimulating M2 polarization.

Le Plessis-Robinson,France Inflammatory processes are prominent in various types of human and experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH) and are increasingly recog-nized as major pathogenic components of pulmonary vascularremodeling. Macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, mast cells, and den- dritic cells are present in the vascular lesions of PH, whether in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or PAH related to more classicalforms of inflammatory syndromes such as connective tissue diseases or human immunodeciency virus. Similarly, the presence of circulating chemokines and cytokines and increased expression of growth (such asvascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor)and transcriptional (e.g., Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells or NFAT) factors in these patients are thought to contribute directly to further recruitment of inflammatory cells, and proliferation of smooth muscleand endothelial cells. Thus, the recognition of complex inflammatorydisturbances in the vascular remodeling process offers potential specic targets for therapy and has recently lead to clinical trials investigating, e.g., the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This presentation will providean overview of specic pathways involving cells, che- mokines and cytokines, cellular dysfunctions, growth factors, highlighting their potential role in pulmonary vascular remodeling andthe possibility of future targeted therapy.Inflamm.

C. Prescott1,*, B. Atkinson2, D. M. McKay1, C. Waterhouse2 1Department of Physiology and Pharmacology,2Department of Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Introduction: PI3k chas recently been identied as a potential target for the treatment of inflammation, primarily due to its role in leu- kocyte chemotaxis. Moreover, this signalling molecule is vital for defence against invading microbes, and its loss could potentiallyresult in persistent infection. We chose to examine the effects of genetic ablation of PI3K p110 con the development and resolution of acute murine colitis induced by the hapten trinitrobenzene sulfonicacid (TNBS).Methods: c -/-mice by intra-rectal administration of 4 mg TNBS in 30% ethanol. Colon tissue was collected on day 3 to examine severity of acute colitis, andon days 7 and 14 to observe the resolution of colitis. Indices of colitisassessed include: weight loss, gross inflammatory and histological score, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Results: While PI3k c -/-mice exhibited signicant protection from TNBS colitis by all measures during the early stages of colitis (i.e.,3 days post-TNBS), they also failed to properly resolve the inflam- mation by day 7 or 14. This was marked by a signicant inability to gain weight following colitis (98.7 \u00b15.2 vs. 107.7 \u00b13.4% initial body weight on day 14), persistence of elevated MPO levels (day 7: 78.6 \u00b11.3 vs. 4.2 for PI3k c -/-and wild-type, respectively), and noticeably PI3k cp110 is effective in blocking bouts of acute inflammation, its activity is required for the properresolution of inflammation. This may be of particular importance inareas of high microbial load, such as the gut. Thus the pharmacoki- netics of inhibitors of PI3Kg activity would be of paramountimportance when considering PI3k cinhibition as a therapy for colitic conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Adipokines new kids on the inflammation block (SY02) OC-002 SERUM ADIPONECTIN LEVELS PREDICT RADIOGRAPHIC JOINT DAMAGE IN ARTHRITIS: RESULTS FROM THE FRENCH ESPOIR COHORT Background: Adipokines are products of adipose tissue that may be involved in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Objectives: To investigate whether serum adipokines are associated at baseline with radiographic joint alterations and may predict structural damage at 1 year in early RA.Methods: We assessed 791 patients in the French ESPOIR earlyarthritis cohort fullling the 2010 EULAR-ACR criteria for RA (n=632) or had undifferentiated arthritis (UA, n =159). We mea- serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin at enrolment.We investigated in RA patients the association between adipokine levels and X-ray joint damage as assessed by Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) at baseline and 1 year in a multivariate analysis includingpertinent confounders: age, sex, BMI, insulin resistance as assessedby HOMA-IR index (model 1). In model 2, we included in addition factors of severity of RA (DAS28, CRP, HAQ, rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP status and radiographic destruction at baseline for the 1 yearanalysis) and the steroid use.Results: The levels of adipokines were not different between UA and RA (p [0.47). Within the RA population, adiponectin level at inclu- sion was associated with structural joint damage at baseline[OR (1.03-1.19), p =0.005] and confounding factors adiponectin concentration (model 1). This association was alsoindependent of the factors of RA severity and of the steroid use[OR =1.12 (1.03-1.21), p =0.007 at baseline and OR =1.13 (1.05-1.23), p =0.002 at 1 year] (model 2). Conversely, neither leptin nor visfatin levels were associated with SHS at baseline or 1 year.Conclusion: In early RA, serum adiponectin level is an independentfactor associated with radiographic joint damage and predictsS34 Inflamm.

OC-003 EVALUATION OF ANTI-TNF-ALPHA ANTIBODYEFFECTS UPON ADIPOKINE PRODUCTION AND INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION IN EXPERIMENTAL COLITIS A. Gambero1,*, T. R. L. Clemente1, A. N. dos Santos1, C. C. de Oliveira1, M. L. Ribeiro1 1Clinical Pharmacology Gastroenterology Unit, Sa o Francisco University, Braganc \u00b8a Paulista, Brazil Abnormalities of fat in the mesentery have been long recognized as characteristic features of Crohn's Disease (CD). The therapy with anti- bodies anti-TNF- a, i.e., infliximab, has been employed to treat CD patients. Although adipose tissue from CD patients can secretes a largenumber of hormones that act modulating immune responses and inflammation, there is no relate about infliximab action upon adipokine production by mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) during intestinalinflammation. Thus, the aim of this work was to study infliximab effectsupon adipokine production by MAT and intestinal inflammation in tri- nitrobenzenosulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Wistar rats with colitis induced by TNBS received infliximab (1 or 5 mg/kg/week).Colitis was characterized by histopathological analysis, MPO content and inflammatory mediators production in colon. Morphology, adipo- kines release and inflammatory markers were assessed in MAT.Infliximab treatment reduces MPO activity and improves all inflamma-tory parameters evaluated in colon. The TNF- aand IL-10 level in colon was not modied while iNOS expression was strongly inhibited in both infliximab groups. Leptin and adiponectin release by MAT was alsoinhibited in both infliximab groups, while resistin released was increasedafter infliximab treatment at 5 mg/kg dose. MAT also expressed level of PPAR- cand adipocyte size after infliximab (5 mg/kg) as healthy ani- mals. TNF- ablockade in experimental colitis was able to reduce the inflammatory response in colon. In MAT, we could observe an inhibition in leptin production, an important pro-inflammatory treatment restores adipocyte morphology could act as an additional anti-inflammatory medi- ator, providing evidences that therapeutic intervention modies not only intestinal inflammation but also MAT alterations induced by inflammation.Financial support: CNPq.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-004 EXPERIMENTAL FOOD ALLERGY LEADSTO ADIPOSE TISSUE INFLAMMATION AND WEIGHT LOSS IN MICE L. P. Dourado1, M. L. M. Noviello1, D. M. Avarenga1, G. B. Menezes1, A. V. Ferreira2, D. G. Souza3, D. C. Cara1,* and Inflammation Research Universidade Federal De Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Food allergy affects approximately 5% of children and 3% of the adult population in the western world. This disease is themanifestation of an abnormal immune response to antigens intro- duced into the organism orally and it is often mediated by IgE. Ourgroup developed a mouse model for the study of food allergy induced to ovalbumin. One of the most remarkable alterations observed in the allergic mice is a loss of weight. However, the disturbances thattrigger this loss of body weight are not clear. Thus, the aim of thisstudy was to investigate the mechanisms involved in weight loss of mice with ovalbumin-induced food allergy. With this purpose, BALB/ c mice were subcutaneously sensitized with ovalbumin in aluminumhydroxide and challenged with the antigen containing diet for 7 days.The allergic mice showed signicant weight loss with loss of epi- didymal adipose tissue, although it was not observed a reduction in food intake. These mice demonstrated adipose tissue inflammationcharacterized by increased leukocyte recruitment and inltration ofmast cells, macrophages and regulatory T cells in the stroma. Moreover, we demonstrated high concentrations of TNF- a, IL-6, IL- 10 and the chemokine MCP-1/CCL-2 in this tissue. The metabolicchanges in adipose tissue of allergic animals were represented by increased glucose uptake and lipolysis in adipocytes, resulting in atrophy of these cells. Changes were also seen in systemic metabo-lism characterized by decreased serum concentrations of glucose,triglycerides, total cholesterol and free fatty acids in allergic mice. Based on our results, we conclude that food allergy induce adipose tissue inflammation by producing mediators that lead to atrophy ofthis tissue. The decrease in adipose tissue mass has systemic conse-quences and results in loss of body weight. Disclosure of interest: None declared. New perspectives on T cells in inflammatory diseases (SY03) OC-005 TREGITOPES AND TOLERANCE: HARNESSING REGULATORY T CELLS TO SUPPRESS INFLAMMATION A. S. De Groot1,2,*, N. Najaan3, D. J. Hui4, F.

We discovered regulatory T cell epitopes (Tregitopes) located inIgG Fc and framework regions that induce regulatory T cells (Treg) in vitro and in vivo. We report efforts directed at using Tregitopes to sup- press antigen (Ag)-specic inflammatory immune responses by inducingimmunological tolerance. Studies in allergy (OVA model), transplanta- tion (MLR, cardiac transplant model), protein therapeutics (OVA), gene therapy (AAV), and autoimmunity (EAE, NOD) have demonstrated thattolerance to a range of Ags can be induced by co-administration ofTregitopes with target Ags in vitro and in vivo. Tregitopes activate CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + (nTregs). In vitro, co-incubation of Ag with Tregitopes leads to suppression of Teff responses (i.e. cyto-kine secretion, and In vivo, a of proteins (i.e. ovalbumin, and autoantigens) results in Treg expansion andfunctions, with suppression of Ag-specic T cell and antibody responses. The in vivo Tregitope effect is long-lasting; 100 days in transplant, and up to 30 weeks in the NOD mouse model. Tregitope treatment appearsto be pleiotropic; in different model of gamma-interferon, induction of TGF-Beta and IL-9 are due the complex interplay of APC, nTregs, Teff, and aTregs. Stimulation of regulatory T cells to control a range ofinflammation-mediated pathologies is promising. Moreover, thepotential to stimulate Tregs in an Ag-specic manner may reduce side effects (i.e. infections) associated with more widely immunosuppres- sive treatments. Adaptation or incorporation of Tregitopes intoestablished protein therapeutics also may have broad-reaching impli-cations for the elds of allergy, autoimmunity and transplantation. of interest: A.

OC-006 A CRITICAL ROLE FOR NF-KB1 IN THE PRODUCTION OF GM-CSF BY ACTIVATED CD4 TCELLS DURING INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES I. P. Wicks1,2,3,*, A. V. I. K. Campbell1,K Walter & Eliza Hall Institute Of Medical Research,2Rheumatology Unit, Royal Melbourne Hospital,3University of Melbourne,4Immunology, Walter & Eliza Hall Institute Of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia We previously reported that NF-kB1-decient ( Nfkb1-/-) mice had reduced CD4 T cell-dependent acute inflammatory arthritis (1). We also previously reported that MoDC differentiated from monocyteprecursors in the spleen during acute inflammatory peritonitis (2). Here, we show that Nfkb1 -/-mice are protected from acute inflam- matory peritonitis and that protection in both of these models of acuteinflammation is due to a requirement for the NF-kB1 subunit in CD4T cells. Protection was not due to enhanced apoptosis or failure to upregulate cytokine receptors, but to a selective defect in the pro- duction of the cytokine GM-CSF by activated CD4 T cells. We alsoshow that the in vivo differentiation of CD11c intCD11bhiLy6C+/ hiMHCIIhiMoDC, which could be identied in inflamed synovial tissue and draining lymphoid tissues, was dependent on the expres- sion of NF-kB1 in CD4 T cells. These data provide in vivo evidencethat NF-kB1-mediated production of GM-CSF by activated CD4 Tcells is required for MoDC differentiation under inflammatory conditions.

Kang1, Y. N. Bashkatova2, S. M. Andreev2, S. P. Atamas1 1Department of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, United States,2Department of Nanobiotechnology, NRC Institute of Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation Abstract: Interleukin-4 mRNA exists naturally in two isoforms, one encoded by exons 1-4 (IL-4), and the other encoded by exons 1, 3,and 4 (IL-4 d2). We have previously identied and named IL-4 d2 mRNA. We and others studied IL-4 d2 mRNA expression in pathol- ogy, and discovered changes in patients with scleroderma, asthma,tuberculosis, and other diseases. However, it is not known whether acorresponding IL-4 d2 protein is also naturally produced and under what conditions. The in vivo effects of IL-4 d2 protein have never been studied. We have developed an mAb against IL-4 d2 with no cross-reactivity to IL-4. Freshly puried T cells from 10 patients withmild or moderate asthma and from 5 healthy controls were tested after up to 96 h activation with PMA/ionomycin. Levels of IL-4 and IL- 4d2 mRNAs were measured by RT-Q-PCR, and secretion of IL-4 and IL-4d2 proteins was measured by ELISA. Basal expression of IL-4 and IL-4 d2 mRNAs was detected in all samples. Stimulation caused a 5-12-fold increase in IL-4 mRNA, and a 20-70-fold increase in IL-4d2 mRNA, peaking at 12-24 h of activation. T cells from controls secreted IL-4 but not IL-4 d2 protein, whereas T cells from asthmatics produced both IL-4 and IL-4 d2 proteins in comparable amounts. Levels of IL-4 protein peaked at 24-48 h of activation, whereas IL-4d2 protein peaked at 72 h. Adenoviral gene delivery of mouse IL-4 or mouse IL-4 d2 to mouse lungs in vivo induced immune inflam- mation with accumulation of T and B cells in both cases. However, delivery of IL-4 but not IL-4 d2 induced pulmonary eosinophilia, suggesting that IL-4 does and IL-4 d2 does not engage STAT6 sig- naling. Western blotting experiments in primary human T cell cultures tested phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT3. Only IL-4 but not IL-4 d2 induced phosphorylation of STAT6 or STAT3 in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Thus, IL-4 d2 is naturally secreted as a protein; it is biologically active in vivo Sepsis and septic shock are major medical challenges that result from a harmful host response to infection. Suppressed neutrophil apoptosis,a hallmark of sepsis, perpetuates inflammation and delays resolution.We found that the myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) protein is necessary and fundamental to execution of the neutrophil death program. During constitutive apoptosis of human neutrophils,MNDA is initially involved in suppression of Mcl-1transcription. Subsequently, MNDA is cleaved by caspases and relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it shortened the half-life of the anti- apoptotic protein Mcl-1 by promoting its proteasomal degradation,thereby accelerating collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Conversely, culture of neutrophils with myeloid HL-60 cells. We also show that neutrophils from septic patients exhibited impaired MNDA relocation/cleavage parallel with Mcl-1 increased half-life,preservation of mitochondrial function and suppression of apoptosis.Thus, the nuclear protein MNDA functions as a central mediator of a novel nucleus-mitochondrion circuit that promotes progression of apoptosis. Disruption of this circuit contributes to neutrophil lon-gevity in septic patients, thereby identifying MNDA as a potential target for treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory pathologies.

OC-009 NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC RELOCALIZATION OF THE PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN (PCNA) DURING DIFFERENTIATIONIS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS ANTIAPOPTOTIC ACTIVITY IN MATURE NEUTROPHIL: IDENTIFICATION OF A NUCLEAR EXPORT SEQUENCE D. Bouayad1, M. Pederzoli-Ribeil1, J. Mocek1, \u00b4 Paris Descartes, Cochin France We have recently described in mature neutrophils, a new survival pathway regulated by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear factor involved in DNA replication and repair of proliferatingcells. Notably, in neutrophils, which are non-proliferating cells, PCNA localized exclusively in the cytoplasm due to its nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization occurring during myeloid differentia- tion. The rst aim of the study was to elucidate the molecular basis ofthis PCNA cytoplasmic relocalization. We identied a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that can mediate an active CRM1- dependent nuclear export. However, because this NES sequence waslocated at the inner face of the PCNA trimer, this NES was fullyfunctional in PCNAY114A monomeric mutant, which accumulated within the cytoplasm. Using the DMF-differentiated PLB985 cell line, we next tested whether PCNA nuclear-to-cytoplasmic differentiation would impact its anti-apoptotic cells expressing the monomeric and the same anti-apoptotic activity assessed by mitochondria depolarization as those expressing PCNA ascompared to control PLB985. In contrast, no antiapoptotic activitywas observed in PLB985 cells expressing the nuclear SV40NLS- fused PCNA, thus strongly suggesting that nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization but not trimerization was pivotal for PCNA survivalactivity neutrophils. We concluded that (1) PCNA nuclear- to-cytoplasmic relocalization is part of the specic features of the neutrophil differentiation programme since it is essential for its pro-survival activity and (2) this phenomena is dependent on the newlyidentied monomerization-dependent PCNA NES.

Barrientos1,*, Marin-Esteban1, L. neutrophils (PMN) are key components of the innate response via several mechanisms, in particular the production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). NETs are composed of decondensed chromatin bers associated with granule and cytoplas-mic proteins and are released upon activation. NETs play animportant role in antimicrobial defenses but seem also to contribute to some auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. Our aim was thus to investigate whether NETs could interact with dendritic cells and thusmodulate key immune functions. We rst developed a reproduciblemodel to induce, isolate and quantify NETs from blood PMN. Cal- cium ionophore A23187 was chosen to induce NETs and the restriction enzyme Alu I allowed the recovery of heterogeneous-sizedfragments of NETs, as observed by DNA electrophoresis. Their composition was assessed by Western blotting and the use of various antibodies against some proteins potentially involved in DC interac-tions; proteomic analysis is under investigation. The incubation ofisolated NETs with moDC did not directly induce DC modications (CD80, CD86, CD83, CD40, HLA-DR ...). In were able to modulate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on moDC maturation. In particular, wecould observe the decrease of LPS-induced HLA-DR up-regulation. Our preliminary results thus suggest that NET formation, that takes place during inflammation, could also constitute a regulatory mech-anism by modulating some DC functions. The next steps of this study will be to better understand the mechanisms of NETs-DC interactions, in particular the signaling pathways involved and the consequenceson T cell activation.

Infection and inflammation (OC01) OC-011 ROLE OF PYRIN INFLAMMASOME IN IL-1 B PROCESSING RESPONSE TO BURKHOLDERIA M. A. Gavrilin1,2,*, D. Abdelaziz3, A. Amer1,3, M. D. Wewers1,2,3 1Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine,2Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute,3Center for Microbial Interface Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, United States Aims: Bacterial recognition by mononuclear cells often initiates assembly of an inflammasome resulting in activation of caspase-1 andprocessing of IL-1 b, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine. B. cepacia is one of the major opportunistic pathogens colonizing airways and inducing progressive respiratory inflammation in cystic brosispatients. However, the Burkholderia -sensing inflammasome remains uncharacterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate pyrin as a potential sensor of B. cepacia and its effect on caspase-1 activity. Methods: Human monocytes (Mo) and THP-1 cells, YFP-pyrin and inflammasomeadaptor molecule ASC (YFP-ASC), were infected with B. cepacia and for inflammasome activation. Results: B. cepacia efciently activates the inflammasome and IL-1 b release in Mo and THP-1 cells. Suppression of pyrin levels in Mo andTHP-1 cells reduced caspase-1 activation and ability to process and release IL-1 bbyB. cepacia challenge. In contrast, over-expression of pyrin robust IL-1 bresponse to B. cepacia , which correlated with the enhanced host cell death. In initial efforts to identify the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) respon- sible for B. cepacia recognition by pyrin, Mo were infected with Burkholderia mutants, defective in several types of secretion sys- tems.Inflammasome activation and IL-1 brelease was abolished infected with T4SS mutants of B. cepacia. Conclusions: For the rst time we showed an association betweenpyrin levels and release of the major pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 b by mononuclear cells infected with B. cepacia . The inflammatory reaction is likely induced by a yet uncharacterized PAMP of the T4SS.

Here, we demonstrated that inflammatory processes generated through TLR2 engagement and TNF a negatively regulate CD36 expression both on human and murine mac- rophages, and hence decrease CD36-mediated PfPEs clearance, directly favoring the worsening of malaria infection in vivo. Our main objectivewas to determine whether PPAR cor Nrf2 activators could restore CD36 expression and function on macrophages during inflammatory processes. In these conditions, we showed that PPAR cligands were ineffective to promote CD36 expression. This phenomenon was directly associatedwith a failure in the expression and activation of PPAR c. Interestingly, pharmacological and molecular approaches using c- and Nrf2-decient macrophages showed that CD36 expression and function were restored both on human and murineinflammatory macrophages via Nrf2, independently of PPAR c.T h e s e results were validated in vivo where only Nrf2 and not PPAR cactivators improved the outcome of severe malaria highlighting that Nrf2 activatorsrepresent a novel class of host immunomodulatory drugs that might beuseful for treatment of severe malaria.

OC-013 RESISTANCE OF ALVEOLAR Pasteur de Paris,2Intensive care unit, Groupe hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph, Paris, France Monocytes and macrophages endotoxin tolerance, and more widely Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists tolerance is a phenomenon corre- sponding to a modication of functional response of these cells (particularly an alteration of proinflammatory cytokines) during itera-tive stimulation by theses agonists, notably the lipopolysaccharide(LPS). Tolerance is observed with monocytes and macrophages from many tissue (peritoneal cavity, spleen, bone marrow), but is not detected with alveolar macrophages (AM). We investigated the cyto-kine and cell specicities of lung microenvironment possibly involved in that singular behavior of AM. We conrmed the absence of toler- ization of AM ex vivo three systemic inhibition of granulocyte-macrophagecolony-stimulating (produce in large amounts by type II pneumocytes, IIPC) led to a modication of the second response of AM to LPS. Similarly, AM obtained from interferon- c(IFN-c) receptor KO mice, or after in vivo inhibition of this cytokine, allowed theobservation of tolerance. The responses of AM isolated differentS38 Inflamm.

In summary, AM are resistant to tolerance to endotoxin. This functional singularity is underlined by the presence ofGM-CSF (produced by IIPC) and of IFN- cof which production is depending of NK and B cells) within lung microenvironment.

Fay, Kared, V. Monceaux, O. Diop,M. Mu \u00a8ller-Trutwin, B. Hurtrel, Y. have a role in antitumor immune responses and antiviral immunity. Recently, a new subset of iNKT cell has been reported to produce Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and impli- cated to inflammatory diseases. In the context of pathogenic SimianImmunodeciency Virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, wereport the emergence of IL-17 expressing cells during the acute phase. This subpopulation expresses phenotypic markers of iNKT cells and appears at day 14 post-infection concomitantly with an increase inTGF-b and IL-18 expression. This IL-17 producing iNKT population (iNKT-17), rather than IL-17 producing CD4 T cells (Th17), persist during the chronic phase in peripheral blood and in a large number oftissues, except colon. In addition, the levels of these cells wereassociated with disease progression to AIDS. Consistent with the role of TGF-b and IL-18 production, we demonstrated that, in vitro, TGF- b and IL-18 induce the differentiation and expansion of iNKT-17cells. The activity of IL-17 is classically dened by its ability toinduce the expression of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, which ultimately leads to the recruitment and activation of phagocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes). The emergence ofiNKT-17 cells during SIV/HIV infection could therefore contribute to the chronic activation of immune cells and inflammation. These abnormalities may be involved in the increased risk of serious non-AIDS conditions, such as cardiovascular, kidney, liver diseases, andnon-AIDS-dening malignancies, in individuals with HIV infection, compared to the general population.

Hussell1 1National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom Background: Recent studies suggest that prolonged alterations in innate immunity following a primary viral infection are orchestrated byup-regulation of negative regulators in innate immune effectors, pri- marily alveolar macrophages. The majority of negative regulatorsinvestigated in this study have not been explored following viral infection before and are therefore novel. Methods: Using a murine model, we tentatively assessed theinvolvement of various negative regulators following We also studied the antagonism of GR (by RU486 administration) followingprimary influenza infection and its effect on subsequent secondarybacterial challenge because of its therapeutic potential. Results: Following primary influenza, the expression proles of the regulators altered dramatically. There was a biphasic expressionpattern: early phase regulators, which peaked at day 7 (e.g. Axl, GR,PPAR- c, and GRK2) and late resolution phase regulators (e.g. MerTK, EP2, IL-10R, EP2 and LXR) which peaked around days 19-26. GR antagonism following primary influenza infection reducedthe severity of subsequent secondary bacterial pneumonia. Discussion: The up-regulation of negative regulators in a biphasic manner is interesting and may represent any or all of the following:(a) apoptosis of alveolar macrophages leaving behind those thatpreferentially express a particular receptor, (b) maturation of mac- rophages at different times so that receptor expression is seen in waves, (c) recruitment of macrophages leaving a receptor at particulartime points (d) alteration of macrophages following engulfment ofapoptotic cells. Conclusions: These ndings would help to develop alternative interventions against secondary bacterial pneumonia and we haveshown that antagonism of these negative regulators, as we have shown in GR antagonism, may lead to effective clinical application.

The inflammatory inltrate in the brain, with the recruitment of CD8+ T cells, and endothelium damage seems to be relevant in this process. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) isan inflammatory mediator involved in leukocyte recruitment andvascular permeability. Objective: To investigate the role of the PAFR in the outcome of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection and the relevance of this molecule for the neuroinflammatory process involved in CM.Method: C57Bl/6 by intraperitoneal injection. Parasitemia and survival parameters were monitored daily. Leukocyterolling and adhesion were evaluated by intravital microscopy in theInflamm. Res. S39 123pial vessels. Recruitment of CD8+ T cells of brain- sequestered leukocytes were analyzed by FACS. The expression ofcleaved caspase-3 in total brain extracts was analyzed through Wes- tern blot. Histopathological analyses were also performed. To further investigate the role of PAFR, WT mice were treated with PAFRspecic antagonist (UK-74,505).Results: Infected PAFR -/-mice resisted to the infection for a longer period (21 days) than WT (7 days). Perivascular inflammatory inl- trates -/-mice. However, intravital microscopy showed similar rolling and adhering leukocytes in WT and PAFR-/-mice. The recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells were reduced in PAFR-decient mice, as the activation of caspase-3. In WT miceinfected with PbA, treatment with UK74,505 was also associated withthe reduction of infection severity. Conclusions: PAFR signaling seems to be relevant for the develop- ment of experimental CM and its blockade is a promisingpharmacological strategy in CM. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Lung sensitization with C. albicans in mice attenuated subsequent P. aeruginosa -induced lung injury and decreased bacterial burden. Interestingly, this protection persisted when direct interactions between the two pathogens were blocked. Our objective was therefore to determine the cellularmechanisms that may account for the Candida -triggered protective effect against P. aeruginosa infection. Methods: Strains C. albicans CA SC5314 Balb/c 5 CFU of C. albicans .P. aeruginosa pneumonia was induced 48 h later by endotracheal instillation of 107CFU of P. aeruginosa . Lung immune response was assessed 24 h later in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and lung homogenates from mice infected with PaO1 with orwithout C. albicans sensitization. BAL and lung determined flow cytometry (FACS). Results: a to signicant alveolar macrophage cellrecruitment and activation with a higher expression of MHC II in BAL (p \\0.05 vs. control). In contrast, P. aeruginosa pneumonia alone (Pa) signicantly increased both PMN and macrophages but decreased alveolar macrophage activation (p \\0.05 vs. control). lung sensitization by C. albicans signicantly enhanced alveolar macrophage recruitment and activation with an overexpres-sion of both CD86 and MHC II (p \\0.05 vs. Pa). Consistently, lung total lymphoid cell populations were signicantly decreased by P. aeruginosa pneumonia alone, but were signicantly increased by C. albicans airway colonization alone and by Candida sensitization prior to P. aeruginosa possibly related lymphoid recruitment and activation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

The majority of available data on identication of bacterial antigen originates from studies of coronary arteries but not of lower limbs arteries.Aim: To investigate the presence of bacterial cells and microbial DNA with use of broad-range popliteal arteries of patientsundergoing reconstructive surgery or amputation. Methods: Fragments of arteries were harvested and cultured, from the remaining fragment DNA was extracted. PCR amplication wasperformed with primers for gene fragment coding bacterial 16sRNA,major outer membrane protein (ompA) of CP and urease gene of HP DNA with positive and negative controls. Routine bacteriological cultures of specimens were carried out.Results: Using routine microbiological methods popliteal and femoral arteries contained 64% of examinedfemoral and popliteal specimens. CP could be demonstrated in 69% of positively-tested patients while HP was detected in 3.8%. In carotid arteries 29% of cases contained bacterial DNA, 29% CP and 0% HPspecic genes. Thirty one bacterial DNA,65% CP and 18% HP. Conclusions: Bacterial isolates and DNA were found in lower limb arteries. Aorta and carotid arteries only sporadically contained iso-lates.

Bernhagen1,*, S. Kraemer1, C. Lue1, and Molecular Cell Biology, Rwth Aachen University, Aachen,2LMU University of Munich, Munich, Germany MIF is a structurally unique inflammatory mediator that plays a critical role in several inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Werecently discovered that MIF, contrary to its eponymous name, functions as a chemokine, promoting the recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed and atherogenic endothelium (Bernhagen et al., Nat. Med. 2007). Thisfunction is mainly based on non-cognate interactions with the chemokinereceptors CXCR2 and CXCR4, but MIF also binds to the MHC class II chaperone CD74. Blockade of Mif but of Cxcr2 or Cxcr4, Cxl8 and Cxcl12, respectively, in mice with advancedatherosclerosis led to plaque regression. In an attempt to devise novelMIF/CXCR-based therapeutic approaches, we comprehensively mapped the MIF/CXCR interface and identied a pseudo -(E)LR and an N-like- loop motif in MIF as a critical structural basis for MIF's promiscuousinteraction with CXCR2 (Weber et al., PNAS 2008; Kraemer et al., FASEB J . 2010). Applying peptide spot array technology, here we fully characterize the MIF/CXCR4 interface and identify the motifs and res-idues on the receptor side of CXCR2 and CXCR4 responsible for MIFbinding. Importantly, we will report on the identity, formation, and function of novel hetero-oligomeric MIF receptor complexes, which are involved in inflammatory monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment byMIF. Based on this previously unavailable structural information, wereport on peptide-based anti-MIF strategies that may have future appli- cability in inflammatory disease and atherosclerosis.

Eichentopf1, 1 (MCP-1, CCL2) plays a major role in inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. CCL2 is post-translationally modied residue formed by intramolecular cyclization of N-terminalglutaminyl residues. Here, we show that the Glutaminyl Cyclases (QCs) facilitate this reaction. The pGlu-residue confers resistance to proteolytic degradation and ensures proper receptor activation. In this context,upregulation of pGlu-cytokines in disease may exert protective but alsodeleterious effects for surrounding tissues. Chronic or overshooting cytokine response can drive toxicity and tissue damage. Accordingly, wehave characterized the role of QCs in inflammatory responses in vitro, in situ and in vivo. QC activity originates from two distinct genes termedQPCT (QC) and QPCTL (isoQC). Especially QC stimuli; inhibition of isoQC activity or genetic deciency of prevents the N-terminal pGlu-formation of Gln-cytokines. Consequently, the secretion of such immature peptidesattenuates their stability and receptor activation, which alleviates pathology in animal models. Our ndings open up alternative pathways for counteracting the excessively overproduced pGlu-cytokines by QC-inhibitors. Hence, this novel small-molecule approach has the potential totherapeutically modulate inflammatory responses in CNS and peripheral tissues. Disclosure of interest: H.

Blockade of the CCR10 receptor might therefore represent a novel alternative to the current treatment of asthma. We have evaluated the effect of the CCR10antagonist POL7085, a Protein Epitope Mimetic (PEM) in two differenthypereosinophilic asthma models in mice. Nine week-old male Balb/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) administered intraperito- neally in the presence of alum, and challenged to OVA administeredintranasally rst in a 8-day (D5-D7) and then in a conrmative 21-day (D18-D21) model. POL7085 was administered once daily, 1 h before each OVA challenge at increasing doses up to 18 lmol/kg intra-nasally lavage (BAL) was performed 24 h after the last challenge, and BAL cells differentially counted. In both models, in saline treated animals, OVA induced recruitment of eosinophils, neu-trophils, macrophages and lymphocytes into the BAL fluid. POL7085dose-dependently and signicantly decreased eosinophil numbers in BAL by 85 \u00b17.1 and 55 \u00b14.3% in the 8-day and the 21-day models, respectively. In addition, the higher doses of POL7085 also reduced thenumber of BAL neutrophils and lymphocytes in both models, althoughnot signicantly. In conclusion, these preliminary data show that CCR10 antagonist, POL7085, signicantly and dose-dependently decreases eosinophilia, and reduces the influx of other cell types in twomurine allergic model of asthma after once daily local administration. These data suggest that CCR10 antagonists may represent a promising novel approach for treating asthma.English et al., Immunol ESTABLISHED IN MURINE MODEL OF COLITIS J. A. Pheneger1,*, P. Lee2, L. Carter2, F. consist of three oncogenic serine/threonine kinases, whose activity is regulated at all levels of expression. PIM-1 and PIM-3 have been shown to be involved in T cell proliferation and survival following T cell receptor engagement and have reported roles in cytokine inducedsurvival. These activities suggest that a PIM1/3 kinase inhibitor may beuseful in targeting T cell mediated inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease. Herein we report the ability of a small molecule PIM 1/3 kinase inhibitor to modulate disease progression and severity of theCD45RB adoptive transfer murine colitis model, which is a model where progression involves Th1 and Th17 cytokines. AR00472159 is a selective and potent inhibitor of PIM1 and 3 kinases in both the enzyme(160 pM PIM 1 and 300 pM PIM 3) and cellular setting (88 nM PIM 1cell assay). When administered orally once daily at 10 and 100 mg/kg to CB17 SCID mice beginning 28 days after adoptive transfer of CD4 + CD45RBhi T cells (from Balb/c donors) and dosed for 21 days,AR00472159 signicantly inhibited colon pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IFNg with treatment. Furthermore, bene- cial effects were seen by up to 85% inhibition ofmucosal thickening, 64% colon inflammation and 65% inhibition of colon gland loss. These data support an important role of PIM kinases in a Th1/Th17 driven model of colitis.Disclosure of Inflammation, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation,2Laboratory of Pulmonary Investigation, Federal University Of Rio De Janeiro,3Department of Pharmacology, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,4Universite \u00b4de Rennes 1, Rennes, France Environmental and occupational lung disorders are important aspects of clinical medicine and the worldwide economic costs are staggering. Silicosis is a dysfunction caused by long-term inhalation of silicaparticles, characterized by intense inflammation and brosis, includingthe presence of granulomas in the lung tissue. In spite of the therapeutic arsenal currently available, there is no specic treatment for this dis- ease. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of the JNKinhibitor, SP 600125, on the brotic component of the experimental model of silicosis in mice. Swiss-Webster mice were injected intra- nasally with silica particles, and further, daily treated with the JNKinhibitor SP 600125, from day 21 to 27 after silica provocation. Theanalyzes were performed 24 h after the last administration. We showed that treatment of silicotic mice with the JNK inhibitor SP 600125markedly reduced granuloma formation, collagen deposition as well as the increased labeling for macrophages and myobroblasts in the lungtissue. Generation of the chemokine KC and the brogenic factors TNF-aand TGF-b were inhibited by the drug. In line with the previous data, SP 600125 suppressed the increase in airways resistance (centraland peripheral) and static elastance in silicotic animals. The high levelsof phosphor-JNK noted in silicotic lungs, as compared to the controls, were clearly reduced by SP 600125. Additionally, incubation of lung broblasts with SP 600125 in vitro abolished the proliferative responseto IL-13 stimulation. In conclusion, our ndings indicate that JNKinhibitor SP 600125 effectively suppressed the brotic phase in sili- cosis in mice, which is clearly reflected by the impairment of lung function alterations, strongly supporting the therapeutic potential oforally available JNK inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary AAND TRPV-1 ANTAGONIST COMPOUND ORALLY EFFECTIVE IN MODELS OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN C.

A signicantly lower degree of paw inflammation, inflamma-tory cell influx, and the erosion of cartilage and bone was seen with LAP-MMP-VIP and LAP-MMP- aMSH. Collagen type II autoanti- body and serum inflammatory cytokine production were also reducedin these two groups when compared to LAP-MMP. The short half lives of VIP and aMSH limit their therapeutic use.

Kaushansky1,*, R. Zilkha-Falb1, R. Hemo1, L. Institute of Science, Rehovot, IsraelMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS, associated with complex anti-myelin autoimmunity. Amongall approaches proposed for MS therapy, an approach that neutral- izes only the pathogenic T cells reacting against myelin, while leaving the innocent immune cells intact, is the ultimate goal in theimmune-specic therapy for MS. The multiplicity of primary targetantigens, along side the dynamic nature of autoimmunity in MS, whereby the specicity of anti-myelin pathogenic autoreactivities may shift or expand in the same patient with disease progression,impose major difculties in devising immune-specic therapy toMS. To overcome this multiplicity and the potential complexity of pathogenic autoreactivities in MS, we have put forward the concept of concomitant multi-antigen/multi-epitope targeting as, a conceiv-ably more effective approach to immunotherapy of MS. Weconstructed an EAE/MS-related synthetic human Target Autoantigen Gene (MS-shMultiTAG) designed to encode in tandem only EAE/ MS related epitopes of all known encephalitogenic proteins. TheMS-related protein product (designated Y-MSPc) was immuno- functional and upon tolerogenic administration, it effectively suppressed and reversed EAE induced by a single encephalitogenicprotein. Furthermore, Y-MSPc also fully abrogated the developmentof ''complex EAE'' induced by a mixture of ve encephalitogenic T-cell lines, each specic for a and OSP. Strikingly, Y-MSPc was con-sistently more effective than treatment with the single disease-specic peptide or with the peptide cocktail, both in suppressing the development of ''classical'' or ''complex'' EAE and in ameliorating ongoing disease.

By crossing the EAE- resistant mouse strain RIIIS/J and the EAE-susceptible mouse strainB10.RIII, the Eae2 locus on mouse chromosome 15, have been found. TheEae2 is also linked to the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on stimulated macrophages. Within Eae2 , a sub-locus linked to Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA), Cia31 , has been identied. The aim of this project is to investigate whether genes within Cia31 , in addition, are linked to EAE and to investigate putative candidate genes. TheInflamm. Res.

Induction of EAE by immunization with themyelin basic protein peptide 89 -101 resulted in later onset and lower severity of disease in the congenic B10.RIII RIIIS/J_ Cia31 mice compared to littermate controls. By gene expression analyses andbioinformatics studies, we have suggested the Ctnnd2 andMarch6 genes as two potential EAE candidate genes in Cia31 .Ctnnd2 codes ford-catenin, a brain protein involved in the transduction of signals between neurons. Deletions or mutation in this gene results in severeretardation in humans. March6 codes for an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The March family of proteins regulates membrane molecules, among those, CD86. Sequence analyses of the Ctnnd2 and March6 genes show variations between the RIIIS/J and B10.RIII strains in bothcoding and non-coding regions. Furthermore, we have found a dif-ferential expression of the CD86 protein on stimulated peritoneal macrophages from congenic B10.RIII RIIIS/J_Cia31mice compared to littermate controls. We hypothesize that this might be linked to anamino acid change in the March6 protein. Conclusion: A gene(s) in the congenic Cia31 fragment in mouse chromosome 15, are involved in development of EAE, the animalmodel for multiple sclerosis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-028 DYNAMIC OF CXCL12 EXPRESSION IN THE CNS OF EAE MICE AND ITS POTENTIAL ROLE INMATURATION OF OLIGO/NEURO PROGENITORS R. I. Zilkha-Falb1,*, N. Kaushansky1, 1Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterized by massive demyelination associated with axonal damage and neuronal loss, typically accompanied with episodes ofrelapses/remissions. Both in MS and its murine model, experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the development of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation was shown to be associated with robust upregulation of the CXCL12 expressed in the CNS. However,the dynamic of CXCL12 at the different stages of EAE and in par- ticular at recovery and indeed, its expression by cells of neural lineages under such circumstances remains unclear. We noted thatwhile CXCL12 expression in the CNS is increased in correlation withthe development of severe pathological and clinical EAE, interest- ingly, the level of CXCL12 remains high during spontaneous clinical recovery associated with reduction of CNS inflammation. We showthat not only astrocytes, but also newly generated neuronal and oli-godendrocyte progenitors express CXCL12 in the CNS of mice at the peak of EAE and during recovery. CXCL12 immunoreactivity in neuronal and oligodendrocyte progenitor vitro differentiated adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNPCs).In vitro studies further show that addition of CXCL12 enhances the differentiation of aNPCs towards neuronal and oligodendrocyte pro- genitors. Moreover, the addition of AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist,markedly inhibited the effect of both the exogenous and endogenous CXCL12 in promoting the differentiation of neuronal and oligoden- drocyte progenitors, and their mature counterparts. Our data highlightthe postinflammatory steady expression of CXCL12 by neuronal andoligodendrocyte progenitors and demonstrate its involvement in dif- ferentiation/maturation of aNPCs, implicating a role for CXCL12 IN INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) ACTIONS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) I.

However, GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice had decreased pY-STAT3 in the brain due to a marked reduction in the totalnumber of pY-STAT3-positive cells and the absence of detectable pY-STAT3 in specic cell types. These changes in pY-STAT3 were asso- ciated with a disproportionate reduction in the expression of various inflammatory markers as well as reduced vascular pathology and blood-brain barrier leakage. Degenerative changes in the cerebellum charac- teristic of GFAP-IL6 mice were almost absent in GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice. The ndings suggest that in the CNS: (1) sgp130-Fc is able to blockIL-6 trans-signaling, (2) trans-signaling is important for IL-6 cellularcommunication with selective cellular targets and, (3) the blocking of trans-signaling may prove to be an effective means for alleviating the detrimental effects of IL-6.

Rossi1, V. de Novellis1 1Experimental Medicine, The Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) are anatomically and functionally interconnectedcooperating for the integration of emotionally salient sensory input. Specically, the unpleasantness and affective component of chronic pain are driven by prelimbic and infralimbic (PL/IL) divisions of the mPFCand amygdala reciprocal connections. These regions can be profoundlyaffected by persistent pain generated by peripheral nerve injury or chronic inflammation in rodents. We show in this study that nociceptive responding BLA ?mPFC pyramidal neurons undergo deactivation following carrageenan-induced inflammation together with downregu- lation of the endovanilloid/glutamate transmission (while GABAergic tone was enhanced) that can participate for impairing pain behaviourS44 Inflamm. Res. 123mediated by BLA-mPFC circuits. In particular, it has been found here that pyramidal cells are inhibited by intra-plantar injection of carra-geenan. We show unprecedented evidence of a neural mechanism by which selective metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) up-regulation in the BLA may impair mPFC function in inflammatorypain conditions. These results appear opposite to those ones found inneuropathic pain conditions (excitatory effect on pyramidal neurons). Thus amygdala can lead to differential changes in functionally distinct subsets of mPFC neurons in inflammatory versus neuropathic pain. Inconclusion, we believe that the present data will help the understanding ofthe cross-talk between amygdala and mPFC, and the role of mGluR1 in the BLA for the functional changes of amygdalo-cortical interactions within the framework of the pain-related IN EXPERIMENTAL STROKE S.

Necdin was specically upregulated in cellsderived from the ischemic hemispheres which was CD11b +sorted (60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion). To corroborate, necdin+/ Iba1+double positive cells were observed and assumed the activated 'ameboid' morphology in brain sections. To test the role of necdin ingrowth arrest of inflammatory cells, we generated lentiviral particles (LVPs) to downregulate necdin at protein levels via RNA interference (RNAi).

In summary, necdin is expressed in the hyperactivated subpopulation of microglia and restricts their proliferation.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-032 NUCLEAR RECEPTORS AS POTENTIAL TARGETFOR THE TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH SPINAL CORD TRAUMA MICE I. Paterniti1,*, E. Esposito1, E. Mazzon1,2, Neurolesi ''Bonino-Pulejo'', Messina, ItalyThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated receptors (PPARs) and Liver Xreceptor (LXR) in an experimental model of spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. To this purpose we used: (1) a high afnity ligand for a (3) potent (T0901317). Moreover, to evaluate thecontribution of PPAR- a, we used mice with a targeted disruption of the PPAR- agene (PPAR- aKO). Spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips (force of 24 g) to the dura via a four-levelT5-T8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma charac-terized by oedema, neutrophil inltration, and production of damage, and apoptosis. 15d-PGJ2, GW0742, and T0901317 treatments, 1 and 6 h after the SCI, signi-cantly reduced: (1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissueinjury (histological score), (2) neutrophil inltration (myeloperoxidase ameliorated the recovery of locomotor function. In order to elucidate whether theprotective effects of 15d-PGJ2 and GW0742 are related to PPAR- cand PPAR- b/dreceptor of PPAR- cand PPAR- b/dantagonists on protective effects. Moreover, the absence of a functional PPAR- agene mice resulted in a signicant augmentation of inflammation and tissueinjury events associated with spinal cord trauma.

OC-034 INHIBITION OF MESENTERIC von Roizes1, M. S. Imtiaz1 1Physiology & Pharmacology, University Of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Efcient lymph flow is critically important during the inflammatory process to limit edema formation and to allow antigen-presentingcells and lymphocytes to migrate from the inflamed tissue to thedraining lymph nodes and mount an adequate immune response. Lymph flow is an active process enabled by rhythmical, phasic constrictions of the collecting lymphatic vessels. This function, orlymphatic pumping, is intrinsic to the muscles embedded in thevessel wall and is modulated by many mediators present in the vicinity of the vessels during inflammation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate neuro-immuno-modulators with anti-inflammatoryproperties released by peptidergic nerves, and by inflammatory cells patrolling the interstitium and lymph. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of VIP and PACAP on lymphatic pumpingand the cellular mechanisms they activate. Pharmacological assess- ment of vessel diameter change and intracellular microelectrode electrophysiology demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibitionsof lymphatic contraction frequency and muscle hyperpolar-ization in response to VIP, PACAP27 and PACAP38. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry of VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors inlymphatics. Abolition of antagonist PACAP6-38 and VPAC1/VPAC2 antagonist predominant involvement of VPAC2 in the peptide actions. Moreover, abolition of the VIP-induced responses with glibenclamide suggests K ATP channel involvement. During inflammation, VIP and PACAP are likely to be released by nerve terminal and inflammatory cells in the vicinity oflymphatics. In this context, the potent lymphatic pumping inhibitionthese peptides cause may influence the inflammatory process by compromising lymph drainage, edema resolution and immune cell trafcking.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Cancer, genetics and inflammation (OC04) OC-035 TUMOR PYRUVATE KINASE M2 AS BIOMARKER OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER AND GERD T. Gupta1,*, K. S. Chahal1 1Department of Pathology, Government Medical College, Amritsar, IndiaTumor M2-PK is known to be present in high concentrations in tumor tissue, plasma and other body fluids. Plasma determination of TumorM2-PK has been shown to discriminate between benign/premalignant and malignant conditions. Tumor M2-PK has also been reported to be increased in some inflammatory conditions. The present studyexplores the ability of Tumor M2-PK expression to differentiatemalignancy from chronic inflammatory condition (GERD) and assess it as a noninvasive biomarker in early diagnosis of esophageal cancer. The Tumor M2-PK concentration was quantitatively measured inEDTA-plasma of 218 individuals by a sandwich ELISA method(Schebo /C210Tech, Germany). Among them were 64 patients of histo- logical conrmed esophageal cancer, 58 patients of GERD, 34 patients of breast cancer, and 62 healthy individuals as controls. Thecut-off value to discriminate patients from controls was taken as15 U/ml for Tumor M2-PK. In patients with esophageal cancer Tumor M2-PK mean values was 60.72 U/ml, in GERD was 32.28 U/ ml, in breast cancer was 25.97 U/ml and in controls was 2.61 U/ml.Comparison of means showed a signicant difference of esophageal cancer from GERD (t =6.544, P\\0.001) and controls (t =16.405, P\\0.001). GERD patients had non-signicantly higher values than breast cancer patients (t =1.037, P[0.05). Patients at stage I of esophageal cancer and breast cancer had higher values of Tumor M2- PK than GERD patients. Sensitivity and specicity of Tumor M2-PK in differentiating malignancy from healthy controls was 94 and 95%in esophageal cancer and 67 and 90% in breast cancer. In differen-tiating GERD from esophageal cancer it was 94 and 64% respectively. Tumor M2-PK is a biomarker for malignancy and is a better marker for esophageal cancer than Breast cancer. It can dif-ferentiate early stages of esophageal malignancy from GERD but its ability to be a noninvasive preclinical biomarker for esophageal cancer needs further elucidation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Le Cabec1, I. and Differentiation and activation of phagocytes 1CNRS/IPBS-UMR5089,2CNRS/IBCG,3CNRS-ITAV, Toulouse, France,4Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, United States The presence of inflammatory cells like macrophages in tumours is often associated to enhanced invasiveness of tumour cells and for- mation of metastases and therefore, it is considered as a factor of bad prognosis. Thus we investigated the role of human macrophagesin tumor cell invasiveness. First, we examined the migration modesused by human macrophages and breast carcinoma SUM159 cells when they inltrate a thick layer of Matrigel /C210matrix. SUM159 cells used the mesenchymal migration mode in a matrix metalloprotein-ase (MMP)-dependent manner. In the presence of macrophages, SUM159 cells were no longer sensitive to MMP inhibitors: they followed macrophages which formed tunnels in the matrix in acollective and amoeboid migration mode. Next, we used tumour cellspheroids (TS) of SUM159 cells embedded into Matrigel, as a more complex set-up mimicking the tumour environment. Under these conditions, tumour cells were unable to invade the surrounding 3DS46 Inflamm. Res. 123matrix unless macrophages inltrated the TS. To determine if macrophage migration ability triggers invasion of tumor cells weused bone-marrow derived macrophages from inl-trated by hck-/-macrophages decient for Matrigel migration, tumour cells had a reduced invasive capacity indicating that the intrinsic migration ability of macrophages is critical for tumour cell invasiveness. Here, we developed a new in vitro model allowing thestudy of macrophage-tumour cell relationship in the invasion pro-cess. These results (1) demonstrate a MMP bypass of tumor cell migration in the presence macrophage, (2) support the pivotal role of the macrophage migration process in tumour cells invasion (3)highlight that inhibition of macrophage migration is a new phar-macological strategy.

OC-037 TARGETING MYELOID DERIVED SUPPRESSORCELLS IN VIVO 5-FLUOROURACIL REDUCES INCIDENCE Group 1Pharmacology and Physiology, Univesrity of Calgary, Calgary, Canada The myeloid derived suppressor cell (Gr1+CD11b+, MDSC) is a recently described protumorigenic cell type with andproangiogenic affects. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog che- motherapeutic has been shown to reduce MDSC recruitment in vivo in a xenograft model of lymphoma and to selectively kill MDSC in vitro.We have previously shown that MDSC are upregulated and correlate withneoplastic changes in the colon in the interleukin-10 decient mouse (IL- 10 -/-). The aim of this study was to test whether targeting MDSC in vivo with 5-FU affects cancer development in vivo in the IL-10-/-model of colitis associated cancer. 6-week-old IL-10-/-mice were given 6 weekly intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/Kg 5-FU or saline control (n =5). Animals were sacriced at 12 weeks and colons were harvested. Inflammatory changes, polyps and dysplasia scores were evaluatedmacroscopically and histologically using previously published scoringsystems. Gr1 +CD11b+cells per unit area of mucosa (cells/106mm2)w e r e determined via immunohistochemical analysis of colon sections with anti-mouse antibodies. Student's T test was used to statistically comparegroups. Both macroscopic \u00b10.83 vs. (4.17 \u00b10.69 vs. 3.84 \u00b10.58) scores of inflammation were comparable between control and 5-FU treated mice. Polyp scores werereduced following 5-FU (0.33 \u00b10.52) treatment as compared to controls (3.00 \u00b10.00). 5-FU treatment reduced MDSC levels in the colon down to near wild type levels at 9.45 \u00b11.59 cells/10 6mm2.5 - F U (0.17 \u00b10.40) treatment reduced scores from control levels (4.40 MDSC counts of cells/106mm2. Our data show that treatment with 5-FU does not affect inflammatory markers, but decreases neoplastic changes and MDSC recruitment in the IL-10-/-mouse. This is the rst evidence that targeting MDSC in vivo in a model of colitis-associated cancer can reduce cancer incidence.

Inflammation has been considered the mostimportant cause of injury in organs subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The aim of this study was evaluate the endogenous mechanisms responsible for regulation of local and systemic inflammation afterintestinal I/R in mice genetically selected for maximal (AIR max)o r minimal (AIR min) local Acute Inflammatory Response. After 45 min of intestinal ischemia, mice were submitted to reperfusion (0, 1, 4 and 24 h). The extent of lung injury was evaluated by myeloperoxidase(MPO) activity and cellular inltration in the lung parenchyma. Hyp- oxic genes and inflammatory cytokine expressions were evaluated in the lung by Real Time PCR. It was observed that AIR maxI/R mice had a progressive neutrophilia starting after ischemia and peaking at 4 h ofreperfusion (2.7 \u00b10.3910 6cell/ml). On the other hand, AIR minI/R mice had a low inltrate with equivalent levels compared to the control groups (1.2 \u00b10.29106cell/ml). Corroborating these results the MPO activity was higher in the lungs of AIRmax I/R than AIRmin I/Rmice (p \\0.01). A high expression 1 -a, Vhl, Il -1bandIl-6was observed in AIRmax I/R mice. Conversely, AIR minI/R mice presented low expression of these genes. The positive correlation found in AIRmice between the inflammatory reactivity and hypoxic genes expres-sion suggest that the genes responsible for regulating the acute inflammatory response, xed by selective breeding, can modulate the expression of genes involved in situations of hypoxia, and consequentlymodify the lung injury intensity hypoxia-dependent.

One of subsets within the inflammatory myeloid cells compartment is immature and includes myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC),accumulating in tumor-bearing hosts in response to various inflam-matory mediators. We supposed that TLR2 might become more readily available on the surface of MDSC in response to component of com- plement C5a, one of the most active inflammatory mediators,concentration of which is increased in a tumor microenvironment.

Increased expression of TLR2 was associated withdecreasing the expression of CD88 (presumably due to ligand-receptorinternalization). We suggest that rapid C5a-induced increase in avail- ability of TLR2 on the MDSC surface may promote metastazing through activation of MDSC known to tolerize anti-tumor T cells.Hypothetically, MDSC activation supported by ligandshyaluronan and versican commonly overaccumulated within the co-accumulation of TLR2 highMDSC and versican/hyaluronan ligands within the same compartments may serve as candidate biomarker pattern for propensity of a tumor to metastasize.

Instituto Butantan,2Department of Food and Experimental Nutrition, USP, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as DMBA, induce a decrease in bone marrow cells (BMC) numbers and hematological alterations resulting in an immunosuppressive state. DMBA metabolism depends on the activation of the aryl hydrocarbonreceptor (AhR). Mice genetically selected for high (AIR max) or low (AIR min) acute inflammatory response to s.c. injection of Biogel P100 presented a complete segregation of Ahr alleles endowed withlow ( Ahr d) or high ( Ahrb1) afnity to PAHs, respectively. Accordingly, AIR max are more resistant than AIR minto DMBA induced skin and lung carcinogenesis. We investigated the effect of DMBA treatment on BMC of AIR selected mice and its possibleimpact on acute inflammatory response.

Acute inflammation response was also eval- uated after 24 h of Biogel P100 subcutaneous (s.c.) injection.DMBA treatment resulted in a signicant (p \\0.01) decrease in neutrophil population and increase of HSC on bone marrow in AIRmin mice only. Blast cells from DMBA-treated AIRmin pre-sented displastic nucleus, which is one of the distinguishingfeatures of preleukemia, and myeloid cells showed low proliferation capacity after in vitro GM-CSF stimulation. These effects on myeloid BMC reflect on an impaired cellular migration to theinflammatory site 24 h after Biogel injection. This investigationdemonstrates that AIR maxmice are protected and AIRmin are prone to acute bone marrow cytotoxic and presumable preleukemic effects of DMBA. The complete segregation of alleles at the Ahr locus found in AIR mice might contribute to their differential inflam-matory responses and to the phenotypes of susceptibility and resistance of BMC to DMBA-induced effects.

This study aims at identifying theincidence of daily ingestion of iron by juvenile mice on the orienta-tion of immune response following the induction of an experimental colitis or food allergy. Six groups of male juvenile Balb/c mice were treated during 6 weeks with vehicle or iron solution (150 mg/kg/day-100ll/day po). In parallel, half of the animals were submitted to sham or ovalbumin sensitization (1 mg/ml-100 ll/day po) and chal- lenge (100 mg/ml-100 ll po). In the other half, we induced a sham or experimental TNBS colitis (40 mg/kg in 50% Ethanol 1 week follow-up) after the 6 weeks of iron treatment. Spleen expression of T-betand GATA3 were evaluated by RT PCR. Their epigenetic regulations were assayed by the analysis of cytosine methylation levels of their respective promoter sequence. In Th1 model, T-bet/GATA3 ratioincrease is mainly linked to T-bet promoter gene hypomethylation and thus gene overexpression. The Th2 model revealed upregulation of GATA3/T-bet ratio consecutive to GATA3 expression increase inhibition. However, no modication of methylation prevented of T-bet promoter gene methyla- tion in the Th1 model.

Sundquist1 1Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden Objective: Familial risks of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been assessed in small case-control studies, usually based on reported, butnot medically veried, RA in family members; thus the degree of familial clustering of these diseases remains to be established. Methods: The Multigeneration Register, in which all men andwomen born in Sweden from 1932 onward are registered togetherwith their parents, was linked to hospital admission data. Stan- dardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratio of the observed to the expected number of cases of men and women withmothers and/or fathers affected by RA, compared with men andwomen whose mothers and/or fathers were not affected by RA. Results: A total of respectively 18,496 and 51,921 cases of RA were recorded in offspring and parents. The overall signicant SIRs amongmen and women with a mother, father or both parents hospitalized forRA varied between 2.64 and 11.01. Marginally higher familial risk was found before age 40. The risk was not dependent on gender. The parental transmission of RA was similar for both men and women.The population attributable fraction of familial RA was 4.29%. Conclusions: This study has provided the rst data on age-specic familial clustering of RA, based on medically conrmed records.The risks were so high that hereditary factors were considered to belikely to contribute, possibly modied by environmental factors. Age-specic risk tables would be helpful for clinical counseling. Disclosure of interest: None declared. Inflammatory cells: neutrophils PATHWAY G. Cirino2, R. J. Flower1, M.

Treatment of humanPMNs the H 2S donor NaHS (10-100 lM) provoked prompted and intense mobilization ( [50%) of AnxA1 from the cytosolic pool to the cell surface, supporting the inhibitory effects of the gas in the flowchamber assay.

Next, we investigated whether endogenous AnxA1 couldmodulate H 2S synthesis, indicating existence of a positive circuit. To this end, a marked increase in CBS and/or CSE expression in a variety of tissues (aorta, kidney, spleen) tested from AnxA1-/-mice, as compared to wild type animals, was quantied by qPCR. Moreover, NaHS was able to counteract the increase in expression in iNOS and COX2 (fourfold and sevenfold reduction, respectively) upon LPS-stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), though itwas totally inactive in cells prepared from AnxA1 -/-mice. Taken together, these data strongly suggest\u2014for the rst time\u2014the exis- tence of a positive interlink between AnxA1 and the H 2S pathway, providing a novel mechanistic explanation for the exquisite propertiesof H 2S in the control of experimental inflammation.

Guiet1, macrophages (Mph), critical for innate immunity, is also involved in pathologies, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. In vivo, Mphs migrate mostly in a constrained three-dimen- sional (3D) environment. We have recently shown that, depending onthe extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture, human Mphs are able tomigrate in 3D using two distinct migration modes: they use the prote- ase-independent amoeboid migration mode (like other leukocytes) in porous ECM and the mesenchymal migration mode in non-porousECM. In addition, we have identied the phagocyte specic tyrosinekinase Hck as an effector of Mph mesenchymal migration. Now we show that the mesenchymal migration of macrophages in ECM is matrix metalloproteinase it is MMP-dependent inside tumour cell spheroids. ECM degradation is the result of several cellular processes: (1) formation of 3D podosomes with proteolytic activity, (2) matrix compaction, and (3) matrix internali-zation.

Macrophages from op/op mice are able to sufcientlyperform effector functions in vitro, such as phagocytosis and nitric oxide (NO) production. There are quantitative differences when peritoneal elicited macrophages were tested. Those from op/op mice showed astronger response than those from control mice with regard to NO or IL- 12 release. Interestingly, these same characteristics have been described to B-1 cell derived phagocytes. In this study, the peritoneal cell sub-populations of op/op mice and their littermates were analyzed. The aimwas to investigate whether op/op peritoneal ' 'macrophages' ' were B-1 cell derived phagocytes .The deciency of cfms gene in op/op mice did not affect peritoneal B-1 cell population. Further, these cells are able todifferentiate into phagocytes under LPS stimulus. The origin of thesephagocytes was related to B-1 cells considering the VH11 Ig gene rearrangement detected in these cells. It also could be postulate that B-1 cell differentiation into phagocyte is independent of M-CSF. We alsospeculate that the MCSF-independent macrophage described in litera- ture could be derived from B-1 cells.

Previously, PAR 2activation has been shown to cause pain in the joint (Helyes et al .2010. Eur J Pain); however, the mechanisms responsible for this are unclear. To elucidate neuronal PAR 2expression in joints, 10 ll of a 2% Fluoro-gold (FG) solution was injected into the knee joints of 4 na \u00a8ve male Wistar rats to retrogradely label knee stained with an anti-PAR 2antibody. Cells positive for FG and for PAR 2 were counted and neuronal diameters measured. To measure joint noci-ception objectively, electrophysiological recordings were made from single unit afferent nerve bres in the knee joints of male Wistar rats during both normal and noxious rotation of the joint. Afferent bre ringrate was recorded during 10 s rotations made before and over a period of15 min after close intra-arterial injection of the PAR 2activating peptide, 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH 2(100 Rats the TRPV1 antagonist, SB366791 i.p. 30 min prior to nerve recordings; n =6) It was observed that 59\u00b15% of the FG positive cells in the DRGs were also positive for PAR 2, and PAR 2was broadly expressed across all sizes of DRG neurones innervating the knee joint. 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH 2caused a signicant increase in ring rate in joint afferent neurones during both normal and noxious rotation over a time period of 15 min. This effect could be blocked by pre-treatment with SB366791 (p \\0.05 compared to 2-fu- royl-LIGRL-NH 2alone, using two way ANOVA). In conclusion, PAR 2 is expressed in joint sensory neurones and activation of PAR 2causes sensitization of these afferents via a TRPV1-dependent mechanism. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

It is under glutamate- inducedplasticity occurring after prolonged pain stimuli which leads to neu- ron hypersensitivity. CeA pain stimulated/inhibited for mGluR7 and mGluR8 receptors respectively,have been locally administered within CeA and behavioural and electrophysiological changes have been investigated in models of inflammatory chronic pain. mGluR7 and mGluR8 receptors playdifferent, even opposite, actions on pain-control and induced changesin RVM. Moreover, mGluR7 shows to function only under normal conditions whereas mGluR8 requires a chronic pain-induced plas- ticity to play as Having mGluR7 mGluR7 antagonist, Inflamm.

Consistently with pain behaviour responses, (S)- 3,4-DCPG inhibited ON and increased OFF cell activities whereas AMN082 increased the ON and reduced the OFF cell activity. MPIPPalso changed the ON and OFF cell activity, consistently withbehavioural analgesia. These results show that stimulation of mGluR8 and blockade of mGluR7 could be exploited for chronic pain control. Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-048 ANTIGEN-DRIVEN T CELL RESPONSE INDUCES PERIPHERAL ANALGESIAIN 1INSERM U1043, Toulouse, France Painful sensation is a hallmark of the inflammatory response induced by pathogens or tissue damage. A large spectrum of molecules released within the inflamed tissue such as neuropeptides, prosta- glandins or proteases induces pain by stimulating primary afferentneurons in situ. Activity of primary sensitive bers can be counter-acted by peripheral endogenous regulatory mechanisms involving local opioid release by leukocytes inltrating the inflammatory site. Since pain is an inherent component of inflammation often accom-panying immune response, we investigated the endogenous regulationof CFA-induced inflammatory pain in the context of adaptive T cell immune response. The nociceptive response to mechanical stimuli was studied using von Frey laments in mice immunized with OVAin CFA. The nociceptive response of nude versus wild type mice was dramatically increased, demonstrating T cell deciency associated with increased pain sensitivity. Based on adoptive transfer experi-ments of OVA-specic CD4 +T lymphocytes into nude mice, we show that antigen-specic activated but not resting T lymphocytes are responsible for the spontaneous relief of inflammation-induced pain following antigen challenge. The analgesia was dependent on opioidrelease by antigen-primed CD4 +T lymphocytes at the inflammatory site. T cell-mediated analgesia was inhibited by local injec- tion of an opioid receptor antagonist, unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Notably, we found opioid precursor mRNA to be thansevenfold increased in antigen-specic activated CD4 +T lympho- cytes, as compared to resting T lymphocytes in vivo. Taken together, our results show that CD4+T lymphocytes acquire anti-nociceptive effector properties when specically primed by antigen and point outanalgesia as a property linked to the effector phase of adaptive T cell response.

Cho1 1The Catholic University, Institute of Bone & Joint diseases, The Catholic Institute of Medical Science, Seoul, Korea, Republic OfObjective: Recent ndings based on basic and clinical research implicate important molecules and pathogenesis in rheumatoidarthritis (RA). However, there are still many unknown facts, due to the complexity of the disease and the numerous molecular players involved, and the integrated systems approach is needed to understandthis disease.Methods: A systems approach was performed to characterize the RA- associated lists of pathways, diagnostic markers, and therapeutic targets. Twelve global gene expression datasets obtained from thejoint tissues or cell lines of patients with RA and osteoarthritis wereanalyzed through data integration with orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization, functional enrichment, and network modeling process.Results: By the integrative analysis, we identied core RA-associatedgenes (RAGs). By mapping RAGs into functional pathways and diseases, we categorized key RA cellular processes, common patho- logical phenotypes, and their related diseases. Then, we reconstructednetworks describing key RA processes and their inter-relationships based on their protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction. From these network models, we established cell type dominant signature,anti-TNF-alpha therapy perturbed domain, and putative regulatorymechanisms. Finally, we predicted essential molecules that can con- trol or indicate such key processes. The list of potential markers and targets included 20 genes, which were selected based on the networksfrom RAGs identied from the integration of secretion data and cell/tissue specicity data. Conclusion: We introduce lists of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets identied using a systems approach. Also, suggested networkmodels and panel of essential molecules can shed novel insights into RA pathogenesis and also serve as an important resource for dis- covery of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

In contrast to p38 inhibitors, GLPG0259inhibited expression synovial tissue. GLPG0259 did block of JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinases, indicating cytokine/MMP release is mediated by a downstream kinase. In themouse CIA model, GLPG0259 reduced paw inflammation and bone destruction at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher. At 30 mg/kg, a well tol- erated dose, GLPG0259 Immunohistochemistry and in vivo imaging showed that GLPG0259 reduced the expression and activity of MMPs within affected joints. GLPG0259, an orally bio- available inhibitor of MAPKAPK5, has anti-inflammatory and boneprotecting activity similar to or better than other therapeutically rele- vant inhibitors, thereby showing potential as a rst-in-class candidatedrug for the treatment of RA.

Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover,Germany Background: IL-31 is a cytokine expressed by T cells following activation with cytokines or staphylococcal exotoxins. A major function of IL-31 in atopic dermatitis (AD) is the induction of pruritus in the skin. We recently showed that IL-31 induces pro-inflammatorycytokines following staphylococcal exotoxins stimulation in humanmacrophages. However, signalling pathways of IL-31 in activated human macrophages still remain unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the signalling pathways of IL-31 receptor in activatedmacrophages as well as role of IL-31 in modulation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) as well as b- actin levels were determined by means of Western blot analysis. IL-12 secretion was assessed by using an ELISA.Results: IL-31 activated strongly STAT-1 and 5 but not STAT-3 in human macrophages after 1/2 activation contributes to theunderlying mechanism of IL-12 suppression in macrophages. Thismechanism may be relevant in Th2 inflammatory responses and may help to develop therapeutic strategies in IL-31 associated diseases such as AD.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

(A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore,2Institute of Translational Medicine, Department of Molecular & Clinical Pharmacology, MRC Centre for Drug SafetyScience, University of Liverpool, Paz, Madrid, Spain,5Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Rockefeller University Hospital, Rockefeller University, New York, United States Endotoxin tolerance is dened as the failure to respond to endo- toxins as a result of prior exposure to low doses of endotoxin. Clinically, this is observed in monocytes/macrophages from sepsis patients and has been linked to sepsis-associated mortality. Gram-negative endotoxins (e.g. Lipid A, LPA) are recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which signals through two adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. The molecular mechanisms explaining endotoxin tolerance ispoorly understood. Using systems biology approach, we identify anovel molecular predicted a 'putative' TRIF- induced negative regulator(s) to mediate this event. Biochemical studies with TRIF-mutant macrophages identied that a functionalTRIF pathway triggers the expression of negative regulators of TLR4 signalling which induce endotoxin tolerance. In vivo studies conrmed TRIF-silencing to inhibit endotoxin tolerance as well as block mor-tality in a mouse sepsis model. Our ndings were also demonstrated inhuman monocytes, human natural mutants for TLR components (e.g. STAT1, UNC93B, MYD88) and in sepsis patient monocytes. These data demonstrate for the rst time a negative regulatory role of TRIF-dependant pathway in orchestrating sepsis-associated endotoxin tol-erance in mice and humans. Future targeting of TRIF-pathway may be helpful to modulate sepsis. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Recent study suggeststhat may enhance LPS/TLR4-dependent signaling and thus regulate LPS-induced inflammatory response. However, howPTEN plays its role in the TLR4-dependent signaling transduction pathway remains unclear till now. By performing immunoprecipita- tion assay we showed that PTEN was physically associated withTLR4 RAW264.7 cells after LPS stimulation. Interestingly, LPSstimulation also drove PTEN migrating to the cell membrane. This phenomenon suggested that interaction of PTEN with TLR4 may be involved in regulating TLR4-dependent signaling transduction path-way. In addition, LPS decreased the phosphorylation levels of PTEN,dephosphorylation of PTEN promotes its transfer to the cell mem- brane and induced its phosphatase activity to suppress Akt signaling, enhanced NF-kappa B activity and increased TNF-alpha production.This regulation was mediated by inhibiting Akt activity through lipidphosphatase of PTEN Conclusion: This study reveals that PTEN in plasma translocate to the cell membrane and binds with TLR4 is a critical step to initiate LPS/TLR4 dependent inflammatory response.

In vivoexperiments using Gal 3-decient mice emphasized the critical role of this protein in regulating inflammatory responses in bacterial inflammatory diseases, mostly mediated by bacterial lipopolysac-charides (LPS). Although it is well established that Gal 3 can interactwith LPS, the pathophysiological importance of LPS/Gal 3 interac- tions is not fully understood. We here demonstrate for the rst time that the interaction of Gal 3, either via its carbohydrate bindingC-terminal domain or via its N-terminal domain, with LPS from different bacterial strains, enhances the ability of LPS to activate neutrophils both in vitro and in vivo. Gal 3 allowed low LPS con-centrations (1 lg/ml without serum, 1 ng/ml with serum) to upregulate CD11b expression on human neutrophils in vitro and drastically enhanced the binding efciency of LPS to the neutrophil surface. These effects required LPS preincubation with Gal 3, beforeneutrophil stimulation and involved specic Gal 3/LPS interaction.A C-terminal Gal-3 fragment, which retained the lectin domain but lacked the N-terminal domain, was still able to bind both to E coli LPS and to neutrophils, but had lost the ability to enhance neutrophilresponse to LPS. This result emphasizes the importance of anN-terminus-mediated Gal 3 oligomerization induced by its interaction with LPS. Finally we demonstrated that Balb/c mice were moresusceptible to LPS-mediated shock when LPS was pretreated with Gal 3. Altogether, these results suggest that multimeric interactions between Gal-3 oligomers with LPS potentiates its declared. SOCS-1 INHIBITION OF MYD88 EXPRESSION CORRELATES WITH MILDERSEPSIS-INDUCED ALI IN DIABETIC RATS L. R. Filgueiras-JR1,*, J. O. Martins1, C. H. Serezani2,M .B .A . Montes1, S.

Our previous work showed that in ALI induced by instillation of LPS, the NFkB nucleartranslocation and cytokines production was reduced in diabetics. Inthe present study we investigated if the same occurs in ALI secondary to sepsis. Methods: Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by alloxan andsepsis by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP). After 6 h, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to measure cytokines by ELISA. Lung tissue was prepared for evaluation of edema, cellinltration (HE staining), Transforming growth Results: Morphological analysis of h of CLP showededema and mononuclear cell inltrate in the BAL and parenchyma.Remodeling was evaluated by the increased number of cells expressing TGF- banda-SMA. These parameters were lower in diabetics. Comparing the CLP with the sham operated group wefound that non-diabetics exhibited an anti inflammatory prole (high IL10, TGFb and COX-2 and low IL-1b and TNFa). In diabetics this polarization was not observed and the concentration of mediators wasmuch lower than in non-diabetics. Alveolar macrophages from dia-betics with sepsis compared to non diabetics show lower expression of MyD88 mRNA and overexpression of SOCs1 mRNA. Conclusion: The by CLP is characterizedby edema, mononuclear cell inltrate and signs of early remodeling.Concomitantly, the lung exhibited an anti inflammatory prole. These characteristics were less intense in diabetics. The impaired expression of MyD88 in macrophages from diabetics with sepsis can explain themilder lung inflammation observed in diabetics.Financial support: FAPESP and ACTIVATING PROTEASE (FSAP) ACTIVATION IN HUMAN INFLAMMATION:A SENSOR FOR CELL DEATH F.

Furthermore plasma FSAP is activated upon contact withapoptotic and necrotic cells by an assay detecting complexes between FSAP and C1-inhibitor, and FSAP activation in post-surgery patients, patients suffer- ing from severe sepsis, septic shock and meningococcal sepsis. Levels of FSAP-inhibitor complexes correlate with nucleosome levels andcorrelate with severity and mortality in these patients. These resultssuggest FSAP activation to be a sensor for cell death in circulation and that FSAP activation in sepsis might be involved in nucleosome release thereby contributing to lethality.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Therefore, we hypothesized that use of stable analogues of 20-HETEmay provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of septic shock. Totest this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a synthetic analog of 20-HETE, N-[20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoyl]glycine (5,14-HEDGE), on the ET-induced activity, peroxynitrite production, and COX-1/COX-2 and CYP4A1 protein expression in rats and mor-tality in mice. Blood pressure fell by 28 mmHg and heart rate rose by47 beats/min in male Wistar rats treated with sublethal dose of ET (10 mg/kg, i.p.). ET-induced fall in blood pressure was associated with increase in iNOS-hsp90 association, phosphorylated VASP,gp91 phox, p47phox, nitrotyrosine a COX-1 and CYP4A1 protein expression in heart, thoracic aorta, kidney and superior mesenteric artery, and elevated serum ni- trotyrosine levels. All of the ET-induced changes, except for COX-1protein expression, were prevented by 5,14-HEDGE given 1 h after ETinjection. Treatment of male Balb/c mice with 5,14-HEDGE 1 h after injection of ET raised the survival rate from 84 to 98%. A competitive antagonist of vasoconstrictor effects of 20-HETE, 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z),15(Z)-dienoic acid, prevented the effects of 5,14-HEDGE on the ET-induced changes, except for iNOS-hsp90 association. These data suggest that 5,14-HEDGE reverses hypotension and improves survivalduring endotoxemia, and may be regarded as a potential therapeuticagent in the treatment of septic shock.

Kalle1,*, Kasetty1,M o University, Lund,2Pharmacy, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Systemic infections leading to sepsis and septic shock are a major cause of mortality in intensive health care units. Gram-negative sepsis is accompanied by an overactivated innate immune response as well as excessive coagulation mainly induced by endoxins released fromthe bacteria.

OC-061 EFFECT OF NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION ON SEPSIS INDUCED AUTOPHAGY IN MICESEPTIC MODEL H. Iwasaka1,*, Y. Hagiwara1, Matsumoto1, Unit, Oita University, Oita, Japan Background: Autophagy is the process cells recycle their own non- essential, redundant, or damaged organelles and macromolecularcomponents. It is an adaptive response to sublethal stress, such as nutrient deprivation, that supplies the cell with metabolites it can use for fuel. The purpose of this study was to determine whether unbri-dled autophagy is related to sepsis induced organ dysfunction, andautophagy induced organ dysfunction can be compensated by nutri- tional intervention in mice cecal ligation and puncture model. Methods: All experiments were conducted in accordance with theInstitutional Care and Use Committee. Male C57BL/6 mice (20-23 g)were randomly allocated into four groups: Group C (sham operated), and Group S (food restriction for 12 h), Group CLP (cecal ligation and treated with 5% glucose subdermal injection). Elec- tron microscopic examination of liver were done for autophagosome and autolysosome detection. Immunoblotting of liver samples weredone for detection of LC3. Blood samples were also examined such asALT, AST, blood glucose, NEFA, and HMGB1. Statistical differ- ences were determined by ANOVA and repeated measured ANOVA, followed by Dennett's test.Result: AST, ALT and HMGB1 levels were highest in the Group CLPamong the other groups; however, the Group CLP + 5%G was sig- nicantly lower than the Group CLP. On the other hand, autophagic levels detected by microscope and Immunoblotting was signicantlyincreased in both Group S and Group CLP than other groups.Conclusion: The results of our study show that autophagy was induced with cecal ligation and puncture model like as food restric- tion, and excessive autophagy may cause sepsis induced liverdamage. 5% glucose administration can restore excess autophagy and liver damage. Nutritional intervention may improve autophagy associated organ dysfunction in several critical states.Disclosure of interest: None declared.OC-062 EVALUATION OF THE MINIMAL STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE GALACTOFURANOSE MOLECULE CAPABLE TO STIMULATE THEPHAGOCYTIC ACTIVITY AND EXACERBATES LETHALITY IN SEPTIC MICE G.

GFB-Me and GFB-Me-5,6-IPP increased signicantly the mortality rate of septic mice. However,GFB-Me started killing earlier than GFB-Me-5,6-IPP. The treatment with GFB-Me elevated signicantly the levels of all cytokines evaluated (TNF- a,I L - 1b, IL-6 and IL-10). Both molecules were able to exacerbate mortality by sepsis in mice by a mechanism that depends on an increasedlevels of cytokines. These results reinforce the relevance of galactofur- anosyl epitopes as components of pathogens and its virulence. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Le Interne et centre de re \u00b4fe\u00b4rence directed at human VSMC inpatients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) with or without PAH and idi-opathic PAH (iPAH), and characterize their target antigens and their function . Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterizedby a remodelling of pulmonary arteries with vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) proliferation. Methods: Indirect immunofluorescence immunoblotting anti-VSMC in sera from healthy controls(HC) and patients with SSc without PAH, SSc-associated PAH (SSc- PAH) and iPAH. Target were then immunoblotting, then mass spectrometry. Finally, we analysed of collagen matrix containing VSMC and sera HC or the corresponding antibodies and 1-D immunoblotting. Then, 2-Dimmunoblots revealed a number of protein spots of interest and targetantigens were identied by mass spectrometry, including stress- induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), vimentin, a-enolase and proteins involved in smooth muscle contraction. Anti-STIP1 antibodies weredetected by ELISA in sera from 84, 76 and 24% of patients with SSc without PAH, SSc-PAH and iPAH, respectively, versus from 3% of HC. Finally, IgG from SSc-PAH and iPAH patients were able toincrease the contraction of VSMC in a collagen matrix as compared toIgG from HC, particularly when VSMC were pre-activated in the presence of TNF-a. Conclusion: We identied antibodies in the serum with SSc-PAH and iPAH. These antibodies might be path-ogenic by modulating vascular contraction. Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-064 INCREASED TH17 RESPONSE RELATED TO FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN CD4 + CD161 + CELLS IN GIANT CELLARTERITIS AND University Hospital, Dijon, France Th17 lymphocytes have recently been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). In this study, we investigatedTh1, Th17 and Treg immune responses in 21 patients suffering fromGCA (n =14) or polymyalgia rheumatica (PR) (n =7), at diagnosis and after 3 months of steroid treatment and in comparison with 24 age matched healthy volunteers. As human Th17 cells exclusively derivefrom CD4 +CD161+cells, we also assessed the quantitative and quali- tative characteristics of these cells. In comparison with control group, patients revealed decrease in Treg (3.23 vs. 4.71%; p=0.0003) and Th1 cells (10.93 vs. in Th17 cells (0.95 vs. 0.36%; p\\0.0001). Patients had also of IL-6 (70.69 vs. 12.37 pg/mL; p\\0.0001). No difference was detected between GCA and PR patients. A dramatic inltration by Th17and Th1 cells with no presence of Treg was detected in positive tem-poral artery biopsies (TAB). No sign of immune imbalance was observed in negative TAB. After treatment, there was a signicant decrease in the percentages of Th1 ( p=0.0034) and Th17 cells (p=0.0007) whereas the percentage of Treg did not change. The functional analysis showed that CD4 +CD161+cells from patients were able to produce signicantly more IL-17 than those from controls irrespective of culture conditions (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2 with orwithout IL-1 b, IL-23, TGF- b). The level of STAT1 phosphorylation was lower in patients than controls ( p=0.0009) with no difference in STAT3. After treatment, there was a dramatic decrease in IL-17 pro-duction in all the conditions, a downregulation and an upregulation of phosphorylated STAT1 (p=0.0193). This study demonstrates for the rst time a decrease in Treg and conrms the increase in Th17 cells in GCA and PR patients,which is related to functional modications of CD4 +CD161+cells due to different phosphorylation proles and Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-065 LACK OF IL-17RA SIGNALING PREVENTS AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATION OF THE JOINT AND GIVE RISE TO A TH2-LIKE PHENOTYPE INCOLLAGEN-INDUCED Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands This study was performed to examine the role of the IL-17RA sig- naling in the development of CIA. Here we show that CII-immunizedcontrol mice developed CIA from day 24 onwards with an incidence between 40 and 60%. As expected, the IL-23p19 -/-mice did not develop CIA. Interestingly, the IL-17RA -/-mice were completely protected and did not develop CIA even after a third CII/CFAinjection. In contrast to the low percentage of IL-17 +CD4+T cells in the IL-23p19 -/-mice, there was a signicant increase in the per- centage of these cells in the IL-17RA -/-group compared to the control group at day 69. No signicant difference was found in thepercentage of IFN-gamma +CD4+T cells between all three groups.Inflamm. Res. S57 123Interestingly and in contrast to the IL-23p19 knockout mice, the IL- 17RA decient showed a Th2-like phenotype in splenic CD4+T cells at day 69. No difference was noted for FoxP3 expression in the splenic CD4+T cells between the three different mouse groups. Moreover, the CII-specic IgG2a levels in the sera of IL-17RA -/- was signicantly lower compared to the control group at day 20 andlower although not statistically signicant at day 69. At this latter time point, CII-specic IgG1 levels in the sera of IL-17RA -/-was increased although not statistically signicant compared to the con-trol. In conclusion, these data revealed a critical role for the IL-17RAsignaling in the development of autoimmune inflammation of the joint. Moreover, these data show a Th2-like phenotype in IL- 17RA -/-mice immunized with CII, suggesting that IL-17 receptor signaling is involved in the suppression of Th2 cytokines in auto-immune collagen arthritis.

Treg cells produce a number of cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF- b, and can be charac- terized has been indicated as a molecule involved in Treg cell activity regulation in mice (Nocentini et al. 2007). Aim of our study was to investigate GITR expression in humanCD4 +T lymphocytes and its possible role in Treg cell function. Results indicate that a subset of CD4+T cells, characterized by GITR expression and low levels of CD25 expression (CD4+CD25low- GITR+), is present in peripheral blood representing a low percentage of the entire CD4+T cell population (0.32-1.43%). These cells show Treg cell features since they express FOXP3 at intermediate level, IL- 10 and TGF- b. Moreover, they are anergic and anergy is reversed by addition of IL-2. Most of CD4+CD25lowGITR+cells shows a memory phenotype. Functional experiments, performed by removal of this cell population, demonstrated that CD4+CD25lowGITR+cells have regu- latory activity comparable with that of CD4+CD25highcells. Moreover, similarly to CD4+CD25+murine Treg cells, anti-GITR Ab inhibited their activity. Taken together, these data indicate that human CD4+CD25lowGITR+cells represent a new Treg cell population.

Hausman1, B. Kempton1 1Oregon Hearing Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, United States It is generally assumed that autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) is caused by cochlear inflammation and glucocorticoids restore hearingby immunosuppression. However, little attention has been given to the susceptibility of cochlear ion and water transport pathways in AIED and steroid control over their recovery. Therefore, MRL/lprautoimmune disease mice were evaluated to determine how systemicdisease and glucocorticoid treatment affect the ion homeostasis mechanisms in the ear. Mice were tested for hearing at either 2 months of age (prior to disease, N =8) or 6 months of age (after hearing loss onset, N =7). Additional 6 month old mice (N =8) were given oral prednisolone for 2 weeks. Inner ears from all were collected for qRT-PCR of 24 genes responsible for endolymph homeostasis, including channels for transport of sodium, potassium,chloride, and water, as well as tight junctions and gap junctions. Mice developed hearing loss at 6 months and 22 of the 24 cochlear ion and water transport genes were signicantly downregulated. Inflammatorycytokine genes were actually suppressed in the ear, not elevated.Steroid treatment signicantly increased expression of several homeostasis genes, including the potassium channel Kcne1, the epi- thelial sodium channel, several gap junction proteins (Gja1, Gjb2,Gjb6), and aquaporin 3, all of which are involved in K +transport and endolymph production. Steroid treatment had no signicant effect on inflammatory gene expression in the cochlea. It was concluded that circulating autoantibodies and immune complexes may cause hearingloss by disrupting the blood labyrinth barrier and genes required for endolymph homeostasis. Steroid treatment appeared to improve hearing by restoring these homeostatic genes without impactinginflammation. This provides new insight into one potential mecha-nism of AIED and how glucocorticoid therapies may help to restore hearing. [Supported by NIH-NIDCD DC05593].

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of TGF- bon IL-13 expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from SSc patients (n =8) compared to healthy donors (n=10). Jurkat cell line was used as a Th2 model. Cells were treated or not with TGF- b5 ng/ml for 2-48 h in the presence or not of inhibitors for Smad and MAPkinase pathways. Quantication of IL- 13 mRNA mRNA stability were studied by real-time PCR. cells mobility results showed that TGF- binhibited IL-13 mRNA steady state levels by 20-40% without affecting mRNA stability in Jurkat cells andPBLs form healthy donors. Inhibition of IL-13 production involved both Smad- and p38-dependent pathways and repression of GATA-3 transcription factor binding capacity to IL-13 promoter. In contrast tothe inhibition detected in Jurkat cells and healthy PBLs, TGF- b increased IL-13 mRNA and protein expression by 35-43% in PBLs from SSc patients as compared to PBLs from healthy donors. Thisstudy demonstrates that TGF- bdownregulates IL-13 production via GATA-3 as a consequence of signaling through both Smad and p38 pathways in physiological situation whereas it becomes potent activator in SSc pathological situation. Inhibition of GATA-3expression or its IL-13 promoter-DNA binding ability might provide anew approach for SSc treatment. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

C. Lenzo1, J. A. Hamilton1 1Medicine, The University Of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia Even though there are clinical trials assessing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) blockade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), questions remain as to how GM-CSF acts as a proinflammatory cytokine. For the regulation of arthritis progression by GM-CSF theaims of this study were to determine (1) whether there are systemiceffects, (2) the changes in synovial tissue leukocyte populations and (3) the arthritis model dependence on GM-CSF. The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and K/BxN serum transfer arthritis models were tested inGM-CSF -/-mice and/or wild-type mice using an anti-GM-CSF mAb. Cell populations were assessed by differential staining and flow cytometry. GM-CSF blockade, while ameliorating CIA development, was found to have systemic effects, limiting the increase in circulatingLy6C himonocytes and neutrophils. GM-CSF blockade (both synovial macrophages (both Ly6Chiand Ly6Clo) were again reduced, along with the peak disease severity and maintenance. Thus GM-CSF is a key player in two arthritis models, participating in inter-actions between hemopoietic cells, locally and even systemically, tocontrol myeloid cell number as well as presumably to ''activate'' them. These results could be useful for the analysis of the current clinical trials targeting GM-CSF in RA.Disclosure of interest: None declared.OC-070 INFLAMMATORY Univ. Toronto, Toronto, Canada The cellular and molecular events preceding the initial activation of autoreactive CD8 T cells in several autoimmune diseases remain unclear. Recent reports have implicated IL-6, IL-21 and IL-7 in the triggering of autoreactive CD8 T cells in mouse models of autoim-mune diseases. We have shown that IL-21 and IL-6 synergize withIL-7 or IL-15 to induce antigen-independent proliferation of naive CD8 T cells, with a concomitant increase in antigen responsiveness. We postulated that the cytokine-induced augmentation of TCR sen-sitivity of CD8 T cells by low afnity self antigens. Here, we show that cytokine priming enables naive TCR transgenic CD8 T cells to respond to low afnity TCR ligands,resulting in proliferation and display of effector functions. We have used a transgenic mouse model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes to show that cytokine-primed autoreactive CD8 T cells acquire thecapacity to cause disease following stimulation with weak TCRagonists, and that the diabetogenic potential of these cells is depen- dent on the continuous availability of IL-15. These ndings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which inflammatory cytokinescould contribute to the triggering of autoreactive CD8 T cells and thushave important implications for autoimmune diseases associated with microbial infections and chronic inflammation.

Mixed monocytes and CD14+CD16-both generated high levels IL-6 in co-culture, whereas CD14+CD16+ Addition of recombinant IL-6 to CD14+ CD16+ cocultures also reduced the level of neutrophil recruitment. These observations sug-gest that IL-6 plays a role in crosstalk between monocyte subsets and is capable of modulating the inflammatory response of endothelial cells.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-072 INTERLEUKIN-18 FACILITATES NEUTROPHIL HUMAN COLONICEPITHELIA VIA MLCK-DEPENDENT DISRUPTION OF TIGHT JUNCTIONAL OCCLUDIN T. K. Lapointe1,*, A. G. Buret1 1Biological Sciences, Inflammation Research Network, University Of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Compromised epithelial barrier function and tight junction altera- tions are hallmarks of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Several studies have identied a role for proinflammatory cytokines such asTNFaand INF cin epithelial barrier defects observed in the context of IBD. Interleukin (IL)-18 is the latest member of the IL-1 family of cytokines to be identied. Elevated levels of IL-18 have been reported in mucosal tissue from IBD patients. Furthermore, neu-tralization of IL-18 was shown to reduce disease severity in severalmurine models of colitis, suggesting a role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of IBD. Nevertheless, the role of IL-18 in intestinal epithelial barrier function remains unclear. The major aims of ourstudy were to determine the effect of IL-18 on epithelial tightjunction structure and function, and to investigate the mechanism involved in this process. Colonic epithelial Caco-2 monolayers were challenged with IL-18 (50 ng/mL) for 24 h and samples were pro-cessed for immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and permeability measurements. Our ndings treatment IL-18 selectively disrupts tight junctional occludin, without affecting thedistribution of claudin-4 or -5. This effect is accompanied by asignicant increase in the expression and activity level of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Further experiments revealed that inhibition of MLCK by ML9 prevents IL-18-induced loss ofoccludin protein levels. Structural alterations induced by IL-18coincided with a signicant increase in neutrophil migration across Caco-2 monolayers, without affecting IBD by facilitating neutro- phil transepithelial RECEPTOR BIOACTIONS L.

The biological properties of resolvins are mediated via specicG-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

Importantly, this action ofRvD1 was no longer observed in ALX/FPR2 null mice, indicating thecrucial role of this GPCR in RvD1 mediated PMN responses in the mouse. RvD1 (1 and 10 nM) also displayed potent actions on human PMN recruitment to endothelial cells under shear conditions, RvD1signicantly reduced PMN capture, rolling and adhesion quantied using an in vitro flow chamber system. Interestingly, receptor specic antibodies blocked these anti-inflammatory actions of RvD1, with lowconcentrations being sensitive to GPR32 blockade, whilst the highconcentration appeared to be ALX/FPR2-specic. Together these results indicate that RvD1 acts via both GPCRs to regulate and prevent overzealous PMN recruitment to sites of inflammation. Defectivemechanisms and pathways in resolution may underlie our currentunderstanding of the inflammatory phenotype(s) that characterize some prevalent human diseases. Mapping these resolution circuits can provide innovative drug discovery opportunities for inflammatorypathologies.

OC-074 THE ADAPTOR LNK (SH2B3) IS A KEY REGULATOR OF INFLAMMATORY- AND INTEGRIN-SIGNALING CELL DYSFUNCTION B. Charreau1,*, belongs to a family of SH2-containing proteins and is a signaling adaptor molecule that plays regulatory functions in thehomeostasis and proliferation of immune cells. We previously showed that Lnk is expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and phosphorylated in response to TNF (1, 2) .We further demonstrated that, in EC, Lnk is a negative regulator of TNF signaling that inhibits E-selectin and VCAM-1expression decreases VCAM-1 expression in TNF a-treated ECs. In the present study we show that integrin ligation, using anti-CD29 Abs, also promotes Lnk activation andregulation in EC whereas integrin-mediated signaling (Akt and GSK3 b phosphorylation) consecutive to CD29 ligation is abrogated in EC when Lnk is not expressed. We found that Lnk binds to ILK and activates FAK and paxillin. Overall, Lnk causes F-actin stress bers, cytoskeletonreorganization and increases both the number and density of focal adhesions. Functionally, Lnk expression dramatically increases EC adhesion, slows down EC migration and inhibits apoptosis induced byano\u00a8kis. Transfection of mutants and a molecular partner of Lnk mediating the negative regulation of EC migration. Thus, the adaptor Lnk is an effective key regulator of inflammatory- and integrin-signaling controlling EC activation, migra-tion and death, all critical in vascular remodeling and regeneration. Ourcurrent work in animal models also proposes to modulate Lnk in graft EC to provide a cytoprotective signal in organ transplantation. (1) Boulday G. et al.Circ. Res.

Kataoka1 1Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, KOBE University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan Phospholipase C e(PLCe) is an effector of Ras and Rap small GTP- ases. We have for the rst time shown by using PLC e-decient mice that PLC eplays a critical role in the induction of cytokine production in non-immune cells in a variety of inflammatory reactions, such asthose involved in tumor promotion. The role of PLC ein tumorigen- esis is suggested also in humans by recent genome-wide studies that have identied SNPs in the PLC egene (PLCE1) as a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Here, to further investigate its role in inflammation, we create transgenic mice overexpressing PLC ein epidermal keratinocytes. The transgenic mice spontaneously develop chronic skin inflammationsharing the features of human psoriasis, such as adherent silvery scale formation and aberrant inltration of IL-22-producing CD4 +T cells. The keratinocytes in the PLC etransgenic mice highly produce IL-23, which the skin symptom development depends on as demonstrated bythe reversion of the skin phenotype upon its neutralization. Impor- tantly, overproduction of IL-23 is induced even in wild-type keratinocytes in vitro by stimulating with the conditioned mediumfrom those overexpressing PLC e. These results suggest that increased IL-23 expression in the PLC etransgenic mouse skin is mediated by certain autocrine/paracrine factors secreted by PLC BACTERIAL KILLING OF PSEUDOMONASAERUGINOSA D. of Florida, Gainesville, United States,4Universite \u00b4Paris 7 Denis Diderot, Paris, France A decit in early lung clearance of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a), is suspected to be key in nosocomial pneumonia or inInflamm.

Although Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR5 are respectively implicated in the recognition of LPS and flagellin of P.aand in the control of lung infections, very little is known about their roles in the early activation of alveolar macrophages (AMs). Here, we show that flagellin/flagellum-TLR5 interaction is essential to induce P.aclearance by AMs. In contrast to WT PAK (a wild-type P.a strain),unflagelled PAK strain or a strain expressing a flagellin mutated into TLR5-recognition site were not killed by either MH-S cells or primary AMs. We showed reduced uptake of unflagelled or flagellin-mutatedPAK in MH-S cells and primary AMs, when compared to WT PAK.Furthermore, primary AMs from TLR5 -/-mice were unable to kill PAK, when compared to primary AMs from WT mice. A decit in PAK phagocytosis by primary TLR5 -/-AMs was also observed. The importance of recognition by TLR5 for AM-mediated clearance of PAKis recapitulated in vivo in mice. We showed that TLR5-mediated PAK recognition and uptake by AMs were associated with high IL-1 bsyn- thesis, which was reduced with PAK mutants or with primaryTLR5 -/-AMs. We demonstrated that IL-1 brelease was associated with the ability to kill PAK since adding recombinant IL-1RA inhibited signicantly the early clearance of PAK by AMs. In conclusion, wedemonstrated for the rst time that TLR5 plays a major role in the earlyclearance of P.a by AMs and that the flagellum-TLR5 interaction is required for effective phagocytosis of P.a and for the induction of IL-1 b synthesis.

Bouchard1, (2-AG) activates human neutrophils independently of CBreceptor activation. We found the effects of 2-AG were mediated by anautocrine activation loop involving arachidonic acid (AA) and its subsequent metabolism to leukotriene (LT) B 4. In the present study, we tested whether 2-AG and AA could also stimulate neutrophil functionslinked to host defense, more specically the release of microbicidalpeptides as well as their bacterial and virucidal activities. Results: We initially tested if AA and 2-AG were triggering the release of the microbicidal peptides a-defensins and LL-37. We found that both 2-AG and AA stimulated the release of a large amount ( lg) ofa-defensins as well as a limited amount (ng) of LL-37. This release occurred rapidly and paralleled the biosynthesis of LTB 4. Impor- tantly, the supernatants the growth Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus . Importantly, all the effects of AA and 2-AG mentioned above wereprevented by inhibiting the protein antagonist 4 receptor 1 with CP 105,696. Conclusion: The rapid conversion of 2-AG to their sub- sequent metabolism into LTB 4promote 2-AG and AA as multifunctional activators of neutrophils, mainly exerting their effectsby activating the LTB 4receptor 1. The low concentration of AA or 2-AG needed to impair HSV-1 infectiveness likely reflects the physiological importance 2-AG and AA might have in promoting hostdefense in vivo ( supported by grants to NF from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engi- neering Research Council of Canada ).

Phagocytosis amplication induced by TLR3 ligand was a time-dependent, fact not observed for TLR2 and TLR4ligands. AMs treatment with zileuton also impaired TLR4 ligand-induced phagocytosis amplication, suggesting the participation of 5-LO products in this phenomenon.

Increased sPLA2 activity has been documented in several inflammatory disorders and the expression of the sPLA2 groups IIA, III, V and X has been detected in human ath-erosclerotic lesions, indicating that sPLA2s are an important linkbetween lipids and inflammation, both involved in atherosclerosis. This pathology linked to chronic inflammation of the arterial wall is characterized by the accumulation of Low-Density Lipoproteins(LDL) and foamy cells within the subendothelial space. Recently the presence of dentritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen pre- senting cells in atherosclerotic lesions raised the question abouttheir role in disease progression. We have previously shownthat modied lipoproteins can modulate DC function, interfering with their ability to stimulate T cells. In this study, we show that hGX-sPLA2-treated LDL induced DC maturation resulting in acharacteristic mature DC phenotype and in enhanced DC ability toactivate IFN csecretion from T cells. hGX-sPLA2 phospholipolysis of LDL produced high levels of lipid mediators, such as lysophospha- tidylcholine and free fatty acids, which also modulated DCmaturation. Our results indicate that hGX-sPLA2 can induceDC maturation, both directly by hydrolyzing PC from cell mem- branes and indirectly by LDL phospholipolysis, though resulting in different cytokine secretion proles, pointing to differential modula-tion of DC function. In conclusion, the secretion of hGX-sPLA2 in inflamed tissues may contribute to the local activation of DC through the production of lipid mediators from LDL and/or cell plasmamembranes.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Fierro1,* 1Farmacologia e Psicobiologia, Universidade Do Estado Do Rio De de Introduction: (LX) and 15-epi-lipoxins well recognized anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution activities, although little is known about themechanisms that trigger these effects. We investigated the role of ATL-1, a synthetic analog of 15-epi-lipoxin A 4, on the followed by treatment with 12 h to investigate heme oxygenase (HO)-1 a western blot was evaluated using RT-PCR analysis and westernblot assay. MCP-1 levels were determined by ELISA in cells ously treated with SB203580 or SnPPIX, a HO-1 inhibitor, followed by treatment with ATL-1 and LPS stimulation for 24 h.Results: We characterized ALX expression in U937 cells, via theassessment of gene expression and protein. The receptor functionality was conrmed through the analysis of ERK-2 activation, which makes this cell line a suitable tool to study the mechanism of action ofLX on monocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATL-1 increases the expression of HO-1 in U937 cells via activation of p38 MAPK and decreases the secretion of MCP-1, a chemokine involvedin the recruitment of monocytes the focus, in LPS-stimulated U937 cells. MCP-1 inhibition by ATL-1 was reverted by SB203580 indicating that this effect is dependent on the activation of the p38 study claries some of the mechanisms involved in the activation of monocytes by LX and may lead to new approaches for the control of different pathologies where the inflammatory compo-nent is relevant.

Camara1 1Immunology, University Of Sao Paulo,2Nephrology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo,3Pathology, Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, Brazil The chronic renal failure is an immune mediated disease character- ized by renal brosis. The injured tissue releases molecules, such as uric acid, resulting from extracellular matrix degradation or dying cells, which can activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and leads totranslocation MyD88 in many cell types. This immune system mod- ulation interferes in the macrophage and TCD4 + cell activity, with the Th1/Th2 paradigm considered a possible effector mechanism ofbrosis.Objective: We aimed to investigate the role of uric acid signaling via TLR 2, TLR 4 and MyD88 and the function of M1/M2 macrophage in the development of renal brosis.Methods: We used the Unilateral Ureter Obstruction (UUO), wherethe animals were sacriced at 7 days after the surgery. Some animals were treated with allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Protein- hydroxyproline were culture was supplemented with uric acid and assay. Results: UUO increases macrophage entrance in obstructed kidneys, as seen by flow cytometry. IL-12 KO mice presented higher levels of TGF-bcompared to WT mice. Besides, TGF- band type 1 collagen mRNA was decreased in TLRs KO mice, compared to WT mice. Allopurinol treated animals showed preserved renal function and decreased brosis formation. MyD88 KO mice showed a renal protection. Uric acidstimulated pro-brotic cytokines production by hydroxyproline Conclusion: Uric acid crystals are responsible to stimulate Th2immune response, which leads to brosis. This suggests future ther-apeutic strategies against renal brosis should be based on uric acid formation blockage and nally, in the Th1/Th2 balance.

Bertrand-Michel2, P. Le Faouder2, G. Barbara3, of Bologna, Bologna, Italy Transient Potential Receptor Vanilloid (TRPV4), a calcium channel can be activated in vitro by arachidonic acid metabolites. We havepreviously reported that TRPV4 activation hyper- sensitivity in response to colorectal distension (CRD) in mice. However, the potential endogenous activators of TRPV4 present inthe digestive tract as well as the potential role of this receptorchannel in the context of IBS still have to be addressed. As we have previously reported, we have used supernatants of incubated biopsies from IBS patients to induce hypersensitivity symptoms in mice. 4Biopsies from control and IBS patients were immersed in Hank'ssolution. Groups of mice received intracolonically (IC) biopsy supernatant. Abdominal muscle contractions in response to CRD were recorded before and 3 h after biopsy supernatant administra-tion. The same approach was used in mice that had receivedintrathecal injections of TRPV4 SiRNA. Lipids from mouse colon treated with DSS to induce colitis were extracted and EET, HETE and diHETE quantied by mass spectrometry after HPLC. In a lastset of experiments, the extracted metabolites were tested on calcium mobilization response in HEK-TRPV4 transfected cells and on sensory neurons harvested from mouse dorsal root ganglia. Wedetected an increase of EET and HETE in DSS treated mice. Onlythe 5,6-EET provoked an increase in calcium flux in HEK-TRPV4 cells. Metabolite extracts from mouse colon and 5,6-EET also induced calcium signal in sensory neurons. Intracolonic administra-tion of supernatants from IBS induced visceral hypersensitivity inresponse to CRD in mice. Three days after SiRNA treatment, the hypersensitivity to CRD distention induced by IBS patient biopsy supernatants was inhibited. Our study shows that TRPV4 agonists arepresent in the mouse colon and increased under colitis. TRPV4activation plays a central role in IBS patient biopsy supernatants- induced visceral hypersensitivity.Disclosure of CROSS-TALK BETWEEN ADIPOCYTES AND ENDOTHELIAL CELLS IN A 3D CULTURE MODEL V. Pellegrinelli1,*, C. Paris, France Introduction: Obesity, a chronic inflammatory status, is associated with a cellular remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT) with the presenceof inflammatory cells [1]. Visceral WAT which hypertrophy is asso-ciated with metabolic complications, is more vascularized and inflammatory than subcutaneous WAT [2]. We hypothesized that endothelial cells from the visceral WAT through their inflammatorysecretions could alter adipocyte biological functions.Methods: To reproduce tissue architecture, we developed a new experimental 3D model where human mature adipocytes are included in a peptidic hydrogel. In this 3D gel, the adipocytes maintained theirmetabolic functions including adipokine secretion (leptin and adipo-nectin) for 1 week. We performed co-culture of these cells both isolated from visceral WAT of obese subjects in our 3D experimental design. Results: Endothelial cells provoke a decrease of adipokine secretions(-50% for and -20% for adiponectin, highlighted the increased secretion of IGFBP-3 in these experimental conditions. Conclusion: Increased secretion of cytokines and chemokines as conversely decreased secretion of the anti-inflam-matory adiponectin could perpetuate a vicious cycle in hypertrophied and inflammatory WAT. Inflammation and angiogenesis being inter- related processes, G-CSF, CXCL-8 and IGFBP-3, all involved inendothelial precursor recruitment, could promote neovascularization contributing to tissue repair.

OC-086 EVIDENCE BIOCHIP ARRAYS FOR THE MULTIPLEX ANALYSIS OF BIOMARKERSRELATED TO METABOLIC SYNDROME AND INFLAMMATION R. McConnell1, M. Rodriguez1, Inflamm. 123Inflammation is frequently associated part in physiological processes such as insulin secretion, glucose regulation, fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, iron homeostasis, energy homeostasis/endocrine regulation, brin regulation. Other molecules involved in theinflammation response are the adhesion molecules. Biochip array tech- nology enables the determination of multiple analytes from a single sample and this approach offers more information than single analytedetermination as provides a patient's prole at a single point in time. Thisis illustrated here with examples of analytical parameters of biochip arrays for the determination of analytes related to the and inflam- mation. Simultaneous chemiluminescent immunoassays are of capture ligands dene thediscrete test areas for each of the analytes each biochip (9 99m m ) . The immunoassays were applied to the Evidence Investigator TMana- lyser. The MetS Array I enables the adiponectin, CRP and cyst- atin C pg/ml (IL-1 a)t o\\1m g / intra-assay and inter-assay precision,expressed as %CV, were typically \\15%. The adhesion molecules array allows simultaneous measurement of the soluble forms of L-, P-, E-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 with analytical sensitivity valuesranging from (E-Sel) to 4.1 ng/ml (VCAM-1) for neat sample.The data indicate applicability of biochip array technology to the mul- tiplex determination of a broad range of biomarkers with the generation of quantitative patient proles.

Resolution and inflammatory concert (SY09) OC-087 ANTI-ALLERGIC CROMONES INHIBIT HISTAMINE AND EICOSANOID RELEASE FROM MAST CELLS THROUGH AN ANNEXIN 1DEPENDENT MECHANISM S. Yazid1,*, V. Calder2, R. Flower1 1Biochemical Pharmacology, Queen Mary University Of London, London,2University College London, London, United Kingdom Mast cells, basophils and eosinophils represent the rst line of host defence in allergic inflammation reaction. We investigated the mecha-nism by which the anti-allergic drugs di-sodium cromoglycate andsodium nedocromil histamine and eicosanoid release from human mast cells (HMCs) as well as peripheral blood basophils (PBBs) using biochemical techniques. Cord derived HMCs were cultured invitro and PBBs obtained from human donors or cardiac puncture in mice.Subsequent antigen challenged led to a prompt release of histamine and prostaglandin D 2(PGD 2), which was inhibited by cromoglycate, nedo- cromil, cromoglycate or nedocromil induced a rapid phosphorylation on the Ser 27residue of Anx-A1, hence its secretion, secondary to inhibition of phosphatase activity and activation of PKC.Treatment of the HMCs or PBBs with a specic neutralising anti-Anx-A1 (but not irrelevant) monoclonal antibodies reversed the inhibitory effect of these drugs on histamine and PGD 2-released. To highlight the crucial importance of Anx-A1 in this rapid effect of these drugs we testedthe effect of nedocromil in Anx-A1 null mice. Cromones did not inhibit the release of histamine nor prostaglandin D2 from basophils from Anx-A1 null mice.To translate these new ndings clinically, we have ana- lyzed Anx-A1 pattern of expression in tears from patients with Vernal Kerato Conjuntivitis (VKC). While this seasonal disease is associatedwith an increased amount of the clipped- or inactive- form of Anx-A1,VKC patients treated with the cromoglycate-like Alomide Lodoxa- mide) show an augmentation of the total-or active- form of the protein. Altogether, the use of in vitro, in vivo investigations and the translationaloutcome of VKC allergic disease, suggest strongly the anti-inflamma-tory Anx-A1 protein to be a component of rapid cromone actions on mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.

Schif-Zuck1 1Department of Biology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel,2Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, United States,3Department of Pathology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy Background: The engulfment of apoptotic leukocytes (efferocytosis) by macrophages during the resolution of inflammation is essential for homeostasis and results in macrophage reprogramming/immune-silencing. Materials and methods: To characterize pro-resolving properties by was used, distinct macrophage subpopulations. Sorted CD11b highand CD11blowmacrophages were analyzed for protein markers by Western blot, efferocytic scores using fluorescentmicroscopy, and secretion of cytokines ex vivo ELISA.Results: Here, we show to CD11blow ones and stop efferocytosing apoptotic reaching an engulfmentthreshold in vivo. In addition, CD11b lowmacrophages are distinct from either M1 or M2 in their protein expression signature and express pro- resolving properties ,such as diminished responses to different TLR ligands ex vivo and propensity to emigrate from resolving inflammationsites to lymphoid organs. Of interest, we found the pro-resolving lipidmediators resolvin (Rv) E1 and RvD1, as dexamethasone(Dex), to enhancesatiated-efferocytosis and consequently CD11b lowmacrophage conversion whereas genetic deciency in the chemokine scavenging receptor delayed satiation and reduced immune-silencing of macro- phages, and inhibits their departure from resolving inflammation sites. Conclusions: We suggest satiated-efferocytosis is a novel phagocyteproperty displayed by CD11b lowmacrophages and regulated by pro- resolving mediators. Moreover, satiated-efferocytosis is required for CD11blowmacrophage emigration from resolving inflammation sites and the return of tissue homeostasis. Thus, satiated-efferocytosis isessential for the completion of timely- and spatially-coordinated resolution of acute inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res.

Arita1,* 1Department of Health Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Acute inflammation in healthy individuals is self-limiting and has an active termination program. The mechanisms by which acute inflammation is resolved are still of interest. In murine zymosan-induced peritonitis, we found that eosinophils are recruited to the inflamed loci during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. In vivo depletion of eosinophils caused a resolution decit,namely impaired lymphatic drainage with reduced appearance ofphagocytes carrying engulfed zymosan in the draining lymph node, and sustained numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in inflamed tissues. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrome-try of the resolving exudatesrevealed that locally activated eosinophils in the resolution phase produced 12/15-lipoxygenase-derived lipid mediators including protectin D1 (PD1) from docosahexaenoic acid. resolutiondecit caused by eosinophil depletion was rescued by eosinophil restoration or the administration of PD1. Eosinophils decient in 12/15-lipoxygenase were unable to rescue the resolution pheno-type. The present results indicate that eosinophils and eosinophil-derived lipid mediators including PD1 have a role in promoting the resolution of acute inflammation, expanding the roles of eosinophils in host defense and resolution.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Damps and AIM2INFLAMMASOMES THROUGH RELEASE OF PRODUCTS INTO THE CYTOSOL S. Kailasan Vanaja1,*, V. and Physiological Systems,2Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, United States Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) induces elevated levels of IL-1beta in infected patients. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of IL-1beta by EHEC are unknown. In- flammasomes are multiprotein complexes in the cytosol that processproIL-1beta to IL-1beta. identify the in IL-1beta induction by EHEC, we infected macrophages derived from wild type and mice decient in inflammasome compo-nents with EHEC and analyzed the processing and release of matureIL-1beta. EHEC-induced IL-1beta production was dependent on caspase-1 and the adaptor ASC. Notably, both NLRP3, a cytosolicsensor for microbial and endogenous products, and AIM2, a cytosolic sensor for DNA, were absolutely essential for EHEC-induced IL- 1beta production. Though EHEC is a non-cytosolic pathogen, bac-terial products such as DNA were observed in the cytosol of infectedcells, providing a potential means by which cytosolic inflammasomes might be activated. This also indicated that phagosomal degradation of bacteria is a prerequisite for inflammasome activation by EHEC.Supporting this hypothesis, blocking lysosomal acidication and typeI interferon signaling that are essential for bacterial lysis in phago- some, led to a marked decrease in EHEC-induced IL-1beta secretion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EHEC potently activates multipleinflammasomes as a result of release of bacterial products fromphagosomes into the cytosol. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

(DENV) infection is the most important mosquito-borne disease on Earth. In the past few years, several studies have shown theimportance of inflammasome complex activation during infectious pro- cesses. Then, we evaluated the role played by inflammasome activation during host response to primary DENV infection. To this end a mouseexperimental model, utilizing a DENV-2 strain that causes a severedisease in mice was used. Wild-type (WT) infected mice showed increased levels of cleaved Caspase-1 in spleen. However, Casp-1 cleavage in spleen of DENV-2-infected ASC -/-mice was reduced. These animals, as well as Casp-1-/-mice, presented a more severe disease manifestation after DENV infection. In addition, viral loads in spleen of ASC-/-and Casp-1-/--infected mice were markedly elevated and lethality rates after infection were strikingly higher. Of note, bothgroups showed reduced IL-1 bproduction after DENV infection, when compared to WT-infected mice. Hence, IL-1ra-treated mice showed marked susceptibility to DENV-2 infection when compared with infec- ted-WT mice, showing similar alterations to that seen in ASC -/-and Casp-1-/--infected mice. Of note, there was marked increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) after DENV infection in WT mice, and inhibition of NADPH oxidase by Apocynin (APO) treatment or infection ofgp91phox -/-mice resulted in reduced ROS production and in inhibition of IL-1 bproduction after DENV infection. In a similar way to the response seen in mice decient for inflammasome components and in IL- 1ra treated mice, APO-treated and gp91phox -/-mice showed more marked susceptibility to DENV infection. These data suggest that ROS-mediated inflammasome activation is essential for host ability to deal with DENV infection, in part through promotion of IL-1 bproduction and of CAPABLE OF DRIVING INFLAMMATION IN A MODEL OF GOUT J. L. Harper1,*, O. Shaw1, S. Steiger1, X. Liu1, W. J. Martin1 1Malaghan Institute Of Medical Research, Wellington, New Zealand Acute gout is an intensely painful form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the formation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joint and characterised by the inltration of leukocytes including monocytes. Currently, the role of MSU-crystal recruited monocytes inthe progression of the inflammatory response is unclear with monocytedifferentiation into macrophages being linked with either anti- inflammatory or pro-inflammatory responses to MSU crystals in vitro. Using a murine model of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation weproled in vivo. Our ndings showed that newly recruited monocytes exhibited poor phagocytic capacity, expressed low levels of pro-IL-1 b and failed to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines alone, or in responseto MSU over time MSU monocytes exhibited increased phagocytic capacity and expression of CD14, and the accumulation of intracellular pro-IL-1b, active caspase-1 and M1-like macrophage. Consistent with this, MSU crystal restimulation triggered the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells ex vivo, and macrophages in vivo. These data show for the rst time that differentiation of MSU crystal-recruited mono-cytes crystal deposition, may play a signicant role in abrogating resolution and perpetuating inflammation in gout.

Tognarelli1,*, J. Gayet1, M. Dupuy1, disease charac- terized inflammation of the respiratory tract andsystemic vasculitis. Vasculitis involves small- to medium- sizevessels and mostly affects lungs and kidneys. Given the current lack of a mouse model for this human disease, it is important to conceivealternatives to investigate the pathogenesis of this syndrome. We have previously described [1] a peculiar NK-like CD4 T cell subset probably involved in WG vascular damage. We here investigatedthe role of the endothelium, target of the vascular injury. We ana-lyzed the phenotype and functional features of human microvascular endothelial cells (MECs) derived from renal glomerula, lung and skin. We observed consistent differences between the three tissuesin the basal expression of activation and adhesion markers (ICAM-1; ULBPs; PVR). Moreover the MECs stimulation with different changes in phenotype and cytokineproduction (IL-8; IL-6; IL-15; CX3CL1). Finally, we showed thatMECs derived from the three tissues have different ability to stimulate NK cells. Of note, renal- and lung-derived MECs elicited NK cell response more efciently than the skin-derived. Our nd-ings demonstrate that endothelial cells depending on their tissue origin can differently stimulate cells of the immune system. These data could contribute to explain why vasculitis may selectivelyaffect specic organs, as for Wegener's disease, in which lung andkidney vessels are particularly concerned. 1. de Menthon et al.

Pothlichet1, T. Niewold2, Special Surgery, New-York, United States Dysregulation of the antiviral immune response may contribute to autoimmune diseases. Here, we hypothesized that altered expression or function of MAVS, a key molecule downstream of the viral sensors RIG-I and MDA-5, may impair antiviral cell signalling and therebyinfluence the risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prototypeautoimmune disease. We used molecular techniques to screen non- synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAVS gene for functional signicance in human cell lines onecritical loss-of-function variant (C79F, rs11905552). This SNP sub-stantially type I interferon (IFN) and other proinflammatory mediators and was found almost exclusively in the African-American population. Importantly, in African-American SLEpatients, the C79F allele was associated with low type IFN productionand absence of anti-RNA-binding protein autoantibodies. These sero- logic associations were not related to a distinct, functionally neutral, MAVS SNP Q198K. Hence, this is the rst demonstration that anuncommon genetic variant in the MAVS gene has a functional impact upon the anti-viral IFN pathway in vivo in humans and is associated with a novel sub-phenotype in SLE.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm.

Shiozawa1,* 1Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School Of Medicine, Kobe, Japan Interferon a(IFNa) has been hypothesized to cause SLE, however, direct proof for this is lacking. We previously found that overstimulation of CD4 T cells with antigen led to the development of autoantibody- inducing CD4 T ( aiCD4 T) cell capable of inducing autoantibodies including anti-dsDNA antibody and lupus tissue disease including IC-mediated glomerulonephritis. Notably, aiCD4 T cell is induced via de novo TCR revision, but not by cross-reaction to antigen. We test here the role of IFN ain relation to generation of aiCD4 T cell by making IFNatransgenic (Tg) mice. Methods: Mouse (mIFNa) gene controlled under microinjected into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 togenerate TetOp-mIFNaTg mice. We mated this mice with E lSR-tTA Tg mice, expressing tetracycline-transactivator (tTA) gene under the control of Ig heavy chain enhancer and SR apromoter, to obtain used as a control. Results: by increasing IFN ain doxycycline (Dox)-inducible IFNaTg mice, anti-dsDNA antibody, immune complex (IC) and tissue injuries identical to human SLE were induced. Serum anti-dsDNA r-aised 12 weeks (wks) after cessation of Dox, and anti-ds DNA antibody reached maximum at 20 wks. IFN awas increased in 7/14 (50%) mice at 28 wks.

Vasheghani Farahani1,*, R. Monemdjou, G. Perez, F. Beier, J. Martel-Pelletier, M. Kapoor 1Faculty of Medicine, Dpt of Biomedical Science, University Of Montreal, Montreal, Canada Purpose: OA is characterized by cartilage destruction, subchondral bone remodelling and synovial membrane inflammation. Studiessuggest that the PPAR cactivation is a therapeutic target for OA. In vitro activation of PPAR ccan reduce the synthesis of various catabolic and inflammatory factors implicated in OA pathophysiol- ogy. However, the specic in vivo role PPAR cin OA pathophysiology is still unknown. Here, for the rst time, my studyexamines the specic in vivo cKO were generated using LoxP/Cre system. 10 weeks old WT and PPAR cKO mice were subjected to model of OA. 10 weeks post-surgery, mice were sacri-ced, hind limbs were dissected and embedded in parafn. Sections were stained with Safranin-O and blindly graded by OARSI scoring method. Cartilage explants studies were conducted using hip cartilagefrom 3 to 4 weeks old control and PPAR cKO mice. Cartilage was extracted, cultured and stimulated with IL-1\u00df, RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was conducted. Results: Cartilage-specic PPAR cKO mice exhibited accelerated OA compared to WT mice. OARSI scoring of joint sections showed that PPARcKO mice (10 weeks post-surgery) exhibit greater matrix depletion, hypocellularity, brillation and structural damage com-pared to WT mice. So, loss of PPAR cin the cartilage results in greater cartilage destruction associated with OA. RT-PCR analysis further indicated that PPAR cKO mice exhibit signicantly reduced expres- sion of aggrecan and collagen II and increased expression of MMP-13compared to control mice. In addition, IL-1 b-stimulated PPAR cKO cartilage exhibited signicantly increased expression of inflammatory enzymes (iNOS-2 and COX-2) compared to WT mice. Conclusion: These results, for the rst time, demonstrate that loss ofPPARcin the cartilage leads to accelerated OA in mice, suggesting a key role of PPAR cin the pathophysiology of OA.

And Marie Curie, Paris,2Rheumatology,3Orthopedy, St-antoine Hospital, Paris,4UR 4, University Pierre And Marie Curie, Paris, France Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritic disease and a major cause of disability in elderly. This disease, which is characterizedby joint degeneration, leads to a progressive loss of articular cartilage in response to mechanical and biochemical factors. However, OA is a complex disease not limited to cartilage degeneration and recently,experimental animal models suggest that subchondral bone remodelingcould initiate and/or contribute to cartilage loss in OA through bone/ cartilage interplay. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability of soluble mediators released by loaded osteoblasts to shift the articularchondrocyte phenotype from resting to pro-degradative through a noveland unique bone/cartilage communication model. Thanks to a three dimensional (3D) culture model, murine calvaria osteoblasts were submitted to compression in Biopress Flexercell plates (1.7 MPa, 1 Htzduring 24 h). Then media from loaded or unloaded osteoblasts was used to treat primary mouse articular chondrocytes for 24 h. ChondrocyteS68 Inflamm.

It enhancedTIMP-1 expression (5.2-fold) whereas it strongly inhibited TIMP-2 and-3 expression (respectively by 55 and 89%). These results indicate that soluble mediators released by compressed osteoblasts promote a pro- degradative phenotype in chondrocytes. Identication of these solublemediators should lead to new therapeutical targets and/or new bio-markers in OA. Disclosure of interest: M. J.

We have demonstrated previously the protective actions of CORM-2 in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage. However, little is known about the effects of these molecules in OA synovitis. In thisstudy we explored the effects of CORM-2 in OA synoviocytesstimulated with interleukin (IL)-1 b. Synovial tissue samples were obtained from 15 OA patients undergoing total knee joint replace- ment. Synoviocytes were obtained by digestion with collagenase andcultured until third passage. Cells were stimulated with IL-1 b (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of CORM-2 at various con- centrations (50-200 lM) or RuCl 3(200lM) as negative control. CORM-2 markedly decreased cell proliferation induced by IL-1 b and it did not modify HO-1 expression, thus discarding the partic- ipation of this protein in the effects of CORM-2. This agent was able to reduce both protein and mRNA levels of IL-8, CCL2 andCCL20, effects that were accompanied by a marked reduction in themigration promoted by IL-1 b. At the highest concentration employed, this treatment also showed benecial effects by decreasing reactive oxygen species generation. Interestingly,CORM-2 also reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, theactivity and expression of degenerative mediators such as MMP-1 and MMP-3. Further analyses revealed that signicantly mitogen-activated protein kinases andnuclear factor jB signalling pathways, which could be responsible, at least in part, for the protective effects elicited by CORM-2 in this cellular system.In conclusion, CORM-2 moleculesrepresent new and interesting strategies to counteract synovial inflammation during osteoarthritis.

Due to the well-known anti-apoptotic effects of SOCS1 and SOCS3, we inves- tigated their possible involvement protecting psoriatic cells fromIFN-c/TNF-a-induced apoptosis through the PI3 K/AKT signaling, which has denite anti-apoptotic functions in than expressing increased SOCS1 and SOCS3, psoriatic keratinocytesshowed high levels of phosphorylated AKT in response to IFN- cand TNF-a. Moreover, the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-X Bcl-2 genes could not be down-regulated by IFN- c/TNF- ain psoriatic keratinocytes, differently to what observed in healthy cells. Kerati-nocytes stably transfected with SOCS3 were more resistant to IFN- c/ TNF-a-induced apoptosis compared to control clones, and showed high levels of Bcl-X L,Bcl-2 and phosphorylated AKT. Vice versa, a-induced Land Bcl-2 levels. SOCS1 manipulation in keratinocytes had effects similar to that of SOCS3 even though less signicant. Our dataindicate that SOCS3 and SOCS1 can anti-apoptoticprograms occurring in IFN- c/TNF-a-activated psoriatic keratinocytes by sustaining AKT activation and Bcl-X Land Bcl-2 expression. We are currently investigating whether SOCS3 and AKT inhibition inpsoriatic keratinocytes renders these cells declared.Inflamm. Res. S69 123OC-100 INTERPLAY BETWEEN TNF AND REGULATORY T CELLS IN A TNF-DRIVEN MODEL OF ARTHRITIS, AND THE IMPACT OF PASSIVE ORACTIVE ANTI-TNF THERAPIES J. Biton1,*, L. Avicenne, Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny,3Neovacs, Paris, France TNF plays a major inflammatory role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and anti-TNF targeted treatments are highly effective in this disease. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the interplay between TNF andCD4 +CD25+FoxP3+regulatory T cells (Treg), and the impact of anti- TNF therapies on those cells. We used a TNF-driven disease, speci- cally human TNF transgenic (TTg) mouse model of arthritis. In the rst part of our study, we observed that, in 7 weeks old-TTg mice, hTNFoverexpression induced lower Treg proportions in secondary lymphoidorgans, as compared to age-matched wild type (wt) mice. However, the frequency of Treg cells increased with time in TTg mice, reaching the same proportion than wt mice at 24 weeks. TNFR2 expression by Treg,also increased with time in TTg mice. In the second part of our study, TTg mice were treated with either passive (infliximab) or active (TNF- K: vaccination against TNF) anti-TNF. Compared to untreated mice,hTNF with either infliximab or TNF-K resulted in anincreased Treg frequency. In lymph nodes (LN), our study showed that hTNF blockade induced an expansion of induced Treg cells dened by the CD4 +CD25+FoxP3+CD62L-phenotype, an up-regulation of CTLA-4 expression by Treg cells, accompanied by an increased Tregsuppressive activity on effector T cell proliferation. In conclusion, in a strictly hTNF dependent inflammation model, we show for the rst time that TNF can have different effects on Treg, depending on the durationof exposure and on disease phase. Our work also shows that TNFblockade either by TNF-K or infliximab could depend not only on TNF neutralization but also on Treg upregulation. Disclosure of interest: J. Biton: None Declared, L.

IL-1B-DEPENDENT DOWN REGULATION OF MIR-24 PARTICIPATES TO PREMATURE AGING OF CHONDROCYTES IN OA D. Philipot1,*, D. Guerit1, E. Italy Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by chondrocyte premature aging involving altogether an hypertrophic phenotype, a DNA damage accumulation and presence of senescence-mediated secretory factorssuch as Il-1b, Il-8 and MMPs. Molecular mechanisms involved in OA are still under investigation. Here we identied by genome wide miR-array analysis that p16INK4A-regulatory microRNA, one target of ex accu-mulates. Furthermore, we show by RT-qPCR that hsa-miR-24 expression increases during early steps of ex vivo chondrogenic dif- ferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and p16INK4Aincreases correlating with an hypertrophic stage. Finally, preliminaryresults based on specic antagomir approach suggest that hsa-miR-24 down regulation is sufcient to trigger p16INK4A-dependent pre- mature aging on chondrocyte and expression of hypertrophic markerssuch as MMP13. Altogether, we proposed that hsa-miR-24 is one of therst microRNA in human having an central anti-aging role by pre- venting the onset of one age-related disease.

OC-102 REGULATION OF TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID 4 ACTIVITY BYPROTEASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR AGONISTS AND HYDROGEN France,2Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada We have previously demonstrated that Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) activation in intestinal epithelial cells causedintracellular calcium mobilization and chemokine release. Further, TRPV4 activation in mouse intestine induced colitis, suggesting that this channel could participate to intestinal inflammation. Many mediators arereleased at inflammatory sites, including serine proteases known toactivate Protease-Activated Receptors (PAR), but also endogenous gas, such as hydrogen sulde (H 2S). We hypothesized that such mediators are able to regulate TRPV4 functions in intestinal epithelial cellsMethods: TRPV4 response was evaluated by measuring calcium flux with a Fluo-8 probe in Normal derived Colon Mucosa (NCM460) cells. Cells were exposed to PAR 1- (TFLLRN-NH 2), PAR 2- (SLI- GRL-NH 2), or PAR 4-activating peptide (AYPGFK-NH 2), Sodium Hydrogen Sulde (NaHS) a H 2S donor, or their vehicle, 3 min before a second stimulation with the specic agonist of TRPV4, 4 aPDD (4 TRPV4 agonist induced a dose-dependent calcium inNCM460 response to 10 lMo f4 aPDD was signicantly increased when cells were pre-incubated with PAR 1-(100lM) PAR 2- (10lM), but not PAR 4-activating peptide (200 lM). Intestinal epi- thelial cells did not respond to low concentration (1 lM) of 4 aPDD. However, if cells were pre-treated with the PAR 1- (100 lM) or the PAR 2- (10lM), but not the PAR 4agonist, they became responsive to 1lM of the of TRPV4 agonist (50 lM). Conclusions: Activation of PAR 1, PAR 2but not PAR 4potentiated the cellular response of TRPV4 but also sensitized the receptor, poten-tially enhancing its pro-inflammatory effects. However, NaHS exposure decreased cellular response to TRPV4 agonist, thereby potentially exerting anti-inflammatory effects in None declared.S70 123OC-103 LIPOTOXIC MITOCHONDRIAL IN CELLS ACTIVATED WITH PHOSPHOLIPOLYZED LDL R. M. Agrapart1, phospholipases A2 (sPLA2), are now considered attractive therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers, as they contribute in inflammation through lipoprotein-dependent and independent mecha-nisms. We have previously shown that hGX-sPLA2 is expressed inhuman atherosclerotic lesions and that the phospholipolysis of LDL by hGX sPLA2 results in a proinflammatory LDL particle (LDL-X), which perturbs endothelial function through the induction of endoplasmicreticulum (ER) stress. Alteration in ER homeostasis triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) which regulates the balance between survival and apoptosis. In the present study we aimed to identify themolecular pathways directing LDL-X-stress responses to survival orapoptosis in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells (HUVEC), activated with LDL-X induced all three branches of the UPR response with concomitant activation of apoptotic and survival pathways (BCL2family of proteins). WB and RT-QPCR analysis showed a signicantdecrease in cyclinD1 expression, suggesting that the regulation of cyclinD1 in response to LDL-X induced-ER stress is a checkpoint control, which prevents cell-cycle progression until homeostasisis restored. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis of the mito- chondria in the LDL-X treated cells showed altered morphology and shrinkage indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. In parallel, weobserved upregulation of antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes, with con-comitant activation of NRF2, whose main role is to protect cells from oxidative stress. As LDL-X is not oxidized, we postulated that in addition to the modication of LDL, the lipid mediators produced fromLDL hydrolysis, arachidonic acid and Lyso-PC, activate the antioxidantresponse and this was further conrmed by WB analysis, RT-QPCR and immunofluorescence experiments of HUVEC cells stimulated with the lipid mediators.Conclusion: LDL-X induces inflammation in endothelial cells througha lipotoxic MURINE MODELOF GOUT F.

Wild type (WT) mice and (fluorimetric assay) were analyzed in macrophages.Results: Injection of MSU in the knee joints of mice induced neu-trophil influx and neutrophil-dependent hypernociception. MSU- induced neutrophil influx was and relied the induction of CXCR2 acting chemokines in a NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1/IL-1b/MyD88-dependent manner. LTB 4was produced rapidly after injection of MSU, and was necessary for Caspase-1-dependent IL-1 b production and consequent release of ROS- dependent activation of the inflammasome.Conclusion: We show the role of the inflammasome in mediatingMSU-induced joint inflammation and dysfunction, and highlight a previously unrecognized role of LTB 4in driving inflammasome activation in response to MSU crystals both in vitro and in vivo.Financial support: Disclosure of interest: PATHWAY Gombault1, II, Montpellier, France Deposition of uric acid crystals in joints causes gout disease. Pro- longed airway exposure to silica crystals leads to silicosisdevelopment. Aluminum hydroxide (alum) salts are frequently usedas vaccine adjuvant. These micrometer size particles activate innate immunity through the Nlrp3 inflammasome resulting in IL-1 bpro- duction. The inflammasome is activated not only by particles derivedfrom endogenous aggregates or environmental pollutants but also by abroad spectrum of situations, from metabolic stress to pathogen- related molecules. Particles-mediated inflammasome activation has been linked to reactive oxygen species involvement and lysosomedestabilization. In an other hand, ATP is present in all living cells andextracellular ATP is a well known soluble danger signal able to activate the Nlrp3 inflammasome through P2X7 receptor and pann- exin-1 pore formation. Here we establish a link between ATP andparticles signaling. First, we show that uric acid, silica and alum particles trigger endogenous ATP release depending on functional P2X7 receptor and pannexin-1 hemichannel proteins. Then, weobserve that maturation and secretion of IL-1 bwere dramatically impaired in presence of purinergic receptors or pannexin-1 pore antagonists.

OC-106 IL-27 AND SOX40LASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE REACTIONS H. F. Cognasse2, J. Belgium IL-27 and sOx40L are produced mainly by antigen presenting cells and are powerful immunomodulatory molecules. For instance, IL-27enhances B cell proliferation and OX40L reduces Th2 response. To date platelets were not reported to be able to release neither IL-27 nor sOX40L. We sought to examine the levels of IL-27 and sOx40L insupernatants of apheresis platelet concentrate preparations (PCs) during storage and in left over products involved in transfusions that induced acute transfusion reactions (ATR). Samples from PCs were taken foranalysis each day during their 7-day storage. We recorded 4 ATR epi-sodes for which PC left over products could be analyzed. Two fractions (supernatant and lysates of platelets) from each ATR-associated PC (and 10 controls) were prepared. Ap r o t e o m i c approach was used to determine inflammatory factors involved in ATR and ELISA was used for quantifythese factors. After a 1-day storage of PCs we found elevated levels of IL- 27 and sOx40L (respectively at 18,020 \u00b15,844 and 374 \u00b150 pg/mL/ 10 9unit) that increased respectively by 2.2 and 2.25-fold at storage day 7 versus day 0. Moreover, supernatants of ATR-associated PCs contained higher and corresponding platelet lysates contained lower, IL-27 and sOx40L levels, compared to control PCs (P \\0.05). We exposed B and T cells to supernatants and cell lysates of ATR-associated PCs and observedan increase of CD86 and CD69 expression only for PCs supernatants. This over-expression of activation markers was abolished when B and T cells were preincubated with IL-27 and sOx40L blocking antibodies. Wedemonstrated that platelets contain and release IL-27 and sOx40L that areimplicated in ATR. These data emphasize the importance of investigat- ing, in a multi-center collaborative study, larger series of ATR-associated PCs to determine specic reagents or processes to reduce IL-27 andsOx40L production during collection and storage of platelet components.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflammatory processes in cardiovascular and renal diseases (OC10) OC-107 ABERRANT PRESENTATION OF MPO INDUCES TOLERANCE AND PROTECTS FROM EXPERIMENTAL ANTI-MPOGLOMERULONEPHRITIS S. R. Holdsworth1,2,*, A. R. Kitching2, D. Odobasic2, D. MMC, Monash University, Clayton, Australia Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a major cause of renal failure. Cresc- entic GN is the most destructive form of this disease. Most casesresult from autoimmunity to myeloperoxidase (MPO) causingsevere glomerular inflammation. We dened an immuno- dominant and nephritogenic T cell epitope from MPO (20 amino acids; known as peptide 52 [pep52]). This work examines of MPO could attenuate autoimmunity andanti-MPO glomerulonephritis. Autoimmunity was induced by immunizing mice (with MPO or pep52) then disease was triggered with low dose anti-GBM globulin which induced glomerular neu-trophil influx and MPO deposition. Aberrant presentation of MPO was performed by intranasal insufflation of pep52 or over consecutive days pro-tected mice from the development of autoimmunity when subsequently immunized with 200 lg pep52, compared with con- trol mice given nasal insufflation with an irrelevant peptide. Thefrequency of CD4+ cells responding to MPO by producing IFN c was 457 \u00b1107 (per 10 6, control mice) versus 289 \u00b190 (tolerized mice) and IL-17A-producing titres were mice were challenged with anti-GBM globulin, GN was reduced in tolerized induced strong anti-MPO autoimmunity which induced GN when triggered with anti-GBM globulin. However, immunization with CD40 -/-DCs protected from the development of autoimmunity and GN. Draining lymph node cells isolated fromCD40 -/-DC-immunized mice showed higher levels of IL-10 suggesting the induction of Tr1 regulatory T cells.

Our group hasidentied the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1 or CD71) as a mesangial IgA1 receptor and we had shown that in cultured mesangial cells TfR1 activation by polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1) induces IL-6 productionand cell proliferation. However the mechanism underlying thiscytokine production and cellular proliferation is still unclear. Herein, we developed a new inducible mouse model of IgAN, in which patients' IgA induced mesangial cell proliferation, IL-6 and TNF- a production, monocytes/macrophage renal inltration and renal dys-function. These responses were associated with PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway activation, once sustained PI3K/Akt pathway activation in PTEN \u00b1mice amplied patients' IgA1 effects, whereas blocking of by rapamycin was inhibitory. Concomitant with PI3K/ Akt/m-TOR pathway activation we observed an increased TfR1 expression and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta(PDGFR\u00df) expression and phosphorylation. Interestingly, PDGFRinhibition cell proliferation not matory cytokine production. In vitro overexpression of TfR1 increased cell sensitivity to PDGF-BB suggesting that mesangial cellproliferation is due to a convergence of TfR1 and PDGFR signaling.We conclude that PI3 K/Akt/m-TOR pathway is pivotal to IgAN inflammation by controlling renal inflammatory cytokines production and is also important to mesangial cell proliferation via a modulationof PDGFR signaling threshold.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

One of the molecules that might orchestrate the balance between TGF- b1 and HGF/BMP-7 is CD44, which is a surface glycoprotein involved in inflammation and whoseexpression is up-regulated on tubular epithelial cells upon kidney injury. All CD44 isoforms differ in the extracellular domain and are therefore interacting with different molecules. The CD44 standard(CD44s) isoform can facilitate TGF- b1 signaling, while the CD44- variant 3 (CD44v3) is capable of binding HGF and BMP-7 due to itsattached heparan sulfate moieties. expressing either or CD44v3, specically on proximal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), we studied the progression of obstructivenephropathy (UUO), as a model of chronic kidney diseases. Wt andtransgenic mice (n =8/group) were subjected to UUO, and sacriced at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Primary TECs were isolated from Wt and transgenic mice (n =3/group), and stimulated with r-TGF- b1. Sta- tistics were done with the Mann-Whitney test. At day 1 upon UUOthe CD44 s transgenic mice showed signicantly more tubular dam- age compared to the Wt and the CD44v3 mice, while no differences were found at later time-point. At day 1, the CD44v3 UUO kidneysrevealed signicantly less accumulation together withless TGF- signaling and increased BMP-7 signaling compared to the Wt and CD44 s kidneys. In vitro stimulations of primary TECs with TGF- b1 showed that, in response to TGF- b1, CD44v3-TECs synthesize less a-SMA, CTGF, TGF- then the Wt-, and CD44 s-TECs. In conclusion, these results suggest that CD44v3decreases tubular injury and myobroblast accumulation in earlystage of chronic obstructive nephropathy through downregulation of TGF-b1 pro-brotic A.

CC chemokine receptor (CCR)2 regulates monocyte/macro-phage migration into injured tissues. However, the direct role of CCR2 in the progression of DN remains unknown. We hypothesize that deciency or blockade of CCR2 confers kidney protection in DN.Methods: Experiments were conducted in Ins2 Akitamice with or without the selective CCR2 antagonist, RS504393 (2 mg/kg/day via osmotic or in CCR2 decient mice(CCR2 -/-) and their wild type littermate (CCR2+/+) STZ induced diabetes for 6 Ins2Akita+ vehicle.

In vitro, podocytes grown on high glucose (HG) media are associated with signicant increase in macrophage migration from those grown in normal glucose (NG) media using transwell migration assay and thiseffect was blocked with the addition of anti-MCP-1 antibody. Inaddition, M1 macrophages induced podocyte permeability; but deciency migration; (3) macrophage-dependent soluble factors directly inducepodocyte injury through the pro-inflammatory M1 but not the anti- inflammatory M2 subsets.

Activation of the canonical NF-kB signaltrans-duction pathway, mediated by phosphorylation and degradation of IkBa by the IkB-kinase (IKK) complex, is a crucial step in pro- inflammatory target gene expression such as that of chemokines oradhesion molecules, which have been implicated in atherosclerosis. The role of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a multi-functional protein complex with functions in NF-kB and b2-integrin signaling, in ath-erosclerosis has been unknown. Here, super-complex formationbetween IKK and the CSN was indicated for by IKK2/CSN5, IKK2/ CSN3 and NEMO/CSN2 under pro-atherogenic conditions.

Autophagy is the primarypathway for degrading and recycling long-lived proteins, and its activation has recently been shown to mediate myocardial injury in response to I/R injury. In this study we investigated the ability of H 2S preventing autophagy as a potential mechanism underlying its car- dioprotective effects against I/R injury. Male rats were subjected to myocardial ischemia for 45 min followed by 2 h reperfusion.NaHS, a H 2S donor, at doses of 10, 30, 100 lmol/kg was injected i.p. at 30 min before ischemia. The autophage related genes beclin 1 and ATG5 mRNA were elevated in the area at risk (AAR) of hearts subjected to I/R. NaHS reduced myocardial infarct size and attenu-ated the increase of beclin 1 and ATG5 expressions. In vitro, culturedneonatal rat cardiomyocytes were subjected to 24 h hypoxia followed by 2 h reoxygenation, and NaHS at doses of 10, 30, 50, 100 lmol/L were added 30 min prior to hypoxia. Detection of microtubule-asso-ciated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) conversion, i.e., LC3-I to LC3-II, and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining were also used for the determination of autophagy activity in cardiomyocytes. Autophagywas induced in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation(H/R), as indicated by the increases of beclin 1 and ATG5 mRNA expression, LC3 conversion as well as MDC staining. dose-dependently indicate that inhibition of autophagy might be one of the mechanisms underlying H 2S cardio- protective effects against ischemia reperfusion injury.Keywords: Hydrogen sulde, cardiomyocyte, autophagy, ischemiareperfusion.

In the current study, we show that miR-155, an inflammatory cell-expressedmicroRNA, stimulates the secretion of pro-hypertrophic and - inflammatory factors by macrophages and thereby causes adverse inflammation and heart failure. We subjected miR-155 KO and WTmice to 1 and 4 weeks of angiotensin II (AngII) to induce cardiachypertrophy, inflammation and failure. Whereas AngII signicantly increased both cardiac mass and hypertrophic signalling in WT mice, the absence of miR-155 inhibited this hypertrophic response. More-over, absence of miR-155 prevented inflammatory cell influx in theheart following AngII, more specically the influx of macrophages. These data were independently conrmed using antagomiRs against miR-155 in AngII-treated mice. In situ hybridization predominantlyidentied cardiac miR-155 in macrophages and very little was detected in cardiac myocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that mac- rophage miR-155 mediates towardscardiac marrow transplantation withmiR-155 KO and WT mice and in vitro experiments independently conrmed that miR-155 in the macrophage mediates cardiac hyper- trophy. miR-155 direct target Suppressorof Cytokine Signalling-1 in the macrophage, leading to increased IL-6secretion and consequent STAT3 activity, implicated in cardiac inflammation and hypertrophy. These data reveal miR-155 expression in the macrophage to be mandatory to allow cardiac hypertrophy,inflammation and failure, by permitting cytokine signalling, identi-fying miR-155 as a crucial inflammatory regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.

Here, we analyze the role of ASCs in reducing the progression of kidney brosis. Progressive renal brosis was achieved by unilateral clamping of the renal pedicle for 1 h, after that, the kidneywas reperfused immediately. Four hours after the surgery, 2 910 5 ASCs were intraperitoneally administered, and animals were followedfor 24 h post-treatment and then at some other time interval for the next 6 weeks. Also, animals were treated with 2 9105ASC at 6 weeks after reperfusion and sacriced 4 weeks later to study their effect when interstitial brosis already is present. At 24 h after reperfusion, ASC- treated animals showed reduced renal dysfunction and enhancedregenerative tubular processes. Renal mRNA expression of IL-6 andTNF was decreased in ASC-treated animals, whereas IL-4, IL-10 and HO-1 expression increased despite a lack of ASC in the kidneys as determined by SRY analysis. As expected, untreated kidneys shrank at6 weeks, whereas the kidneys of ASC-treated animals remained normalin size, showed less collagen deposition and decreased staining for FSP- 1, type I collagen and hypoxyprobe. The renal protection seen in ASC- treated animals was followed by reduced serum levels of TNF- a, KC, RANTES and IL-1 a. Surprisingly, treatment with ASC at 6 weeks, when animals already showed installed brosis, demonstrated ame- lioration of functional parameters, with less tissue brosis observed and reduced mRNA expression of type I collagen and vimentin. ASCtherapy can improve functional parameters and reduce progression of renal brosis at early and later times after injury, mostly due to early modulation of the inflammatory response and to less hypoxia, therebyreducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Extracellularadenosine has been implicated as central signalling molecule during conditions of limited oxygen availability (hypoxia), important in attenuating tissue damage, acute inflammation and the preservation ofpulmonary barrier function. During periods of acute inflammationextracellular levels of adenosine are increased in the affected tissues, yet the molecular mechanisms are presently unknown. The Equilibra- tive Nucleoside Transporters (ENTs) have signicant impact levels of extracellular adenosine. During periods ofhypoxia, the expression levels of ENT1 and -2 are signicantly reduced, leading to the attenuation of adenosine uptake and resulting in an increased extracellular adenosine concentration. Cellular hypoxia ispart of the pathophysiological correlate of an acute inflammatory pro-cess, yet in addition a variety of cytokines are released upon the stimulation of the immune system. Given this, we investigated conse- quences of pulmonary acute inflammation on the expression of ENTs.Our initial studies with endothelia and pulmonary epithelia demonstrate attenuation of adenosine uptake as result of diminished expression of ENTs during acute inflammation in vitro. Studies with siRNA con-rmed the major contribution of ENT2 as main adenosine transporter inlung. Furthermore, examination of the ENT2 promoter suggests nuclear factor-kappa B in ENT2 repression. Additional in vivo studies using aInflamm. Res.

OC-116 IN VIVO IMAGING OF NF-KB PATHWAY IN ACUTE LUNG INFLAMMATION MOUSEMODEL CAN PREDICT A PHARMACOLOGICAL RESPONSE F. Stellari1,* and F. L. S. Ottonello***, G. Villetti*\u2014** Life Sciences and Health Technologies University of Bologna(Bologna, Italy),*** Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, NF-kB plays a central role in immunity, inflammation, development, cell survival and has been indicated under a number of pathological conditions of lung disease, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, weassessed the in vivo activation of NF-kB signaling in lung tissue using abioluminescence imaging system (IVIS) to monitor activation of an NF- kB promoter in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. A plasmid contained responsive elements (RE) of NF-kB and luciferase asa reporter gene has been delivered intravenously in nude mice at theconcentration of 40 ug per mouse using in vivo-jetPEI TMfrom Polyplus as a transfectant agent. One week after DNA delivery the transient transgenic mice had been imaged in order to check the baseline acti-vation of the NF-kB pathway. The day after, the mice have been treated with LPS 15 ug per mouse intratracheally and the lungs imaged using bioluminescence (BLI) at 2, 4, 7 and 24 h. The ability of the IKK2inhibitor MLN120B orally administered at the dose of 300 mg/kg tocounteract NF-kB activation has been evaluated. The maximum peak of NF-kB activation was reached at 4 h with seven-tenfolds of induction in comparison to the saline group and at 24 h the signal dropped down atbasal level. In the group treated with MLN120B was observed a 50%inhibition of LPS-induced NF-kB stimulation, an effect that was in good agreement with the inhibition of p65 nuclear translocation evaluated ex vivo in lung homogenates. In this experiment we showed that is feasibleto monitor NF-kB activation in vivo in lung tissue in a non-invasive wayby BLI and create a new in vivo tool for drug discovery process.

The aim of this study was to use TUL as a model to char- acterize anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution TUL. Whole blood PMN and monocyte-derived macro-phages of healthy steers were used in vitro. Results: TUNEL staining and ELISA revealed reduced LTB 4inM. vitro, by A 2. Immunoblotting and real-time RT-PCR that TUL levels describe confers both anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution benets,independent of its antibacterial properties (e.g. in zymosan-inflamedlungs). The data suggest that drugs with both antimicrobial and pro- resolution properties would be most benecial for treating infectious inflammatory diseases.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-118 NEW INSIGHTS IN CYPRESS POLLEN ALLERGENREPERTOIRE: FOR? allows the distinction between co sensitization and cross reactivity and is at the basis of the improvement of allergy diagnosis. About 10% of children are affected by allergy to cypress pollen in Mediterranean area and the prevalenceis growing. The symptoms are sometimes more severe than for apollinosis to grass. Objective: (1) To decipher the repertoire of pollen allergens from Italian cypress ( Cupressus sempervirens ), (2) To clinical characteristics to specic IgE proles.Methods: A proteomic approach was used. Allergens were located by serum IgE immunoblotting after 2D separation of water or detergent pollen soluble extracts. Allergens were then identied bymass spectrometry.S76 Inflamm. Res. IgE reactivity proles were observed by immunoblotting in 80 cypress pollen allergic patients. A rst grouprecognized allergens with high relative molecular masses (HMW [30 kDa) and a second group recognized peptidic epitopes on a basic 14 kDa protein. The major allergen Cup s 1 (43 kDa) wasfound among the HMW allergens as well as Cup s 2, a polygalac-turonase (43 kDa, basic), newly described, with a 70% prevalence. Among three candidates for the 14 kDa protein (a Lipid Transfer Protein, cytochrome c or histones), histone is the most probable oneon the basis of preliminary data. Because of its monomorphic nature,such reactivity would put the patient at the frontier between allergy and autoimmunity. The data obtained by immunoblot were compared with IgE obtained using ImmunoCAP ISAC (Phadia), a min-iaturized multiarray system.Conclusion: The investigation of this model of allergy leads to both analytical (description of new allergens) and mechanistic (inflam- mation and autoimmunity) results and hypothesis. The deniteidentication of the 14 kDa protein, as well as its clinical relevance in inflammation, autoimmunity and IgE-mediated basophil mediator release remain to be unraveled.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-119 DUAL ROLE OF IL-22 IN ALLERGIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION AND ITS CROSS-TALKWITH IL-17A D. Togbe1,*, A.G. Besnard1, has both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties and its role in allergic lung inflammation has not been explored.Objectives: To investigate the expression and roles of IL-22 in theonset and resolution of experimental allergic asthma and its cross-talk with IL-17A. Methods: IL-22 expression was assessed in patient samples and in thelung of ovalbumin-immunized and challenged mice. IL-22 functions in allergic airway inflammation were evaluated using IL-22-decient mice or anti-IL-22 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the effects ofrecombinant IL-22 and IL-17A neutralizing antibodies were investi-gated. Measurements and main results: Increased pulmonary IL-22 expression is found in the serum of asthmatic patients and in wild- type mice immunized and challenged with ovalbumin. Allergic lunginflammation is IL-22 eosinophil IL-33, chemokine production, airway hyperreactivity and mucus production are drastically reduced in IL- 22-decient mice or by IL-22 antibody neutralization during immu-nization of wild-type mice. By contrast, IL-22 neutralization duringantigen challenge enhanced allergic lung inflammation with increased Th2 cytokines. Consistent with this, recombinant IL-22 given with allergen challenge protects mice from lung inflammation. Finally, weshow that IL-22 may regulate the expression and proinflammatory properties of IL-17A in allergic lung inflammation. Conclusions: IL-22 is required for the onset of allergic asthma, butfunctions as a negative regulator of established allergic inflammation.Our study revealed that IL-22 contribute to the proinflammatory properties of IL-17A in experimental allergic asthma.

Domingos2, W. Tavares de Lima2, D. D. Inosine has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects in a wide range of inflammatory conditions, including acutelung inflammation.Objective: This study intended to investigate the possible involve- ment of adenosine receptors in inosine anti-inflammatory effects in murine model of ovalbumin-induced asthma.Methods: Female balb/c mice, sensitized (day 0) and boosted (day 7) subcutaneously with OVA (10 lg) were challenged at day 14 and 15 with aerosolized OVA (1%) and treated intraperitoneally 30 min priorwith inosine mg/kg) with A 2A(ZM241385), A 2B(allox- azine) or non-selective (caffeine), 30 min before inosine injection (10 mg/kg). After 24 h, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) wasobtained to perform the cell counting. Lungs fragments were obtainedand cultured-24 h (explant) for determination of cytokines recovered in the BAL at 10 mg/kg, when compared with the allergic control group. Pre-treatment with ZM241385 and caffeine, reverted 70\u00b15 and 97.6 \u00b18.1% the inosine effect on the total count, and 86.5 \u00b17.9% and 96.2 \u00b14.1% the macrophage count, respectively. Also, caffeine treatment reverted the lymphocyte cell count in 68.0 \u00b114.5%. DPCPX or alloxazine treatment did not cause any effect. Inosine also reduced the levels of IL-4 (67 \u00b18%) and IL-5 (55\u00b18%) in explants, an a dose-dependent inhibition of cellmigration in the BAL, an effect that might involve A 2Areceptor, as demonstered by pre-treatment with ZM241385 and caffeine. More- over, inosine effects can involve an inhibition on cytokine release that might be related to A 2and/or A 3adenosine receptors.

Bleomycin (BLEO) is an anticancer drug, which itsmain side effect is lung toxicity correlated with brosis. In mice,BLEO is used to study Pulmonary Fibrosis. Here we evaluated the role of BK receptors in lung inflammation and brosis. B 1R, B 2R and B1B2R 30% of survival (d =21) and 20% of weight loss. B 1RKO succumbed with 100% of mortality (d=14), however B 2RKO mice were protected form lethality and weight loss. The B 1B2RKO showed the same phenotype as WT mice. BLEO induced marked PMN influx into lung and airways with pro- tein leakage (d =7) in WT, B 1RKO and B 1B2RKO, but not in B2RKO mice. B 2RKO displayed reduced blood hematocrit than WT, B1RKO and B 1B2RKO mice. Lung levels of IL-1b, IL-6 and CXCL1 were increased in WT, B 1RKO and B 1RB 2RKO, but not in B 2RKO mice. However, TGF-b 1was elevated only in WT and B 1B2RKO, and B2RKO mice showed increased IL-10 lung levels (d =7). By real- time PCR no differences were found in the kinetic of B 1R expression between WT and B 2RKO mice. However, B 1RKO mice had increased B2R expression than WT (d =4.7). iNOS mRNA expression was progressively increased in B 1RKO compared to WT (d =4.10), but it was blunted in B 2RKO mice. B 2RKO showed a reduced expression of eNOS, von Willebrand Factor, a-SMA and Col1a1 (d =10) com- pared to WT or B 1RKO mice. WT and B 1B2RKO presented increased lung hydoxyproline content, but not B 2RKO mice (d =21). Histo- pathology conrmed the lung integrity of B 2RKO when compared to WT or B 1B2RKO mice (d =21). We showed that different BK receptors could establish the susceptibility to lethality induced byBLEO. We conclude that B 2R is more important for lung inflam- mation and brosis than B 1R, and B 2R may be benecial for Pulmonary Fibrosis treatment. Montpellier, France,3Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,4Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, France Background: Massive recruitment of neutrophils and extracellular release of their azurophil granules (AG) leads to chronic proteolytic and oxidative stresses in cystic brosis (CF) airways. Previously, we demonstrated that neutrophils are reprogrammed upon entry into CFairway (via cAMP and mTOR pathways), and then go to release AGactively. Better understanding of these reprogrammed neutrophils is essential to develop efcient treatments for fatal CF airway disease. Methods: We used novel retroviral envelope probes for FACS anal-ysis of surface metabolite transporters on CF airway neutrophils (glucose transporter Glut1, inorganic phosphate transporters Pit1 and Pit2, and neutral amino acid -AA- transporter ASCT2), as well asmass spectrometry to characterize AA metabolites (assumingly, derived from proteolysis) in CF airway fluid.Results: We found increased expression of Glut1 (+81%) and PiT1 (+77%) on CF airway neutrophils, compared to blood neutrophils. Moreover, CF airway neutrophils with high AG release compared tothose with low AG release (as identied in our previous studies), dis-played major PiT2 idea that AG release and metabolic reprogramming occur concomitantly. Next, we foundthat CF airway fluid is highly enriched in AA metabolites, starting innewborns and infants. CF airway fluid contained 300 + AA metabo- lites, with [95% of them increased tenfold or more compared to airway fluid from healthy controls. AA metabolites correlated highly withneutrophil count and anabolic AA, some of which are transported byASCT2, were very high in CF airway fluid. Conclusions: Our results suggest that neutrophils not only proteolyze the airway tissue and thereby condition the extracellular fluid towardshigh AA content, but that they also use these AA, and other nutrients, to drive their reprogramming. This new pathway may be amenable to therapeutic modulation.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Reactive oxygen species and proteases (OC12) OC-123 NF-KB ACTIVITY IS REDUCED BY INOS-DERIVED NO IN HUMAN CHONDROCYTES: CONTRIBUTION TO SUSTAINED LOW GRADE INFLAMMATION IN OSTEOARTHRITIS A. F.

Lopes1,2 1Faculty Pharmacy,2Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra,3Orthopedics Department and Bone Bank, University Hospital of Coimbra,4Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal NF-kB mediates important chondrocyte inflammatory and catabolic responses that ultimately lead to cartilage destruction, the hallmark ofosteoarthritis (OA). This work aimed at identifying the role of the neuronal and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthases (nNOS and iNOS, respectively) as sources of NO in normal and OA human chondrocytesand at elucidating the role of endogenous iNOS-derived NO on theregulation of NF-kB activity. For this, we compared nNOS and iNOS protein levels by western blot and NF-kB activity by ELISA in normal and OA human chondrocytes and measured spontaneous NO produc-tion. Then, we evaluated the effect of inhibiting iNOS on the ability of interleukin-1b (IL-1) to induce NF-kB. Chondrocytes were isolated from human knee cartilage obtained from normal multi-organ donors orOA patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. The resultsshowed that nNOS was expressed in 83% of the normal and 65% the OA chondrocytes, whereas the opposite was found for iNOS (33 vs. 65%). The average nitrite concentration in the supernatants from normal orOA chondrocyte cultures that did not express iNOS was 3.6 \u00b11.0 mM, whereas in cells expressing iNOS it was 9.4 \u00b12.9 mM (P \\0.01). Although IkB-a was present in all the normal samples and in the majority (88.5%) of the OA samples, NF-kB activity in OA chondro-cytes (1.82 \u00b10.23) was approximately twofold higher than in normal ones (0.91 \u00b10.05). Treatment with a general NOS inhibitor, after induction of iNOS expression, was sufcient to induce NF-kB-DNA also NF-kB activation. These ndings favor an inhibitory role ofiNOS-derived NO on the regulation of NF-kB activity in human chondrocytes. This seems to contribute to sustain a moderate level of NF-kB activity and NF-kB-dependent gene expression over time, thusperpetuating inflammation and cartilage destruction.

REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES PROMOTE PRODUCTION OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN THE TNFR1- ASSOCIATED PERIODIC FEVER SYNDROME A. C. Bulua1, M. Pelletier1, S. Myerowitz-Vanderhoek1,D . Kastner1, R. M. Siegel1,* 1NIAMS, National Institutes Of Health, Bethesda, United States Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have an established role in inflamma- tion and host defense. However, how they contribute to thepathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases is not clear. Tumor necrosisfactor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a familial autosomal dominant periodic fever syndrome characterized by pro- longed febrile episodes, serositis, dermal inflammation and an elevatedrisk of amyloidosis. Mutations in the extracellular domain of TNFR1 associated with TRAPS cause misfolding and accumulation of mutant TNFR1 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. PBMC from cells TRAPS-asso-ciated TNFR1 mutations exhibit enhanced basal MAPK activity and enhanced production of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 in response to LPS that is dependent on p38 and JNK activity. Production of TNF and IL-6 inresponse inflammasome, fevers but are hypersensitive to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. We hypothesized that ROS might sustain MAPK activation and con-sequent inflammatory responses in cells from TRAPS patients. Indeed, we found that a variety of antioxidants could signicantly reduce inflammatory cytokine production by cells from TRAPS patients andknock-in mice. Rather than NADPH oxidases, we nd that mitochon-drial respiration provides the ROS necessary for enhanced cytokine production in TRAPS. TNFR1 mutant cells exhibit enhanced mito- chondrial oxidative capacity and ROS generation. Pharmacologicalagents reduce inflammatory cytokine production after LPS stimulationin both cells from TRAPS patients and healthy controls in proportion to their ability to block mitochondrial ROS production but not simply respiration. These ndings suggest that mitochondrial ROS are requiredfor optimal inflammatory responses and may be a novel therapeutictarget in TRAPS and other autoinflammatory diseases.

Fagundes2, V. V. Costa1, D. Cisalpino1, D. F. Valada o1, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, BrazilDengue is one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases. There are no treatments or vaccines available and mechanismsinvolved in host response to infection are poorly understood. How- ever, there are several reports documenting the generation of free radicals after viral infections. Then, we evaluated the role played byreactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generationduring host response to primary DENV infection. To this end a mouse experimental model, utilizing a DENV-3 strain that causes a severe disease in mice was used. Wild-type (WT) infected mice showedincreased levels of ROS, NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO -) in spleen. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by Apocynin (APO) treatment or infection of gp91phox-/-mice and inhibition of iNOS by infection of iNOS-/-mice resulted in reduced ROS and NO production followed by ONOO-decreased generation. These animals presented a more severe disease manifestation after DENV infection, showing increased thrombocytopenia, marked hemoconcentration, elevated plasmatic transaminases activity, enhanced neutrophil arrest and tis-sue injury in liver and elevated systemic production of TNF-a and IL- 6. In addition, viral loads in spleen of all knockout and treated mice were markedly elevated and lethality rates after infection werestrikingly higher. Of note, APO treated, gp91phox -/-and iNOS-/- mice showed reduced ONOO-production after DENV infection, when compared to WT-infected mice, suggesting this specie is of great importance during host response to DENV infection. Hence,FeTPPs (a Peroxynitrite scavenger) treated mice showed markedsusceptibility to DENV-3 infection when compared with infected-WT mice. These data suggest that ROS and NO generation are essential for host ability to deal with DENV infection, in part through pro-motion ONOO -production and control viral Dengue, CAPES, ISCHEMIA/ REPERFUSION INJURY Gobbetti1,2,*, that proteases and proteinase-activated receptor (PARs) activation are involved in several intestinal inflam-matory conditions. We hypothesized that serine proteases could modulate the injury induced by acute mesenteric ischemia/ reperfusion.Methods: C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to 90 min of intestinalischemia followed by 0 or 2 h of reperfusion (I/R). Mice were treated with FUT-175, a potent serine-protease inhibitor or with the PAR 1antagonist SCH-79797. PAR 2-/-mice were subjected to I/R and compared to PAR 2+/+. Serine-protease activity was determined in plasma and intestinal tissues. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (an index of granulocyte recruitment), chemokine expression andwestern blot were performed on intestinal tissues.Results: After the ischemic period, plasma and tissue serine pro- tease activity levels were increased compared to the activity measures in tissues from sham, and this increase was maintainedfor 2 h after reperfusion. Trypsin 25 kDa band was detected in I/Rtissue. Mouse treatment with FUT-175 increased survival after I/R, inhibited tissue protease activity and also signicantly decreased MPO activity, KC and MCP-1 intestinal expression. We investi-gated whether serine proteases modulate byInflamm. Res. S79 123a mechanism dependent on PARs activation. MPO activity levels were signicantly reduced in I/R group treated with the PAR1antagonist SCH-79797 and in I/R PAR 2-/-compared respectively to vehicle group and PAR 2+/+mice. Conclusion: This study showed that increased proteolytic activity andPAR activation play an important role in intestinal I/R injury. Inhi-bition of PAR-activating serine proteases could be benecial to reduce post-ischemic tissue inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. Young Investigator Award Winner.

We hypothesized that PAR 2was important in resolving colitis by modulating the survival of colonic epithelial cells.Methods: (1) Colitis was induced in wild-type (WT) and PAR 2-/- C57Bl/6 mice by the oral administration of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 1 wk. Mice were either killed at the end of DSS treatment or maintained on regular drinking water for 4 more weeks.Colonic MPO activity and levels of PGE 2and PGD 2were determined for mice killed at the end of DSS treatment.

Results: (1) PAR 2-/-mice lost weight earlier than WT after DSS treatment compared to controls and had signicantly higher MPOlevels than WT at the earlier time point. Colonic PGE 2was increased in both strains after DSS treatment, while PGD 2was only increased in WT. PAR 2-/-mice showed increased levels of cellular inltration and loss of architecture at the later time point compared to WT.

OC-128 ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF RECOMBINANT LACTIC ACID BACTERIA DELIVERING ANTIPROTEASES AT THE MUCOSAL LEVELPROTECTS MICE Paris, France Imbalance between proteases and their endogenous inhibitors such as Elan or Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) has been identied in colonic tissues from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We tested here whether the administration of recombinantfood-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) expressing these protease inhibitors could restore the proteolytic balance and thus decrease inflammation in a mouse model of IBD.Methods: Colitis was induced in mice with DSS (5% in drinkingwater) for 7 days. During DSS exposure, mice were orally treated daily with either recombinant LAB (either Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus casei ) expressing Elan, SLPI or IL-10, or with wild- type (wt) LAB as a control. A L. lactis strain inactivated for the extracellular housekeeping protease HtrA was also used to express Elan and tested in the same model, to potentially increase the levels and quality of secreted proteins and thus activity of recombinantElan. At day 7, colonic tissues were analyzed for macroscopic damage scores, cytokines secretion and myeloperoxydase activity. Proteolytic activity (trypsin-like also assessed incolon washes.Results: Mice were signicantly protected against colitis by recom- binant LAB strains producing protease inhibitors, while wt LAB failed to modify any parameters of inflammation. All LAB strainsproducing Elan and SLPI were more efcient at decreasing intestinalinflammation induced by DSS treatment than the ones producing IL- 10. The protective effects of L. lactis expressing Elan were enhanced when htrA gene was inactivated. Conclusion: Oral treatments with recombinant LAB producing Elan or SLPI restored the proteolytic balance and protected mice from colitis. Food-grade LAB could be used as carriers of benecial proteins such as protease inhibitors (Elan and SLPI) for theirdelivery in the gut. Such recombinant bacteria could be considered as effective treatments to reduce inflammation in IBD. Disclosure of interest: None declared.S80 Inflamm.

France is a serine-proteinase contained azurophilic PR3 is specic anti-neutrophilcytoplasm antibodies in Wegener's granulomatosis. When PR3 is expressed at neutrophil plasma membrane, ANCA can bind to their antigen and activate neutrophils thus amplifying inflammation.PR3 can be externalized during expression interferes To investigate how PR3 could impair apoptotic and analysis PR3 colocalized phagocytosis. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that PR3 was associated with CRT in neutrophils. Direct interaction was observed between PR3 and CRT globular domain by SurfacePlasmon Resonance spectrometry. In order to understand the molec- ular mechanisms, we have used a model of stably PR3 transfected rat basophilic cell lines (RBL). Flow cytometry analysis showed that (1)PR3 and CRT were co-expressed at the plasma membrane duringapoptosis but not after RBL-PR3 degranulation; (2) PR3 and CRT expression phosphatidylserine externalization. Phagocytosis assay and PR3 binding impaired RBL phagocytosisby in vivo. Moreover, neutrophils from Wegener patients who expressed a high level of membrane PR3 are less eliminated by macrophages.Conclusion: PR3 might interfere with the safe disposal of apoptoticneutrophils. We demonstrated that PR3 amplied inflammation through a novel mechanism. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

We detected the gene locus using the SNP microarray-based homozy-gosity mapping following to determine the affected gene by direct sequencing. A mutation was found in a gene encoding the proteasome subunit in NNS patients. As predicted by structural modeling, frac-tioned analysis revealed assembly defect of proteasome and decreaseof all 3 different peptidase activities (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities). Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were detected in the cells and skin biopsy sections from patients withNNS by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The productionsof inflammatory cytokines were increased in cultured NNS cells compared with controls, as increased concentrations in sera from patients with NNS. Our ndings reveal that decrease of proteasomeactivity is associated with a novel mutation of the proteasome subunit in NNS. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might play an important role for inflammation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Chapeton Montes1, A. Plante1, P. Tessier1 1Infectious disease research center, Laval University, Quebec, Canada The Ca2+-binding proteins S100A9 and S100A8 are predominantly expressed by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. Once secre-ted, these proteins act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by triggering inflammatory responses. Indeed, previous studies showed that S100A9 induces leukocyte activation and pro-motes their migration toward inflammatory sites. Interestingly, high levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are found in the serums and at inflammatory sites of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases likerheumatoid arthritis, and these levels correlate with disease activity.In this study, neutralizing antibodies were used in the murine colla- gen-induced arthritis model to investigate the importance of S100A8 and S100A9 in rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-S100A8 or anti-S100A9mAbs were injected twice a week starting 1 day before arthritisinduction. Anti-S100A9 injections led to a 50% reduction of disease intensity while anti-S100A8 injection caused a worsening of the disease. The anti-S100A8-associated results are consistent with theInflamm. Res. S81 123anti-inflammatory properties of S100A8 protein after its oxidation. Lower bone destruction was observed in anti-S100A9-treated animalscompared to the isotype control group. Cytokine production was also decreased as exemplied by a marked reduction of IL-6 in serum of anti-S100A9-treated animals. Considering that human S100A9 indu-ces the and of MCP-1, MIP-1 a, IL-1b, and TNF- aby human peripheral blood mononu- clear cells, we suggest that S100A9 amplify the immune response through the production of pro-inflammatory soluble factors. Treat-ment with monoclonal anti-S100A9 may breach pro-inflammatory cytokine secre- tion and leukocyte migration, leading to less tissue destruction. Our results show that S100A9 is a potential therapeutic target in inflam-matory diseases unlike S100A8 which seems to be relevant in theresolution of inflammation.

Vlasuk3, T. van der Poll1 1Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands,2Statistical department, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,3Sirtris, A GSK Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States Background and Aim: SRT2104 is a highly selective small molecule activator of the silent information regulator transcript (SIRT1) thathas broad anti-inflammatory effects in cell cultures and rodents. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of SRT2104 on the inflammatory and coagulation responses in normal healthy malesubjects after exposure to LPS.Methods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisted of three treatment arms (N =8 per arm): (1) Oral SRT2104 (2 g/day) for seven consecutive days; (2) placebo on days 1-6 and SRT2104(2 g) on day 7; (3) placebo for seven consecutive days; on day 7, allsubjects received intravenous LPS 3 =0.0777 and 0.0318 for groups 1 and 2 vs. group 3, respec- tively) and IL-8 (p =0.0470 and 0.0249, respectively). There lower TNF aand IL-10 levels. SRT2104 attenuated coagulation lowered plasma lev-els of the prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 concentration (p =0.0384 and 0.0368, respectively). SRT2104 did not impact LPS-induced changes in gene expression proles of blood leukocytes as determinedby whole genome arrays performed before and 4 h after LPS. CRPlevels measured 24 h post-LPS were signicantly lower in the SRT2104 group 2 versus placebo (p =0.0179). Clinical signs asso- ciated with LPS tended to be reduced after SRT2104 administration.AEs were primarily those expected following LPS.Conclusion: This is the rst clinical study to demonstrate biological responses consistent with the activation of SIRT1 by a small mole- cule. release and activation of coagulation. The effects on coagulation are differentiated from those previously observed forsteroid agents in a similar setting and suggest a unique potential as a therapeutic strategy for inflammatory disease.Disclosure of interest: None declared. OC-133 NEXT GENERATION THERAPEUTICS FOR THETREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES\u2014 DISCOVERY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF AN INHALABLE HIGHLY POTENT AND SPECIFICANTI-IL-4RA SMALL PROTEIN ANTAGONIST A. M. Hohlbaum1,*, K. Jensen1, A. A. AG, Freising, Germany Anticalins are a new class of therapeutic proteins based on human lipocalins. We reasoned that given the diversity of compounds thatthese molecules can naturally bind, it should be possible to engineer and identify Anticalins with specicity for IL-4Ra, a receptor known to play a key role in allergy and asthma pathogenesis.Methods and results: Phage display technology was used to isolate a human tear lipocalin-derived Anticalin to specically recognize human IL-4Ra with low picomolar potency. The protein can beexpressed at high yield using a scalable E.coli process and exhibitsdrug-like properties (Tm of 64 /C176C + refolding after thermal denatur- ation) and resistance to multiple stress conditions. A dissociation constant of Kd =14 pM was measured for the interaction with human IL-4Ra by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The cross-reactivity prole, competitive antagonistic properties and potency towards both the IL-4Ra/gamma and the IL4Ra/IL13Ra receptor complexes were conrmed in FACS-based binding studies usingtransfected cells and multiple disease relevant cell-based assays. Furthermore, Anticalins can also be effectively delivered by inhala- tion to the lung, due in part to their relative small size of 17 kDa androbust biophysical properties, and exhibit an extended pulmonaryhalf-life in rodents. Conclusions: Our data describe the discovery and characterization of an inhalable IL-4Ra Anticalin (PRS-060), a potential therapeutic forthe treatment of allergic diseases, including asthma. PRS-060 displaysnumerous differentiating features posited to be relevant for the pro- posed therapeutic concept, including, but not limited to inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13-dependent pathways with high potency, localadministration and action in the lung via the inhaled route, favourablesafety and tolerability (human scaffold, lack of immune effector cell interactions due to the absence of an Fc domain), robustness (dry powder formulation) and low production costs.Disclosure of interest: AG, NEUTROPHILS EXTRAVASATION IL-1 J.

Lundahl1 1Department of Medicine, unit Allergy,2Karolin ska Biomics Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,3Uppsala Clinical Center Hospital, Uppsala,4Department of Nephrology, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden The aim was to scrutinize gene activation following neutrophil in vivo extravasation and IL-1 in vitro stimulation in healthy study subjectsand to address the question if neutrophils render a potential to tune thecomposition of inflammatory mediators. In vivo extravasated neutro- phils were collected by the skin chamber method and compared to circulating neutrophils following a density separation. Gene expres-sion was assessed by gene array and conrmed by quantitative PCR.Protein expression of selected markers was assessed by flow cytom- etry, immunoelectron microscopy and ELISA. Expression of the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) increased following extravasation at bothgene and protein level. Flow cytometry indicated an increased surface expression that was further induced following stimulation. Immuno- electron microscopy conrmed an increased pool of IL-1R1 both at thecell surface as well as intracellular, following extravasation. Further-more, NFkB1 CCL20 were extravasation, and the corresponding chemokines were locally pro-duced at high concentrations at the inflammatory site. In addition, IL-1in vitro activation of puried granulocytes induced an increased gene expression of NFkB, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20 and CXCL2, similar to gene activation following extravasation. Furthermore, a release ofCCL3 and CCL4 was detected following 5 h of in vitro IL-1 stimu- lation. The present results indicate that neutrophils could tune the pro- inflammatory milieu following extravasation and IL-1 stimulation bythe production of chemokines. This renders the neutrophil a potential to bridge the consecutive accumulation of mononuclear leukocytes.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-002 ACTION ON P-SELECTIN AND ICAM-1EXPRESSION CONTRIBUTE TO POTENTIAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF CROTOXIN, A TOXIN FROM RATTLESNAKEVENOM M. C. Cirillo1,*, F. P. B. Nunes1, M. Instituto Butantan, the main of Crotalus durissus terricus crotoxin inhibits paw edema, and consequently cell migration induced by carra- geenan. Leukocyte-endothelium interaction induced by carrageenan involves adhesion molecules expression, such as P-Selectin andICAM-1. The aim of this study was to demonstrate histologically the inhibitory effect of crotoxin on cell migration to the subcuta- neous tissue of footpads injected with carrageenan, and investigatethe effect of this toxin on ICAM-1 and P-Selectin expression atthis tissue. A single dose of crotoxin (0.89lg/50lL s.c.) or saline (control) was administered 1 h before carrageenan (300 lg/50lL) or saline intraplantar injection in mice. For histological analysis,the footpad was removed 6 h after carrageenan. The tissue wasprocessed and sections were stained with H/E. To evaluate P-Selectin and ICAM-1 expression, the footpad of the treated animals with crotoxin was removed 30 min or 1 h after carra-geenan and analyzed by immunohistochemical. Tissues were incubated with antibody against these adhesion molecules and incubated with secondary antibody peroxidase conjugate. Histo-logical analyses showed that the treatment with crotoxin (1 h)reduced edema and cellular inltration when compared to control. The same treatment decreased the expression of P-Selectin and ICAM-1 when compared to control. These results suggest that theinhibitory effect of crotoxin on cell migration involves the actionof this toxin on the expression of these adhesion molecules plays a key role in inflammation. These results contribute to characteriza- tion of anti-inflammatory properties of the crotoxin and reinforcethat this toxin is a potential natural product in controlling inflam-matory diseases.

Themechanisms of action of Amblyomin-X, a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor from the cDNA library of the Amblyomma ca- jennense tick, were here characterized in the (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis.Methods: In was carried out in the dorsal skin chamber in male Swiss mice and optical microscopy eval- uation was performed in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane(CAM). t-End cell lineage was simultaneously treated with amblyomin- X and VEGF and employed to quantify cell migration and tube for- mation by optical microscopy; cell adherence to matrigel by colorimetric assay; apoptosis, necrosis, proliferation, cell cycle andadhesion molecules expression by flow cytometry.Results: Topical application of Amblyomin-X, simultaneously to VEGF, inhibited the VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the mice dorsal subcutaneous microvasculature and in the CAM .Treatment of t-End with Amblyomin-X delayed the cell cycle by maintaining them in G0/ G1 phase; inhibited cell migration, adherence, proliferation, ICAM-1, expressions.Conclusion: VEGF-induced angi-ogenesis by affecting endothelial cells functions involved in different steps of the process. Besides contributing to the comprehension of pathophysiological mechanisms of Kunitz type-serine proteaseinhibitors, data herein have shown support further studies focusing onAmblyomin-X as a scientic tool to the design of therapeutic molecules.

Janczewska1,*, M. Zaleska1, W. L. Olszewski1,2 1Department of Surgical Research & Transplantology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences,2Department of Transplantation Surgery, Central Clinical Hospital, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Warsaw, Poland Circulating polymorphonuclear leucocytes are recruited in the wound by soluble mediators, causing cell adherence, transcapillary migration and chemotaxis. In a later stage T cells play a modulatory role in woundhealing, although the full range of their effects is incompletely under-stood. There is no evidence that B lymphocytes play a signicant role in wound healing. Aim. The question arises which and when immune cells and their specic subsets accumulate in the fast and delayed healingwounds. This applies particularly to lower limb non-healing ulcers.Methods. In order to dene which blood immune cells reveal predi- lection for wound cells or matrix, an in vitro adherence test was worked out. Briefly, cryopreserved tissue sections were covered with bloodleukocyte suspension at 4 /C176C, incubated for 30 min, the non-adherent cells were washed out. This test allowed to show (a) adhesion to broblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, matrix, (b) phenotypes cells stained with monoclonal antibodies. Venous ulceredge biopsy specimens obtained from 15 patients and skin frag- ments of ve healthy undergoing various vein surgery were studied. Results: Ulcers. Neutrophils adhered to granulation tissue aroundcapillaries and to matrix, forming clusters. Few adhered to broblasts.They also stuck to epidermis. CD68+ve and elastase+ve monocytes were evenly distributed close to capillary lumen. Few scattered irregularly distributed CD3 T cells were seen on granulation tissue butnone on epidermis. On normal skin section adherence of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes was almost nil. Interestingly, all celltypes strongly adhered to glass. Conclusions. Preponderance of neu- trophils and monocytes over lymphocytes on granulation tissue sections suggests presence of a signal for their accumulation as in thescavenging phase of wound healing. The signal might be microbesand autoimmune tissue-antigen-specic cohorts of granulocytes and lymphocytes. None declared. P-005 MICRORNA MIR-150 REGULATES Q. Zheng1, Q.-S. Mi1,* 1Immunology Program, Henry Ford Health Detroit, USA CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T ( iNKT) cells play an impor- tant role in the regulation of diverse immune responses, includingallergy, autoimmunity, and cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of 21-25 nt single-stranded non-coding small RNAs, are increasingly being recognized as important regulators of gene expression through theinhibition of effective mRNA translation. We recently reported thatmiRNAs expressed in iNKT cell lineage are potent regulators of iNKT cell development, maturation, and function. However, the role of spe- cic miRNAs in the iNKT cells has not been addressed yet. Using miRNA arrays, we found that the expression of miR-150 was signi-cantly upregulated in mature iNKT cells compared to immature iNKT cells in the thymus. Interestingly, mice with miR-150 deciency have a defect in iNKT cell development in the thymus and iNKT cell matura- tion was blocked at developmental stage 1 and 2, while the peripheraliNKT cells maturated normally. Furthermore, miR-150-decient peripheral iNKT cells produce more cytokine interferon-gamma com- pared to that of wild type after PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Thus, ourresults suggest that miR-150 controls iNKT cell thymic maturation and regulates iNKT cell function. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-006 EFFECTS OF METFORMIN ON ANGIOGENESIS ASSESSED AS PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION OF HUMAN UMBILICAL VEIN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS N. Esfahanian1,*, Y.

Res. 123synthesis, and transcription. Recent epidemiological studies demon- strate that Metformin lowers the risk for several types of cancer indiabetic patients. Concerning the critical role of angiogenesis in the incidence and progression of tumors, we investigated the effect of Metformin on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)proliferation and migration and its possible mechanism by inhibitingAMPK signaling using Compound C. Method: We studied the effect of Metformin on morphology and viability of HUVECs using MTT and LDH assays, proliferation by MTT and cellnumbering, and migration by wound repair method. Moreover, the effectof Metformin on VEGFR2 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Metformin at concentrations of 0.5-3 mM effectively reduced the number of endothelial cells by 5.5-55%, without being cytotoxic to thesecells. Similarly, the cell proliferation and migration were markedly(P\\0.001) inhibited by Metformin. The inhibitory effects of Metformin on the endothelial cells number and migration were reversed partially by Compound C (P \\0.01). Interestingly, compound C (10 mM) alone showed a slight but signicant inhibitory effect on the endothelial cells number (16%) and migration (16.5%). Metformin at the studied con- centrations had no signicant effect on VEGFR2 expression. This studyindicates Metformin exerts potent anti-angiogenic effects on HU-VECs and AMPK activity, at least in part, is required for this effect.

A peculiarity of M-colin is to ligands on autologous neutrophils ormonocytes, but the physiological function of this binding is unknown.Our aim was to analyze the responses induced by M-colin interaction with neutrophils and to evaluate whether leukosialin related to cell adhesion, andmigration, is a potential target receptor for the M-colin. We conrmed that biotinylated rM-colin binds to neutrophils via a calcium-depen- dent interaction inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), thus involving its capacity to bind acetylated ligands including sialic acid.Interestingly, binding of rM-colin inhibited neutrophils labeling with anti-CD43 mAb, but not with antibodies to another membrane glyco- protein, CD66. The effect of rM-colin on CD43 immunolabeling wasabolished by GlcNAc but not of CD43 by exogenous M-colin. Fluorescence an even distribution of biotinylated-rM-colin on resting neutrophil surface at 4 /C176C but a polar redistribution at 37 /C176C, similar tothe antibody-induced capping of CD43. Exposure to recombinant M-colin triggered neutrophil functions, such as aggregation, adhesionand respiratory burst in a dose-dependent manner, effects already described for CD43 antibody cross-linking. The Y271F mutant of M-colin, unable to bind sialic acid, was unable to enhance neutrophilactivation and did not prevent access of anti-CD43 mAb to its antigen.These results strongly suggest that CD43 is a receptor for M-colin and show that M-colin interaction with the cell surface, possibly via the cross-linking of CD43, induces potent neutrophil activation.Disclosure of interest: None P-008 NEUTROPHILS AND COMPLEMENT ACTIVATE EACH OTHER'S. AN INFLAMMATIONAMPLIFICATION LOOP FURTHER ENHANCED BY ANCA L. Halbwachs-Mecarelli1,*, France Knock-out mice from experimental inflammatory diseases shed new light on an important participation of the complement alternative pathway in neutrophil-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). We have recently described an activation of the complement alternative pathway by TNF-stimulated neutrophils (PMN). We now analyzed the conse-quences of this activation. PMN, stimulated or not with TNF, wereincubated with normal human serum or sera immunodepleted in C5, C2 or factor B, to distinguish classical and alternative pathways involvement. PMN activation was assessed by flow cytometry mea-surement of CD11b expression or oxidative burst. Complementactivation on the surface of PMN, stimulated by coagulation-derived products or by TNF, further activated enhancing lation C5-depleted empha- sizing the role of C5a and on TNF-stimulated adherent PMNa condition known to allow the access of ANCAs to their antigens. This activation involved the classical pathway but amplication by the alternative pathway was required. Microparticles, released byPMN in vitro and highly present in plasma of acute vasculitis patients,efciently activated the complement alternative pathway. In conclu- sion, PMN activate the complement alternative pathway, which, in turn, amplies PMN pro-inflammatory responses, thus representing anew amplifying loop in the inflammation process. This mechanismprobably explains the complement involvement in PMN-mediated diseases such as ANCA-associated vasculitis. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Using three SVMPs, we evaluated the participation of different domains in alterations of the leukocyte-endothelial interactions induced byBothrops venoms in the microcirculation of the cremaster of mice. We also evaluated, by immunofluorescence and ELISA, the expres- sion of used were: P3 SVMP with a hem- which has catalytic, disintegrin-like, and cysteine- rich domains; JAR-C, a degraded form of JAR devoid only of thecatalytic domain, with no hemorrhagic activity; and BnP1, a weaklyhemorrhagic P1 SVMP, which has only the catalytic domain. Toxins (0.5lg) or PBS (100 lL) were injected into the scrotal bag of mice. Adhered and emigrated leukocytes were counted in a post-capillaryvenule by intravital microscopy 2, 4 or 24 h after the injections. Thenumber of adhered and emigrated cells increased in all times studied. Adhered cells diminished after 24 h of the toxins injection when compared to 2 h, but emigrated cells signicantly increased in thisperiod. There was a signicant increase in the expression of CD54 after 2 and 4 h, followed by a decrease 24 h after the injection. We observed a time-related increase in expression of CD31 in endothelialcells during the period studied. The number of adhered and migratedcells was consistent with the expression of CD54 and CD31, respectively. Despite the differences in hemorrhagic activities and in domain compositions of the toxins used, all of them induced similaralterations in leukocyte-endothelial interactions. The results suggestthat the alterations induced by these SVMPs in the microcirculation are associated to the expression of CD54 and CD31.

RU treatment also enhanced L-selectin and decreased b2-inte- grin expressions in circulating neutrophils, and only L-selectinenhancement was reversed by both TSPO ligands. RU treatment did not affect adhesion molecules expression on circulating lymphocytes, but additional incubation vitro Ro5-4864 leukocyte-endothe- lium interactions evoked by RU treatment, which may be dependent on alterations on adhesion molecules expression.

In this study, to dene the molecular signature of CD4+memory T cells, we investigated the gene expression prole and methylome of antigen specic memoryCD4 +T cells generated using T cells from DO11.10 OVA specic TCR transgenic mice. More than 12 million 50-end tags were sequenced from na \u00a8ve effector and memory T cell libraries with a next generation sequencer, corresponding to approximately 12,000-14,000different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. Several novel up- and down-regulated genes were found in memory CD4 +Tc e l l s , which are possible candidate genes related to development andmaintenance of the memory phase. In addition, when the genome-wide DNA methylation prole was investigated in memory CD4 T cells, 466 DMRs (differentially methylated regions) in 438 genes wereidentied. Interestingly, most DMRs in na \u00a8ve and memory T cells were demethylated during T cell differentiation. Moreover, the majority of the DMRs were localized to intronic sites and not to CpG islands. Among these DMRs, only 5% were correlated with expressedgenes that related ' and' 'immune response' '. Moreover, these DMR were different between various T cell subsets, indicating that the methylation status of T cell subsets reflects T cell conditions. Our ndings indicate that the genesassociated with DMR are key genes related to memory phenotype that undergo variable changes in DNA methylation during CD4 cell Mitic1, S.

Depletion of C sensory neurons was performed byneonatal administration of capsaicin, while systemic depletion of MCwas performed by successive injections of increasing doses of com- pound 48/80 in adult rats. The result showed that neonatal depletion of C sensory neurons diminished Con A-induced increase in paw diameterand plasma extravasation, while MC depletion increased both param- eters. Although opposing effects on paw diameter and plasma extravasation were recorded, both treatments similarly reduced theinflux of immune cells to inflamed paws. However, both treatments ledto the decrease in proportion of T cells and increase in proportion of resident macrophages in draining lymph nodes (DLN). According toresults, neuropeptides secreted from activated C sensory neurons have pivotal role in acquiring local inflammatory response, influencing both vascular and cellular components. On the other hand, mediatorsreleased from MC are not indispensable for inflammatory edema for-mation, but are critical for cell recruitment to the inflammatory focus. Mediators secreted either from C sensory neurons or MC also affect microenvironment in DLN during Con A-induced inflammation.Supported by: Grant No 145049 by the Ministry of Science Republicof Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.

Biologia Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro,Brazil, 3Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Harbor, MI, USA Diverse evidence supports the hypothesis that in hemorrhagic and hemolytic episodes free heme might be responsible for the inflamma- tory response in the lung. Starting to the premise that the alveolar macrophages (AM) is the main defender of lung environment, weinvestigated the effects of free heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) in alve- olar macrophage activation. Heme stimulation is able to increases AM responsiveness, enhances IL-1 b, IL-6 and IL-10 release, induces HO-1 expression and stimulates ROS production by rat AM. In addition,heme stimulation induces p47 phoxphosphorylation, 5-LO and FLAP expression, as well as NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that these proteins can be related to pro-inflammatory effects by heme inAM. All these events are directly involved in microbicidal functions ofmacrophages and prompted us to investigate the role of heme in these functions. In this study, we observed that heme induces phagocytosis and bacterial killing, key events responsible by pathogens removal.Taken together, these results suggest a role for heme as a proinflam- matory agent able to induce antimicrobicidal activity in alveolar macrophage. The understanding of the effect of heme in pulmonaryinflammatory processes can lead to the establishment of new strategiesto ameliorate tissue damage associated with hemorrhagic episodes and severe Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Galectin-9 (Gal-9) was initially characterized as a potent eosinophil chemoattractant but has subsequently been found to have profound immunosuppressive effects in models of collagen-induced arthritis,acute graft versus host disease and carrageenan paw oedema. Itseffects on neutrophil recruitment and behaviour during inflammation have not been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of the present study were therefore to investigate whether Gal-9 modulates neutro-phil recruitment during the acute inflammatory response. Todetermine the effect of Gal-9 on leukocyte trafcking in vivo a model of Mice were pre-injected i.p. with Gal-9 (1-30 lg) followed by 0.2 mg zymosan. Peritoneal la- vages were collected and leukocyte influx assessed. To pinpointwhether Gal-9 affects a specic step of the leukocyte recruitment cascade flow chamber assays were performed. Freshly isolated quantied random elds. The effect of Gal-9 on neutrophil annexin V expression, ERK phosphorylation and adhesion was also assessed. Pre-treatment with Gal-9 resulted in asignicant increase in the numbers of neutrophils and monocyte/ macrophages recruited into the peritoneal cavity. The flow chamber experiments identied a specic effect of Gal-9 on neutrophil trans-migration with a concomitant reduction in neutrophil rolling,signicant at 10 nM. In contrast to other galectins, Gal-9 was found to induce Annexin V exposure in the absence of other activating stimuli and also induced ERK phosphorylation. These data indicate a role forGal-9 in neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-018 MICROARRAY PROFILING OF MOUSE AND HUMAN MACROPHAGES D. C. Lacey1,*, H. Dinh1, A. Achuthan1, A. D. Cook1, G. Scholz1, and granulocyte macrophage- CSF can induce the survival, activation anddifferentiation of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Murine bonemarrow-derived macrophage populations are often used as models of human monocyte-derived populations; it is unknown how similar the various cell populations are when differentiated in the presence ofM-CSF or GM-CSF. We have used microarray to determine how similar are the respective gene expression proles of murine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and GM-CSF-induced MDM We found that there were 4,206 genes (20%) different between BMM and GM-BMM,but only 17% of these differentially expressed genes were identicalacross the species. By gene ontology (GO) classication, 34 and 41% of differentially expressed GO categories in the mouse and human gene lists, respectively, were common across the species; however, 84% ofthe most signicant 50 differentially expressed GO categories were common.

In conclusion, BMM and GM-BMM would appear to be reasonable models for human monocyte-derived macrophage populations when relative geneexpression in response to M-CSF and GM-CSF is analyzed at the ''pathway'' level rather than at the level of individual genes.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-019 CHARACTERIZATION OF VISFATIN AS A NOVELATHEROGENIC TARGET: VISFATIN PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS BY INDUCING AND MACROPHAGE TRAPPING M. R. Yun1,*, H.-Y. Park1 1Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Korea National Institute of Health, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea Objective: Visfatin is a novel proinflammatory adipokine secreted from adipocytes, which has been linked to atherosclerotic plaque formation, recently. However, controversial results exist about the roleof visfatin in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, weinvestigated whether visfatin could regulate monocyte/macrophage differentiation and expression of scavenger receptors (SRs), contain- ing CD36, SR-A, and lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor-1(LOX-1), responsible for foam cell formation in macrophages, a critical step in atherogenesis. Methods and Results: The monocytic incubation phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in the presence or absence of visfatin. In this study, we show that visfatin enhanced the oxLDL uptake by inducing CD36 and LOX-1 expression, but not SR-A, and led to theproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a.We also found that PMA-induced THP-1 cells became more adherent with a concomitant increase of ICAM-1 protein in the presence of visfatin. Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed thatvisfatin induces peripheral membrane polymerization, suggesting that visfatin alters morphology and cyto- skeletal organization. Visfatin-induced effects were as determined by inhibition with JNK inhibitor, observed activation of JNK by visfatin. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that visfatin promote PMA-induced THP-1 cell differentiation into trapping macrophagephenotype and contribute to macrophage foam cell formation byincreasing CD36 and LOX-1 expression and inflammatory cytokine production, consequently leading to the progression of atherosclerosis.

Res. 123regulation of the leukocyte migration in response to inflammatory stimuli has not been fully elucidated. We assessed the effects ofnicotinamide on neutrophil recruitment in the pleural cavity of mice, and the microcirculation of the murine cremaster muscle using intravital microscopy. BALB/c mice were treated with nicotinamideper os (Nic, 1,000 mg kg -1) 30 min before and 1 h after challenge with an intrapleural injection of carrageenan (Cg, 4, 500 ng/cav- ity). Neutrophil migration was assessed 4 h after the challengethrough pleural wash. To perform intravital microscopy studies,BALB/c mice were pretreated with Nic (1,000 mg kg -1) 30 min before and 1 h after challenge with Cg (100 lg directly added to cremaster muscle). Rodamine number of rolling and adher-ent leukocytes was determined during video analysis. Nic (1,000 mg kg -1) inhibited the neutrophil recruitment induced by Cg (PBS, 1.9 Cg, 27.1 ***Nic + LTB 4, 0.8 \u00b10.2). Moreover, Nic neutrophils p\\0.05, ** p\\0.01, *** p\\0.001, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post test). Nic was able to inhibit the neu-trophil migration in response to different inflammatory stimuli, in addition to its ability to reduce neutrophil rolling and adhesion. Thus, Nic could be useful since its parameters of biosecurity and pharma-cokinetics have already been dened. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-021 EGFR MEDIATED INFLAMMATION AND PROLIFERATION IN LUNG CELL (A549) S. Kundu1,* 1Department of Zoology, University of Calcutta, Koklkata, India Exposure to cadmium is associated with the development of pul- monary damage such as emphysema and lung cancer. This metal is also a powerful inducer of different proinflammatory and cell cycleregulatory proteins in many biologic models. Previously we showedthat prolonged exposure of low concentration of cadmium resulted in up regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and cell cycle reg- ulatory molecules in mice lung cell. The present study wasundertaken to determine molecular mechanism of inflammation and its relation to cell proliferation in a transformed human lung ade- nocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549) in response to cadmiumchloride. In comparative studies, we examine that short-durationexposure to lower doses of cadmium signicantly increase the growth of A549 cells, whereas, higher doses are toxic and cause cell death. We also observed that cadmium induced elevatedexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) like IL-1 b, TNF- a, IL-6. The possible occurrence of cell proliferation events was evaluated via analysis of the physical state of the DNA and the expression ofKi67 and PCNA. We also checked the pattern of expression of different cell cycle regulatory molecules involved in the onset of cell proliferation. Our results indicate that cadmium treatmentappears to induce inflammatory and growth responses in trans-formed A549 cell line by activating epidermal growth factor receptor and its downstream modulators. These results may con- tribute to better understand the toxic mechanism of cadmiummoreover; the expression prole of cadmium induced regulatory molecules could provide potential biomarkers for cadmiumexposure.

UNIFESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is a major obstacle to the establishment of survival of the transplanted kidney. The trait most associated with the decline of renal function in this pathology is theinterstitial tubule brosis (FTI) and tubular atrophy (TA). Recentstudies suggest that certain interstitial myobroblasts derive from renal tubular cells that have undergone the process of epithelial- mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). In this study, the objectivewas to induce the transdifferentiation of epithelial cells derived fromhuman proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2), using as inducer hydrogen peroxide. Methods: To this end, epithelial cells were incubated with Keratinocyte-SFM medium (GIBCO) with 5% fetal calf serum(GIBCO), deprived of serum during the experiment. Cells weretreated with concentrations of H 2O2(0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 2.0 mM/mL) and evaluated in the time of incubation for 24, 48 and 72 h for induction of EMT by oxidative stress. TGF-b was used inconcentration (10 ng/mL) as positive control. Cells without treatment were used with negative control. Evidence was given by EMT microscopy, cell viability, cell motility and immunocytochemistry ofmolecules related to the process, such as cytokeratin, E-cadherin,vimentin and a-SMA. Results: We observed the cell viability assay that the better dose to sublethal condition was 0.25 mM/mL at 24, 48 and 72 h in relationship to control, but when tested with cellmotility, the doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mM H 2O2, when done for 48 and 72 h, provided the best results of migration, supported by immunocytochemistry analysis, in which cells are subjected to oxidative stress by altering the expression of surface proteins ofepithelial cells begin to express proteins mesenchymal cells. Conclusion: This study provides that H 2O2can be used to induce transdifferentiation of epithelial cell in the dose of 0.50 mM in thetime of 72 h.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-023 STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS FORREGULATION OF MACROPHAGE AND OSTEOCLAST DEVELOPMENT AND ACTIVATION BY PSTPIP2 Chitu1,*, V. Nacu1, H. Ketchum1, E. R.

This phenotype closely resembles human chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (Ferguson et al. 2006). PSTPIP2 is expressed predominantly in macrophages and osteoclasts (Chitu andStanley 2007) and regulates their differentiation and activation invitro and in vivo. Absence of PSTPIP2 in cmo mice leads to the expansion of myeloid progenitors thus priming macrophage and osteoclast differentiation. In to wt macrophages,cmo macrophages produce more osteoclastogenic cytokines in response to LPS challenge. Structure-function studies reveal that interactions of PSTPIP2 with PTP-PEST and membrane phospho- lipids are critical for its ability to control the development andactivation of macrophages and osteoclasts.

Applied Toxinology, Butantan Institute,2Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: TLRs expressed in endothelial cells and leukocytes are pattern recognition receptors that detect invading microorganisms andsterile molecules to trigger immune and inflammatory responses. TLRactivity is closely linked to the risk of many inflammatory diseases and immune disorders. Combined proteomic and transcriptomic approaches applied to analyze Thalassophryne nattereri venom complexity revealed the identity of the major toxins as a family ofnew proteins displaying kininogenase activity, the Natterins. Objective: In this study, we investigated the modulation of TLR activity by Natterins and the underlying mechanism.Methods and results: Interaction of leukocytes with cremaster micro- vessels was monitored by using an (0.01 lg/mL) or PAR4 agonist (0.02 lg/mL) in 20 lL were administered topically in cremaster muscle after 6 h of treatment with Natterins (0.02 lg/mL) injected by intraescrotal route. When rolling behavior was determinedafter topical application of LPS or KC in mice pre-treated with Natterins,the proportions of rolling leukocytes in venules were almost the same in control-mice. In contrast, no inhibitory effect was observed in Natterins- treated mice challenged with topical application of PAR4 agonist. Theanti-inflammatory effect of Natterins was not modied by metyrapone orZnPP IX. Finally, the rolling of leukocytes induced by LPS or KC was not impaired in Natterins-treated TLR2 KO,M y D 8 8 KOor TLR4 mutant mice, indicating that TLR2- or TLR4-MyD88-mediated signals arerequired for the anti-inflammatory effect induced by Natterins. Conclusion: These data provide a molecular level explanation for the anti-inflammatory function of Natterins in LPS- or KC-inducedinflammation that on CNPq.

Aghyani1, M. Ebadi1, N. Esfahanian2 1Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,2Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran Corneal neovascularization is a side effect of numerous inflammatory and non-inflammatory ocular surface disorders. During corneal injury, angiogenic factors are released from both corneal cells and inltratinginflammatory immune cells. The angiogenic factors induce endothe-lial cells proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis. Angiomotin, an angiostatin binding protein, is involved in endothelial migration during angiogenesis. Angiomotin protein is a key factor for endo-thelial migration. Therefore, blockade of Angiomotin function will leads to inhibition of angiogenesis. In this study we evaluated the expression of Angiomotin in alkali induced inflammatory cornealneovascularization in mice. A total of 20 BALB/c mice divided intotwo groups for this study. First, animals were anesthetized by administration of ketamine and xylazine combination intraperitone- ally. Further topical anesthesia induced by 0.5% proparacainehydrochloride on animals right cornea. Alkali burn corneal neovas-cularization induced by a silver nitrate cauterization technique. Mice were sacriced 3 and 6 days post injury and eyes were enucleated for analysis. Corneas were removed and RNA was extracted usingTRIzol reagent. The rst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 lgo f total RNA. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression master mix and specic primers and probes of Beta-actinand Angiomotin genes. The results showed that Angiomotin expres-sion increases during corneal neovascularization. Angiomotin expression increased in both groups of animals and its expression was higher in day 6 in comparison to day 3. The results of thisstudy conrm the over-expression of Angiomotin during inflam-matory induced corneal neovascularization. Based on these results, we here propose this idea that Angiomotin can be a new target for designing new therapeutic option for corneal neovascularization.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-026 REGULATION OF NEUTROPHIL FUNCTIONBY NAMPT DURING INFLAMMATION K. J. R. J.

Nampt [nicotinamide phosphor-ibosyltransferase, pre-B-cell inflam- matory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, Nampt also functions in the regulation of NAD metabolism. In view of theimportance of NAD in the control of neutrophil activities, such as the action of the NADPH oxidase, we investigated the role of Nampt in neutrophil apoptosis and the control of functions such as the respi-ratory burst.S90 Inflamm. Res. apoptosis, and the turnover of the anti-apoptotic proteinMcl-1. However, it did not have any signicant effect on functions such as chemotaxis and the respiratory burst. Inhibition of the enzy- matic activity of Nampt (using the inhibitor FK866/APO866 atconcentrations from 1 to 100 nM) inhibited the activity of therespiratory burst in a time and dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of Nampt also signicantly inhibited transcription of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF a. These data conrm the importance of Nampt in regulating neutrophil apoptosis, but reveal a new function forNampt in controlling functions that would contribute to the inflam- matory process. Therapeutic inhibition of Nampt in inflammatory diseases would be predicted to decrease the release of tissue-dam-aging reactive oxygen species and the release of pro-inflammatorycytokines from activated neutrophils.

It has been shown thatBjV induces a signicant leukocytes accumulation, manly neutro-phils, at the local tissue damage. In the present study we investigate the contribution of Bj-LMWF to induce lung leukocyte influx after gastrocnemius intramuscular injection. The Bj-LMWF was obtainedthrough a Millipore centrifuge device with a molecular weight cut-off 10KDa. To conrm the absence of proteolytic enzymes or others proteins ( [10 kDa) of the venom, the ltrate contained the was analysed by SDS-PAGE silver stained, gelatinolyticactivity and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The lung leukocyte influx was induced in male Swiss mice by injection of BjV (1.2 mg/ kg) or Bj-LMWF (0.24 mg/kg), in gastrocnemius muscle. Cellinflux was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage at 15 min, 1, 6 and24 h after venom or Bj-LMWF injection. Results showed that BjV and Bj-LMWF evoked a signicant cell accumulation in the lung from 6 up to 24 h following the injection. Differential cell countsfrom BjV mice demonstrated that neutrophils were the predominantcells accumulating at 6 h and mononuclear cells at 24 h. Bj-LMWF signicantly increased the number of neutrophils at 6 h as well as mononuclear cells at 6 and 24 h. In conclusion, both BjV andBj-LMWF have a similar activity as pro-inflammatory response to lung leukocyte migration. The fact that Bj-LMWF induces inflammation suggests that non-enzymatic peptides elicit inflam-matory events perhaps by interacting with specic cell membraneacceptors. Financial support:FAPESP.

It is known that me- talloproteases is the main class of toxins involved in the inflammatory activity of this venom. A protein related to mammals high molecularmass kininogen (HK), puried from the plasma of Bj snakes wastested on inflammatory activity of Bj venom in vivo ,using intravital microscopy. Bj venom (1 or Jararhagin (0.5 a hem- orrhagic metalloproteinase isolated from Bj venom, incubated or notwith BjHK (2 lg) were injected (100 lL) into the scrotal bag of mice. The microcirculation of cremaster muscle was analyzed 2 or 24 h after the injections. We analyzed a segment of a post-capillary venuleduring 5 min and counted adhered and emigrated leukocytes, com-paring with the observed in control group injected with sterile buffered saline. Results showed that, in groups injected with Bj venom or JAR, adhered and emigrated leukocytes were signicantlyincreased in all times studied. Adhered cells were diminished after24 h of the toxins injection, when compared to 2 h, but emigrated cells were signicantly increased. When incubated with BjHK, the Bj venom or JAR did not induce alterations of leukocyte-endothelialinteractions in the microcirculation. This inhibition was similar to theobserved when Bj venom and JAR were treated with o-phenanthro- line, despite of the mechanism of action of BjHK on the catalytic activity of JAR not be like a chelating agent. We can conclude thatBjHK inhibits the inflammatory activity of the Bj venom by inhibiting the activity of their metalloproteinases.

Experimentally, the venom of the Crotalus durissus terricus (CdtV) shows a signicant anti-inflammatory reactioninduced by thioglycolate or carrageenan. Still, the CdtV alters some functions of macrophages, cells that in chronic inflammatory pro- cesses are fused to form multinucleated giant cells (MGC).

After an ion exchange chromatography of CdtV, three different fractions are obtained: PI, PII (corresponding to the pure crotoxin-CTX, the main toxin of this venom) and PIII. We implanted roundglass cover slips on the s.c of mice pretreated with a non-toxic doses CdtV or fractions. After 4, 7, 14 and 21 days of the implantation, cover slips were removed, stained with hematoxylin/eosin in order tocount the formed MGC or processed for immunohistochemicalidentication of F-actin. The formation of MGC was signicantly inhibited in cover slips removed after 4, 7 and 14 days of the group treated with the crude venom as well as in the group treated withcrotoxin, when compared to saline treated groups. The immunosta-inings for F-actin were also signicantly inhibited in all times studied when compared to control groups. The inhibition of F-actin expres- sion was positively correlated with the inhibition of the giant cellsformation observed previously in cover slips implanted in the same period and stained with h/e.

Velazquez1, adaptor protein is mainly expressed in the haematopoietic system. It possesses a potential dimerization (DD), a PH and SH2 functional domains and a conserved C-terminal tyrosine phosphoryla-tion site that allow its interaction with different signalling effectors.Mice decient for this protein have demonstrated its role as a negative regulator of signalling pathways controlling the proliferation of hae- matopoietic stem cells (HSC), and B-lymphoid partly due to hypersensibility to several cytokines and growth factors, notably Stem Cell Factor (SCF). Our previous studies have implicated for the rst time Lnk as an important inhibitor of SCF-dependent migration of primary mast cells. However, the molecularmechanism underlying this regulation has not been identied. To ana- lyze the functional contribution of the different Lnk domains to Kit- dependent cell migration, we used Lnk-decient bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) expressing wild-type or Lnk mutated forms as ourcellular system. First, we examined the effect of Lnk on the actinreorganization and cell spreading by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that the Lnk SH2 domain is important for inhibiting SCF-mediated actin polymerization and cell spreading of BMMC. In order to dissect at the molecular level the mechanism by which Lnk negatively regulates Kit-dependent cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migra-tion, we examined the activation of two signalling effectors involved inthese processes, the SHP-2 phosphatase and the Vav1 protein. Our results showed that Lnk down-regulates SCF-mediated activation of both molecules. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that Vav1and Lnk interact in a SCF-independent fashion; we are currently con-rming this association.

Malheiro1,2,*, L. H. Faccioli3, T. A. Lima2, J. P. D. Pimentel2, J. S. D. Silva4, HCV is a highly immunogenic infectious agent leading to the development of an intense humoral and cellular response. The HCV infection of cells rapidly triggers intracellular signalingevents leading to cytokine production and changes in the pattern ofexpression of cell adhesion molecules, providing a barrier to rep- lication and viral spread. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokine prole inperipheral blood from blood donors of the Foundation HEMOAM HCV positive. We analyzed blood samples from 50 individuals that were reactive in serological screening test for HCV, and 53 sam-ples negative of healthy blood donors. The expression of celladhesion molecules in leukocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry and serum cytokine was performed by ELISA. The prevalence of HCV infection in the population of blood donors of the FoundationHEMOAM living in Manaus, from August/2009 to July/2010, was0.1% and was greater prevalent in the group of rst-time blood donors, compared to repeat blood donors. It was observed that the expression of cell adhesion molecules on leukocytes in peripheralblood is influenced by HCV infection, resulting in changes in thepattern of leukocyte recruitment to the liver and thus alters the course of the disease. There is evidence that the immune response against HCV in the population of blood donors, provide a towardTh1 prole, characterized by a high concentration of IL-12 and IL- 10 in peripheral blood. It was found that the concentration of cytokines in peripheral blood from donors infected with HCVcorrelated with the expression pattern of cell adhesion molecules ofleukocytes. However, our results reinforce the importance of the relationship between cell adhesion molecules, cytokine production and HCV declared.Inflamm.

Mariano1,* 1Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, UNIFESP, Paulo, Brazil It is well documented that irritant inoculation into either the peritoneal cavity (PC) or other sites of mice generate a factor/s that stimulate bone marrow production of monocytes. We hypothesized that cells from the peritoneal cavity might also respond to remote inflammatory stimuli.Searching for data to support this hypothesis, LPS, BCG or Ehrlichascitic tumor were inoculated in the footpad of Balb/c mice and B-1a and B-1b cells, macrophages and B-2 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after different time intervals of irritant inoculation. Resultsshow that the peritoneal macrophage population increased in the PC with a simple needle puncture in the foot pad after 24 and 48 h. When tumor was inoculated, macrophage population also increased persistingfor 72 h. The number of B-1 cells increased after 48 h of tumor inoc-ulation and B-2 cell population declined in the three periods studied. Therefore, we may suggest that alteration in PC cells is remote-stimulus dependent since these modications were not observed after BCG andLPS inoculation. Only B-1 cell population increased 24 h after BCGstimulus. Also, animals were inoculated with Ehrlich tumor in the paw and 24 h after, CFSE solution was inoculated in the foot pad or in PC. 16 h after, the presence of CFSE +cells in spleen, bone marrow, pop- liteal lymph node and PC was evaluated. Results show that cells in the paw migrate to the popliteal lymph node and PC. Yet, cells in the CP migrate to the same lymph node. CFSE+cells were not detected in bone marrow or spleen. Data obtained so far show that the peritoneal cavity isnot physiologically limited to itself but interacts with pathological manifestations that occur remote to its limits by mechanisms under investigation in our laboratory.Financial support: Fundac \u00b8ao de Amparo a `Pesquisa o Paulo, FAPESP.

Mani1 1Physiology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran Heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in several clinical settings associated with systemic inflammation. The underlying mechanism of decreased HRV during systemic inflammation is unknown. It appears that the inflammatory cytokines might play a role, since epidemiol-ogic studies has shown that circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)correlate signicantly with indices of depressed HRV in various clinical conditions. Since there is no report to show a cause-effectrelationship between IL-6 and decreased HRV, the present investi- gation was carried out to study the peripheral and central effects ofIL-6 on heart rate dynamic in mice. Adult male BALB/c mice were used in the study. RT-PCR was performed to study the expression of IL-6 receptor in mouse atrial and the results showed that gp130mRNA was detectable in the atrium. The effect of IL-6 was alsostudies on chronotropic responsiveness of isolated stimulations. of isolated atria with 10 IL-6 was associated with a signicant hypo-responsiveness tocholinergic stimulation (log IC 50of carbacholine changed from 6.26 \u00b10.1 in controls to -5.59 \u00b10.19 following incubation with P\\0.05). The chronotropic responsiveness to adrenergic stimu- lation was identical with or without incubation with IL-6. To examinethe systemic effects of IL-6 on HRV, studies were performed in twoseparate experiments. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-6 (200 ng/ mouse) was associated with a signicant decrease in HRV parameters (SDNN, SD1, and ng/mouse) had no signicant effect on HRV parameters. These data are in line with a peripheral role for IL-6 in the genesis of decreased HRV during systemic inflammation. Understanding theinteraction between cytokines and cardiovascular regulatory systemcould potentially lead to development of strategies for treatment and management of patients with inflammatory diseases.

P-037 ELEVATED SERUM Rheumatology, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan Objective: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), serum levels ofcytokines/chemokines were measured and examined the association of systemic manifestations, especially hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) in complicated with AOSD,Methods: Seventeen patients diagnosed as having AOSD and 20healthy controls, with informed consents, were enrolled. We analyzed clinical and laboratory ndings retrospectively. Serial serum samples were obtained from patients andcontrols. Cytokines/chemokines, including ELISA. Multivariate anal- ysis was used to evaluate the correlation between serum chemokine levels and disease activity and clinical features of AOSD.Results: Signicantly higher serum levels of all cytokines/chemokines(IL-18, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CX3CL1) were observed in patients with active AOSD compared with healthy controls. The elevated CX3CL1 levels seen in AOSD patients correlated positivelywith clinical activity, as well as with CRP and ferritin levels, although there were no signicant correlation between serum levels of other chemokines and either CRP or ferritin levels. In 17 patients withAOSD, 4 patients were complicated with HPS. Levels of serumCX3CL1 and ferritin were all signicantly higher in AOSD patients with HPS than in those without HPS. Notably, serum CX3CL1 levels were signicantly diminished following successful treatment andclinical improvement.Conclusion: The serum CX3CL1 level may be used as a clinical marker to assess disease activity of AOSD. We suggest that highS94 Inflamm. Res. 123levels of serum CX3CL1 and ferritin encountered in AOSD reflect the presence of HPS. The association between levels of chemokine pro-les and distinct clinical manifestations and various patterns of disease course suggest the heterogeneity of pathogenesis in AOSD.

Mitra1 1Transplant immunology and immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi,2Department of Medicine(Rheumatology Division), Medicity Hospital, Gurgaon, India In a limited number of patients with active RA, we undertook a pilot study to characterize the phenotype and function of effector and Treg cells obtained from the synovial fluid of affected joints and comparedthem with that of the autologous peripheral blood. Multi-color flow cytometry is employed for this purpose. Our preliminary data reveals signicant enrichment of both Th17 (IL-17A+) and Treg cells (FoxP3+)in the local disease site of RA patients (Synovium) over their peripheralblood. The most interesting observation we made was the signicantly reduced IL-10 production by CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells derived from the local disease site(affected articular joints).However, under same invitro condition higher percentage of Treg cells(CD4+CD25hi, FoxP3+)from the peripheral blood of the same patients could produce IL-10. Our results suggest (1) intact homing of Treg cells (in parallel with Th17 cell enrichment) to the diseased synovial fluid and (2) there is denitivefunctional impairment of the locally recruited Treg cells, at least interms of IL-10 production. We also studied the expression of chemokine receptors such as CCR4, CCR6, etc. on the Treg cells which may be involved in their selective recruitment to the pathologic site of RA. Wefeel that these preliminary ndings are quite interesting and require further studies with more elaborate experiments to understand the possible mechanism(s) contributing to the languidness of locallyrecruited Treg cells in terms of suppressive cytokine production (IL-10). Identifying the complex immune interplay between T effector and T reg cells might help in restoration of locally recruited Treg cell's function for clinical application in rheumatoid arthritis.Disclosure of None declared. P-039 TWEAK MODULATES TNF CYTOKINE Molecular Biology II, of Pharmacy, Madrid,4Hospital Virgen de la Victoria, CIBEROBN, Malaga, Spain, 5Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm,GermanyContext: Tweak and TNF acytokines are involved in the ongoing pro- inflammatory process found in obesity. Their respective receptoractivation (Fn14 for Tweak and TNFR1 and 2 for TNF a) results in the recruitment of TRAF adaptor proteins and activate NF- jB and MAPKinases pathways. Recently, it has been found that Tweak pre-treatment attenuate the production of TNF ainduced pro-inflam- matory cytokines in human cancer cell lines. Objectives: To determine if TWEAK priming could affect the pro- duction of TNF ainduced and AdipoQ cytokine production blot NF- jB and MAPK signalling TNFR1 and TNFR2. Inaddition, serum levels of TWEAK were measured in a human cohort covering a wide range of obesity. Results: We found that Tweak priming in part by reducing TRAF2 levels.

P-040 CIGARETTE SMOKE UPREGULATES EXPRESSION BY ENHANCING MRNA STABILIZATION VIA P38 MAPK SIGNALINGIN AIRWAY SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS neutrophil chemoattractant known to be elevated in the airways of cigarette smokers and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Weexamined here the acute effect of aqueous cigarette smoke extract(CSE) on CXCL8 expression in primary cultures of normal human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC). In parallel, CXCL8 released in the culture medium was measured by ELISA. We foundthat CXCL8 mRNA levels markedly increased (up to 100-fold)upon CSE exposure in a concentration and time-dependent manner and such effect was accompanied by the accumulation of the CXCL8 protein in the culture medium. CSE-evoked elevation ofCXCL8 mRNA was mimicked by the smoke component acrolein and was fully prevented by the a,b-unsaturated aldehydes scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Inhibition of protein synthesis with (CHX) per se caused a super-induction of CXCL8 levels, indicating that gene products maintaining basal CXCL8 mRNA at low levels are constitutively expressed of CXCL8 mRNA levels evoked CSE by TNF-alpha, was negatively modulated by CHX indicatingthe involvement of secondary response genes.

P-041 EFFECT OF RESISTIN AND TNF- AON INSULIN RESISTANCE IN NORMAL PREGNANCY S. Sobhanian1,*, A. Sotoodeh Jahromi1, P. Zareian1 1Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Islamic Republic of Iran Background and objective: Pregnancy is related to glucose metabolism disorders and insulin resistance Insulin Resistance May Facilitate Supplyof Appropriate nutrients particularly of glucose to fetus for fetal growthand metabolism. The mechanism responsible for insulin resistance has not been clearly stated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of resistin and in insulin resistance during pregnancy.Approach: Serum resistin and TNF- aconcentrations were measured by ELISA in 86 healthy pregnant women (26, 23 and 37 of them in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters, respectively) and in 21 healthy non pregnant women in a cross sectional study.Results: Resistin concentration was signicantly higher in the thirdtrimester (9.5 \u00b13.3 ng mL -1) as compared Serum TNF- alevel pregnant women (2.6 \u00b11.9 pg mL-1) as compared with maternal healthy controls (0.8 \u00b10.7 pg mL-1). There were signicant correlation between gestational age BMI between gesta- tional age and insulin resistance (IR). We also did not found correlation between IR and resistin as well as between IR and TNF- a in pregnant women.Conclusion: TNF- aand resistin do not appear to contribute greatly to pregnancy induced insulin resistance in healthy pregnancy.

Olszewski1,2 1Department of Surgical Research & Transplantology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences,2Department of Transplantation Surgery, CentralClinical Hospital, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Warsaw, PolandObjective: Tissue fluid/lymph (TF) contains cytokines, chemokines, growth factors originating from blood, parenchymatous and inltrat-ing cells. These proteins regulate immune processes but also influence cellular events in lymph nodes draining inflammatory tissues. Aim: To measure concentration of pro- and anti-inflammatory cyto-kines and chemokines in human lower limb skin tissue fluid/lymph innormal subjects, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive lymphedema without and with bacterial dermatitis. Methods: TF was collected from lymphatics in lower leg and cyto-kines measured with ELISA.Results: (1) pro- and VEGF C, CCL21 and 27) were measured inpatients: (A) without any dermal conditions (N), (B) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (C) lymphedema without dermatitis (LD), (D) lymph- edema complicated by dermatitis (L). (1) Level of proinflammatorycytokines was highest in RA. In all patients groups it was higher than in N. IL10 and 12 levels were low. (2) KGF, MMP9 and TIMPS concentration was signicantly higher than in N in all groups, (3)VEGFs and CCL21 and 27 were much elevated in lymphedema butnot so much in RA. Conclusions: Concentration of cytokines in tissue fluid/lymph varies depending on the type of processes in skin. Most of cyto- and che-mokines are produced locally and their level exceeds that of serum.Measuring humoral factors in TF gives insight into tissue events that is not possible with measuring serum concentrations.

P-043 VITAMIN D SUPPRESSES TH PATHOGENIC BEHAVIOR OF PRIMARY TH17 CELLSFROM PATIENTS WITH EARLY RA IN SYNOVIAL FIBROBLAST ACTIVATION P. van Hamburg1, P. and Immunology,2Rheumatology,3Internal Medicine, ERASMUS MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Objective: This study was performed to identify the effect of vitamin D on the pathogenic behavior of primary Th17 cells on synovial broblast (RASF) activation both from patients with early RA. Here, we show in Th17-RASF co-culture experiments an increase of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-1 and MMP-3. Vitamin D signicantly suppressed the production of IL-6and MMP-3 in these co cultures. Interestingly, the specic enhanced autocrine production of IL-17 due to this Th17-RASF interaction was signicantly inhibited by vitamin D. In addition, markedly suppressedexpression of RORgammat and signicantly enhanced expression ofGATA3 was noted in the presence of vitamin D. No effect of vitamin D was observed on T-bet and FoxP3 expression. In addition, lower IL-22 and enhanced IL-10 production was found in the presence of vitamin D. Theregulatory effects of vitamin D on IL-17 production in the Th17-RASF coculture was comparable to neutralizing IL-17 and on IL-6 production comparable to neutralizing TNF or IL-17. In conclusion, these data show that vitamin D modulates the pathogenic behavior of primary Th17 cells intheir activation of synovial broblasts. In addition, vitamin suppresses the proinflammatory IL-17 loop between Th17 and RASF cells. These data suggest that the activation of the vitamin D pathway may have therapeuticpotential for the treatment or even prevention of persistent arthritis.Disclosure of interest: None declared.S96 Inflamm. Res. 123P-044 IL-8/RANKL INCREASED BY EXCESSIVE FORCE PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT INDUCES ORTHODONTICALLY-INDUCED INFLAMMATORY ROOT RESORPTION Funakoshi1,*, K. Kasai1 1Department Orthodontics, Japan Orthodontically-induced inflammatory pathologic consequence of orthodontictooth movement. OIIRR is a sterile inflammatory process that is extremely complex and involves various disparate components, including mechanical forces and certain known biologic messengers.Interleukin (IL)-8, a member of the CXC chemokine family ofcytokines, is potent chemoattractants for neutrophils. Recent studies demonstrated that IL-8 and RANKL contributed to alveolar bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement. However, little isknown about the relationship between OIIRR and IL-8/RANKL. Theaim of this study was to investigate how IL-8 and RANKL contribute to root resorption during orthodontic tooth Materials methods: Forty male 6-week-old Wistar rats weresubjected to orthodontic force of 10 or 50 g to induce a mesially tipping movement of the upper rst molars for 7 days. We determined the expressions of CINC-1/CXCR2 (cytokine-induced neutrophilchemoattractant; CINC-1/CINC-1 receptor) and RANKL proteins inroot resorption area using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of compression forces (CF) on IL-8, and IL-8 on RANKL production by human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cellsfor 48 h. We observed an effect of chemokine treatment on rat od-onto/osteoclasts in dentin and PDL broblasts by the orthodontic forceof 50 g on day 7. CF increased the secretion and the expression ofmRNA of IL-8 from hPDL cells in a magnitude-dependent manner. Addition of IL-8 increased the expression of mRNA of RANKL from hPDL osteoclast resorp- tion excessive orthodontic force.Disclosure M. Mitsuhashi1, University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Matsudo, Japan Objective: The aims of this study were to investigate the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in periodontal ligament (PDL) in vivoand in vitro, and to examine the effect of HSP70 on the mRNAexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- a) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced by compression force (CF) in human PDL (hPDL) cells.Materials and methods: In vivo study, 10 g of orthodontic force were applied to the molars to induce experimental tooth movement in rats.Immunohistochemical staining with HSP70 was performed. In vitro study, hPDL cells were subjected to 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 g/cm 2of CF for 24 h, and were treated with recombinant human HSP70 for 12 h. ThemRNA expression of HSP70, TNF- a, and RANKL from hPDL cells subjected to CF were determined by real-time PCR. Effects of HSP70 on the expression were determined. Results: In vivo study, on 1 day after tooth movement, the immu-noreactivity of HSP70 was weakly. On 2, 3 and 4 days, HSP70positive reaction in broblasts was recognized more than on 1 day. Further, HSP70 positive reaction was increased on 7 and 14 days. In vitro study, the mRNA expression (CF 4.0 g/cm 2) of HSP70 markedly increased to 12 h. In particular, the increase from 9 to 12 hwas signicantly higher than other duration. In contrast, the mRNA (CF 4.0 g/cm 2) of TNF- aand RANKL signicantly increased after the application and peaked at 9 h. However, themRNA expression of TNF- aand RANKL gradually decreased with the increasing level of HSP70 at 12 h after the application. Further- more, exogenous HSP70 partially inhibited the CF-induced TNF- a and RANKL expression in a dose-dependent manner at 6 and 12 h.Conclusions: These results indicated that HSP70 inhibited the expression of TNF- aand RANKL in hPDL cells in response to CF. In conclusion, HSP70 may function as a homeostatic mechanism tocompensate for PDL cell changes occurring during orthodontic toothmovement. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-046 COMPARISON OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE PROFILE IN PLASMA OF PATIENTS SUBMITTED TO SURGERY UNDER PROPOFOL ORISOFLURANE ANAESTHESIA D. Fecchio1,*, M. Mazoti1, M. G. Braz1, L. G. Braz2, J. R. C. Braz2, D. M. Salvadori1 Medical School, UNESP, Campus Botucatu, Botucatu, Brazil Background: Although is known that surgery and anaesthesia can influence the release of mediators in patients, the role of volatile andvenous anaesthetics on the modulation of cytokines in patients sub- mitted to minor elective surgeries is not well elucidated. We evaluated and compared pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines inpatients submitted to non-invasive elective intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol. Methods: ASA I adult patients submitted to otorhinolaryngology surgery were randomly allocated to receive anaesthesia with isoflu-rane 1 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) (n =16) or propofol 3-5 mg mL -1(n=18). Venous blood samples were drawn from each patient at baseline (T1), 120 min after anaesthesia induction (T2) and on IL-1b, tumor (TNF-a) were measured by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) using flow cytometry.Results: The pro-inflammatory IL-6 concentration signicantlyincreased in group at (4.55 pg mL -1) and T3 (8.10 pg mL-1) versus baseline (2.10 pg mL-1) whereas in propofol group this increasing occurred only at T3 (12.80 pg mL-1) versus baseline (2.10 pg mL-1). Besides, in TIVA group IL-8 had also raised just on the rst postoperative day T3 (8.20 pg mL-1) versusInflamm. IL-10, IL-12 and TNF- awithin or between groups. Conclusions: I patients submitted to non-invasive surger- ies isoflurane anaesthesia promotes prompt and progressive IL-6 release TIVA with propofol promotes late IL-6 and IL-8release.Financial support: Sa o Paulo Research Foundation, Brazil [FAPESP] and The National Council for Scientic and Technological Devel- (CNPq), Brazil.Disclosure of interest: None P-047 PATIENTS SUBMITTED TO NON-INVASIVESURGERIES UNDER SEVOFLURANE ANESTHESIA J. Braz1,*, Center, Botucatu Medical School, UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil Patients submitted to surgical procedure have inflammatory response because of the trauma of the surgery and possibly due to the anes-thetics. The role of volatile anesthetics on the modulation of cytokines in patients submitted to non-invasive surgey is not well elucidated. Sevoflurane is widely used for TNF-alpha and anti-inflammatory IL-10) in plasma from ASA I patients scheduled for otorhinological surgery under inhalationanesthesia with sevoflurane at Botucatu Medical School Hospital,UNESP. Patients with a disease, smokers, alcoholics, obeses, those who were occupationally exposed, those who had any kind of infection or inflammation within the previous 30 days, those whowere under medication or who had received radiation were excluded.After approval of The Ethical Committee for Human Research, the study was conducted in 15 patients of both genders, aged from 18 to 44, who were submitted to surgery with 1.0-1.5 minimum alveolarconcentration of sevoflurane. Blood samples were drawn at four time points: before anesthesia induction (T1-baseline), before the begin- ning min after (T3) usingthe kit BD Human Inflammation Cytometric Bead Array by flow cytometry. Friedman test was used to compare cytokine prole among four sampling times. There were no signicant differences in theconcentrations of all cytokines among the four time points evaluated(P[0.05), with exception of IL-6, that increased on the rst post- operative day (T4) in relation to baseline (T1) and T2 (P \\0.001). In conclusion, sevoflurane anesthesia does not change concentrations ofanti- or pro-inflammatory cytokines during surgical procedure, butpromotes late IL-6 release after otorhinological surgery in adult ASA I patients.

Kasai11Department of Orthodontics,2Department of Pathology, Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Matsudo, Japan Objective: Orthodontically induced inflammatory an unavoidable pathological consequence of orthodontic tooth movement. Cause of OIIRR has not yet been conducted. IL-17from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient enhances local inflammationand increases the production of inflammatory cytokines, which further promote RANKL expression and activity. We reported that com- pressed periodontal ligament cells obtained from tissues with severeexternal apical root resorption produced a large amount of IL-17 andRANKL in vitro. Therefore, in the present study, the expressions of RANK, RANKL, IL-17, IL-17 receptor, IL-23 receptor and of Th17 cells was conrmed using immunofluorescence confocal analysis in RA model mice in root resorption during experimental tooth movement.Materials and methods: 8-week-old male BALB/cAJcL mice (control)and SKG/Jcl mice (RA) were subjected to an orthodontic force of 10 g with a closed coil spring ligated to the maxillary rst molar cleat by a stainless steel ligature wire to induce a mesial tipping movementof the maxillary rst molars for 7 days. Each sample was sliced into4lm continuous sections in a horizontal direction. The expression of RANK, RANKL, IL-17, IL-17 receptor, IL-23 receptor and Cathep- sin-K areaincreased signicantly in RA model mice compared with that in control mice on day 7 after application of the appliance. Moreover, presence of Th17 cells in root resorption area was conrmed.Conclusions: These results indicate that Th17 cells may be involvedin the process of root resorption during tooth movement by RA model mice.

Kasai1 1Department of Orthodontics, Nihon Japan Objective: Orthodontically induced root resorption (OIRR) side-effects in orthodontic treatment, and this resorbed root cannot be recovered again. The occurrence of severe root resorption is higher inpatients with allergies or asthma, therefore the immune factors maybe involved with the occurrence of root resorption. Further, we also reported that orthodontic patients with severe root resorption have high (GCF).Recently, it has been revealed that IL-17 plays an important role in bone destruction of rheumatoid arthritis by inducingIL-6 production in broblast-like synoviocytes. However, the rela-tionship among IL-17, IL-6 and OIRR is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IL-17 on IL-6 production from human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells. Furthermore, the expression of IL-17 and IL-6 Res. 123Materials and methods: To induce experimental tooth movement in rats, 50 g of orthodontic force was applied for 7 days. Immunohis-tochemical staining with TRAP, IL-17, IL-17R, and IL-6 was performed. In vitro study, hPDL cells were stimulated by IL-17 (0-100 ng/ml) for up to 72 h. Real time PCR and ELISA were esti-mated the expression of IL-6. In addition, the effect of IL-17 onosteoclastogenesis was assessed by TRAP staining and activity Result: In IL-17, signicantly increased in the root resorptionarea at 7 days. In vitro study, IL-17 induced IL-6 production from hPDL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the number of TRAP positive cells and osteoclasts with actin ring signicantlyincreased.Conclusion: These results suggest that IL-17 may stimulate osteo- clastogenesis (odontoclastogenesis) through the expression of IL-6 in occurrence of OIRR.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-050 EFFECT OF IL-17 ON THE EXPRESSION OFRANKL FROM HUMAN DENTAL PULP CELLS M. Shimizu1,*, M. Yamaguchi1, K. Kasai1 1Department of Orthodontics, Nihon of Japan Objective: Orthodontically induced inflammatory unavoidable pathological consequence of orthodontic treatment. Orthodontic forces are known to produce mechanicaldamage and inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp and periodontalligament. Interleukin (IL)-17 is an inflammatory cytokine which T helper (Th) 17 cell derived. However, the relationship between IL-17 and osteoclast development is not fully understood. Our previous studyfound that the level of IL-17 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) obtained from orthodontic patients with severe root resorption increased. We examined that the effects of IL-17 on the expression ofreceptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand (RANKL) by humandental pulp cells in vitro, the expression of IL-17, IL-17 receptor, IL-6 and RANKL in root resorption experimental tooth movement in rats.Materials and methods: hDP cells were stimulated by IL-17(0-100 ng/ml) for up to 48 h. The expression of RANKL and OPG mRNA was determined by using real-time PCR. In animal study, forty 6-week-old male Wistar rats were subjected to an orthodonticforce of 10 or 50 g with a closed coil spring (wire size: 0.005 in., diameter: 1/12 in.). Experimental tooth movement was undertaken for 7 days. Each sample was prepared for haematoxylin and eosin (H IL-17 increased the levels of RANKLmRNA expression from hDP cells in a dose-dependent immunoreactivity IL-17R, was detected in odontoclasts with an orthodontic force of 50 g, but not 10 g.Conclusions: These results indicate that IL-17 may modulate the mRNA expression of RANKL in hDP cells.IL-17 might be involved in the progress of inflammation in pulp tissue and the incidence ofsevere root resorption during orthodontic AND PSMA-PSA CO-EXPRESSION IN HUMAN HYPERPLASIA AND PROSTATE CANCER A. Ben Jemaa1, Y. Bouraoui1, S. Sallami2, Y. Rais3, of La Rabta,3Urology, Hospital of Military Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia The interleukin-6 is released in response to inflammation and cancer can function to promote growth and facilitate invasion of several forms of tumours including that of the prostate. The PSMA and PSAare implicated in the development and progression of prostatecancer. The increased secretion of IL-6 and co-expression of PSMA-PSA in prostate tumorigenesis may be correlated. The aim of this study was to relate the expression of IL-6 and their receptorswith PSMA-PSA proles in pathologic prostate tissues to investi-gate their role in prostate tumorigenesis. The study was carried out in 9 benign prostatic hyperplastic (BPH) and 17 cancerous human prostates (PC). Immunohistochemical was performed. Ourresults showed that (PSMA+, PSA+) was positive in present in 3/9 (33.3%), (PSMA -, PSA+) was absent, and (PSMA -, PSA -) was present in 2/9 (22.2%) of patients. While, in PC, (PSMA+, PSA+) was present in12/17 (70.58%), (PSMA+, -, PSA+) was present in 1/17 (5.88%) of patients and (PSMA -, PSA -) was absent. Concerning (PSMA+, PSA+) prole, IL-6 and it's receptor IL-6R awas expressed in all the patients with BPH and in the most of PC patients (75 and 91.66%, respectively), whereas it's second receptor gp130 was present in 50% of BPH and in 83.3% of PC. Alternatively, IL-6 and it's receptors wereexpressed in the most of patients in the other proles in BPH and also in PC. Among (PSMA+, PSA+, prole, 31.28 \u00b15.3, respectively) in BPH. Inversely, PSMA is more expressed than PSA in PCpatients the same prole (32.69 \u00b17.63 and 20.45 \u00b11.31, respectively).There was an high expression of IL-6 and PSMA-PSA co-expression in BPH and PC. A betterunderstanding of biologic mechanism of this association connectingwith the role of several signaling pathways within PSMA-PSA proles will be interesting.

S99 123compounds: chemokines, neuropeptides, hormones and growth factors, and is expressed on the surface of various cell types and is found also insoluble form. To gain new insight into the physiological role of DPPIV in experimental model of inflammation, we explored blood plasma DPPIV activity during cyclophosphamide (CPA)-induced cystitis in rats. Wecompared the DPPIV activity in blood plasma of CPA injected rats withand without treatment by proline rich peptide (PRP), a cytokine from neurosecretory granules of neurohypophysis. PRP had been demon- strated as a unique regulator of activity of neurons, strong antibacterialagent, and mediator of the hypothalamus-neurohypophysis-bone mar-row-thymus axis. In the present work, the Wistar line white rats (130-160 g) were divided on three groups. Two experimental groups were intraperitoneally administrated CPA (25 mg/animal), the controlgroup received saline. On the next day, one of experimental groups wasinjected with PRP (20 lg/animal). At 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th days after CPA administration, the animals were anaesthetized, per 1 ml of blood were taken by cardiopuncture, and plasma was separated from theerythrocytes by centrifugation during 5 min at 2,000 rpm. In CPA injected animals, along with the cystitis development, we observed the time dependent inhibition of DPPIV activity in blood plasma peaked at60% drop on the 7th day and the recovery of this activity after 11th day. Inthe PRP treated animals the inhibition of DPPIV activity peaked at 40% drop, and the occurrence of cystitis was milder. In conclusion, it seams the using of PRP along with CPA as a chemotherapeutic agent diminished theside effects of CPA as cystitis and on the other hand, protected the activityof important protease, DPPIV.

Thus, the aim of this work was study theinteractions of lymph nodes and PAT during reactivated TNBS-colitisin Wistar rats. The alterations of PAT evaluated were fatty acid prole and adipokine production by gas chromatography and ELISA, respectively. Lymph node cells were cultured and cytokines produc-tion evaluated by ELISA. Fatty acid analysis of PAT reveals an increase of x-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during colitis, such as linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid, resulting ina ratio x6/x3 different from healthy controls. x-6 arachidonic acid level and ratio x6/x3 were not modied in lymph node cells or serum. PAT also produces elevated levels of pro- and anti-inflam- matory adipokines during colitis. Lymph node TNF- abut not IL-10, characterizing the pre- dominant Th-1 response associated with this disease. Additionally, T cells collected from lymph nodes from animals with colitis demon- strated increased results sug- gesting that PAT modication could contribute to the lymph node cellactivation observed during colitis, increasing the Th-1 response.

P-054 CXCL8 IS Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal,2Faculty of Cell Biology and Histology, Universityof Murcia, Murcia, Spain In mammals the chemokine system modulates leukocyte migration during inflammatory process. Neutrophil recruitment depends mainly ofthe CXC chemokine family, such as and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. The zebrash (zf) inflammatory process also involves leukocyte recruitment. Sequence analysis studies have identied severalmembers of CC and CXC chemokine families. Additionally, recentstudies have shown that teleost have two distinct lineages of CXCL8, with distinct expression proles at early inflammatory stages: the CXCL8-Lineage 1 (CXCL8-L1) and the CXCL8-Lineage 2 (CXCL8-L2). Both chemokine lineages seem to have a powerful chemotacticactivity in carp. Here we address the role of zfCXCL8-L1 and L2, in neutrophil recruitment, under inflammatory conditions. We have been employing splice morpholinos (MOs) designed to block zfCXCL8expression in the Tg(mpx:GFP)i114 transgenic line. To monitorneutrophil recruitment two different stimuli were used: tail transec- tion and injection of fluorescent bacteria. Briefly, stage Tg(mpx:GFP)i114 embryos were microinjected with the zfCXCL8 MOsor with MO standard control. Next, tg larvae with 3 days post-fertiliza- tion (dpf) were tail transected or injected with Larvae were mounted in 1% of agarose low-melting point and time-lapseimages were taken at different time points to address the total neutrophilnumber recruited to the injuries. Furthermore, a gene expression study of cxcl8-l1, cxcl8-l2, cxcr1 and cxcr2 was made by qPCR using extracted RNA from 3dpf larvae in different times of inflammation. Our data showthat cxcl8-l1 and l2 genes are over-expressed under in zfCXCL8 morphants the in vivo time-lapse images have shown a signicant decrease in the neutrophil number recruited to the inflamed area. These results support the idea that also inzebrash CXCL8 has an important role in modulation of neutrophil recruitment under inflammatory conditions. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-055 INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS PRODUCTION BY HUMAN MONOCYTES MODULATED Hydroxyapatite (HA) is widely used for prosthesis coating and is known for its generation of wear particles. ThisS100 Inflamm. Res. 123material release mounts an inflammatory response which could result in implant loss. To improve the bioactivity of the implant, electro-deposited biphasic ceramic containing 50% HA and 50% tricalcium phosphate (TCP) was elaborated. In this work, we have studied the regulation of inflammatory mediators production induced by thebiphasic biomaterial compared to standard HA coating or titaniumalloys (Ti6Al4V). Material and methods: Freshly elutriated human monocytes were exposed to the materials for 4 and 24 h. IL-1 b, -6, -8, -10, TNF- a, TIMP-1 and -2 concentrations were measured with ELISA. Gelatin-olytic activities of conditioned media were examined by gelatin zymography. Total mRNAs were extracted and variations of mRNA production were measured by RT-qPCR.Results and discussion: Pro-inflammatory increased IL-6 mRNA level by HA-stimulated cells. IL-8 was more produced by HA/TCP-stimulated cells and HA coating inducedan increased IL-10 concentration. Moreover we had stressed that HA- induced MMP-2 mRNA production and activity were decreased by comparison to HA/TCP condition whereas MMP-9 did not exhibitany variations at either mRNA or enzymatic activity levels. Tissularinhibitors of MMPs (TIMP)-1 and -2, did not exhibit any variations between the two studied coatings. Our data have highlighted that HA/ TCP had a lesser inflammatory potential than HA coating leading to adecreased in inflammatory cells activation. Therefore, this regulationof inflammation process was counterbalanced with an increased in ECM turnover. Conclusion: These results suggest that HA/TCP might be used as anovel biomaterial for prosthesis coatings to improve implant inte- gration and lifespan.

P-056 ADIPOKINE, TOTHE OF TISSUE Endocrinology and Nutrition department, Paris, France Introduction: During obesity, a chronic inflammatory state, white adipose tissue (WAT) undergoes profound cellular remodeling withaccumulation of immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes. Visceral WAT which development is associated with obesity-related complications, is more inflammatory than subcutaneous WAT analysis, we in human inflammatory preadipocytes. We aimed at precising the role of CXCL2 that we characterized for the rst time in human WAT.Results: The circulating levels of CXCL2 measured by Elisa assay were signicantly higher in obese than in lean age-matched subjects (p\\0.05). CXCL2 mRNA levels determined by RT-PCR, were also increased WAT of obese subjects (p \\0.05). CXCL2 secretionwas signicantly higher in visceral to vs. 24 ng/ml, p \\0.001). In visceral WAT, CXCL2 expression was positively correlated to M1 (TNF and IL-6) while not to M2 from visceralWAT as described in [2] was enhanced by CXCL2. Im-munohistological analysis showed a higher number of activated neutrophils adherent to the endothelium of visceral WAT from obese compared to lean subjects. In vitro adhesion of neutrophils to endo-thelial cells from visceral WAT was also increased by CXCL2. Thesame stimulatory effect was observed with conditioned media from visceral WAT whereas neutralizing antibody of CXCL2 abolished it. Conclusion: CXCL2 could be considered a new adipokine upregu-lated in WAT during human obesity. CXCL2 could participate in theinflammation of visceral WAT by recruiting blood monocytes and neutrophils. TITYUS VENOM INDUCEDINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS IN PERITONEAL CAVITY K. C. da Silva Bitencourt1, C. Arte \u00b4rio o Preto, Brazil Introduction and objectives: Scorpion envenomation is a common medical problem in many countries, and it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Animal venom is able to induce systemic alterations similar to those observed in acute-phase inflammatoryresponses. There are many studies regarding the venom actions,however little is known about the interactions the fractions IX (Ts2) or X (Ts6) with the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo, the ability of Ts2 and Ts6 induce cytokines andnitric oxide release, as well as lipid bodies (LB) formation in peri-toneal cavity of mice. Methodology and results: Ts2 or Ts6 (250 lg/kg) or PBS were intraperitoneally injected in the peritoneal cavity of 129sv mice andafter 4, 24, 48 and 96 h the lavage was collected. The cytokines weremeasured by ELISA and nitric oxide (NO) by Greiss method. Ts2 or Ts6 toxins were not able to stimulate NO, however they stimulated the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as, IL-6, TNF- a, TGF- b, IL-1band IFN- cin different manner depending of the time analyzed. To evaluate LB, cells were stained by osmium tetroxide and counted in optical microscope. LB formation was increased after 24 h of theinjection of toxins. Neutrophils were increased in peritoneal cavitybetween hours 4 and 96 after injection of toxins. Conclusion: Our results show that Ts2 and Ts6 induced recruitment of inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and inflammatory mediators. Ts2 andTs6 induced the formation of LB, which could be related with eico-sanoids production. Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res. S101 123P-058 DOUBLE-EDGED-SWORD-LIKE ROLE OF CORNEAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORYAND ANTI-MICROBIAL R. Susarla1,*, S. Aroori1, Walker1, R. Bland2, S. Rauz1 1Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, 2Biological sciences, University of Warwick, Warwick, UK Purpose: Corneal infections are the main cause for worldwide pre- ventable blindness. Corneal cells respond to infections by triggeringan inflammatory response through toll-like receptors (TLRs). Vitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D3) modulates immune certain cells. We hypothesise 1,25(OH) 2D3plays an immunomodulatory role and there exists a coordinated cross-talk between vitamin D and TLR signallingto reduce inflammation and remove infection. Methods: Three different cell types- primary corneal epithelial cells (PHCEC), corneal broblasts (HKF) and scleral broblasts (HSF)were generated donor corneal-scleral button remnants fromtransplant surgery. The mRNA and protein expression of VDR, vitamin D metabolizing enzymes 1 a-OHase and 24-OHase and their regulation with TLR activation was investigated by RT-PCR,immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and superarray. The culture supernatants were analysed for the production of cytokines using ELISA multiplex immunoassays.Results: 1 a-OHase as in the epithelial cells and keratocytes. Only the PHCEC converted the inactive (25(OH)D 3) to active 1,25(OH) 2D3. Following TLR activation (TLR3 and 4), the mRNA and chemo-kines and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) were up-regulated in corneal cells. Under these conditions, the mRNAs for 1 a-OHase and 24-OHase were in anti-microbial peptide-cathelicidin expression with TLR stimulation which was enhanced by vitamin D. Conclusions: In the cornea vitamin D acts as a 'double-edged sword'where on one hand it cytokines and down-regulating pep-tides in defence against P-059 CYTOKINE CONCENTRATION MEASUREDBY MULTIPLEX BEAD ARRAY IS UNAFFECTED BY SAMPLE TYPE (PLASMA OR SERUM) OR FREEZE-THAW CYCLE L. Parkitny1,2,*, B. Cameron3, Di Pietro1,2, L. Moseley1,4 1Neuroscience Research Australia,2Prince of Wales Clinical School, 3Inflammation and Infection Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Randwick,4School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia Background: Although measurements of inflammatory factor con- centrations are thought to be affected by testing procedures, little isknown about the effect of sample type. This study compared (a) the extraction of selected inflammatory factors from human plasma andserum samples, and (b) the effect of thaw-freeze cycles on the con- centrations of these factors in plasma and serum. Methods: Participants enrolled in a study examining the role of acuteinflammation in the development of Complex Regional Pain Syn-drome following a wrist fracture, consented to an assessment that included a blood test. Serum and plasma samples were collected from the uninjured arm within 7-14 days of fracture and stored at -80/C176C. Alternate samples were exposed to 0, 1 or 2 prolonged thaw-freezecycles. A Bio-Rad multiplex-17 bead array cytokine assay and Luminex technology were test and MIP-1 b. Out of range low values were replaced with the established minimal detectable value for the test. Results: Samples were collected from 25 participants (11 female and 14 male, mean age 43.96 \u00b117.26). Concentrations were below the detectable limit of the test for many of the inflammatory markers. Concentrations of IL-1 b, IL-6, serum than in plasma; IL-12p70 was measured as higher in plasma than in serum. However, paired samplettests revealed no signicant group differences between concentra- tions obtained from plasma and from serum (p \\0.05). Inflammatory factors were not affected by freeze-thaw cycles, except for IL-8(p\\0.05). Conclusions: Inflammatory factor concentrations measured by mul- tiplex bead array are not affected by the sample medium (plasma or serum) or by one or two thaw-freeze cycles (except IL-8). Otherfactors, such as handling requirements, should be considered when selecting a sample medium for testing of inflammatory factors. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-060 THE ROLE OF INFLAMMATORY CELLS, ADHESION MOLECULES, INTERMEDIATE FILAMENTS AND CHEMOKINE RECEPTORSIN THE PATHOGENESIS OF NASAL POLYPS E. 1Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery,2Histology and Embryology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara,Turkey The pathogenesis of development of nasal polyposis is incompletely understood. The aim of this study was the investigation of the role ofinflammatory cells, adhesion molecules, intermediate laments and chemokine receptors in the development of nasal polyposis. Totally, 35 patients were enrolled (Group 1, 10 patients with Samter syndrome;Group 2, 10 patients with diffuse polyposis without signs of Samtersyndrome; Group 3, 5 patients with solitary nasal polyps; Group 4, 10 Expression of CD4, CD8 and CD106 were similar between the groups. Ratio of patients expressing CD4 in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 werehigher than the controls. Ratio of patients expressing CD8 antigen weresignicantly higher in all three groups than the control group. Expres- sion of CD147 in Group 3 and Group 4 was signicantly higher than in Group 1 and Group 2. CD98 expression was higher in Group 1, Group 2and Group 3 than in Group 4. The ratio of patients expressing vimentinin Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 were signicantly higher than in Group 4. Immunostaining for pancytokeratin was positive in allS102 Inflamm. Res. 123patients. In conclusion, inflammatory cell, adhesion molecule, inter- mediate lament and chemokine receptor proles in nasals polyps differamong both different patient groups and control subjects. Our ndings suggest that inflammatory cells, adhesion molecules, intermediate l- aments and chemokine receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis ofnasal polyps.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-061 ACTIVITY OF A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICDEVICES (TAMMEF SYSTEM) AND ELF ON LPS INDUCED TNF- ARELEASE IN HUMAN LYMPHOMONOCYTES CELL CULTURE of Physics,3Department of Physics,4Department of Science, University of Italy Electro-magnetic elds (EMFs) interact with inflammatory mecha- nisms. To investigate the activity of EMFs on the release of TNF- awe did dose in a monocyte culture isolated from the blood of eight healthy donors. We studied ''in vitro'' the effects of TAMMEF System (Ther- apeutic Application of a Musically Modulated Electromagnetic Field),Electromagnetic Low Frequency ELF or untreated cells on LPS induced TNF-arelease. ELF apparatus modulate the frequency of 100 Hz, sinusoidal waveform; TAMMEF System produces a eld whoseparameters are modied in time and varying within the respectiverange, so that in a single application all possible codes can occur. We used a pair of electromagnetic plates controlled by an audio tape player, recorded with a classical excerpt. The human lymphomonocytes culturewere positioned between the polar expansions and exposed at ELF andTAMMEF electromagnetic eld for an hour each 24 h 4 days before LPS stimulation. Sham group was positioned away from magnetic elds. TNF- adetermination was made by Elisa test; the data were analyzed by Student's '' t'' test and ANOVA. The baseline release of TNF-adid not differ between the three study groups (intergroup dif- ference, +34.1, +33.1, +38.3% for Sham, groups (+159, +278, +298, +256% in the same times) in comparison to the Control group (+247, +356, +216,+311%). There was a statistical signicant difference (p =0.01) between ELF and TAMMEF whereas the difference between control vs ELF and control vs TAMMEF were not signicant (F =0.2 and 0.1, respectively). LPS induces a stronger TNF-a release in culture under-gone to ELF in comparison to TAMMEF, in each time of theexperimental protocol, and this seems to indicate that TAMMEF is able to induce a complex modulation of LPS induced TNF-a release.

Simpson11Respiratory Drug Discovery, Glaxosmithkline, Stevenage, UK Airway epithelial cells are a major source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and have a key role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such asthma and COPD. The severity ofthese diseases is associated with increased levels of IFN cand TNFaand with a reduced sensitivity to steroids. Recently, it has been demonstrated that combination of TNF aand IFN cimpairs the ability of steroids to inhibit the expression of pro-asthmatic genes,such as IL6 and IL8, in airway smooth muscle cells. It has notbeen studied whether a similar phenomenon occurs in the airway epithelial cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether IFN c, in combination with TNF a, reduces steroid sensi- tivity in A549 human lung epithelial cells and human primary bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE cells). IFN csynergistically enhanced the expression TNF a-induced inflammatory mediators such as IL6 and Rantes, not affect TNF a-induced IL8 expression in A549 cells. The ability of the steroid fluticasone propionate (FP) to inhibit the secretion of these cytokines was similar in response to TNF aalone or in response to TNF ain combination with IFN c, suggesting that IFN cdoesn't affect the steroid trans-repression activity. Moreover, in A549 cells stably transfected with a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven reporter gene, increasing concentrations of IFN c, up to 200 ng/ml, did not alter steroid trans-activation activity. However, combination of TNF aand IFN cproduced high expression of IP10 and ICAM1 that is completely steroid insensitive. Same trend of steroid sen-sitivity for TNF a- and IFN c-induced inflammatory genes has been observed in primary NHBE cells from different donors. We con- clude that the reduction of steroid responsiveness by combination of TNF aand IFN cis cell type specic and that there is a set of IFNc-induced genes intrinsically steroid insensitive.

P-063 EVALUATION OF CD MARKERS IN EXERCISERS COMPARED TO NON EXERCISERS A. Khosravi1, Hassan 1Immunology,2Nursing,3Midwifery,4Biostatistics, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Islamic Republic of Iran Objectives: Exercise has been introduced as a model of the stress response hence having some impact on immune system reactions. To obtain information about lymphocyte turnover in cells recruitedduring exercise, we recently analyzed the interactions betweenexercise stress and the immune system to provide an opportunity to link basic and clinical physiology and to evaluate the role of stress like activities and immune related sub population of t-cells.Methods: The study was performed using sera samples of 34 exer-cisers as the case group and sera samples of 15 non-exercisers as the control group. Two blood samples were taken before and after exercise of which serum was extracted. Cell blood count (CBC), CD3,CD4 and CD8 were measured for all participants. Data were analysed using ANOVA and Spearman analysis tests. \u00b14.93 and 2.34 S103 p =0.000) with WBC count in case group, while this correlation was not found forcontrol group. The mean CD8 level was signicantly higher in (24.66) (19.50) -8.82-1.50, P=0.008). The CD4/CD8 ratio was increased signicantly in control than case group but this relationship was not signicant.Conclusion: The mean OD value of CD3 and CD8 and the CD4/CD8 ratio were all signicantly different among exercisers compared to non-exercisers indicating that immune system can be affected byexercise depending on the nature and quality of exercise. The resultsof the current study indicated that changes in the case of mean values for each immunological parameter such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 are explaining the on immune response.Keywords: Inflammation, cytokine, exercisers, Taiwan, China Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of proteasome inhibitor meniscal chondrocytes were enzymatically isolated from osteoarthritic knee cartilage.

P-065 EFFECT OF PRE-EXERCISE CARBOHYDRATE MEALS WITH DIFFERENT GLYCEMIC INDEX ON CIRCULATING LEUKOCYTES, HORMONALAND CYTOKINE RESPONSES DURING SUBSEQUENT ENDURANCE EXERCISE J. Ziaolhagh1,*, raji2, M. ziaolhagh3, of Education, Mashhad, Islamic Republic of Iran Purpose: Carbohydrate ingestion during prolonged strenuous exercise attenuates the leukocytosis and subsequent neutrophilia and lym-phopenia by maintaining plasma glucose concentration andminimizing stress hormone and inflammatory cytokines responses. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of pre-exercise high carbohydrate meals with high glycemic index (HGI) or lowglycemic index (LGI) on blood leukocyte redistribution during sub-sequent endurance exercise. Methods: 24 male subjects (age 24.8 \u00b10.35 years, body mass 76.1 \u00b13.5 kg, height 1.77 \u00b10.02 m, body fat percentage 11.1 \u00b13.23, VO2max 51.18 \u00b10.65 mL kg -1min-1;m e a n \u00b1SEM) performed two 90-min runs on a treadmill at 70% VO2max 2 h after ingesting a HGI or LGI meal. Each isocaloric test meal contained 1 g kg-1body mass of carbohydrate and the glycemic index values were 94 and 40, respectively.Trials were separated by at least 7 days in counterbalanced order. Results were analyzed using a two-factor (trial 9time) repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc (Bonferroni) comparison as appropriate.Results: Plasma glucose concentrations were signicantly higher inLGI than HGI immediately after exercise. However, there were no signicant differences in circulating leukocyte and neutrophil counts, plasma cortisol, interleukin-6 concentrations between trials.Conclusion: Ingestion of a LGI meal 2 h before sub maximal exercise maintains plasma glucose concentration during subsequent exercise when compared with ingestion of a HGI meal. However, it seems tohave limited effects on circulating leukocyte and neutrophil counts,circulating stress hormone and cytokine responses to None declared. P-066 THE CARDIAC FIBROBLAST AS AN INFLAMMATORY SUPPORTER CELL IN HEARTFAILURE: INCREASED CHEMOTAXIS AND ACTIVATION OF INFLAMMATORY CELLS DUE TO PARACRINE ACTION OF PATHOLOGICAL CARDIAC MYOFIBROBLASTS IN PATIENTS WITH HEART Germany Background: Inflammation is one pathology in the progression of heart failure. Here, we investigate the chemotactic properties ofmyobroblasts as a stimulator for cardiac inflammation.Methods: Endomyocardial biopsies were obtained and analyzed in regard to inflammation and the number of myobroblasts in patients with heart failure. Moreover, a human cardiac broblast cell culturesystem using cells from these heart failure patients was used to investigate the response of the broblasts to different stress stimuli in regard to the expression of chemokines, migratory activity andinduction of inflammatory cell activation.Results: We show here that heart failure patients have increased numbers of myobroblasts in their biopsies and importantly,S104 Inflamm. Res. 123increased numbers of inflammatory cells. Myobroblasts did (CCL2, and Using supernatant from myobroblasts in migration assays against inflammatory cells, we could document that the chemotactic properties of myobroblasts were increased signi-cantly by 300% compared to supernatant from unstimulatedbroblasts. Moreover, investigating the adhesion of inflammatory cells to myobroblasts, we show an increased adhesion of inflam- matory cells on myobroblasts (+150%). These inflammatory also activated by the supernatant of myobroblasts and showedan increase in degradatory activity, allowing for easier transendo- thelial migration through the basal membrane. Conclusions: Myobroblasts, known as the main contributor forextracellular matrix proteins were also highly chemotactic active andincreased the number of inflammatory cells in patients with heart failure. This makes the myobroblasts an inflammatory supporter cell and may be one explanation for cardiac inflammation in heart failurein general. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

The host immune response is involved inviral persistence and progression of lesions. Most HPV infections likely involve a balance of Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Objective: To measure serum ICC. Patients and methods: The study included 109 women with LSIL (n=16), HSIL (n =40), ICC (n =13) and 40 with sus- pected of HPV-induced disease, but no pathological changes oncervix biopsy (control group) attending in the Colposcopy Clinic of the Botucatu Medicine School (UNESP) and in the Preventive Gynecology, Hospital Amaral Carvalho, Jau \u00b4, SP. The cytokines concentrations were determined in cervical secretion and in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The search and genotyping for HPV in the fragments of the biopsies were performed by polymerasechain reaction using specic primers. The socio-demographic datawas obtained by interview and study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results: A total of 78.9% of the patients were of Caucasian origin,23.8% completed the second degree, 37.6% were smokers, 57.8% hadat least three sexual partners lifetime and 8.3% reported a history of previous Sexually Transmitted Diseases. HPV DNA was detected in 90.0% in control group, 93.7% in LSIL, 100.0% in HSIL and 84.6%in the ICC. The HPV type 16 was the prevalent in all groups. The levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in cervical secretion were signicantlyincreased in patients with ICC. In the serum, the level of cytokines was not signicantly different among the studied groups. Conclusion: These results suggest that the increased of cervical andserum Th2 cytokines of women with ICC is related to the progressionof intraepithelial lesions.

Toda2 1ECI Inc.,2Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Chemotaxis, which is crucial for the trafcking of leukocytes during inflammatory and immune responses, is achieved by chemokine sig- naling through a chemokine receptor that belongs to the GPCR family. The precise mechanism underlying the connection betweenthe chemokine-stimulated receptor and cytoskeletal reorganization isnot fully understood. A cytoplasmic protein FROUNT binds to C-terminal region of chemokine receptor CCR2 and regulates monocyte and macrophage inltration to sites of inflammation. Herewe aim to reveal the molecular mechanism of FROUNT-chemokine receptor interaction in the regulation of chemotaxis signaling. We identied the minimum sequence in the C-terminal region of CCR2 for binding with FROUNT. We exploited the sequence todevelop a novel screening method to identify inhibitors of FROUNT- CCR2 interaction. We identied selective inhibitors by screening small-molecule libraries. In a cell-based assay, some of such inhibi-tors tuned out to block CCR2-mediated chemotaxis. Our resultsindicate the potent possibility of this interaction between chemokine receptor and FROUNT as a therapeutic target for controlling the chemotaxis signaling. One appeal of our strategy is that it can avoidthe undesired side effects caused by conventional approaches tar- geting receptor itself at the cell surface. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

The aim of this study was to analyze the release of these cytokines from peripheral blood monocytes and itscorrelation with physical function and longevity in healthy elderly.Inflamm. Res. S105 123Methods: A study with 19 healthy elderly (12 women and 7 men) aged 84\u00b10.58 years and average co-morbidities of 5.31 \u00b10.59 has been conducted at Federal University of Sa o Paulo. It was evaluated the independence of instrumental activities of daily living (IAD), grip strength (GS), ability to sit and stand up in seconds (ASS) and IL-6 andTNF-afrom monocytes stimulated with LPS. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1SE and the Pearson' test between variables was used. Results: 63% of healthy elderly were independent IAD and 37% partial dependent, good GS (21.42 \u00b11.69) and normal ASS (17.0 \u00b11.21). TNF-aand \u00b1113.70 and 1,045.0 \u00b112.33 pg/ml, respectively. There no between cytokines levels and physical func- tion or co-morbidities.Conclusion: Although low grade inflammation may be a marker offunctional limitations in older people, we could not nd any corre- lation between IL-6 and TNF from stimulated monocytes and physical function. It is possible that monocytes are not related to thefunctional activity of this elderly and that these healthy elders have a defense mechanism against the physical function disorders.

The studies with olive oil supplementation, however, arecontroversial yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sh or olive oil supplementation on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and some mediators of hypertension and inflammation, using SHR.Procedures: Male SHR (12 weeks) received olive oil (Aceites Bor-ges.) (OO, 1.5 g/kg), sh oil (Sigma) (FO, 1.5 g/kg) or vehicle (C) by gavage for 8 weeks, once a day. SBP was measured once a week by tail cuff plethysmography. ACE activity was determined in serumfluorimetrically and in cardiac and renal tissue using Hipuril-His-Leu(HHL) and Z-Phe-His-Leu (ZPhe-HL) as substrates. Cholesterol HDL and glucose serum and serum cytokines (TNF- a, IL-1band IL-6) were determined by ELISA. Results: Both oils decreased SBP, ACE activity in serum and the ZPhe- HL/HHL ratio in the cardiac tissue. Only the FO decreased Cholesterol HDL but increased all studied cytokines. FO also increased Glucoselevels in relation to C group. The Heart weight, however, was lower onlyin OO group. Conclusion: These data shows that FO and OO supplementation decrease the SBP associated with a reduction on ACE activity, inSHR. The decreased ZPhe/HHL ratio by both oils, however, mayindicate decrease of N-domain ACE, able to cleave angiotensin 1-7, which has antiproliferative and vasodilatadores effects. The decreaseof HDL and the increased glucose and cytokines levels in FO group can suggest insulin resistance, which could promote cardiovascularhypertrophy and hyperplasia.

Ishida1,*, Kimura1, N. 1Forensic Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, 2Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan We examined the pathophysiological roles of CC chemokines in antigen- induced arthritis (AIA) by using CCL3-/-,C R 1-/-and CCR5-/- mice. Administration of methylated BSA (mBSA) into the intra-articular of the knee joint induced severe arthritis in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas the absence of CCL3 and CCR1, not CCR5, attenuated the severity CCL3-/-and CCR1-/-mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, severe suppressed in CCL3 CCR1-/-mice with attenu- ated vitro RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis was signicantly enhanced byCCL3 addition in WT-derived bone marrow cells, and anti-CCL3 Abssignicantly suppressed these CCL3 effects on osteoclastogenesis. Supportingly, the enhancement failed to be observed in CCR1 -/-- derived bone marrow cells. These observations indicated that CCL3-CCR1 axis would be essential for the osteoclastogenesis as a co-stimu-lator. Thus, the absence of CCL3-CCR1 interaction reduced macrophage recruitment from the bone marrow, and local osteoclastogenesis, and eventually ameliorated AIA. Collectively, these observations indicatedthat CCL3-CCR1 interaction might be a molecular target for the treat-ment of inflammatory arthritis. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Here, we report a crucial role for CX3C che- mokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) in the recruitment injection neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and macrophages, followed by the development of diffuse pulmonary brosis (PF) with accumulation of brocytes,characterized were enhanced signi- cantly and remained at elevated levels until PF developed. Comparedwith WT mice, collagen deposition was attenuated in CX3CR1 -/- mice with reduced number of lung brocytes although BLM increased leukocyte inltration to a similar extent in WT and CX3CR1-/-mice, implying that less intrapulmonary recruitment of brocytes directlycorrelated with decreased collagen deciency.Furthermore, BM transplantation from CX3CR1 -/-to WT to CX3CR1-/-mice, recapitulated the phenotypes in CX3CR1-/-mice. These results demonstrated that CX3CR1 interaction was involved in BLM-induced recruitment ofBM-derived brocytes and subsequent development of PF. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Donma31Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty,2Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul University,3Suleymaniye Education and Research Hospital, Ministry of Health, Istanbul, Turkey Infertility is an important health problem throughout the world and repeated in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure is distressing for thecouples seeking reproductive assistance. Since among about one-fourth of these couples no identiable cause for infertility can be found, an immunologic basis has been attributed to unexplained losses for years. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects ofantiinflammatory parameters (AIPs) as well as total antioxidativecapacity (TAC) on the outcome of IVF therapy. Serum samples were obtained prior to and after IVF treatment from 26 women selected according to the appropriate criteria among 70 infertile women and 26fertile women as the control group. Interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-1 receptor antagonist, fetuin A, adiponectin as the AIPs deter- mined by ELISA. TAC was measured spectrophotometrically. SPSSwas used for statistical analyses. IVF clinical pregnancy and live birthrates were determined as 30.8 and 23.1%, respectively. During the therapy, adiponectin and IL-10 levels decreased (p B0.001); insulin and TAC levels increased (p B0.02). Increases observed in fetuin A levels were not statistically signicant. No correlation was detected incontrol group. However, signicant correlations were observed between fetuin A and adiponectin as well as TAC in samples obtained prior to IVF therapy (p B0.05). For the pregnant in this group, important correlations were detected between fetuin A and adipo- nectin as well as TAC, and between IL-10 and fetuin A (p B0.05). There was also an association between fetuin A and TAC followingIVF (p B0.01). No correlation of fetuin A with these parameters was detected in nonpregnant group. It was concluded that the relationship between fetuin A and the other parameters and particularly TAC during IVF therapy may be important to improve IVF success.* This study was supported by Istanbul University Scientic ResearchProjects Unit (Project No: 4327).

Silva1 1Pathology,2Nursing,3Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu,4Gynecology and Obstetrics, The State University of Campinas School of Medical Sciences, Campinas, Brazil Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common type of abnormal vaginal flora. Although BV stimulates local cytokine pro- duction, it is still not well established its cytokine prole. It is believedthat sialidase activity, a microbial hydrolytic enzyme, may modify the local innate immunity in BV and interfere in cytokine production. Objective: To determine whether differences in cytokine prole inBV cases are correlated with the sialidase activity.Methods: A total of 120 women attending outpatient clinics were included and were sampled for vaginal and cervical swabs, and vaginal wash with sterile buffer. All women had conrmed BV bymicroscopic classication of GRAM stained vaginal smears by Nu-gent criteria. Additionally, they were tested for other infections to assure that only cases of solely BV were included. Absence of Can- didiasis was possible presence of trachomatis were excluded by culture and PCR, respectively. Sialidase activity was qualitatively determined by incubation of the samples of vaginal washes with the fluorogenicsubstrate 2 0-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-aL- D-N-acetylneuraminic acid.

The intra-pleural (i.pl.) injection of ovalbumin (OVA)induced the migration of gamma delta T cells expressing CCR9 and alpha 4beta 7-integrin into the pleural cavities C57BL/6 increased in pleural washes recovered fromOVA-challenged mice (OPW). The in vivo neutralization of CCL25did not inhibit gamma delta T cell migration to pleural cavities after OVA challenge; however, it selectively inhibited alpha grin+and IL-17+gamma delta T lymphocyte migration into inflamed we observed that the majority of pleuralalpha 4beta 7+gamma delta T cells from OVA-challenged mice express CCR9. Furthermore, CCL25 i.pl. injection induced the migration of alpha 4beta 7+gamma delta T cells to mouse pleura and triggered IL-17 production by those cells. CCL25 induced IL-17+gamma delta T lymphocyte in vitro chemotaxis, even though it failed to alter IL-17 production by gamma delta T cells after in vitro stimulation. Inaddition, alpha 4beta 7-integrin blockade inhibited in vitro transendo- thelial migration of gamma delta T cells induced by CCL25 and OPW. Moreover, the in vivo blockade of anti-alpha 4beta 7-integrin mAb failed to inhibit the migration of alpha beta T lymphocytes, suggesting that the CCL25/alpha 4beta 7-integrin pathway is selective for gamma delta T cells.

Buxbaum1 1Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, USA Caspase-4 has been proposed to be a member of the inflammatory caspases. We have previously found that caspase-4 mRNA is sig- nicantly upregulated in the brain of Alzheimer disease subjects. Other studies also implicate its role in the neuropathologies such asAlzheimer's disease. Despite numerous studies implicating the role of the gene in apoptosis and inflammation, the fact that the gene is only represented in the primate genome makes it difcult to characterizeits physiological 123To study physiological function of caspase-4, we have generated transgenic mice expressing human caspase-4 under the control of itsauthentic promoter using bacterial articial chromosome (BAC). Tissue expression analysis revealed the prominent level of caspase-4 expression in immune tissues such as spleen and thymus, while thosein the brain and liver are relatively low, mirroring well the previousstudies of mRNA distribution in human tissue. Unexpectedly we found signicant portion of caspase-4 are in the processed form, although transgenic mice were viable and fertile. The role of caspase-4 in cytokine secretion becomes apparent upon lipopolysaccharide(LPS) challenge, as transgenic mice exhibited hyper-sensitivity to intraperitoneally injected LPS. At high dose, transgenic mice died within 24 h due to cytokine storm in the serum as well as in the brain.Quantitative gene expression analysis in the brain revealed themoderate upregulation of caspase-4 expression. At low dose, trans- genic mice rapidly secreted higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 b(IL-1b) and (IL-18), both of are known substrates of caspase-1. To investigate whether caspase-4 acts in a manner independent or dependent on caspase-1, caspase-4 transgenic mice are studied with caspase-1 nullbackground. Our study indicates that caspase-4 acts in caspase-1dependent manner for IL-1 band IL-18 endotoxemia. Disclosure PLACENTAL EFFECT S. Sandri1, E. M. F. H. Knebel1, De Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute-phase protein in mammals with proinflammatory and angiogenic activities. Although SAA ismainly synthesized by liver, extrahepatic synthesis occurs in severaltissues including the placenta. In the early stages of pregnancy the hypoxia is essential to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the placenta and organogenesis in the embryo. The hypoxia is alsorelated to placental diseases. Interestingly, the serum levels of SAA are increased in preeclampsia. The possibility that hypoxia may control the expression of SAA was recently observed by our lab inadipose tissue cells. Herein we evaluated whether hypoxia affectsthe expression and intracellular concentration of SAA explants. For \\1% (hypoxia) and 21% oxygen tension during 24 h. The placental villous explants from normal term pla-centa were lysate to measure SAA intracellular by commercial ELISA kit. The RNA total was extracted by Tryzol /C210and analyzed by RT-PCR using mRNA and protein expression for hypoxia-induciblefactor-1alpha (HIF-1 a) by western blotting. In the experimental conditions used it was observed an increase mRNA and protein expression for HIF-1 a. On the contrary, the hypoxia decreased the SAA1 and SAA4 mRNA levels. Also of placental villous explants were diminished. According MTT test and consumption of glucose the viability of thecultured placental villous explants was maintained. Compared toadipocyte, in that it was observed that hypoxia increases SAA expression, the decrease of SAA induced by hypoxia in placental villous explants may contribute with a local physiological com-pensatory response in the rst trimester of pregnancy or may beinvolved to abnormal remodeling of the placental vasculature found in preeclampsia.Financial support: FAPESP.

Silver1 1Microbiology and Immunology, Cuny Medical School, New York, 2Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA Sepsis remains an important clinical problem with a high mortality rate. Our long-term goals are to dene new targets for therapy. We have previously shown that CD14-decient mice are resistant to infection withclinical isolates of E. coli and that this resistance is accompanied by efcient clearance of the bacteria; in contrast, wild-type (WT) mice die from such infection and are unable to clear the bacteria. To dene the mechanisms that regulate resistance, we have extended our studies toTLR4-decient mice, the signaling molecule for the CD14/TLR4receptor complex, and have designed experiments to dene these mechanisms. Mice [wild-type (WT), CD14 -/-or TLR4-/-]w e r e injected with live E. coli and parameters of their response to acute infection were measured, including survival, bacterial clearance, che-mokine production and cell recruitment. Similar to CD14 -/-mice, TLR4-/-mice were resistant to infection and cleared the bacteria more efciently than WT mice. Bacterial clearance was due to an earlyrecruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection that occurred in response to activation of a unique chemokine pathway that is activated indepen- dently of both CD14 and TLR4. Our results show a pathogenic role for theCD14/TLR4 pathway in severe Gram-negative infection resulting in highlevels of proinflammatory cytokines; however this response may be secondary to a more important insidious role resulting in high levels of chemokines preferentially in blood, preventing PMN transmigration toinfected tissue and facilitating the dissemination of bacteria from alocalized site of infection. In contrast, activation of a second chemokine pathway that is independent of CD14 and TLR4 results in a chemokine gradient that promotes PMN recruitment to the site of infection, resultingin enhanced bacterial clearance.

Given their situation at the dentin-pulp interface, odontoblasts are the rst cellsencountered by invading pathogens and/or their released components,and represent, in the tooth, the rst line of defence for the host. We have focussed our study on the effects of Gram-positive bacteria as these largely dominate the carious microflora in initial and moderatedentin caries lesions. We have shown that odontoblast TLR2engagement in vitro by lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell compo- nent of Gram-positive triggers cell recruitment. Responses to LTA were modulated by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and CD14. Together these data suggest that odontoblasts may elicit innateimmunity and related inflammation. Studies are ongoing to hinder Gram-positive bacteria sensing by odontoblast TLR2 and downstream signal transduction in order to prevent excessive inflammatory andimmune responses that lead to the necrosis of the human dental pulpchallenged with cariogenic bacteria.

Rodrigues1, Soares1 1Department Microbiology and Immunology, IB, UNESP,2Botucatu is cytokine exerts many unique immunologic and bio-logical effects. It is produced as a biologically inactive and leaderless precursor protein, which must be cleaved into its mature form by caspase-1. The caspase-1 also exists in an inactive precursor in thecytosol and needs proteolytic auto-cleavage, which is catalyzed by the assembly of a multi-protein complex called inflammasome. During inflammation, interleukin (IL)-18 is produced by macrophages andother cell types such as keratinocytes and damaged endothelial cells. Objectives: To explore the role of IL-18 in inflammatory innate immune responses we investigated their impact on toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) and mannose receptor (MR) expression by humanperipheral blood monocytes, and its effect on TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-10 production. Subjects and methods: Monocytes from healthy donors were stimulated or not with IL-18 during 18 h, and then TLR2, TLR4 andMR expression as well as intracellular TNF-alpha, IL-12 and IL-10production were assessed by flow cytometry the levels of TNF- alpha, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-10 on culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Results: IL-18 treatment was able to increase TLR4 and MR expression by monocytes. The production of TNF-alpha and IL-10 was also increased by the treatment with the cytokine. However, IL-18 wasunable to induce neither IL-12 nor IL-15 production by these cells.Conclusion: Taken together, these results show an important role of IL- 18 on the initial of inflammatory response, promoting the expression ofsome pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) during microbes recognition phase.

On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-10 production, expansion and activation of regulatory T cells have been correlated with pro- gression of infection. Our group showed that the frequency and activityof regulatory T cells during M. tuberculosis experimental infection are influenced by genetic background of infected host. Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the expression of IFN-gamma receptor as well as IL-12 and IL-10 receptors would bedifferently expressed in infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Methodology: BALB/c C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1910 5bacilli by intra-tracheal route. Thirty (initial phase) and 70 days (late phase) post infection, Colony-Forming Unit number andexpression of cytokine receptors were evaluated. Results: C57BL/6 mice control the infection after 70 days while BALB/c mice did not. Day 70 infected C57BL/6 mice had a higherexpression of IFN-gamma receptor (alpha chain) in lung CD11b + cells compared with day 70 infected BALB/c mice. The expression of IL-10 receptor (alpha chain) was up regulated in lung CD11b+and CD11c+cells obtained from day 30 infected BALB/c mice compared with C57BL/6 mice at the same period of infection. In addition, an increase in the expression of IL-12 receptor (beta1 chain) was found only in lung CD4+cells of day 70 infected C57BL/6 mice. Conclusion: These data suggest that the differential expression ofIFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10 receptors in hosts genetically different may represent one of immunological parameters which contribute to coordinate the induction of cellular immune response associated withthe distinct capacity to control M. tuberculosis infection.

P. dos Santos3, Passos3 Preto, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Leprosy is chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis with wide clinical spectrum. Although the detection rates has fallen a lot in the last 20 years, Brazil is still considered an endemic country for leprosy by WHO and north region of the country has thelargest coefcients. Despite its ancient history, leprosy still presentsmany aspects that need to be studied, in special regarding the chronic skin inflammation linked to the bacteria-induced lesions. In the last years, a novel lineage of CD4 T helper cells (Th), termed Th17, wascharacterized by the production of interleukin 17 (IL-17), involved in a plenty of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory reactions. However, its role in the leprosy immunopathology is still unknown. Then, thisstudy aimed to identify whether the expression of IL-17 in leprosy patients. Tissue samples of leprosy patients were obtained from 20patients at Alfredo da Matta Foundation, in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Leprosy diagnosis was clinically conrmed and associated with baciloscopy and histopathology. The tissue samples were collectedbefore treatment under topical anesthetic inoculation. The sampleswere cryopreserved and used for immunohistochemistry analysis anti-IL-17 IL-17 expression immunoperoxidase staining by microscopy analysis. IL-17 expressionwas consistently higher in leprosy patients than in normal cutaneoustissue from control individuals. IL-17 seemed to be detected specially in the mononuclear cells in the skin cellular inltration, as visualized in the stained sections. The IL-17 expression was elevated in all clinical formsof leprosy evaluated. The results demonstrated that IL-17 +cells are present in all clinical forms of the leprosy skin lesions, suggesting that the IL-17 inflammatory response is restricted to the skin lesion site.

Della-Casa2, \u00b4rio de Imunopatologia, Instituto Butantan, Paulo, Brazil A single dose of Crotalus durissus terricus snake venom induces a long lasting anti-inflammatory effect on paw edema and cell migra-tion induced by carrageenan in mice. Recently it was demonstrated that crotoxin, the main toxin of Crotalus durissus terricus venom, is responsible for this effect. Cytokines are regulators of the acute phaseof inflammation, increase the production of chemokines that attractinflammatory cells to the inflammatory site, and also stimulate the expression of adhesion molecules. Cell migration induced by carra- geenan has been shown to be mediated by cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 b. The aim of this study was to evaluate the action of crotoxin on thesecretion of IL-1 band IL-6. A single dose of crotoxin (0.89 lg/50lL s.c.) or saline (50 lL) was administered 7 days or 1 h before carra- geenan injection in males Swiss mice. To evaluate the effect ofcytokine secretion, after 4 h of intraperitoneal injection of Cg (300lg/200 lL) or saline (200 lL), peritoneal exudate was collected and the assay of cytokines, such as IL-1 band IL-6 were determined by ELISA. The peritoneal exudate of animals pretreated with crotoxinshowed a signicant decrease in the secretion of all pro-inflammatory cytokines evaluated, such as IL-1 band IL-6 when compared to untreated animals. The decrease in cytokine secretion observed inexudates from animals pretreated either 7 days or 1 h with crotoxinwas 49 and 71% for IL-1 b, respectively, and 12% and 51% for IL-6, respectively. We could suggest that the long-lasting anti-inflamma- tory effect on cell migration involves the modulatory action ofcrotoxin on the secretion of important pro-inflammatory cytokines that participate in the inflammatory response induced by carrageenan.

Van Roy1,*, H. Ulrichts1, the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 are mediated through a receptor system consisting of gp130 and soluble or membrane IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Deregulation of this system is implicated in avariety of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blocking IL-6R results in clinical benet as with tocilizumab, an monoclonal antibody (mAb). Nanobodies (NB) are therapeutic pro- teins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chainantibodies, naturally occurring in Camelidae . They have a high degree of homology to human Ig VH domains but yet have distinct features that favor monovalent high afnity binding. ALX-0061 target afnity and potency. Monovalent interaction with IL-6R avoids unwanted cross-linking, while the HLE strategy excludes the need for an Fc-region, thus avoiding immuneeffector functions. These properties were considered important for apotentially improved safety prole compared to full IgG mAbs. totocilizumab.

P-089 BLOCKING IFN AIN LUPUS PATIENTS THROUGH ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC IMMUNIZATION: PHASE I-II CLINICAL STUDY OF IFN-KINOID P. Hospitals, Brussels, Belgium Background: Interferon alpha (IFN a) has been associated with the severity and disease activity of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Active immunization against IFN awith IFN a-Kinoid (IFN-K) has been shown to prevent severe renal lupus disease and to prolong survival inNZW/NZB mice models. Anti-huIFN antibodies neutralize all 13 sub- types of huIFN aand as well as against IFN ain sera of lupus patients. Objectives: We evaluate IFN-K in lupus patients in terms of safety,immunogenicity, clinical response and impact on IFN a-regulated serum chemokines levels and methods: IFN a-Kinoid (IFN-K, Neovacs SA, Paris, France) is an immunotherapeutic composed of recombinant humanIFNaconjugated to KLH as a carrier protein, inactivated and adju- vanted with emulsion. Patients with moderate (SLEDAI 4-10) and positive for anti-dsDNA a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2, doseescalation study to evaluate four different doses of IFN-K Immune responses are being evaluated through titration of anti-IFN anti- KLH antibodies with isotyping, evaluation of neutralizing capacityand of cellular responses. Clinical response is being assessed byregular evaluation of BILAG and SLEDAI scores gene signature as assessed by Af- fymetrix /C210are evaluated over the study period in comparison to the scores in healthy volunteers who had blood collected to determine baseline IFN a-regulated serum chemokines levels and IFN a-inducible gene signature.Results: No related serious adverse event has been reported. Few minor and transient local and systemic reactions have been observed following immunization. Complete safety, immunological and clinicalresults will be presented.Conclusions: Active immunization with IFN aKinoid to block IFN a in lupus is an attractive new therapeutic concept.

Hachet-Haas2, The CXCL12 chemokine plays an important in inflammation. Our team identied a CXCL12 neutraligand (C05) belonging to the family of chalcones, that inhibits its interaction with CXCR4 and CXCR7 ( JBC 2008 ) and the eosinophil inltration in a model of asthma. Due to its low solubility (C05, 9 lM), we decided to facilitate its administration by adding three types of groups: phosphate (C05-P), L-serine (C05-Ser) and sulfate (C05-S), as prodrugs. The analytical characterization of the three compounds was performed on the TechmedILLplatform ( http:// www.pcbis.fr ): solubility and stability (t 1/2) were measured in serum, PBS and lung homogenate. The in vitro activity was evaluated byS112 Inflamm. Res. 123intracellular calcium assay and in orsaline Drugs or solvent were administered i.p. or i.n. 2 h before each challenge. Prodrugs are 5-10,000 times more soluble than the chalcone C05. None of these prodrugs modies the calcium impulseinduced by CXCL12. On the other hand, after incubation in mouse serumor lung homogenate, the prodrugs are vivo, at 350 lmol/kg i.p, C05-P (PBS) same as C05 (CMC 1%) with 80% inhibition of eosinophil recruitment in BAL. C05-Pversus C05 administered i.n. at a dose of 22 lmol/kg (limit of C05 sol- ubility in PBS) inhibits the eosinophil recruitment by 50 versus 0%, respectively. C05-P i.n. shows an activity 10,000 times higher (IC 50=10\u00b17 nmol/kg) than i.p. administration. A comparison between compounds C05-P, C05-Ser and C05-S (i.n.) at 30 nmol/kgshows similar activity (67, 69 and 64%, respectively). Use of soluble CXCL12 neutraligand prodrugs enable local administration and activity at low doses and offers an interesting strategy for the development of drugcandidate for asthma treatment. Furthermore, our short model of asthma is highly efcient to estimate new therapeutic strategies. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-091 STUDY OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN WOMEN WITH BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS AND CO-INFECTION WITH CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS M. M. D. V. Santos-Greatti1,2,*,C .M a r c o n i2,A .P o n t e s3,A .G .P . Santos3,C .M .G .D .L .P a r a d a4,M .G .S i Medical School, Botucatu, Brazil Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the common type of abnormal vaginal flora that affects women in reproductive age. Changes in the local innate immunity have been reported in thisevent. Moreover, women with BV can be a Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) carrier. The cytokine prole in this co-infection should be better investigated. Objective: To evaluate differences in local proinflam-matory cytokines levels in women with bacterial vaginosis by Chlamydia trachomatis . Material and methods: A total of 156 women attending an outpatient clinic at Sa o Paulo State University, Brazil were enrolled. Vaginal flora was evaluated by Gram stained smears according to Nugent's criteria.Women who were positive for Candida sp.,Trichomonas vaginalis and aerobic vaginitis were excluded. Cervical samples were also collected for the detection of CT by PCR. Additionally, a vaginal wash wasperformed using sterile saline in the vaginal vault to measure thecytokines, Interleukin (IL)-1 b, IL-6 and IL-8 levels by ELISA. Com- parison of cytokines levels between the groups was performed by Mann-Whitney test. This study was approved by institutional ethicsreview board and all women provided a written consent term. Results: Patients with BV were divided in two groups of 76 women each according to their CT status. Our results showed that IL-1 band IL-6 levels in vaginal washes from women with solely BV had signicantlyincreased levels (p =0.04 and p \\0.01, respectively) when compared with the group of women co-infected with CT. In relation to IL-8, no difference between the groups of women with BV accompanied or not byCT infection (p [0.68) was detected.Conclusion: Bacterial vaginosis itself is responsible for increases in the local proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 band IL6, but not cervicitis by Chlamydia trachomatis . of interest: involving Th1 lymphocytes. Recent nding demonstrated that B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), one of the most important mole-cules for B cell development, affected Th1 and Th2 responses and influenced the course of some T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions.Objective: We have assessed the serum BAFF and the mRNA TNF- a intralesional expression levels. We have also investigated their association with psoriasis severity and looked for the correlation between BAFF titres and the mRNA TNF- aintralesional ones. Patients Serum BAFF was measured in 62 patients withpsoriasis and 50 healthy controls (HC). Skin biopsy specimens were taken from both lesional and non lesional skin of 24 among the 62 patients and from 4 HC skin. BAFF levels were detected by ELISA.TNF-amRNA expression levels were analyzed by QRT/PCR. Dis- ease activity was evaluated according to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Results: The level of serum BAFF was inpatients with psoriasis compared to HC (p \\10 -3). In both elevation in serum BAFF and mRNA TNF- aintralesional expression levels were associated with disease activity (p \\10-3in the two cases). In addition, BAFF serum and mRNA TNF- aintralesional expression levels were higher in PsA group when compared to all other psoriatic patients (respectively p =0.002 and p \\10-3). More interestingly, the titres of serum were correlated with mRNATNF-aintralesional expression levels (p =0.008). Conclusion: Our results suggest that BAFF may be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Nevertheless, it is unclear which mecha- nisms contribute to the high BAFF levels. It is conceivable that aninflammatory process triggers, via the production of inflammatory cytokines notably TNF- awas incriminated.

S113 1231Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada Diverse Impact of Secretory Phospholipases A 2IIA, V and X on Pro- inflammatory Activity of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC) Secretory phospholipases A 2(sPLA 2) are lipolytic enzymes, acting mainly on PtdCho of plasma lipoproteins. Their impact on VSMC isconsidered to be one of the proinflammatory mechanisms leading toatherosclerosis. We investigated the impact of three sPLA 2, IIA, V and X on mitogenesis and migration of VSMC and the relationship of physico-chemical state of the milieu on the activity of sPLA 2's and on their interaction with HDL, HDL 3and LDL. It included the role of the particle size, cholesterol content and sphingomyelin/PtdCho ratio of plasma lipids. The methodology was described in detail in: Pruzanski et al., Lab Invest 81: 757, 2001, BBA 1736: 38, 2005, BBA 1771: 5,2007 and J. Lipid Res. 49:2161, 2008. The results showed that mito- genic activity of VSMC was most signicantly enhanced by gr V sPLA 2. sPLA 2hydrolysis of HDL and LDL, enhanced mitogenic activity in order V [X[IIA. Release of PGE 2from the VSMC was enhanced by gr X and less by V, whereas the release of LTB 4was enhanced by gr V and less by gr X. Migration of VSMC was enhanced only by gr IIA in a dose/time related manner. All three sPLA 2's showed high sensitivity to the physico-chemical changes in the environment ofthe digestion medium. Enzymatic activity of sPLA 2's correlated with the lower sphingomyelin/Ptd Cho ratio in HDL as compared to LDL. HDL 3was hydrolysed more rapidly by all three sPLA 2's and correlated with the higher proportion of the long chains of sphingomyelin in HDL 3. The above studies show that the sPLA 2's, IIA, V and X, exert variable but detrimental effect on VSMC. Their interaction with plasma lipidsdepend on the physico-chemical state of the milieu and all three par-ticipate in the complex proinflammatory mechanism of atherogenesis, especially by reducing HDL level.

Tanaka2, M. Suda2, Gifu Pharmaceutical University, Gifu, Japan Bronchial asthma is characterized by allergic airway inflammation caused by various mediators. Many recent studies demonstrated theimportance of lipid mediators in the onset and development of bronchial asthma. These studies promote our investigation to nd out a new inhibitor of lipid mediator as a remedy for allergic bronchialasthma. Our purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of dual antagonists for cystenyl leukotriene receptor and thromboxane A2 receptor (KP-496 and RS-601) on experimental allergic asthma inguinea pigs. Actively sensitized animals were repeatedly exposed toantigen, and drugs were administered [KP-496 (0.01 and 0.1%); inhalation for 5 min and RS-601 (3 and 10 mg/kg); per orally 2 h] before every antigen exposure. KP-496 and RS-601 mg/kg) signicantly inhibited an antigen-induced increase of air-way resistance at 4 h after antigen challenge (late phase response) and airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine. Furthermore KP-496 and RS-601 clearly suppressed the inltration of inflammatory cellsinto airway. From above experiments, two dual antagonist, KP-496 and RS-601 showed the inhibitory action on both an asthmaticrespiratory disorder and inflammatory changes of airway in guinea pigs. These ndings suggest they will be benecial agents in thetreatment of bronchial asthma.

P-096 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE SIGNALING TO ENHANCEOSTEOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION of Rhumatology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya,2Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Hyogo University of Health Sciences, Kobe, Japan Background: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is one of the cell- derived lysophospholipid growth factors that signal diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We previously demonstrated that S1P signaling induced proliferation andprostaglandin productions by synovial cells from arthritis(RA) patients. FTY720(FTY) a of S1P receptors which induces internalization of S1P receptors, rendering the cells unresponsive to S1P. The present study we investigated therole of S1P signaling for osteoblast differentiation using C2C12, cell line, which differentiate into osteoblasts. Methods: Osteoblast differentiation was induced by the treatment of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 in the presence or absence eitherS1P or FTY. Osteoblast differentiation was determined by osteoblast- specic transcription factor Runx2 mRNA expression after 2 days of culture, ALP activity in the cells after 7 days of culture, or osteocalcinproduction by the cells after 10 days of culture. Smad1,5,8 andERK1/2 phosphorylation was examined by western blotting. Results: ALP activity and osteocalcin production by BMP-2-stimulated C2C12 was enhanced by addition of either S1Por FTY. This enhancing effect of FTY on osteoblast differentiationwas stronger than that of S1P. Both S1P and FTY enhanced BMP-2 stimulated Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation of C2C12. These enhancing effects of S1P/FTY were inhibited by addition of MEK1/2/inhibitor(U0126), indicating that S1P signaling enhanced BMP-2-Smad axis via activation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2 axis. Conclusions: These results suggest that S1P signaling enhances BMP-2-Smad axis via activation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 axis, thereby aug-menting osteoblast differentiation. FTY may be useful for the treatment of RA by enhancing osteoblast differentiation as well as the inhibition of inflammatory cells inltration in the synovium.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-097 AIRWAY REMODELING IN MURINE ASTHMACORRELATES WITH A DEFECT IN PGE2 SYNTHESIS BY LUNG FIBROBLASTS C. L. Stumm1,*, S. Wettlaufer2, S. Jancar1, M. Peters-Golden2 1Immunology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil,2Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USAS114 Inflamm. Res. 123Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that can lead to airway brosis. One of the key events in this process is the localactivation of broblasts to myobroblasts, which expresses a-smooth muscle actin ( a-SMA) actively synthesizes and secretes type I collagen. PGE 2is a lipid mediator that inhibits broblast activation by ligating the EP2 receptor. Idiopathic associatedwith a defect in broblast PGE 2synthesis and/or responsiveness. We investigated if the airway brosis in murine asthma is associated with a defect in the synthesis/response axis of PGE 2by lung broblasts. Female immunized 2 9with ovalbumin (OVA) in alum (ip) and subjected to 3, 7 or 12 airway challenges with OVA in PBS. Lung sections were stained for Collagen-1 and PAS. Fibroblasts were isolated from lung minces after the indicated number of chal-lenges and grown in culture. Cells were incubated with PGE 2, the selective EP2 analog butaprost free the direct acti- cyclase thymidine incorporation a-SMA and collagen-I synthesis by western blot. PGE 2was measured by EIA and EP2 receptor expres- sion by real time RT-PCR. Collagen deposition around airways was absent after 3 challenges, minimal after 7, and intense after 12. Thiswas accompanied by a time-dependent impairment in the 2under IL-1 bstimulation, which was maximal after 12 challenges. At this time point we also observed a reduced expression of the PGE 2synthetic enzymes COX-2 and mPGEs1. The responsiveness of broblasts to PGE 2, measured as proliferation, a-SMA expression and collagen-I synthesis, as well as EP2 expression, was not different among the groups. Since PGE 2 inhibits broblast activation, a defect in the ability of broblasts from animals with chronic asthma to produce this molecule may be implicated in the pathogenesis of airway brosis.

P-098 PTPN1 AS A MODULATOR OF PLATELET-ACTIVATING RESPONSES (PAF) is a key mediator in the induction and progression of many pathophysi- ologic states such as atherosclerosis, where dendritic cells (DC) can act as regulators of disease progression. As some signalling pathwaysactivated by PAF involve JAK kinases, we investigated the modula-tion of functional responses of DCs to PAF by one of the regulators these kinases, protein-tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). volunteers, we down-regulated PTPN1 expression usingsiRNAs, which decreased PTPN1 protein expression by 25%. Here, we show that even if modest, this down-regulation of PTPN1 is enough to modify the prole of cytokine mRNA expression observedafter PAF stimulation, of DCs. In DCstransfected with PTPN1 siRNAs, as compared to with signicantly CCL2 whereas IL-10 level was not signicantlyaffected. On the other hand, PAF-induced mRNA levels of TNF alpha and TGF beta were drastically decreased in presence PTPN1 siRNAs. Luciferase assay IL-6 and IL-8 in response to PAF. Our results suggest that the effects of PTPN1 on IL-6 promoter activity are dependent on Tyk2 and Src kinase activity, given that over-expressionof mutants of either kinase partially rescues the activity of the IL-6 promoter in response to PAF. Together, our results suggest thatPTPN1 is an important modulator of PAF-induced functional responses by influencing cytokine production. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-099 LPA INDUCES LEUKOCYTE RECRUITMENT TO INFLAMMATORY SITES IN VIVO VIA LPA1 AND LPA3 S. G. Bourgoin1,*, La Jolla, USA, 4Me\u00b4decine, \u00b4Laval, CRCHUQ, Que secretion of IL-8 and IL-6. As IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant involved in inflammatory cell influx into the human synovium and autotaxin-derived LPA has been detected in synovialfluids from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we assumed that LPAmight recruit leukocytes to inflammatory sites either directly or indirectly by stimulating the release of cytokines/chemokines. In this study we used a murine air pouch model to study the influx ofimmune cells. To assess LPA receptor dependency and the mecha-nisms of LPA-induced leukocyte recruitment in vivo we used both a pharmacological and a genetic approach. We report that (1) LPA injected into air pouches recruited leukocytes in leukocyte (3) TNF ainjected into air pouch prior to LPA strongly enhanced LPA-mediated leukocyte influx as well as chemokinesecretion, such as KC. Interestingly, the CXCR2 chemokine receptor antagonist SB22502 administered i.v. to mice reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, LPA-mediated recruitment ofleukocytes into the air pouch. The ability of LPA to recruit leu- kocytes and the enhanced production of cytokines/chemokines in TNFa-primed air pouches suggest that LPA, via LPA1 and LPA3 receptors, may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. The results provide novel insights into the relevance of LPA receptors as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-100 GENERATION OF is an inflammatory process of the pancreatic gland that in the severe forms triggers the inflammation inremote organs. An additional characteristic of pancreatitis is the necrosis of peripancreatic adipose tissue due to the release of lipolytic enzymes. These areas of adipose tissue release in turn inflammatorymediators. Here we have evaluated the generation of halogenated freefatty acids by necrotic adipose tissue in a model of acute pancreatitis. Methods: Pancreatitis was induced in male rats by intraductal administration of 3.5% sodium taurocholate. We obtained samples ofadipose tissue and ascitic fluid 3, 6 and 18 h after induction, and thelevels of free fatty acids as well as fatty acid chlorohydrins were evaluated by GC-MS. In additional experiments we administered fatty acid chlorohydrins, generated by chlorination of adipose tissuelipid extracts, on the peritoneum of control animals. Three hours laterwe obtained peritoneal macrophages and the expression of TNF aon these cells was evaluated by RT-PCR. Results: During pancreatitis, necrotic areas of adipose tissue generateand release free fatty acids as well as its chlorohydrins. We identied oleic acid chlorohydrin and mono- and linoleic acid in both adipose tissue and ascitic fluid. Administration of chlo-rinated lipids in the peritoneal cavity results in an increasedexpression of TNF aby peritoneal macrophages. Conclusion: We conclude that during severe acute pancreatitis, the necrotic areas of the peripancreatic adipose tissue generate chlori-nated fatty acids. These halogenated lipids could activatemacrophages and plays a role in the progression of the systemic inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-101 THE LRP1-SHCA COMPLEX SHIFTS THE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1 (IGF-1)SIGNALING PATHWAY FROM DIFFERENTIATION TO CLONAL EXPANSION DURING ADIPOGENESIS M. Estelle Woldt, Je Sophie Foppolo, Sophie Martin, Ve Ji, Joachim receptor that integrates multiple signaling pathways. Its cytoplasmic domain serves as docking sites for several adaptorproteins such as the Src homology 2/ a-collagen binds kinase receptors (TKRs) such as the insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor. However, the physiological signicance of the physical interaction between LRP1 and ShcA, andwhether this interaction modies TKRs signaling, are still unknown. Here we report that LRP1 forms a complex with the IGF-1 receptor, and that LRP1 is required for ShcA to become sensitive to IGF-1stimulation. Upon IGF-1 treatment, ShcA is tyrosine phosphorylatedand translocates to the plasma membrane only in the presence of LRP1. This leads to the recruitment of the Growth factor receptor- bound protein 2 (Grb2) to ShcA, and activation of the Ras/MAPkinase pathway. Conversely, in the absence of ShcA, IGF-1 signalingbifurcates towards the Akt/mTOR pathway and accelerates adipocyte differentiation when cells are stimulated for adipogenesis. These results establish the LRP1/ShcA complex as an essential componentin the IGF-1-regulated pathway for MAP kinase and Akt/mTOR activation, and may help to understand how IGF-1 signaling shiftfrom clonal expansion to growth-arrested cells and None SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE of Nutritional Science, Women's University,2Dept of Biochemistry,3Inst Med Sci, St. Marianna Univ Sch Med, Kanagawa,4Dept of Rheumatology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan Objective: Although an important role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in arthritis has been suggested, its function in chondrocytes isstill not fully known. On the other hand, an important involvement ofvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), probably through regulating angiogenesis has been speculated. We here investigated the in vitro effect of S1P on theexpression of VEGF in human articular chondrocytes from OApatients. Methods: Human articular cartilage samples were obtained from patients with OA under informed consent. Chondrocytes were iso-lated using enzymatic procedure and then cultured in vitro by monolayer, and the cells were stimulated with S1P in the presence or absence of inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)signaling molecules and a Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX).VEGF expression and its secretion in culture supernatants were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chon- both at mRNA and protein levels. MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 were not effective to suppress the VEGFinduction; rather, blocking of the ERK MAPK enhanced the VEGF expression. The Gi protein inhibitor PTX partially attenuated the S1P- induced VEGF secretion.Conclusions: A potential contribution of S1P in the regulation ofVEGF expression in human chondrocytes has been suggested. S1P may thus play a unique role in the pathophysiology of OA through regulating VEGF expression in chondrocytes.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

The role of LXs in the endometrium is unknown. Our initial observa- tions receptor (ER)-mediated transcriptional activation in Ishikawa endometrial epithelial Furthermore, we demonstrated that LXA 4possesses robust estro- genic activity through its capacity to alter cellular proliferation aswell as the expression of estrogen-regulated genes implicated incancer development. Interestingly, LXA 4also demonstrated anti- estrogenic potential in that it attenuated E2-mediated cellular pro- liferation, consistent with the effects of a partial ER agonist.Subsequent studies revealed that these actions of LXA 4were directly mediated by ER aand appear to closely mimic those of the potent estrogen, 17 b-Estradiol (E2). Using competitive radioligand binding assays, we conrmed that this lipid binds ER. We addi-tionally demonstrated this estrogenic activity of LXA 4in mouse uterus in vivo using a uterotrophic assay and the expression of E2- dependent genes as readouts. Taken together our results establish adual capacity of LXA 4to modulate estrogenic activity in the endometrium. These ndings highlight a previously unappreciatedparadigm in LXA 4-mediated and reveal novel mechanisms.Disclosure SUSCEPTIBILTY AND RESISTANCE IN HISTOPLASMA CAPSULATUM INFECTION A. Secatto1,*, E. M. Soares1, ) is a dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes a wide spectrum ofdiseases. LTs are potent lipid mediators of inflammation and hostdefense, derived from the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway of ara- chidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Recent studies show that susceptibility or resistance of different strains to certain infections,such as Leishmania amazonensis , is associated with differential pro- duction of LTs. In the present study, we evaluated the LTB 4 production in mice and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from suscep-tible and resistant mice after challenge with H. capsulatum. Methods and Results: Mice sv129 (resistant) and C57BL/6 (suscepti-ble) were infected with 5 910 5yeasts of H. capsulatum by intratracheal route. Peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from both strains were infected in vitro for 24 h at a ratio of 1:5 ( H. capsulatum :macro- phage). Lung homogenates collected and the production of LTB 4was evaluated by ELISA. The phagocytosis was assessed using unopsonized or IgG-opsonized inhibitor, was added previ- ously to the infection. Susceptible mice showed increased fungal recovery and decreased LTB 4production when compared with resistant mice. Interestingly, PMs from resistant mice produced higher levels ofLTB 4upon H. capsulatum challenge than did those from susceptible mice. As expected, PMs from sv129 phagocytosed 1.9-fold-increased IgG-opsonized- H.capsulatum by PMs from C57BL/6 and sv129 dependent on the endogenous synthesis LTs. Conclusion: LTB 4is important mediator involved in the mechanisms of host defense by participating in the patterns of resistance/sus-ceptibility to infection of H. capsulatum .

When injected into the intrapleural (i.pl.) space of C57BL/6 mice, lymphocyte mobiliza- tion in vivo, phenomenon also observed in in vitro chemotaxis assays.The i.pl. injection of Escherichia coli (LPS) triggered FLAP T cell accumulation into pleural cavities.Accordingly, 5-LO KO mice failed to recruit gamma delta T cells into the inflammatory site after i.pl. LPS. Antagonists of the LY292476 also delta T cell accumulation in pleural cavities as well as in vitro chemotaxis toward pleural washes obtained from LPS-simu- lated mice. LTB 4/BLT1 also accounted for gamma delta T cell migration induced by i.pl. administration of Mycobacterium bovis BCG or antigen in sensitized mice. BLT1 was expressed on na \u00a8ve, resident as well as LPS-recruited gamma delta T cells. Isolated gamma delta T cells were found to undergo F-actin cytoskeleton reorganization whenincubated with LTB 4in vitro, conrming that delta T lym- phocytes can respond directly to LTB 4. In addition to its direct effect on gamma delta T cells, LTB 4triggered their accumulation indirectly, via modulation of CCL2 production in mouse pleural cavities. These data show that gamma delta T cell migration into the pleural cavity of miceduring diverse inflammatory responses is dependent on LTB 4/BLT1. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-108 MECHANISMS Canada Leukotrienes play an important role in innate immunity and are active participants in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosisand rheumatoid arthritis. 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the crucial the transformation of ara- chidonic acid to leukotriene A 4. We identied several splicing variants of 5-LO in lymphoid and myeloid cell lines and in human neutrophils. All cells that were tested expressed an mRNA encoding for 5-LO that contained the expected 14 exons of the full-length5-LO. Additionally, we identied several variants of the 5-LOmRNA: one that retained intron 10 ( a-10), another that lacked exon 13 (D-13), one that lacked exons 10 and 13 ( D-10,13) and one that lacked the rst 96 base pairs of exon 10 ( D-p10). When the cDNA of these were transfected in HEK293 cells, the resulting5-LO isoforms were expressed but were devoid of catalytic activity. Immunoblot analyses with recombinant 5-LO isoforms demonstrated the expression of the D-13 isoform in Raji cells and in human neu- trophils. Interestingly, when variant isoforms active full-length 5-LO, biosynthesis of 5-LO products was inhibited. The focus of ongoing studies is to understand mechanismsregulating the expression 5-LO isoforms and to determine themolecular interactions involved in their inhibition of the biosynthesis of 5-LO products. We are currently investigating the subcellular distribution of the different 5-LO isoforms and their putative inter-actions with 5-LO-activating coactosin-like-protein (CLP). Overall, these variant 5-LO isoforms likely represent a novel endogenous mechanism for the regulation of the 5-LO pathway and lipid mediator biosynthesis.

P-110 LPS-DIFFERENTIATED MONOCYTIC MONO MAC-1 CELLS ARE IN ARACHIDONIC 5-LIPOXYGENASE S. J. Poirier1,2,*, L. is a recog- nized model to study monocyte/macrophage differentiation. In this study, we investigated whether their differentiation with LPS would impact polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism. Upon treat-ment of MM1 cells with LPS, the expression of the monocyte marker CD14 was enhanced and this correlated with a signicant increase in 5-lipoxygenase expression (assessed by qPCR and immunoblot).Importantly, major changes in the cellular fatty acid prole were alsoobserved. The 16-carbon monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio was greatly decreased in differentiated cells, which would indicate a decrease in stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression duringdifferentiation. Interestingly, we found that differentiated MM1 cells'phospholipids were enriched in 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, AA) and 20:5n -3 (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) which are the precursors of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids mediators. Additional experimentswere performed to elucidate the putative mechanisms involved in AAand EPA enrichment. When incubated with their 18-carbon precur- sors, differentiated MM1 cells accumulated twice as much AA and EPA compared to undifferentiated cells. Similarly, the retroconver-sion to AA and EPA from their 22-carbon counterparts was also more efcient in differentiated cells. Finally and in agreement with the enhanced 5-LO expression and the AA and EPA buildup, weobserved that differentiated MM1 cells also acquired the capacity torelease AA and to synthesize leukotriene B 4following ionophore stimulation. In conclusion, MM1 cells represent a good model to investigate changes in fatty acid metabolism and incorporation intophospholipids and in eicosanoid metabolism that accompany human monocyte-macrophage differentiation.

P-111 CAFFEIC ACID PHENETHYL ESTER (CAPE), A COMPONENT OF HONEYBEEHIVES, IS A POTENT INHIBITOR OF LEUKOTRIENE myeloid cells such as B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells, is the key enzyme in the bioconversion of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes (LTs). LTs are important lipid mediators of inflammation that are also involved inthe progression of various inflammatory diseases. A number of nat-urally occurring compounds have been investigated as potential inhibitors of 5-LO and of LTs biosynthesis. Amongst these are polyhydroxylated compounds such as caffeic acid that are widelydistributed in plants and exhibit anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatoryproperties. In this study, we demonstrate that the naturally occurring caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a component of propolis from honeybee hives, is a potent inhibitor of LTs in human neutrophils.The calculated IC 50for the inhibition of LTs biosynthesis by CAPE and the known 5-LO inhibitor zileuton were 0.51 and 3.49 lM, respectively. Synthesis of some structural analogues of CAPE wasalso performed to investigate their structure-activity relationship asfree radical scavengers, antioxidants and 5-LO inhibitors. Both ester and amide analogs of CAPE were designed with the rational that esters may be more susceptible to chemical and enzymatic degrada-tion compared to the corresponding amide. Our results show thatwhile these compounds are effective free radical scavengers and antioxidants, certain structural features are required for effective inhibition of LTs biosynthesis in human neutrophils.

Various evidences have suggested thatthe formation of LBs during some infections. This is a phenomenonthat may have implications in the pathogenesis of these infections and is related to the formation of LTB4 and PGE2. The purpose of this study was to characterize the presence of LBs and LTB4 and PGE2synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals infected with hepatitis C. The study included 70 candidates for blood donation, which in the period of August/2009 at July/2010 showedreactivity in serological screening tests (ELISA and immunoblot) inthe Foundation of Hematology of the Amazon. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured from under different stimulis for subsequent staining and counting of LBs. The LTB4 and PGE2 in thecell culture supernatant was determinated. that the coreand NS5 proteins of HCV stimulates the formation of lipid bodies in cells of HCV positive patients stimulated in vitro, but not induces PGE2 production in this group. However LTB4 is increased inpatients infected with HCV compared with HCV negative individuals. HCV positive individuals have increased concentrations of IL-12 and IL-10 in peripheral blood. Our data suggest that in individualsinfected with hepatitis C there is a weak signal for the Th1 responseand a high number of LBs in PBMC and high concentration of LTB4, IL-12 and IL-10 when compared to HCV patients negative. These results suggest one possible mechanisms of viral escape and may beassociated with chronic infection.Financial support: CNPq OF SKIN BLOOD FLOW HYDROGEN SULFIDE IN RATS B. Hooshmand1,*, S. Hajizadeh1, A. R. Mani1 1Physiology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran Alteration in skin blood flow has been implicated in a variety of clinical conditions associated with inflammation such as urticaria and diabetes.Hydrogen sulde (H 2S) has recently been identied as an endogenous gaseous transmitter with ability to induce both vasodilatation and vasoconstriction in a variety of vascular beds. There is little knownabout the contribution of hydrogen sulde in modulation of skin bloodflow. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of local and systemic administration of hydrogen sulde on skin blood flow in anesthetized rats. Male Wistar rats were used in this study. Cutaneousblood flow was recorded from soles skin using a laser Doppler flow-meter. Local inhibition of cystathionine- c-lyase (the enzymeresponsible for synthesis of H 2S in vasculature) was associated with a dose-dependent increase in skin blood flow. Cutaneous application ofsodium sulde (a H 2S donor) induced a biphasic response in presence of cystathionine- c-lyase inhibitor. While low concentration of sodium sulphide made a signicant decrease in skin blood flow, higher con-certinos induced vasodilatation. Intravenous administration of sodiumsulde induced in presence of cystathionine- c-lyase inhibitorThis study is the rst study to show a biphasic effect for local H 2S in modulation of skin blood flow in an experimental model.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Costa1 1Pharmacology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil,2Pharmacology, Institute of Health Sciences, University Agostinho Neto, Luanda, Angola Objective: Exogenous H 2S knee joint signicantly inhibited carrageenan (CGN)-induced synovitis; supporting the role of H 2S donors as therapeutic alternatives for arthritis. We now aimed to identify the existence of H 2S producing enzymes in rat knee and their role in synovitis model. Methods: Under approval of USP Animal or saline. After 4 h,leukocyte counts were performed in bone marrow (BM), knee samples were collected and, cytokines, protein expressionand activity CSE, cystathionine-b synthase (CBS), caspase-1, NF- kB and AP-1 were measured. The kinetic cycle of H 2S synthesis in synovia was determined based on methylene blue formation method.Data are mean \u00b1SEM for n animals. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA + Bonferroni's test. Results: Injection of CGN evoked increased leukocyte concentration in BM, IL-1b and IL-10 in joint fluid and activity ofcaspase-1 and NF-kB. Treatment with LR increased IL-10 and caspase-1 affecting activition. PGLy treatment only augmented AP-1 activity. Quantitative assay shows that CBS and CSE, the key enzymes for H 2S synthesis, were identied in synovial membrane, and H 2S generation augmented in a time-dependent manner. CSE and CBS inhibitors reduce H 2S generation by 50 and 75%, respectively. Conclusion: The protective effects of H 2S on CGN-induced synovitis might be mediated by increase of IL-10 and down-regulation of caspase-1 activity. This occurs independently of H 2S-producing enzymes found to be constitutively expressed in the rat synovialmembrane; reinforcing the importance of exogenous H 2S in arthritis.

Hyaluronan of high molecular weight inhibits catabolic actions by bronectin fragments. Althoughthere is evidence that HA works via its cell surface receptors, the involvement of CD44 in HA effect on bronectin fragment with the NH 2-terminal gelatin-binding domain (FN-f) is still unclear. Objective: This study was aimed to examine the role of CD44 on HA inhibitory mechanism on NF- jB activation by FN-f in RA chondrocytes.Methods: Cartilage slices from RA knee joints or chondrocytes inmonolayer were cultured with FN-f with or without pretreatment with 2,700 kDa HA. Secreted nitric oxide (NO) levels in conditioned media were determined. Induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) was evaluated with immunoblotting. Activation of NF- jB was assessed with immunoblotting and ELISA. Involvement of CD44 in HA action was evaluated using anti-CD44 antibody. Results: FN-f-stimulated NO production in enhanced nuclear translocation of HA suppressed FN-f-stimulated NO Inhibition jB for NO production. HA suppressed NF- jB activation by FN-f, leading to a decrease in NO production. Anti-CD44 antibody signicantly reversed HA effect onFN-f action.Conclusions: The present study clearly demonstrated that high molecular weight HA suppressed FN-f-activated NF- jB via CD44 in RA chondrocytes. When HA is clinically used for the treatment of RAknee joints by intra-articular injection, it could down-regulate thecatabolic action of bronectin fragments in RA joints through the mechanism demonstrated in this study.

Nitric oxide (NO) has an important regula- tory role in the various types of inflammatory processes. In the presentstudy, extracts of several medicinal plants native to activity. The level of TNF- aand IL-1bpro-inflammatory cytokines in the macrophage culture were also detected. All the extracts at concentration of 50 lg/ml demon- strated a signicant decrease in NO production (p \\0.001) at 24 h treatment. This inhibitory effect was also seen after 48 h. Among the extracts, L. persicum was the strongest extract in reducing the NO production at 1 lg/ml after both 24 and 48 h (nearly 100% inhibition, p\\0.001). S. mirzayanii extract showed the mildest effects in 48 h culture. In cytokine release determination, the extract of L. persicum signicantly inhibited both TNF- aand of IL-1 bfrom the cells.

P-118 PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN HYDROGEN SULFIDE SYNTHESIS AND SIGNALING IN PRIMARY MACROPHAGES N. Dufton1,*, J. Wallace1 1Farncombe Digestive Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada Hydrogen sulde (H 2S) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of leukocyte inltration, and appears to contribute to resolution of inflammation in the GI tract. This study investigated both the syn-thesis and functional characteristics of H 2S in four phenotypically different primary macrophage populations. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are differentiated ex vivo with were peritoneal cavity or dissociated from colon lamina propria (LP). Resident peritoneal cells are the rst lineof host defence, acting to prime the inflammatory response via pattern recognition receptors. LP macrophages, on the other hand, lack many of these receptors due to their proximity to local gut flora. Thecapacity for macrophages to synthesize H 2S, assessed by methylene blue formation, was shown to be variable across a wide concentration range with LP and resident peritoneal macrophages being the most abundant source. Induction of inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo ,reduced the ability of macrophages to synthesize H 2S, paralleled by reduced cysta- thionine gene and protein expression. The addition of H 2S to macrophage populations modulated cytokine release (TNF- a, IL-10) following inflammatory stimuli, increased phagocytic capacity, and also up-regu-lated chemotactic responses to fMLF in a concentration dependent manner. Mechanisms of H 2S signaling were assessed by intracellular cAMP/cGMP levels and NF jB activation. This study provides the rst phenotypic characterisation of H 2S synthesis in different primary macro- phage populations. Together, these data suggest an important role for macrophage-derived H 2S in maintenance of tissue homeostasis and res- of 1-MEDIATED NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATIONIN SEPSIS-ASSOCIATED LUNG INJURY THROUGH ENHANCEMENT OF SUBSTANCE P PRODUCTION S.

Bhatia5 1Department of Microbiology,2NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering,3Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore,4DSO National Laboratories, Singapore, Singapore,5Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand Hydrogen sulphide (H 2S) is increasingly being recognized as an important pro-inflammatory mediator in various inflammatory con- ditions including sepsis. The production of H 2S from L-cysteine in the cardiovascular system is catalysed primarily by cystathionine gamma-lyase. H 2S has been shown to induce transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated neurogenic inflammation in polymi- crobial sepsis. However, endogenous neural factors that modulate thisevent remain unclear. Here, we examined whether substance P is oneimportant neural element that implicates in H 2S-induced neurogenic inflammation in sepsis-associated lung injury in a TRPV1-dependent manner. Male Swiss mice were subjected to cecal ligation andpuncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and treated min before CLP. DL-propargylglycine, an inhibitor of H 2S formation, was administrated 1 h before or 1 h after CLP, whereas sodium hydrosulde, an H 2S donor, was given at the same time as CLP. Capsazepine signicantly attenuated edema formation, neu- trophil sequestration in septic lung. Administration of sodiumhydrosulde further enhanced substance P production and exacerbated lung inflammatory damage but capsazepine reversed these deleterious effects. In the absence of H 2S, capsazepine had no effect on DL-pro- pargylglycine-mediated abrogation of substance P levels, inflammatorycytokine and chemokine production, edema, and myeloperoxidase activity in the lungs of septic mice. Taken together, the present ndings reveal that H 2S regulates TRPV1-mediated neurogenic inflammation in sepsis-associated lung injury through enhancement of substance P pro- duction. The anti-inflammatory effects of capsazepine may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of sepsis.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Habib1 1Biochemistry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, 2Molecular Genetics, Oschner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, USA Statins have pleiotropic effects in addition to their capacity to lower cholesterol. Heme-oxygenase-1 is an anti-oxidant and anti-inflam-matory enzyme responsible for the degradation of heme intobiliverdin, carbon monoxide and iron. In this study, we investigated the effect of statins on HO-1 expression in a murine cell line Raw264.7 and in primary elicited murine peritoneal macrophages (eMPM) obtained from C57BL/6 mice. Induction of HO-1 was obtained in response to 25 mM simvastatin and 10 mM fluvastatinin both Raw 267.4 and peritoneal macrophages. Co-treatment of spermine NONOate (SPNO), a nitric oxide donor, or LPS resulted in an additional important expression of HO-1. Statins alone increasedNO formation and iNOS expression in Raw 264.7 cells and pre-treatment with inhibitors of NO synthase, l-NMMA and 1400 W blocked this effect. This induction was NO independent in primary eMPM cells. In eMPM cells, simvastatin decreased the levels ofLPS-induced IL-6 and TNFa. Both fluvastatin and simvastatinincreased the promoter activity of the mouse proximal and distal promoter in Raw 264.7 cells which was inhibited by mevalonate and 1400 W. Statins induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase inboth cell types and inhibition of these kinases resulted in decrease in HO-1 expression. Gel retardation experiments were performed in both Raw 264.7 cells and primary eMPM for C/EBP, USF and AP-1. Both statins induced nuclear protein-DNA complexes comparedto untreated cells after 12 or 24 h incubation with probes for C/EBP or AP-1 but not USF. Protein-DNA complex was supershifted with an antibody specic for C/EBP b. These data demonstrate that statins has anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing IL-6 and TNFaand increasing HO-1. The role of endogenous NO in statin-induc- tion of HO-1 is variable among different macrophages. None declared.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the sourcesof ROS formation, and to investigate the role of Src and PI3K in modulating ROS formation and aggregation in platelets obtained from LPS-treated rats.Methods: Wistar rats were injected i.p. with saline or LPS (1 mg/kg),and at 6 or 48 h thereafter arterial blood was collected (Ethical Committee No. 2097-1). ROS production in platelets was measured by flow cytometry DCFH-DA (5 lM). ADP a aggregometer. Results: The ROS production in platelets from LPS-treated rats was 2.5-fold higher (P \\0.05) than in saline-injected rats. Incubation inhibitor DPI (5 lM) signicantly attenuated the increased ROS production in LPS group (27 and 60% at 6 and 48 h, respectively). Similarly, the production in ADP (20 lM)-activated platelets in LPS group, whereas acetylsalicylic acid (100 lM) and allopurinol (100 lM) had The ADP-induced plateletS122 Inflamm. Res. 123aggregation was signicantly reduced in LPS compared with saline (P \\0.05), but incubation with wortmannin or PP2 failed to modify this inhibitory aggregatory response. The incubation of platelets from saline-treated group reduced 60% with wortmannin and 30% with PP2.Conclusion: Our data indicate that NADPH-oxidase is the mainsource of ROS formation in platelets isolated from LPS-treated rats, and that activation of Src kinase and PI3 K takes place in the response.

This resume briefly summarized our progress in theunderstanding of mechanisms involved in malaria associated-AKIdevelopment during experimental model of severe malaria. Methods: The parasite load and renal function were monitored in Balb/c mice infected with 10 5parasitized erythrocytes with P. berghei ANKA. To assess renal function, blood urea nitrogen and serumcreatinine was evaluated. The presence of parasitized erythrocytes and prole of pro and anti-inflammatory molecules was quantied by real time PCR (kidney tissue) and Bioplex (serum). Products ofoxidative stress were estimated by ELISA in plasma of animals described above. Results: So far, we observed an increase of serum levels of creatinineand urea, as well as a decrease of ratio of creatininuria and proteinuriaduring acute phase of infection. Furthermore, it was found the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes in the kidneys of infected mice. These data are consistent with the increased expression of mRNA ofiNOS, HIF-1a, IFN-gand ICAM-1, associated with a decrease in theexpression of mRNA HO-1 in kidney tissue of infected mice. The measurement of lipoprotein oxidizabilityalso showed a signicant increase in plasma and urine of infected animals.Conclusions: Together, our ndings bring some elucidation aboutmechanisms of acute kidney injury associated with oxidative stress and structural changes during acute phase of plasmodium infection.

P-123 HOMOCYSTEINE ENHANCES MMP-9PRODUCTION THROUGH CYCLOOXYGENASE GENERATION OF ROS Korea Homocysteine (Hcy) is a metabolic risk factor for cardiovascular dis- ease. High levels of homocysteine promote oxidant stress in vascular cells and tissue because of the formation of reactive oxygen species(ROS), which have been strongly implicated in development and pro-gression of diabetes mellitus by the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Thus, we investigated the sources of ROS generation and mechanismsn of MMP-9 production in murinemacrophages stimulated with homocysteines. MMP-9 in enhanced MMP-9 expression and activity was sig- nicantly attenuated not only by PD98059, a ERK inhibitor but also bySH-5, an Akt inhibitor, respectively. In line with these results, homo- cysteine exclusively increased the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, suggesting a role for the ERK and AKT pathway in homocysteine-induced MMP-9 expression and activity. Furthermore, homocysteinestimulated macrophage cells to showed an increased production of ROS, which was signicantly attenuated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin, inhibitorsinvolving xanthine of cyclooxygenase in homocysteine-induced ROS generation. Taken together, it is suggested that homocysteine enhances MMP-9 production in macrophages via signaling pathways, conse- quently leading to vascular remodeling in None declared.

Liu3 1Physiology,2The Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology of Ministry of Education,3Pathophysiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China Endogenous H 2S might play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Hydrogen sulde (H 2S) can be endogenously produced in mammalian tissues from cysteine by cystathionine- c- lyase (CSE). Our previous study has demonstrated lipopolysaccha- rides (LPS) stimulated the CSE expression and H 2S formation in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathwaysinvolved in LPS-induced CSE expression in RAW264.7 macro-phages. It was found that LPS induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) a. induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal- regulated kinases (ERK) p38 inhibitorSB203580 and ERK inhibitor PD98059 could not affect the effect of LPS on CSE mRNA expression and CSE-promoter activity. It is known that phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3 K) is the down-streamsignaling of LPS. Treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002blocked the LPS-induced CSE mRNA expression results suggest that PKC and PI3K signaling pathways be involved in LPS regulation Phosphoinositide-3-kinase.

The present study analyzed the Nitric Oxide (NO) pro-duction in primary cultured endothelium obtained from lung explants ofB 1receptor knockout (B 1-/-) and wild type (WT) mice. Methods: Cells (n =3-4 for each group) were pre-incubated with DAF-2 DA (10 lmol/L), fluorescence was detected in a confocal microscope and quantied by optic densitometry. Images were obtainedbefore and after 5 min of acethylcoline [ACh (1 mmol/L)] stimulation, with 15 s intervals between each image capture. Cells were pre-treated with the NOSynthase (NOS) co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin exper- iments were performed in WT cells in the presence L-NAME (1 mmol/ L) or B 1antagonist [des-arg9-leu8-BK (0.1 mmol/L)]. Results: ACh caused a gradual increase in fluorescence that was lowerin B 1-/-cells during the whole 5 min of image capture. In all experiments, maximal responses (expressed as arbitrary units ) were reached 270 s after ACh stimulation, thus, this point of the timecurves was chosen to be compared in all treatments. At this point NOrelease was markedly reduced in B 1-/-(35.8 \u00b13.1*) in comparison to WT cells (66.9 were reversed by not L-arginine WT 4, effect (55.0 \u00b19.2, 51.1 \u00b111.9 and 55.3 \u00b14.8, respectively), whereas NO production was blunted by L-NAME (35.8 \u00b14.7*) (* P 1receptor deletion impairs endothelial NO production by mechanisms involved in the reduction of the co-factor BH 4availability.

Fathi Azad3 1Pharmacology and toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan,2Pharmacology and toxicology, Drug applied research center,Tabriz Universityof Medical Sciences, 3Pharmacognosy, Faculty of pharmacy,Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Islamic Republic of IranBackground and objectives: Inflammatory responses management such as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidationand reduction in conjugating capacitance of hepatocytes are so important in preventing cell necrosis and death due to some injuries like acetaminophenoverdose which causes severe hepatic necrosis orexposure to some oxidant metal ions.Studies on this eld remain avery active area since some of current data are still uncertain. In this study, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were used to determine the effects of garlic extract on the acetaminophen and metal ion -inducedcell cytotoxicity and to compare it with the effect of N-Acetyl Cys- teine (NAC) as a standard treatment. Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) wereanaesthetized and after hepatocyte isolation, the cell suspensionswere studied and the amount of ROS formation, lipid peroxidationand glutathione depletion were determined using spectrofluorometry, spectrophotometry and analytical HPLC methods respectively, in different groups of cell suspensions.Results and conclusion: The results of this study indicate that, garlic extract was signicantly effective (P \\0.05) effective in decreasing ROS formation, lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion inducedby acetaminophen overdose, as well as the rst two factors in Ferricion exposure; but was not signicantly effective (P [0.05) in glu- tathione depletion caused by Ferric ion. NAC was completely effective (P \\0.01) in reducing all 3 necrotic factors. In conclusion, we can suggest garlic extract as an anti inflammatory agent in pre-venting lipid peroxidation and ROS formation. It seems that more studies are necessary on different cell types to conrm this hypothesis.Disclosure of interest: M. Anoush Grant/Research Medical Sciences, M.

Camara1 1Immunology, University of Sao Paulo,2Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical condition associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. The ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the most relevant conditions thatlead to AKI. The presence of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,adhesion molecules and the recruitment of leukocytes into the post- ischemic kidneys characterizes the inflammatory process. Apocynin is a pro drug that is converted to a dimer form through the oxidation ofmieloperoxidase. It prevents the translocation of the cytosolic oxidase components to the membrane fraction of NADPH-oxidase. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of apocynin in preventing theinflammatory process associated to renal IRI.Methods: C57/BL6 mice were subjected to renal IRI, having their renal pedicles clamped bilaterally for 45 min, and after that, renal blood flow were restored. Sacrice was performed 24 h after reperfusion. Animalswere divided in three groups: sham, mg/kg i.p. justbefore sacrice, blood and renal tissue col- lected. Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine and ureaS124 Inflamm. Res. 123levels. Histological alteration HE staining. RT-PCR was performed for TNF and IL-6 and IKK expression were assessed bywestern blotting. Results: We observed that IRI group presented higher creatinine and urea levels when compared to sham group; whereas in apocyningroup it was restored. Histological evaluation showed less inflam-matory inltrates on treated group. Also, IRI showed a signicant increase on gene expression of TNF and IL-6, when compared to the other groups. Finally, IKK protein expression was higher on IRIgroup and apocynin treatment was able to decrease it. Conclusion: Treatment with apocynin reduced renal dysfunction and preserved histological architecture. Moreover, it also modulated the inflammatory process, leading to renoprotection.

B. Costa1, T. M. Almeida1, C. R. Weber1, C. M. M. B. De Castro1 1Tropical Medicine, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil Objective: To evaluate the production kinetics of nitric oxide (NO) by alveolar macrophages (AM) in well-nourished (N) and malnourished(MN) rats after in vitro infection with Staphylococcus aureus . Methodology: male Wistar rats (n =12) were breastfed by rats whose diet contained 17% and 8% of protein during lactation (N and NM group, respectively). After weaning, both groups were administered anormoproteic (23% of protein) diet. AM were obtained from thebrochoalveolar fluid after tracheotomy. Following the isolation pro- cedures, three systems were set up: negative control containing AM (NC), positive control containing AM and lipopolisaccharide (PC)and SA containing AM and a suspension of ATCC 29213 (OD =0.15, corresponding to 10 -6CFU.mL-1). Systems were incubated at 37 /C176C in a 5% CO 2atmosphere for 24 h. During incu- bation, samples of 100 lL from the supernatant were collected at intervals of 2 h and subsequently nitric oxide was measured with the Greiss reaction. Statistical analysis were performed using Student t test and Mann-Whitney assuming a signicance level of p \\0.05. Results: malnutrition led to the decrease of macrophageal productionof NO in all systems (p \\0.005). Major production of NO was reached at the intervals between 4 and 8 h in both experimental groups, N and MN (p \\0.001) in the SA system. In addition, a decrease in nitrite concentration was observed after 10 h with similarvalues as determined in NC system (p [0.005). Conclusion: the model of neonatal malnutrition promoted disorders to the function of phagocytic cells, as well as interfered in the macro-phageal nitrosative stress. Moreover, S. aureus possibly has developed a mechanism for reducing the NO concentration in the extracellular fluid) in order to preserve its cellular integrity.Disclosure of interest: None declared.P-129 ENHANCED OXIDATIVE STRESS AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM INVOLVED IN THE EFFECTS OF FORMALDEHYDEON LUNG INFLAMMATION A. Lino-dos-Santos-Franco1, M. Correa-Costa2, A. C. C. Santos-Durao3, J. A. Gimenes-Junior1,*, J. A. Bertoni1, R. 1Department of Pharmacology,2Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo,3Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculty of PharmaceuticalSciences, University of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Exposure to air pollutants such as formaldehyde (FA) leads to inflammation, oxidative stress and immune-modulation in air-ways. FA is emitted by building materials, furniture carpets, wallpaper, plywood, floor coverings and sterilizing agents. We recently demon- strated that FA effects on airways are partially due to an increasedoxidative stress. However, the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS)remained to be determined. It is investigated herein the role of antiox- idant and oxidant enzymes on the release of ROS after FA exposure. Material and methods: Male Wistar rats were exposed to FA inha-lation (1%, 90 min daily) for three consecutive days. After 24 h of the last FA inhalation, the activities and gene expression of (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)- 1 were determined in lung tissue. Results: FA inhalation did not modify the activity of GPX, GR, GSTand CAT, but reduced the activity of SOD when compared to thena\u00a8ve group. A signicant increase in the SOD 1 and 2, CAT, iNOS and COX-1 expression were observed in FA group when compared to the na \u00a8ve group. Conclusion: Our data are indicative that FA causes a disruption of thephysiological balance of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes in lung tissue, most probably favoring the oxidant pathways and thus posi- tively modulating lung inflammation.Financial Disclosure of LEUKOTRIENE B4 NEUTROPHILS: P. mediator, a known proinflammatory agent released in many inflammatory sit-uations and it is able to activate biological responses in human neutrophils (PMN) as well as reactive oxygen species LTB apoptosis through the activation of classical pro-survivalsignaling, which in turn may corroborate to the onset of a chronic inflammatory condition. Recently, ROS have emerged as second- messengers, coordinating intracellular signaling cascades, and thusmodulating several biological phenomena, including apoptosis. In thisstudy, we aim to elucidate the putative role of NADPH oxidase- derived ROS in LTB 4antiapoptotic effect. PMN were isolated from whole blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-PaqueTMdensity gradi- ent. ROS production was evaluated by cytochrome creduction as well as lucigenin and luminol Mitochondrial membrane potential was of JC-1-stained cells.

This event depends modu-lation of NF- jB translocation and I jB-aphosphorylation/ that LTB 4-induced dation and mitochondrial 4-induced antiapoptotic effect in neutrophils occurs via ROS-dependent signaling routes and we do believe that a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophils spontaneous apoptosis may contribute to design betterstrategies to control inflammation.

Kasai1 1Department of orthodontics, Nihon At Matsudo, Matsudo, Japan Objectives: Relaxin (RLX), a member of the insulin/relaxin family of structurally related hormones, has an influence on many physiologicprocesses, such as collagen turnover, angiogenesis, and antibrosis. The periodontal ligament (PDL) contains broblasts, blood vessels, nerves, and a large amount of collagen, primarily of type I. Thehomeostasis of the PDL implicates towards intensive and subtletranscriptional and translational regulation of the collagens and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) genes. In response to mechanical stress during orthodontic tooth movement, the PDL producesinflammatory cytokines and MMPs in vivo. Therefore, it is thishormone may have an influence on orthodontic tooth move- ment through alterations of PDL. In the present study,we investigated the effects of RLX on the release and gene expression of MMP-1 and8 by hPDL cells in vitro . Methods: were cultured with 100 ng/ml RLX for 0-72 h. The mRNA levels of the MMP-1 and 8 were determined by usingreal-time PCR and the protein levels were determined by usingELISA. Effects of specic inhibitors and 8 cells were also investigated by real-time PCR.Results: Real-time PCR analysis revealed that RLX increased MMP-1and 8 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner. The release of MMP-1 and 8 also increased in a time-dependent manner. ERK inhibitor and JNK inhibitor considerably decreased expression, whereas p38MAPK inhibitor markedly inhibitedMMP-8 expression. Conclusion: These indicate that RLX stimulated the expres- sion of MMP-1 and 8 in hPDL cells via MAPK signaling pathways.Therefore, RLX may contribute to periodontal connective tissue andbone matrix remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement via MMP-1 and 8.

Pro- teases in granulocytes that have been reported to elastinolyticactivity, such elastase, used as a substrate. Although medullasin alone showednegligible elastinolytic activity, it expressed signicant elastinolyticactivity in the presence of the granulocyte protein, azurocidin, in the incubation mixture. The mechanism by which the product of partial digestion of azurocidin by medullasin induced the elastin-olytic activity of medullasin was studied. Neither the low nor high-molecular weight fractions produced by the digestion of azurocidin by medulllasin showed elastinolytic activity by themselves. How- expressed signicant elastinolytic activity in thepresence of high-molecular-weight fraction produced by the digestion of azurocidin by medullasin. The product of partial digestion of azurocidin by medullasin forced the protease to adsorbto activity.

Res. 123Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of Zn-dependent neutral proteolytic enzymes, are known to play a critical role in erosion of car-tilage during arthritis. Moreover, levels of these enzymes are increased in inflamed articular joints. MMPs and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) share common catalytic domain organization and exhibitidentical Zn-binding motif. Therefore, studies on SVMPs may provideinsights into the functions of MMPs. In this study we investigated the effects of BaP1 on isolated synoviocytes, the main articular cells involved in production of inflammatory mediators, evaluating: (a) release ofprostaglandin E 2(PGE 2); (b) gene and protein expression of ciclooxi- genase-2(COX-2); (c) participation of NF-kB in COX-2 protein expression, and (d) expression of EP4 receptor. B type synoviocytes isolated from rat knee joint synovial membranes were used. Levels ofPGE 2were measured by EIA, and gene and protein expression of both COX-2 and EP4 receptor determined by real time RT-PCR and W.blot, respectively. Results showed that BaP1 induced release of PGE 2from B type synoviocytes after 1, 3 and 6 h, but not after 30 min incubation, in comparison with control cells. BaP1 induced COX-2 gene and protein expression by synoviocytes (30 BaP1-inducedCOX-2 protein expression. Increased levels of EP4 receptor expression (52 and 65 kDa) were also detected in synoviocytes stimulated by BaP1 (3 h). In conclusion, BaP1 can directly stimulatesynoviocytes to synthesize PGE 2and express COX-2. This effect is mediated by NF-kB. In addition, BaP1 is able to increase expression of EP4, a PGE 2receptor.This may contribute for amplication of PGE 2-induced effects. These ndings suggest novel regulatory mechanisms for metalloproteinases in B type synoviocytes, which may be relevant for inflammation and pain in the joints. Support: FAPESP, CNPq.Disclosure of W.

We hypothesized that PAR 2 drives COX-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Treatment of Caco-2 colon cancer cells with the PAR 2-activating peptide 2-furoyl- LIGRLO-NH 2(2fLI) for 3 h led to an increase in intracellular COX-2 protein expression that was not observed following treatment with a reverse-sequence PAR 2-inactive peptide. COX-2 expression was also increased in Caco-2 cells following a 3 h treatment with eithertrypsin, cathepsin G or proteinase 3, all serine proteinases known to cleave the N-terminus of PAR 2. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with 2fLI for 30 min signicantly increased metalloproteinase activity in thecell culture supernatant. Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation was observed in cell lysates following 40 min of treatment with 2fLI.

However, apical addition of serine proteasesInflamm. Res. to intestinal epithelial cell monolayers reduces perme- ability as shown by increased transepithelial resistance (R TE). This effect of trypsin is independent of activation of protease-activated receptors, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Given the central role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in epithelialcell biology and colonic tissue was measured in Ussing chambers. To determine a role for EGFR-associated signaling ,cells were pretreated across the monolayer was with a signicant dose-dependent decrease in LY294002 and DRTEby 66, 63 and 25% respectively. Pretreatment of cells with or AG879 80%. and AG879 reduced this increase by 99 and 84% respectively. Also, soybean trypsin inhibitor decreased R TEin mouse colon in vitro, suggesting that luminal serine proteases maintain barrier function.Conclusions: Our data suggest that trypsin increases R TEvia activation of EGFR and ErBb2 and via activation of ERK-1/2, PI3K and MMPs. Serine proteases may strengthen epithelial barrier to enhance the efciency of electrolyte and nutrient transport, and may represent amethod to counter barrier defects caused by intestinal inflammation.

Aoki2 1Department Food Health Science, Jissen Women's University, Hino-city, Tokyo,2Department of Biochemistry, The Institute of Medullasin, Kamakura, Japan Tea has various benecial effect on health. Green tea contains cate- chins, theanine, and vitamins such as folic acid and ascorbic acidwhich exert healthy effect. In contrast to green tea, black tea containspolymers of catechins such as theaflavin or thearubigin other than catechins. In this study we examined the effect of black tea extract, theaflavin, and thearubigin on the activity of neutral proteases in granulocytes such asmedullasin and cathepsin G were shown to play important roles in biophylaxis. Both proteases stimulate lymphocyte function and enhance NK cell activity. Medullasin causes inflammation leading tothe development of atherosclerosis. Mice fed with diet containingblack tea components such as theaflavin or thearubigin revealed decreased medullasin activity dose-dependently, but cathpsin G activity decreased only slightly. In contrast to black tea components,addition of green tea components such as epicatechin, epigallocate- chin, and epigallocatechin gallate to the diet of mice caused an increment of both medullasin and cathepsin G activity.

The mechanisms by which extracellular matrix degradation occurs are not yet fully understood. However, literature described both inflammatoryand oxidative processes as critical to parenchyma destruction. Thus,this study focused to investigate the partipation of oxidative stress during the emphysema establishment process induced by elastase in mice. C57BL/6 mice were submitted at a protocol with pancreaticporcine elastase (PPE) instillation (0.05 U, 0.5 U (i.t.) or 3 U (i.n.) ofPPE per animal), to induce pulmonary emphysema in vivo (n =6). Lung tissue was collected on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 after PPE instila- tion. Vehicle treated mice were used as controls. Emphysema typicalmorphological alterations were seen just at 21 days after PPE 0.5 U. TNF-awas elevated at 7 and 14 days after PPE 0.5 U, and was accompanied by a reduction in IL-10 levels at the same time-points.MPO was elevated at the three time-points with PPE 0.5 U. The levelsof Nitrite, TBARS and the SOD activity were also increased at 7 days after PPE 0.5 U, while CAT activity was decreased. When the dose was enhanced to 3 U of PPE and a group with just 1 day afterstimulus was performed, CAT activity presented reduced at 1 day,while SOD activity was increased at the same time-point. These results are corroborated with mRNA expression, with an increase in Nrf2, Sirt-1, CAT and GPx. However, there was no difference inmRNA SOD expression between any groups (control, 1, 7, 14 and21 days). ELISA for TGF- b1 showed a reduction just at 21 days after 3U of PPE. These results indicate that the proteolytic pathway has a link with the oxidative pathway. These data suggest that redoximbalance generated by proteolytic stimulus may be crucial in the early stage of the injury, and has no effect in later stages, when in fact, emphysema is installed. But the stimulus for the antioxidant responseremains enhanced, as seen by the RT-PCR.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-139 HEPARANASE AS A SIGNALING MOLECULEIN CANCER AND INFLAMMATION K. J.

Hulett1 1Biochemistry, Latrobe University, Co- operative research centre for Heparanase is a b- D-endoglucuronidase which degrades heparan sul- fate, a key component of the extracellular matrix and basementmembrane. The degradation of the ECM is essential for bothS128 Inflamm. Res. 123physiological and pathological angiogenesis and metastasis. Heparanase isalso known to have non-enzymatic functions by regulating cell adhesion, cell signalling and differentiation. Although heparanase has been proposed to facilitate leukocyte migration through degradationof the ECM and basement membrane, its role in generating aninflammatory response by mediating the release of chemokines, cytokines and growth factors have not been determined. In this study, the role of heparanase in regulating the expression of these factors ininnate immune cells has been studied .Peripheral blood monocyte cells were stimulated in vitro with endotoxin-free heparanase and cytokine release was examined. Heparanase treatment of cells resul- ted in the release of a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines includingIL-8, IL-10, TNF, IL-6 and IL-1 b. A similar pattern of cytokine release was observed after addition of soluble heparan sulfate, implying that the role of heparanase in induction of inflammation may be due to the enzymatic role of cleaving of its substrate. This resultwas validated via an abolishment of cytokine release following the treatment of MyD88 -/-mouse spleen cells with heparanase, sug- gesting occurs via the toll-like receptor pathway,which heparan sulfate fragments are known to signal through. Thesedata suggests that heparanase can promote inflammation via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-140 ELAFIN ANTIPROTEASE EXPRESSION IS DECREASED WHILE PROTEOLYTICACTIVITY WAS INCREASED MUCOSAL SURFACE IN IBD PATIENTS Paris, France Animal models suggest that proteolytic balance at the surface of inflamed mucosa is broken towards an increased proteolytic activity. This increase could be explained by an important release of proteases, a decreased expression of endogenous inhibitors, or both. We have investigated herethe proteolytic activity released by fresh colonic tissue biopsies of (Crohn's disease: CD, and Ulcerative Colitis: UC) and The expression of elan, a serine protease inhibitor naturally expressed at mucosal surfaces was investigated.Methods: CD and UC patient colonic biopsies were harvestedand incubated (1 h, 37 /C176) in culture media cleavage specic genic substrate (tosyl-GPR- pNa). Other biopsies were parafn-embedded and used for the detection of elan mRNA by a fluorescently labeled riboprobe. Results: A signicant increase in proteolytic activity was detected insupernatants from CD, and UC biopsies compared to control patients. Innon-inflamed biopsies, we detecteda strong expression of elan mRNA in the epithelium, while only few cells in the sub-mucosa expressed this mRNA. In both UC and CD biopsies, elan mRNA was detected in thesub-mucosa in a zone that correlated with inltrated immune cells.However in the intestinal epithelium itself, elan mRNA expression was clearly reduced.Conclusions: Our results showed that in IBD patients, proteolytic balance of the mucosa is disrupted towards an increased proteolytic activity. Elan mRNA was constitutively expressed by epithelial cells in non-IBDpatient tissues, but in CD and UC patient tissues, a down-regulation ofelan was observed in the epithelium. This study showed that the intes- tinal protease-antiprotease balance is altered in IBD and proposes that decient expression of elan by the epithelium could participate toexplain this unbalance.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-141 RELEASED OF TRYPSIN IV BY HUMANINTESTINAL EPITHELIA IN RESPONSE TO PATHOGENIC OR COMMENSAL FORMS OF J.-P. Motta1,2,*, N. Toulouse Toulouse, France,3University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA,4University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada We have previously reported that human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) released from their basolateral side signicant proteolytic activity upon stimulation by LPS. Further, we have observed that LPS-induced increased permeability of intestinal epithelium could beprevented in vitro by treatment with a large spectrum serine proteaseinhibitor. Here, we investigated the effects of pathogenic (EPEC) or commensal (HB101) forms of Escherichia. coli (E. coli ) on the expression of the trypsinIV by IECs. We also investigated the role ofproteolytic activity in E. coli -induced increased permeability. Methods: Caco-2 cells (human IECs) were polarized for 15 days and apically stimulated for 5 h with HB101 and EPEC at 2 910 8CFU/ well, in the or of the serine protease inhibitor FUT-175(50 apical to basal passage method. We have evaluated the expression of the trypsin IV mRNA by qRT-PCR and trypsinogen IV by western-blot.Results: We have observed that EPEC, but not HB101 was able to break the barrier function of IECs, increasing the passage of dextran- FITC. The serine FUT-175 was response to EPEC. Trypsin IVmRNA was expressed in Caco-2 cells infected with EPEC, while it was signicantly down-regulated when cells were exposed to com- mensal HB101. The trypsinogen IV protein was also detected insupernatants of IECs exposed to EPEC, but not in supernatants ofIECs exposed to HB101. Conclusions: The intestinal epithelium infected by a pathogenic E. coli(EPEC), but not by a commensal form (HB101) becomes leaky and the release of proteases seems to play a major role in this event. Epithelial trypsin IV, which is differentially regulated by pathogenic or commensal forms of E. coli , could play an important role in this permeability changes and overall in alerting the immune system topathogen exposure.

U-618, Tours, France Introduction: In CF, the protease/antiprotease imbalance results in the degradation of lung tissue but therapies aiming at reestablishing this balance by the administration of inhibitors gave limited results. Thedifferent distribution of neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) in CF secretions may explain that they are differently regulated by their natural inhibitors. The aim of this work was to investigate the con-tribution of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to the regulation ofNSPs activity. Methods: Proteases activities and DNA were quantied in CF sputum and in suspensions of neutrophils isolated from sputum or controlblood. We analysed the inhibition of proteases by natural inhibitors intotal sputum before and after DNase treatment. NETs secretion was triggered by incubation of isolated neutrophils with S. aureus andP. aeruginosa and NETs were observed by scanning electron micros- and confocal microscopy. are active in CF sputum and resist to inhibition because of their bindingto extracellular DNA and other macromolecular compounds. Part ofsputum DNA belongs to NETs as deduced from the presence of NETotic neutrophils in sputum. HNE activity in whole sputum increases dramatically after DNase treatment and can be fullyinhibited whereas Pr3 and CG activity increase only slightly andstill resist inhibition. CF pathogens induce a higher secretion of NETs by sputum neutrophils than by control blood neutrophils but the activity of the 3 NETs-bound proteases can be measured onlyafter their solubilization from NETs by DNase.Conclusion: We conclude that NETs contribute to DNA load in CF sputum and constitute a reservoir of active proteases that can be mobilized by DNase. The improvement of anti-inflammatory thera-pies by protease inhibitors requires a solubilization of the three major NSPs in lung secretions in parallel to the administration of inhibitors.

USA The pathophysiological function of proteinase 3 (PR3) is not well understood mainly because of its close structural and functionalresemblance with neutrophil elastase and the absence of a specicinhibitor able to target its active site in vivo. Based on the structural analysis of the active sites of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and PR3,we have raised serpinB1 by only fewresidues in their reactive center loop. The rate constant of associationbetween the best serpinB1 mutant and puried PR3 was 1.4910 7M-1s-1which is about 100-fold higher than that observed with wild-type serpinB1, and compares with that of alpha1-PI towardsHNE. Proteolytic cleavage of the mutant serpinB1 by HNE does notimpair the formation of the SDS stable, irreversible complex with PR3 when a molar excess of HNE is present in the reactional mixture. Mutant serpinB1inhibits soluble PR3 as well as membrane-bound PR3 at thesurface of activated neutrophils and clears induced PR3, but not con-stitutive PR3, from the cell surface. Such a specic inhibitor should help investigating the biological function of this protease and possibly serve as a therapeutic agent in PR3-related inflammatory diseases such asWegener granulomatosis.

During joint inflammation, articular synovial broblasts (B type) are the main cells involved in the release of inflammatory mediators. In this study we investigated the capacity ofa metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops asper snake venom (BaP1) to induce release of interleukins (ILs) -1 b, -6 and 18 in the articular joints of rats and the effects of this protease on synovial broblasts in culture, evaluating cytokines production and TNF- a gene expression. Male Wistar rats were injected with BaP1 (5 mg/ joint) or bovine serum albumin (BSA-control). At selected periods of time after this injection concentrations of ILs were determined byEIA. B type synoviocytes were isolated from rat knee joints synovialmembranes and incubated with BaP1 (12.5 mg/mL) or medium alone (control). TNF- agene expression was evaluated by real time PCR. Results showed that in vivo BaP1 induced release of IL-1 b, IL-6 (1-3 h) IL-18 (12-48 h). Stimulation B synoviocytes withBaP1 caused of IL-1 b(12-24 h), IL-6 (30 h), IL-18 (1 and 24 h) and TNF- a(1-6 h) in the supernatant of cultures. In addition, BaP1 induced gene expression of TNF- a(5 min-3 h) in synoviocytes. Together, obtained data showed the capacity of BaP1 toinduce the release of ILs in the articular cavity of rats and the ability of this protease to directly stimulate B type synoviocytes to produce and release of inflammatory cytokines. Up regulation of geneexpression of TNF- amay be the primary mechanism for production of this mediator induced by BaP1. Moreover, data suggest that B type synoviocytes are target cells for MMPs during inflammatory pro-cesses INVOLVEMENT OF INFLAMMASOME PATHWAY AND MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIVER FIBROSIS IN MICE V. Lagente1,*, I. Guenon1, A. Fautrel1,2, is the result of a complex interaction between different cell types and is characterized by an inflammatoryprocess in response to chronic injury and by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), leading to the accumulation of extracellular matrix. We investigated the involvement of inflammasome pathway,the role of P2XR7 and of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP and TIMP- 1) in the CCL4-induced inflammatory process and liver brosis in mice. Methods: CCL4-induced liver injury was obtained by intraperitonealinjection of 0.35 ml/kg CCL4 dissolved in a 1:12 ratio with mineraloil in C57BL/6 males. Animals were injected once with CCL4 and liver were harvested. In another set of experiments, mice were treated twice a week for 3 weeks and were sacriced 2 days after the lastinjection. Livers were harvested either into 10% buffered formalin forhistological evaluation or snap-frozen into liquid nitrogen for mRNA or cellular lysate preparations. Collagen deposition was analysed by red Sirius staining. Components of Inflammasome, MMPs QPCR Results: CCL4 induced a signicant collagen deposition in liver after 3 weeks but not at 24 h, as determined by red sirus staining andincreased alpha1-collagen expression. Pro-MMP-9 and TIMP-1 wereincreased both at 24 h and 3 weeks, but MMP-2 only at 3 weeks. An increase in Nlrp3 inflammasome transcription was observed at 24 h and 3 weeks but purinergic receptor P2rx7 and Pannexin 1 were only sig-nicantly elevated at 3 weeks. In control mice, immunostaining showeda low expression of P2RX7 and PANX1 in the portal area, NLRP3 was not detectable, whereas CCL4 induced a signicant increase expression of NLRP3, PANX1 and P2RX7 at 24 h but more markedly at 3 weeks.Conclusions: These results showed that CCL4-induced an earlyactivation of inflammasome pathway inducing an imbalance between MMP and TIMP-1 and leading to collagen deposition and brosis.

Mutations in NOD1 andNOD2 genes are associated with hyperinflammatory responses and stimulation of Nod2 in oste-oblasts synergistically enhances osteoclast formation induced by LPS,IL-1a, and TNF- a; suggesting that Nod proteins play an important role modulating signaling pathways associated with the immune response. Since NF-kB and p38 MAPK are signaling pathwaysinvolved in the expression of inflammatory mediators, we examinedthe role of Nod1, Nod2 and MyD88 proteins on the activation of these signaling pathways by western-blot. The involvement of Nod1, Nod2 and MyD88 in the regulation of bone turnover was assessed bydetermining their role on the modulation of stromal cells (BMSCs) were obtained by flushing the marrows of long bones of MyD88, Nod1 and Nod2 KOmice. BMSCs obtained from wild-type C57/Bl6 mice were used as controls. Cells were stimulated with Escherichia coli of NF- jB, which was completely abrogated in cells lacking either Nod2. Activation of p38 MAPK in MyD88 -/- cells. MyD88, LPS-inducedRANKL expression. Inhibition of OPG mRNA induced by LPS and IL-1 required MyD88 and Nod1, but not Nod2. Our results suggest that MyD88, Nod1 Nod2 modulate activation of NF- jB and p38 MAPK and may play important roles in regulation of bone turnover in inflammatory and infectious conditions.

Cirillo1,*, \u00b4rio o Paulo, Brazil During phagocytosis, the engulfment of the particle begins with the nascent phagosome formation, which occurs at 5 min. At nascentphagosomes an increase on tyrosine phosphorylation and actin poly-merization are observed, this polymerization leads phagosome maturation. Previous studies showed that Crotalus durissus terricus snake venom inhibits the phagocytic activity of macrophages andneutrophils and that crotoxin, the main component of the venom, is responsible for this effect. In macrophages, crotoxin cause reorgani- zation of the actin cytoskeleton and inhibition of phosphotyrosine. Theaim of this study was to investigate the effect of crotoxin on tyrosinephosphorylation and actin polymerization on nascent phagosome of neutrophils. Neutrophils were obtained from peritoneal cavity of rats 4 h after the intraperitoneal administration of carrageenan (4.5 mg/kg)and then incubated (1 h) and submitted to phagocytosis of 5 min. For in vivo assays, neutrophils obtained from rats treated with crotoxin (0.1 mg/kg), 2 h before carrageenan, were also submitted to phagocytosis. Tyrosinephosphorylation and actin with and staining with phalloidin. results showed that crotoxin induced a in staining of phosphotyrosine and F-actin on neutrophilsduring phagocytosis, when compared to the controls. Unlike what occurs in macrophages, our results demonstrate that crotoxin inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation and consequently actin polymerization whichmay inhibitory effect of crotoxin on phago-cytosis by neutrophils. Furthermore, taking into account the importance of these phagocytes on inflammatory response, these results contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatoryeffect of crotoxin.

Turvey11Pediatrics, University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen in infants and young children. 2-3% of primary RSV infections result in severe cases of bronchiolitis and pneumoniarequiring hospitalization and supportive care. Treatment options arevery limited. Excessive inflammation triggered by the host is believed to play a major role in the development of the clinical manifestations. The underlying molecular mechanisms are not well dened butmainly involve the activation of the transcription factor NF- jB. Hence, elucidating the mechanisms of NF- jB activation after RSV infection will likely help to develop new anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we used transfected HEK 293-derived cell lines that overex-press selected human infectionwith live RSV or stimulation with puried TLR ligands (controls). Inaddition, parental cells that harbour the SEAP reporter gene but generally lack TLR expression were used to control for endogenous responses. We demonstrate that HEK 293 cells are permissive forRSV; however the live virus fails to activate human TLRs 3, 4 and 7.Moreover, live RSV is unable to interfere with TLR3, -4 and -7 activation in HEK 293-derived cells mediated by their specic, puried agonists poly(I:C), E. coli LPS, and R848, respectively. This suggests that RSV can evade recognition by these innate immune receptors and may explain why in some children the immune system fails to control primary infection with this virus. Studies are ongoingto determine which pattern recognition receptors are essential for thehuman innate immune system to sense RSV infection. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-150 INHIBITION OF CLATHRIN/DYNAMIN- DEPENDENT TRAM -TRIF SIGNALING PATHWAY J. Zheng1,* 1Medical Research Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China TLR4 plays fundamental roles in provoking a robust anti infectious inflammatory reaction. Recognition of LPS by TLR4 could trigger generally two signaling pathways, the MyD88- dependent and -inde- pendent pathways. Additionally, this recognition could also induce theinternalization of LPS/TLR4 complex, which is considered as aninteracted process with signaling events. To deeply investigate the role of LPS/TLR4 complex internalization in macrophage activation, we did the following experiments. The localization of LPS and TLR4 as well asthe changes of major proinflammatory cytokines and signaling mole-cules were observed or detected in macrophages treated with or without internalization inhibitors showed LPS down-regulated cell surface TLR4 level and both LPS and TLR4 were endocytosed into cytoplasm and colocalized at same local site. On the other hand, inhibitors ofclathrin/dynamin, MDC and dynasore, could maintain higher TLR4 onthe cell surface and less LPS/TLR4 within the cells because of blocking LPS/TLR4 internalization. However, CQ, an inhibitor of endosome acidication, markedly decreased TLR4 amount on the cell surface andincreased LPS and TLR4 amounts within the cells. Furthermore, thedata from ELISA, cytokine antibody array and western blot assaysS132 Inflamm. Res. 123demonstrated that only MyD88-independent pathway was involved in early phase of LPS internalization; but in later phase, TLR4 back to cellsurface could mediate the MyD88-dependent pathways again, and start to the next round of internalization. Taken together, this study claries that internalization of the LPS/TLR4 complex not only maintained theTLR4 recycle, but also took part in the macrophage activation by theMyD88-independent pathway. This nding might provide a new approach to treat the over-inflammatory diseases. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-151 GILZ S. Perugia, Perugia,2IRCCS ''Bonino-Pulejo'', Messina, Italy Glucocorticoids (GC) are of extraordinary therapeutic value in a wide range of inflammatory, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic activity is due to regulatory effects on activation, cell growth and differentiation in a number of cells and tissues, includingcells of the immune/inflammatory system. With the aim to deeplyanalyze the molecular mechanisms of GC action, we have identied a number of GC-induced genes including glucocorticoid-induced leu- cine (GILZ), a protein rapidly induced by GC treatment. Usingdifferent experimental models of inflammatory diseases, we show GILZ is an important mediator of the anti-inflammatory and immu- nosuppressive effects of GC. Moreover, we identied a new L-GILZ, involved in mediating the effects of GC oninflammation and on cell differentiation. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that both GILZ and L-GILZ are crucial mediators of GC-induced effects in that mediate the anti-inflammatory/immuno-suppressive activity. In particular, GILZ regulates T cell activationand differentiation, cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, production and inflammatory process development. Results could provide new means to predict sensitivity of normal and tumor cells totreatment with GC and to outline new therapeutic approaches. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-152 MECHANISM OF FOXO FACTORS NUCLEAR EXCLUSION THE ubiquitous protein whose expression is induced by glu- cocorticoids in haematopoietic cells. GILZ regulates AP-1, jB and FOXO. Indeed, Forkhead transcription factors have beenincreasingly recognized to play a role in immune homeostasis, especially in chronic inflammation. Nuclear import of FOXO factorsfollows stress signals such as oxidative stress, leading to up-regula- tion of target genes, whereas nuclear export is favoured by phosphorylations, mainly by Protein Kinase B, and subsequent 14-3-3recruitment. We recently showed that GILZ inhibits FOXO factorstranscriptional activities in the acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells independently of PKB phosphorylation but through a Crm-1 dependent nuclear exclusion of FOXO3 leading to its relocalization tothe cytoplasm. The aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanismof FOXO factors relocalization by GILZ. First, we showed that the cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3 in the presence of GILZ was not due to an association of FOXO3 with shuttling GILZ. Our hypothesisis that GILZ may promote phosphorylation of onregulatory affecting their nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, pos- sibly through new 14-3-3 binding sites creation. ERK, JNK or p38 Mitogen Activated Protein kinases activities were inhibited by GILZ,as assessed in GILZ-expressing FOXO3-WT and with PKB sites) and observed thatthese mutants were still signicantly inhibited by GILZ. Interestingly,mutation 413, a target of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) located in a consensus 14-3-3 recognition motif, along with substitution of Ile 394 to Ala in the NES of FOXO3, stronglyimpaired the inhibitory effect of GILZ, suggesting that GILZ couldpromote the association of an export complex on FOXO factors independently of PKB sites.

Camara1 1Immunology, University Of Sao Paulo,2Nephrology,3Federal University Of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity and is well established that inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of thedisease. An organelle that suffers cellular stress is the endoplasmicreticulum (ER), leading to altered protein folding. The accumulation of unfolded proteins generates a cell response, which tends to return to homeostasis, but may cause the production of inflammatory factorsand even cell death. The Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzymewith cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. induction may lead to a modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The aim of this study is to evaluate if ERS generated by AKIcan be modulate by HO-1 induction. Also, we tested if ERS can be induced in ox-LDL stimulated macrophages. Methods: C57/BL6 mice were subjected to bilateral ischemia and reper-fusion injury (I/R) for 45 min and sacriced after 0, 15 and 30 min, and 6,12 and 24 h of reperfusion. A group of animals was also treated with Hemin, an HO-1 inducer. We collected blood samples for renal function assessment and renal tissue to determine the gene expression of HO-1,TNF-a, HIF-1a, BiP and CHOP. Moreover, it was also done immuno-blotting for ERS markers. Further, macrophages were stimulated with ox-Inflamm. Res.

Moreover, treated group had higher gene expression of HO-1 and lower expression of TNF- aand HIF- 1a. Also, ERS molecules had lower gene and protein expression intreated animals. Finally, ox-LDL stimulated macrophages had a sig- nicantly increase on ERS, with concomitant higher levels of IL-6.

Their properties have been studies innumber cell types, but is unknown their effect on T cell. In this study, delphinidin was found to increase the interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and expression in Jurkat cells via Calcium Release Activated Calcium(CRAC) and activation of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). By spectrofluorimetric experiments, we tested the by BTP2 and Gd3+reduced the calcium entry stimulated by delphinidin in a dose-dependent manner. In experiments of patch clamp, we observed that delphinidin was able to stimulate a calcium release-activated Ca2+current (I CRAC ), which was inhibited in part BTP-2 and Gd3+. Moreover, in assays of bio- luminiscence imaging of NFAT activity in single living Jurkat F6 cells stably expressing the luciferase reporter gene under control of three NFAT response elements, we showed that delphinidin inducedthe NFAT activity at 2 h post stimulation. Meanwhile, we observedthat delphinidin induced the IL-2 production and expression in Jurkat cells after 24 h. To asses if CRAC and NFAT contributes to the IL-2 production and expression induced by delphinidin, we treated theJurkat cells with BTP-2 or an inhibitor of calcineurin, Cyclosporine A (CsA). Both, signicantly decreased the IL-2 production and expression induced by delphinidin. Finally, we observed that del-phinidin induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at min and kinase, and U0126, reduced the IL-2 delphinidin, not so the inhibitor of JAK2, AG490.

Disclosure of INVOLVEMENT OF JNK/AP-1 PATHWAY IN ENDOTHELIN-1-INDUCED Therapy, Taipei Medicial University, Taipei, Taiwan, China Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictive peptide, as a key mediator of vasoconstriction and tissue repair. It is found that patients with asthma have signicantly higher ET-1 levels as compared with nor-mal subjects. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an immediate early gene, and overproduction of CTGF underlies the development of lung brosis. Previous studies have shown that ET-1induces expression of matrix-associated genes in lung broblastthrough MEK/ERK pathway. However, little information is known about the signaling pathway of CTGF expression in lung broblasts caused by ET-1. In this study, we found that ET-1-induced CTGFexpression was inhibited by BQ123 (ET AR antagonist), but controlled by the sequence -747 to -408 bp upstream of the transcription start site on the human CTGF promoter, suggesting ET-1-induced CTGF expression was most controlled bythe c-Jun phosphorylation, the formation of AP-1-specic DNA-protein complex, and the recruit-ment of c-Jun to the CTGF promoter. These results suggest that ET-1acting through ET AR, activates the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway, which in turn initiates AP-1 activation and recruitment of AP-1 to the CTGF promoter, and ultimately induces CTGF expression in humanlung broblasts.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-156 HUMAN PLATELETS USE MEMBRANEEXPRESSED TLR2 MOLECULES TO SECRETE A PANEL OF CYTOKINES IN A NF- jB/MYD88- DEPENDANT MECHANISM P.

The purpose of this study was to further investigate TLR2 stimulation and NF- jB/MyD88-dependent signalling machinery.

Finally, modulation of platelet soluble factors release was observed if platelets were pre-treated by NF- jB p65 inhibitors prior receptor acti-vating for anucleatedcells permit to explore MYD88 pathway. Our observations support the concept that NF- jB proteins are central in platelet inflammatory func- tions. We recently proposed that platelets adapt the subsequent responses,with polarized cytokine secretion; after signal danger receptor involve- ment and these resulted complete this, with a potential role of NF- jB. Platelet expression of TLR and transcription factors must be, now,apprehended for therapeutics focus on transcription factors TLRdependant, as NF- inhibitory drugs. Disclosure of interest: INHIBITS TNF-ALPHA EXPRESSION A and B (CyPB) are inflammatory mediators that induce migration of Tlymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Cyclophilin A was also reported to induce expression of pro-inflammatory mediators as TNF- a, IL-1bor IL-8 in monocytes/macrophages. However, these last ndings are controversial and no data are available concerning the responses ofmacrophages to a long-term exposure to cyclophilins. We recently demonstrated that a pre-treatment of macrophages with CyPB reduced the secretion of TNF- ainduced by LPS, suggesting that CyPB can regulate inflammatory responses in macrophages. Based on this hypothesis, we examined the molecular mechanisms responsible for desensitization of LPS-induced TNF- aexpression. So we used mac- rophages derived from human peripheral blood monocytes and THP-1cells, which can be efciently differentiated into macrophage-like cells. Quantitative real time PCR analysis allowed us to demonstrate that CyPB strongly inhibits the expression of TNF- amRNA. We also found that CyPB induced in macrophages expression of Bcl-3, a protein known toenhance binding of p50/p50 homodimer, a nuclear factor devoid of transcriptional activity, to the promoter of TNF- agene. We therefore analyzed the molecular events that down-regulate transcriptional acti-vation of TNF- agene immunoprecipitation, we conrmed that pre-treatment of cells with CyPB induced the accumulation of p50/p50 NF- jB, which bound to TNF- agene promoter in place of p65/p50, thus reducing transcriptional activation. Finally, silencing the expression of Bcl-3 by RNA interference efciently restored LPS-induced TNF- aexpression in cells, thus involvement of Bcl-3 in theinhibitory activity of CyPB. Altogether, our results support the hypoth-esis that CyPB is a regulatory factor, which may take part in the modulation of the inflammatory response.

Recent data showed theimportance of Toll-like receptors on the IRI. Even more recently, ithas been discovered another family of innate immunity receptors, present within the intracellular compartments, the NOD-like receptors (NLR). The role of NLR in the kidney is less clear, but there isevidence of its involvement in renal diseases. The objective of thisstudy was to evaluate the involvement of TLR by studying its adaptador protein MyD88, and intracellular Nod-1 Nod-2 in the AKI triggered by IRI.Methods: C57BL6 WT animals and knockout (KO) to MyD88, Nod- 1, Nod-2, RIP-2 and double KO Nod1/2 were subjected to 45 min of ischemia. Blood samples and kidney tissue were collected for bio-chemical analysis, gene expression, protein and histological featuresat different times of reperfusion. Results: Initially, we observed higher gene expression of MyD88, Nod-1 and Nod-2 in renal tissue after different periods of IRI. After24 h of reperfusion we observed that WT and Nod-1KO animalsshowed a signicant renal dysfunction assessed by serum creatinine and indices of acute tubular necrosis while knockout animals for MyD88, Nod-2, RIP-2 and Nod1/2 showed a signicant protection when compared to WT. Also, WT animals showedextensive areas of hypoxia compared to different KO, and mRNA expression of HIF-1 expressed 2.5 9more than Nod-2, RIP-2, Nod1/2 and MyD88 KO animals. Interestingly, the gene expression ofBcl-2 was reduced in WT mice while in KO animals it was up reg- ulated. We also veried that KO mice presented signicantly less serum levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, compared to WTanimals.Conclusion: Besides the TLR, the intracellular sensors Nod-1 and Nod-2 play a role in the pathogenesis of AKI by different mechanisms that result in an exacerbation of the inflammatory process, leading to arenal dysfunction.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM) comprise a unique family of G-protein coupled receptors that are promisingtargets for therapeutic interference. The binding of glutamate toGRMs induces signal transduction cascades that lead to gene-spe- cic transcription. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate and regulate GRM-induced gene expression are still lar-gely unclear. We are studying intracellular signal transduction inresponse to type I GRMs (GRM1 and GRM5).

Cell death mechanisms P-160 THE SURVIVAL OF HUMAN DENDRITIC CELLS IS CONTROLLED BY THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL FACTOR NRF2 IN RESPONSE TO CHEMICALSENSITIZERS France Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells playing a major role in the induction of primary immune response. After theexposure of DC to skin contact sensitizers, such as nickel 4)o asMitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) are observed. Thesecompounds generate a chemical stress that can be perceived as a danger signal by DC, leading to their maturation. Among signaling pathways known to be redox-sensitive, the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway iscentral for the detection of electrophilic molecules. In the absence of achemical stress, Keap1 associates with Nrf2 and targets it to degra- dation. In the presence of an electrophilic compound, Keap1's is modied leading to Nrf2 translocation to the nucleusand transcription of its target genes. To study the role of the tran- scriptional factor Nrf2 in response to chemical sensitizers, DC derived from monocytes (Mo-DC) were treated with NiSO 4, DNCB or (CinA) for different times and Nrf2 expression wasmeasured by Western blot. Accumulation of Nrf2 protein was observed after 4 h of stimulation. To evaluate the role of Nrf2 in cell survival, Mo-DC have been transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to invalidate in vitronrf2 transcripts and were then treated with NiSO 4or DNCB or CinA for 18 h. staining were used to measure apoptoticand necrotic cells respectively. Results showed an increase of sec- ondary necrotic cells (AnV+/7-AAD+) and total apoptotic cells (AnV+/7-AAD-) when Nrf2 is invalided. Otherwise, living cells decreased in absence of Nrf2. These results suggest that the tran- scriptional factor Nrf2 would play a role in cell survival and wouldprotect DC from contact sensitizers. Now, we are focusing our workon caspase signaling pathway in order to know if Nrf2 controls cas- pase activation, known to be involved in DC maturation. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

MNNG can cause excess DNAstrand breaks that lead to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation and cell death (parthanatos). used MNNG-treated mouse embryonic broblasts to death can be abrogated in RIP1 decient cells or by using silence RNA technique to knockdown RIP1 expression. MNNG can also induce rapid PARP-1 and activa-tion, biphasic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and intracellular calcium increase. The early ROS production occurring at 1 min and peaking at 5-15 min after MNNG treatment partiallyresulted from NADPH oxidase. In contrast, the late phase of ROSproduction occurring at 30 min and time-dependently increasing up to 6 h after MNNG treatment was generated by mitochondria. Results further indicated the involvement of RIP1 in sustained late phase ROSproduction and calcium increase. The interactive roles of RIP1 with ROS,JNK and calcium elevation in MNNG-induced parthanatos were char- acterized. Moreover, we found involved in oxidative stress-induced NF- jB and AMPK activation. Taken together, RIP1 is a key mediator for oxidative stress-induced cellular signaling and death. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-162 DOUBLE DEALINGS OF APOPTOTIC CASPASES IN of Dermatology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu, Hsinchu,3Mackay Medicine, Nursing and Management College, Taipei, Taiwan, ChinaS136 Inflamm. Res. 123Terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes to corneocytes is a unique model of cell death, which is indispensable for the homeo-stasis of skin. Despite earlier disputation, cornication has been distinguished from other types of programmed cell death, especially apoptosis. The previous report revealed that differentiating keratino-cytes induced by cell confluence can be resistant to tumor necrosisfactor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis and indicated differentiation is distinct from death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In our study, we report during confluence-induced treating dividing NHEKs with TRAIL, markers of keratinocyte differentiation such as involucrin and type 1 transglutaminase can be induced in addition tothe induction of apoptosis. However, under the pretreatment of cal-cium in NHEKs, expression of differentiation markers cannot be further enhanced by TRAIL but cell death-induced by TRAIL is diminished. When blocking the activity of caspase 3 and 8, bothdifferentiation and death of NHEKs triggered by TRAIL are abolished but differentiation induced by calcium and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate are barely affected. Moreover, TRAIL-evoked signaling ofERK and p38 and degradation of p63 are also attenuated by inhibitingthe activation of caspase 3 and 8. Comparing floating cells with adherent NHEKs after the treatment of TRAIL, we nd much more abundant expression of differentiation markers including involucrin,keratin 10 and loricrin is detected in floating cells than adherentNHEKs. These ndings provide a new insight into the complicated relationship between apoptosis and cornication, and also unravel the novel role of apoptotic caspases in keratinocyte differentiation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Remodeling is recognized by brosis of sub-epithelialbasement membrane, hypertrophy of bronchialglands, goblet cell hyperplasia, thickening of airway epithelium. In this study, we investigated the role of female sex hormones in airway remodelingand responsiveness in a model of chronic lung inflammation.Material and methods: Female C57B/6 mice were subjected to ovaries removal (OVx ) and were OVA-sensitized (OVA 1 mg/ml SC 7 and 14 days later). Control group consisted of sham OVx-OVA. After day 21, OVA-challenge (aerosol, 15 min, OVA 1%)was performed three times a week during three weeks (OVx- OVA). After 5 days of the last OVA-challenge, part of theanimals (OVx-OVA and sham OVx-OVA) was submitted to in vitro tracheal maximal contractile response (E max) to methacho- line (MCh) and histological analysis ( picrusirius red and PAS staining) to identify collagen deposition and mucus production on bronchial compartment. The other part of the ani-mals (OVx-OVA and sham OVx -OVA) was anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and respiratory mechanics assessment (total lung resistance, R, and elastance, E) was performed. Results: Measurements of bronchial mucus and collagen were sig-nicantly lower (6 and 2 times lower respectively) after chronicantigen exposure of OVx-OVA compared with their sham OVx-OVA counterparts. OVx-OVA showed reduced tracheal responsiveness in vitro to MCh (E max: 3.65 g) in comparison to sham OVx-OVA (E max 1.6 g). Total lung resistance ( R) and elastance (E) were higher and lower respectively in sham OVx-OVA. Conclusions: Removal of ovaries affected the magnitude of lung inflammatory response after chronic exposure to antigen suggestingthat female sex hormones could mediate the airway responsiveness and remodeling in chronic allergic lung inflammation.

Wise1 1School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China The mast cell is an important inflammatory effector in both innate and adaptive immunity. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, modulatesa large number of cellular systems in inflammation. While activation of mast cells through IgE receptors (initiation of allergic reaction in adaptive immunity) is known to be modulated by adenosine, the effectsof adenosine on toll like receptors (TLRs) induced mast cells activation(initiation of inflammation in innate immunity) has not been thoroughly studied. We pharmacologically characterized the actions of adenosine on TLR induced IL-8 release from human cultured mast cells (HCMC).Treatment of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and -8-10-7M) potentiated PGN-mediated IL-8 production which was not observed in LPS treated cells. A 1 receptor agonists, CCPA and 20MeCCPA, both markedly potentiated the IL-8 production by PGN dose-dependently. Moreover, a similareffect was also found with A 3receptor selective agonists 2Cl-IB-MECA and HEMADO. A 2receptor was not involved in the enhancing effect as A2receptor specic CGS21680 and CV1808 were found not to affect the PGN effect. The potency of adenosine agonists antagonists on the potentiating action of NECA on PGN induced IL-8 release were investigated, signicant inhibition of thepotentiating action of NECA was observed with antagonists of A 1 receptor, CGS15943 and PSB36, and A 3receptor, MRS3777, but not that of A 2Breceptor, PSB1115. These results suggest that A 1/A3 receptors are responsible for the potentiating effect of adenosine onmast cell activation by PGN in human innate immune reactions.

S137 123P-165 OCCURRENCE OF BIPHASIC University, Kwangju, Republic Of Korea Nonspecic airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is one of cardinal features of bronchial asthma. We have described TNF- a-induced late AHR in a murine model of asthma, in which protocol, the micereceived twice intraperitoneal immunization, followed by broncho- provocation twice with aerosolized ovalbumin with a 1-week interval. The AHR occurs at 10-14 after the second airway allergenchallenge. In this study, we examined the kinetics of late AHR up to 60 h in a 6 h intervals We found that the specic airway resistance increased 4-vefold at 12 h after airway challenge of allergen, fol-lowed by the second phase response being larger and broader inresistance at 24-48 h, peaking at 36 h with 3.5 to 4.5-fold increase, indicating that biphasic late AHR occurred in this murine model of asthma. The rst phase of late AHR was abrogated by pretreatmentof the sensitized animals with anti-TNF- a. Intratracheal adminis- tration of IgE as well as IgG immune complexes (ICs) were able to induce rst phase of late AHR via producing TNF- ain the airways in normal animals. The second phase of late AHR was abrogated bypretreatment of the sensitized animals with CpG-ODN, which inhibited Th2 asthmatic phenotypes, such as airway levels of IL-4 and IL-5 and eosinophils, but it affected neither airway levels ofTNF-a, nor the magnitude of the rst phase of AHR. These data indicate that biphasic late AHR occurs in a murine model of asthma, in which TNF- aand Th2 response are responsible for the devel- opment of the rst and second phases of late AHR, respectively.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-166 A SYNTHETIC CHRYSIN DIHYDROXY-8-(PYRIDINE-4YL) POTENT H. Park1 1College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Republic of Korea In order to nd the anti-inflammatory flavonoid derivatives having optimum chemical structures, various 8-heterocyclic-substituted chrysinderivatives were previously synthesized and their effects on prostaglan- din E 2(PGE 2) production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated. Through thisscreening procedure, 5,7-dihydroxy-8-(pyridine-4yl)flavone (C-721) among the derivatives was selected for further pharmacological study. Contrary to the parent molecule, chrysin, C-721 was found to potentlyinhibit PGE 2and NO production from LPS-treated RAW cells. The IC 50 values of C-721 were 6.2 and 22.6 lM, respectively for COX-2 mediated PGE 2and iNOS-mediated NO production. Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis proved that this com-pound inhibited PGE 2production at least in part by COX-2 down-regulation and COX-2 inhibition, while C-721 inhibited NO production iNOS expression. addition, at 10-50 lM. In vivo has revealed that oral and intraperitoneal administration of C-721 showed 25.2-44.3% inhibition against k-carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice. Furthermore, this compound inhibited collagen-induced arthritis inmice by intraperitoneal injection. All these results suggest that C-721 may have a potential for a synthetic lead compound as new anti- inflammatory agent.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-167 ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHANGES OF AIRWAY IN CHRONIC OVALBUMIN MOUSE MODELOF ASTHMA G. D. Leishangthem1,*, U. Mabalirajan2, B. Ghosh2, A. Agrawal2, A. K. Dinda1 1Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India, ansari nagar, New Delhi,2Molecular Immunogenetics Laboratory and Center for Translational Research in Asthma and Lung Disease, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi, India The mechanisms underlying airway remodeling in asthma remain unknown and ultrastructural changes of asthmatic airway mightreveal novel mechanisms. To investigate the histopathological andultrastructural features of the airway in a chronic ovalbumin mouse model of asthma, two groups of BALB/c mice [Sham and ovalbumin (OVA) n =6 each] were sensitized and challenged with 1.5% OVA in PBS [OVA group (30 min per day, alternative days)] or PBS (Sham group) for 4 weeks. After determining airway hyperrespon- siveness (AHR) to methacholine, mice were sacriced and lungs weretaken for both histopathological and electron microscopic studies.AHR in response to methacholine was enhanced in OVA mice. Histopathological studies revealed the presence of denuded bronchial were composed mainly of eosinophils, lymphocytes and macrophages. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that there were inactive granules in chronic compared to partial activegranules in acute asthma. There were signs of epithelial apoptosis such as shrinkage of bronchial epithelia, widening of intercellular space between adjacent bronchial epithelial cells, and subepithelialbrosis. Basement membrane were thickened and composed mainlyof broblast and collagen. Interestingly, we found mucus granules in both ciliated and Clara cells. In addition, there is increase in the number of mitochondria in smooth muscle as well as evidence ofmitochondrial injury in asthmatic mice. In conclusion, TEM revealedthe interesting and crucial ultrastructural changes of asthmatic airway in relation to airway remodeling and thus it appears to be a useful tool in understanding its pathogenesis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-168 EVALUATION OF THE SENSITIZING POTENTIALOF CHEMICALS BASED ON THEIR dermatitis (ACD) resulting from skin sensitization is a common occupational and environmental health problem, in which dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role. Indeed, after haptenbinding, internalization and processing, DCs acquire a mature phe-notype and migrate from the skin to the draining lymph nodes where they present hapten-peptide complexes to naive T cells. Haptens need to link with proteins to form a stable antigenic complex, able toinduce an immune response. Our hypothesis is that chemical reac-tivity is necessary for a chemical to be a sensitizer allowing both covalent binding to proteins and stimulation of DC maturation by mimicking ''danger signals'' signalling. To date there is no evidencethat a positive correlation exist between the capacity of a chemical to bind to a protein and the amount of stress it induces in DC allowing its maturation. As it is now well accepted that chemical stress will inducethe up-regulation of detoxication systems, allowing DC to handle theperturbation of cellular redox homeostasis, the aim of this study is to evaluate sensitizer potency based on their chemical reactivity using the activation of the Nrf-2 pathway. For this purpose, dendritic (Mo-DCs) and dendritic-like cells (THP-1) were exposed to six with different reactivity (two haptens with high cysteine haptens mixed afnity) and two pro-haptens and pre-haptens.Activation of the Nrf-2 pathway was assessed by measuring the Nrf-2-dependent genes: nqo1 Our results show that chemical sensitizers were able to induce the transcription of Nfr-2 target genes in both models, incorrelation with CD86 and/or CD54 surexpression. These studies will allow developing a new approach for detecting chemical sensitizers in integrating data coming from peptide reactivity tests and data onactivation of dendritic cells.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-169 SUSTAINED IMMUNE SUPPRESSION BY CTLA4-IG IN TWO HAPTEN-INDUCED INFLAMMATION MODELS A. D. Christensen1,*, H. C. Haase1 1Experimental Immunology, Novo Nordisk A/S, Ma l\u00f8v, Denmark The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CTLA4-Ig on the induction of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). CHS is a T cell mediatedimmune reaction in response to epicutaneous application of a haptenand consists of two phases; sensitization- and elicitation phase. Mice were sensitized with DNFB or oxazolone and 5 or 6 days later, a challenge dose was applied. The inflammatory response is quantiedby measuring the increase in ear-thickness at various time-points afterchallenge and the treatment groups are compared to isotype-treated control groups. Firstly, CTLA4-Ig was given in the doses 25, 5 and 1 mg/kg a day prior to sensitization. This study revealed a dose-dependent suppression of the ear-swelling response in both DNFB- and oxazolone-induced CHS, and the effect was most marked in the DNFB model. To obtain full inhibition in the oxazolone model, thedoses were increased up to 125 mg/kg which reduced the responsevery close to background level. Mice treated with CTLA4-Ig were re- sensitized and re-challenged 3 weeks after the rst sensitizationwithout any further treatment with CTLA4-Ig. In both models, CTLA4-Ig still had a suppressive effect 3 weeks after administrationalthough no CTLA4-Ig could be detected in serum. The effect was again most signicant in the DNFB model. Based on these data, we can conclude that CTLA4-Ig induce a long-term immunosuppressionof both DNFB- and oxazolone-induced CHS. The effect was mostmarked in the DNFB model, which could indicate quantitative dif- ference between the two models. Although the effects of CTLA4-Ig on CHS have been studied previously, this study is the rst to com-pare the effect of this compound in both DNFB- and oxazolone-induced CHS and to show a long-term effect of CTLA4-Ig in the oxazolone model.

Correia Da Silva1,*, R. Landgraf2, M. Correa-Costa3, A. N. Camara3 1Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo,2Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema,3University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: The renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a sys- temic inflammatory reaction with predominance of a Th1 response, which affects other organs, modulating a local inflammatory response,including the lung. The lung inflammation is a complex disease thatinvolves the participation of inflammatory mediators and Th2 lymphocytes. Objectives: To evaluate the phagocytic and microbicide capacity ofmacrophages in rats with lung inflammation that underwent IRI.Materials and methods: The alveolar macrophages of rats sensitized to OVA were evaluated for testing phagocytosis and killing, 24 h after antigen challenge the animals were submitted or not to 60 min ofrenal ischemia. The reperfusion injury were analyzed 24 h after the re-establishment of renal blood flow. Serum creatinine, urea, renal histology and lung tissue were evaluated.Results: lavage has a high cellular inltrate inimmunized animals (420%) compared with control animals, IRI reduced this inltration (52%). Macrophages from animals immunized and challenged with OVA presented a 10 9increased phagocytic capacity of red cells compared to control group, whereasimmunized animals subjected to IRI showed a reduction in phago- cytic index of 68%. Killing of K. pneumoniae by macrophages from immunized animals is (56%) higher compared with control group,being reduced in animals submitted to IRI (45%). The immunized andchallenged group showed an increase HO-1 (259%), to the immunized group subjected to IRI. The levels of ureaand creatinine were only altered in animals that underwent IRI showing increased urea (239%) and creatinine (324%) levels in serum compared injury alters the phag-ocytic and microbicide capacity of macrophages, reducing lung inflammation to OVA.

Tuckova2 and Microbiology, General Teaching Hospital In Prague, Prague 2,2Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, Prague 4, Czech Republic The aim of this study was to identify proteins which can be respon- sible for cross-reactivity in patient's sera being positive for wheat and reacting also with rice and pollen allergens and explore the effect ofthermal processing on the IgE reactivity of rice proteins. We stainedalso levels of total IgG, IgA, IgE, ECP and presence of autoanti- bodies. Total IgG, IgA were measured by nephelometry (Dade- Behring BNII TM). The total IgE, specic IgE and ECP were measured by IMMULITE 2000/C210. Antinuclear (Anab) antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (The Binding Site Ltd.) Sera were then processed by immunoblotting using proteins from wheat flour,raw and cooked rice. We have analyzed sera of 138 patients whichwere divided into three groups according positivity to specic IgE. Thirty-three patients were positive only for wheat and were marked as a group I. Patients positive for both wheat and pollen allergens weremarked as a group II (68 patients) and group III (37 patients) werepatients positive only for pollen allergens. We have found a strong cross-reactivity with broad spectrum of rice components (116-7 kDa) in patients (group II) having both, wheat and pollen specic IgE Abs.Patients with specic IgE against wheat or pollen allergens only,(group I and III) reacted with limited number of rice components. We have found out the same level of total IgE and ECP in group I and II but the levels of IgA and IgG were higher in group II. The most commonclinical diagnose in group I was atopic eczema (17 patients). In group III we found the lowest level of total IgE. On the other hand the level of total IgA, IgG and ECP were the highest as a presence of autoantibodies.Conclusion: Interindividual variation in the IgE antibody responsemay involve the clinical expression and reactivity of the each patient. There is also evidence that patients from group I and II differ at the level of total IgG, IgA and ECP form patients allergic only to pollenallergens.Disclosure of interest: Z.

Objectives: Investigate the ability of renal IRI in modulating the pulmonary function in a specic model of allergic lung inflammation.Materials and methods: C57Bl/6 mice were immunized with oval-bumin/alumen on days 0 and 7 and challenged with ovalbumin (OA) aerosol on days 14 and 21. After 24 h of the second antigen challenge, the animals were subjected to 45 min of ischemia. After 24 h ofreperfusion, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, blood and lung tissue were collected for analyses. Results: Serum creatinine levels increased in similar extension inallergic and non-immunized animals subjected to IRI. However, BALpresented reduction in total cells (46%) and neutrophils (58%) when compared with control allergic animals not submitted to IRI. In addition, OA challenge induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, (iNOS) lung homogenates. After renal IRI, phosphorylation of ERK, and expression of COX-2 and iNOS were markedly reduced, however there was no difference for phosphory-lation of Akt between sham and ischemic OA challenged animals. Mucus production was also reduced in allergic mice after renal IRI. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were markedly down regulated in immunized/challenged mice subjected to IR.Conclusions: These results suggested that renal IRI modulate lung allergic inflammation probably by altering the Th1/Th2 balance, at least in part, by changing cellular signal transduction factors.

Male Wistar rats were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). At 2-16 h prior to OVA challenge, animals were exposed to DMTI-II (10 lg). Bronchoalve- olar lavage fluid (BAL), circulating blood and bone marrow wereexamined at 24 h post-OVA challenge. Challenge with OVA signif- icantly increased the influx of total inflammatory cells, neutrophilsS140 Inflamm. Res. 123and eosinophils in BAL and lung tissue. Pre-exposure to DMTI-II potentiated the total inflammatory cells accompanied to DMTI-II also signicantly increased the eosinophil recruitment to BAL, an effect starting at 4 h,remaining markedly elevated at 16 h ( p\\0.05). Eosinopoiesis and eosinophilia (seen within 2-4 h) were also observed. Exposure to DMTI-II alone increased the IL-4 levels, and further increased the IL- 4 levels in OVA-challenged rats. The levels of IgE, LTB 4and eotaxin in OVA-challenged rats were greater compared with non-sensitizedrats, but DMTI-II exposure failed to further enhance such levels. In summary, our study shows that DMTI-II itself presents granulocy- topoietic activity, and enhances allergen-induced neutrophil andeosinophil mobilization from bone marrow to lung tissues that isaccompanied by enhanced IL-4 production.

However, few studies have attempted to evaluate whetherSEA and SEB exposure enhances the allergic cell pulmonary inl- tration. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of pulmonary SEA and SEB pre-exposure on the eosinophil (EO) recruitment ofallergic mice. At 4-48 h prior to OVA challenge, mice were intra- nasally instilled with SEA or SEB (1 lg). Pre-exposure to SEA signicantly increased the eosinophil recruitment to BAL (at 48 h)and pulmonary tissues (12 and 48 h). SEB also potentiated the EOinflux to BAL (at 4 h pre-exposure) and pulmonary tissues (at 12 and 24 h pre-exposure). The eotaxin levels in lung homogenates of OVA- (1,067 \u00b168.26 pg/g; P\\0.05). No signicant differences were detected for IL-4 and IL-6 in lung tissue. The lung EO inltration in OVA-challenged mice pre-exposed to SEA was accompanied by marked increases in the EOforms in bone marrow (24 h: mice (0.15 \u00b10.04 and 0.14 \u00b10.03 9106cells/m, respectively). The levels of IL-5 and eotaxin in bone marrow were 180 and 125% higher (P \\0.05) in OVA-challenged mice pre- exposed to SEA compared with saline-instilled mice. Mice pre-exposed to SEB also exhibited eosinopoiesis and blood eosinophilia,along with increased levels of IL-5 and eotaxin in bone marrow. In conclusion, airways pre-exposure to SEA and SEB exacerbates the pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation and promotes eosinopoiesis inOVA-challenged mice by mechanisms involving eotaxin and IL-5production.

Ligeiro de Oliveira1, C. R. Soares1, H. Domingos1, Tavares de Lima1 1Pharmacology, ICB, University Of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: In previous studies we have shown that antigen sensi- tization 7 days after ovariectomy (OVx) reduces pulmonary inflammation in an acute model of experimental asthma, suggesting that the course of lung inflammation (IAP) depends on female sexhormones (FSH) circulating levels. By measuring the levels of IL-1 b, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10 in pulmonary explants from a murine model of asthma, in this study we investigated how FSH could pos- sibly influence the mechanisms triggering the allergic lunginflammation.Methods: Female Balb/c mice were ovariectomized (OVx) or falsely operated (Sham-OVx) on day 0, sensitized with ovalbumin (grade V OVA/alum) on day 7 and challenged with OVA (grade V) once a day,for 15 min. on the days 14, 15 and 16. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, mice were killed in excess of ketamine and xylazine. Upon lungs removal, the cytokines IL-1 b, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 were measured in samples of pulmonary explants using Duo Set (R&DSystem O`) kits for ELISA. Results: There was a lung tissue increase of IL-1 b, IL-4, TNF- aand IL-13 in Sham-OVx and OVx group (with or without lipopolysac-charide or OVA stimuli) with regard to their corresponding basalcontrols. Overall, the rise in these cytokines levels were signicantly less in OVx than in Sham-OVx mice. Explants from Sham OVx animals had signicantly higher levels of IL-10 regarding to basals,and these were even higher in the OVx group.Conclusion: It is presumable that FSH mediate inflammatory cytokines release by the lungs and can thereby modulate the development of pul- monary allergic inflammation.Financial declared.

Tavares de Lima1 1Pharmacology, ICB, University Of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Formaldehyde (FA) is a common indoor and outdoor pollutant that is found in many products including particle board,plywood, floor coverings and ofce furniture. FA causes lunginflammation and may impair lung cell recruitment after an allergic stimulus. Considering the positive relationship between female sex hormones (FSH) and asthma, we evaluated the role of FSH on allergiclung inflammation after FA inhalation.Inflamm. Res. Wistar rats were ovariectomized (OVx) or not (Sham-OVx) and after 7 days subjected or not to FAexposure (1%, 3 days, 90 min/day). Subsequently the rats were sen- sitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). After 24 h the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the myeloperoxidase enzymeactivity (MPO) were determined. In a parallel set of experiments,groups of rats 7 days after OVx were treated with estrogen (280 mg/ kg, sc) or progesterone (200 mg/kg, sc) 4 h before each FA inhala- tion; after this the rats were sensitized and challenge with OVA. After24 h the BAL and MPO were evaluated.Results: OVx in FA/OVA group did not alter the total cells and the MPO activity in BAL when compared to Sham-OVx group, but in theOVA/OVA group there were reductions of both total cells andMPO activity. The treatment with estrogen or progesterone increasedthe neutrophils and eosinophils in BAL whereas reduced the MPO activity of FA/OVA OVx group when compared to the untreated group. Treatment with estrogen, but not with progesterone increasedthe neutrophils and eosinophils in BAL of OVA/OVA OVx group when compared to the untreated group. Conclusion: Our data are indicative that estrogen and progesteroneare positive modulators in an animal model lunginflammation. (2008/58108-3). Disclosure of interest: None declared.

P-178 IMPLICATION OF SYK KINASE IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NEUROKININ-1RECEPTOR (NK1R) AND FC eRI FOR THE REGULATION OF Welman1, K. Jizi1, K. Maghni1,* 1Reseach center/Pneumology, Sacre-Coeur Hospital, Montreal, Canada A more targeted therapy to control allergy symptoms requires a better understanding of its molecular mechanisms. The RBL-2H3 basophiliccell line (RBL) is the reference model for the study of Fc eRI, the high-afnity receptor for IgE. We have recently shown that (1) RBL cells express the substance P (SP) and its receptor, NK1R, (2) bindingof IgE to Fc eRI increases the expression of NK1R and (3) aggregation of IgE-Fc eRI complex induces autocrine activation of the NK1R, which in turn amplies the response of Fc eRI (e.g. degranulation). However, molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction betweenthe tachykinergic system SP/NK1R and Fc eRI remains unknown. Hypothesis: Syk, a proximal element of the Fc eRI signaling pathway, is involved in IgE binding-increased NK1R expression, and theautocrine activation of loopresponsible of Fc eRI-induced basophil activation. Objective: To demonstrate the role of Syk in the molecular processes described.Methodology: A stable cell line RBL expressing the NK1R conju-gated to the fluorescent protein eGFP (NK1R-eGFP) was established. The expression of the NK1R-eGFP after incubation with IgE, in the presence or absence of a specic Syk inhibitor (BAY61-3606,250 nM) was measured by of internaliza-tion of NK1R-eGFP after IgE-Fc aggregation was determined by confocal Results: Cytometric analyses indicated that the increased expressionof NK1R resulting from the binding of IgE to Fc eRI is reduced when Syk activity is inhibited. Moreover, confocal microscopic analyses showed that the internalization of NK1R-eGFP in response to IgE-FceRI complex clustering is Syk dependent. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a novel role for Syk as a regu- lator of the interaction between the tachykinergic system SP/NK1R and Fc eRI to control both the expression of NK1R and an autocrine pathway responsible of the amplication of basophil-mediated aller-gic responses.

Cliniques Du Sud-Luxembourg, Arlon, Belgium Introduction: We report a case drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) following phenytoin treatment. Symptoms wors-ened after stopping phenytoin. Treatment with ganciclovir andcorticosteroid permitted a rapid improvement without relapse. Case-report: A 46-year-old alcoholic man with hypovitaminosis D presented with fever, confusion and epilepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)was consistent with meningitis antibiotics and phenytoin were administrated. After 3 weeks, he developed new fever (40 /C176C) with hypereosinophilia, hepatitis, lym- phadenopathy and a CD8 T lymphocytosis. New bacterial sepsiswas excluded. Diagnosis of phenytoin-associated DIHS was made. Four days after stopping phenytoin and starting methylprednisolone, a generalized rash developed. Skin biopsies showed CD8 T cellsinflammation. Serologic testing for hepatitis B, C, AIDS, CMV, EBV,HHV6 and autoimmune antibodies showed IgG antibodies for EBV and HHV6. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) did not detect EBV, CMV or HHV6 in peripheral blood, but was positive for HHV6 in bronchiallavage. The reactivation treatment with ganciclovir was added to the corticotherapy. This combination permitted a rapid resolution of DIHS without relapse.Discussion: DIHS involves cross-reactive lymphocytes, temperature, hypereosino- philia, rash, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis. DIHS is a drug reactionbut the viral component has to be taken into account, especially inimmunodepression like here (alcoholism, meningitis necessitating dexamethasone, hypovitaminosis D). In our patient, the association of corticosteroids and ganciclovir may have shortened the course ofDIHS, without relapse or subsequent reactivation of CMV which canbe seen later. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance to consider DIHS and its treatment with antiviral drugs.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-180 CLINICAL AND Ohara1 1Section of Allergy and Rheumatology, St. Lukes International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Rationale. Differential diagnosis of eosinophilia is broad, including allergic, rheumatological, infectious and neoplastic diseases. Absolute count ofperipheral eosinophil count, age and gender of the patients might behelpful in the process of reaching the origin. Methods: We extracted all the 8,639 patients with peripheral eosino- philia from our electronic medical record from 2003 to 2008, andconrmed maximum eosinophil count and highest Eo. rate individually.Then we reviewed the patients' medical record to analyze the nal diagnosis and divided into three groups based on count of peripheral eosinophil i.e. 500-1,499/mm 3, 1,500-2,999/mm3and over 3,000/ mm3. We grouped into diagnosed cases and undiagnosed cases, and divided secondary eosinophilia cases into 14 types of diseases. Results: The majority of patients with high eosinophil count revealedhigh eosinophil rate. Cases that improved after transient eosinophiliawithout any intervention were higher in 500-1,499 group. About a thirdof patients with eosinophilia was diagnosed as having allergic diseases. Some specic diseases (i.e. episodic angioedema with eosinophilia,DRSS and Churg-Strauss syndrome) displayed distinctive patterns that may be useful for correct diagnosis. Very high eosinophil count over 3,000/mm 3or over 5,000/mm3was more common in female, children with age of less than 10, and over 80.Conclusions: Understanding epidemiology of eosinophilia is helpful to diagnose clinically important etiologies such as allergic diseases.

Benett1, D. Campos1, S. A. Gurgueira2, A. E. Vercesi2, S. A. Teixeira3, S. K. Costa3, M. N. Muscara3 1Laboratory of Inflammation Paulo, SP, Brazil Recent studies have shown that endogenous hydrogen sulde (H 2S) may have an anti-inflammatory role in the pathogenesis of airwayinflammation. Weinvestigated the H 2S inltra- tion, antioxidant enzyme activities and protein nitrotyrosine (NT) residues in the airways of allergic mice at 24-96 h after ovalbumin(OVA) challenge. Results demonstrate that the peak of eosinophilinltration into the lungs of OVA-sensitised control (non-treated) mice, seen at 48 h after antigen challenge, was signicantly reduced by treatment of allergic mice with the H 2S donor, sodium hydrosulde (NaHS; 14 lmol/kg, i.p.). Treatment with NaHS also resulted a signicant reduction of neutrophils in the bronchoalvelar lavage (BAL) at 24 and 48 h. A signicant increase in NT residues was seen in control at 48 and 96 h after OVA-challenge, but no modications were inducedby NaHS. Superoxide dismutase activity was signicantly increased in the lungs of control until 96 h after OVA challenge, whereas a decrease in their activity was produced by NaHS at 24 h. In addition, NaHS alsoprevented the augmentation in catalase activity at 48 h, as seen incontrol. Although no modications were shown by the control, NaHS treatment signicantly decreased glutathione peroxidase activity in the lungs at 48 h after OVA challenge. These results suggest that admin-istration of H 2S-donor to mice signicantly attenuated OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation. H 2S may act as an antioxidant agent in the lungs of allergic mice by decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. On the other hand, the benecial effect of H 2S on eosinophil and/or neutrophil migration to the lungs of mice during the allergicresponse is independent on oxidative protein modications.

Objective: To investigate the role of cytokines/chemokines in the development of the allergic lung inflammation in leptin-decient mice(ob/ob). Materials and methods: C57Bl/6 and ob/ob mice were immunized with ovalbumin/alumen on days 0 and 7 and challenged with oval-bumin (OVA) aerosol on days 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22. After 24 h of thelast antigen challenge, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was per- formed, blood was collected and lungs were harvested for analyses. Results: Signicantly fewer cells were recovered from OVA-chal-lenged ob/ob versus mucus challenged C57BL/6 (83 and 28%, respectively). OVA-challenged ob/ob, the decreased reduced IL-13 (63%)and TGF- b(66%) in lung tissue.

C. Calixto1,*, L. Lintomen1, G. F. H. 1Farmacology, University Of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil Eosinophils (EOS) in bone marrow are derived from myeloid pre- cursors in response to cytokine activation. Following antigen challenge, EOS are released into the circulation and recruited to tis-sues. Recently, we showed that a 10-week diet-induced obesity inmice stimulates eosinophilopoesis and enhances EOS trafcking from BM to lung tissues (Calixto et al. in Br J Pharmacol 159:617-625, 2010). The present study aimed to investigate the expression ofadhesion molecules and chemokine receptor, as well as the influence of cytokines on bone marrow eosinophilopoesis of obese mice. In obese mice, ovalbumin (OVA) challenge largely increased the bonemarrow EOS counts at 48 h post-challenge (2.2 \u00b10.4910 6/ml; P\\0.05) compared with lean group (0.6 \u00b10.29106/ml). Expres- sion of VLA-4 in bone marrow EOS from obese mice was signicantly lower (P \\0.05) compared with lean animals, as assessed by flow cytometry assays. In addition, the adhesion of bonemarrow EOS to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1-coated plates in vitro wassignicantly lower in obese compared with lean mice. The levels of eotaxin in bone marrow supernatant did not differ between obese andlean groups. No differences in the CCR-3 expression in bone marrow EOS surface were observed. Treatment of obese mice with antibodies anti-IL-5 (2 mg/kg) and anti-TNF- a(2 mg/kg) normalized the num- ber of immature and mature form of bone marrow EOS, as comparedwith lean mice treated with these antibodies. In conclusion, the increased bone marrow EOS in OVA-challenged obese mice is likely to reflect a down-regulation of VLA-4 in EOS surface, and hence adecreased interaction with the ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Thebone marrow EOS differentiation in obese mice may involve TNF- a and IL-5 production, with no involvement for eotaxin or its receptor CCR-3 (experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Com-mittee of UNICAMP; No. 1496-1).Financial support: Fapesp.

Cockroach allergen extract (CE) is known to contain and we nd that sensitization to cockroach allergens in mice is dependent on the activation of PAR 2in the airway by CE serine proteinases. Our aim was to identify, isolate allergens in the cockroach and puried using ion-exchange chromatography. Each isolated enzyme was distinguished by (a) its Km for different fluorogenic peptides, and(b) its relative K ifor inhibition by different trypsin inhibitors. Additionally, each enzyme was tested for (1) activating PAR 2- dependent calcium signaling in PAR 2-expressing rat KNRK cells and (2) cleaving synthetic peptides representing the tethered ligand (TL)sequences of PARs 1, 2 and 4. Results: contained *25 units/mg protein K mand inhibitor K ivalues for different substrates and inhibitors. The enzymes activated PAR 2in a calcium signaling assay and cleaved PAR-derived TL peptides to unmask are able to target PARs 1, 2 and 4.

P-188 EXPRESSION AND FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF THE PURINERGIC RECEPTOR P2Y12 IN HUMAN EOSINOPHILS V. S. Muniz1, G. Thompson1, C. Barbosa-Pereira1, B. Patrasso-Salgado1, J. S. Neves1,* 1Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University Of Rio De Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Identication of new target molecules through which eosinophils activate and secrete their stored proteins may be highly signicant for our understanding about the pathobiology of host immune responses toparasites and allergic inflammation, as well as reveal new therapeutictargets for the control of the eosinophilic disorders. We have recently reported the expression of the purinergic P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) in human eosinophils (Neves et al. in JACI, 2010), however its contri-butions to eosinophilic inflammation remains to be elucidated. TheP2Y12R was recently described as crucial in mediating the proin- flammatory actions of the leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and appointed as a new therapeutic target for pulmonary allergic diseases (Paruchuri et al.in JEM, 2010). A better understanding of the components of the immuneresponse that mediate response to helminthes and allergens is still needed. In this work we evaluated the expression and functional roles of the purinergic P2Y12R in isolated human eosinophils. We isolatedeosinophils from blood of normal and allergic donors by negative selection. By flow cytometry we conrmed the expression of the P2Y12R on isolated human eosinophils.

Henriques1 1Aplied Farmacology, Farmanguinhos,2Immunology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It is well established the involvement of T cells subsets in the path- ogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Schinus Terebinthifolius Raddi is a native plant from America widely used in folk medicine.We previously described the anti-allergic effect of acetate fraction obtained from their leaves in mouse pleurisy model inhibiting eosinophil influx. In this study we aimed to determinate the effect ofAnacardiaceae fraction (ST fraction) in lymphocyte influx to thepleural cavity, its action in subcutaneous lymph nodes cells and in cytokines modulation. Intrathoracic OVA challenge (12.5 mg/cavity) triggered a CD3 +CD4+and CD3+CD8+T cells accumulation at 24 h, concomitant with an increase of CD3+CD25+and CD3+CD4+CD25+ cells as well as of CD3+CD4+CD44+cells into pleural cavity of sensitized mice. Oral pre-treatment (ST fraction, 100 signif-icantly inhibited the increase of CD3 +CD4+and CD3+CD8+T lymphocyte and the expression of CD44. The treatment failed to inhibit the expression of CD25 but was able to attenuate these cell numbers. The IL-2 and IL-4 production by T cells from subcutaneouslymph nodes was inhibited after in vitro treatment of ST fraction(100lg/mL) or phenolic acid (1-100 lg/mL). We can suggest that the diminished eosinophils observed previously, seems to be also directly related to the lower number and activation of lymphocytesreaching the inflammation site suggesting an anti allergic and an immunoregulatory effect to Anacardiaceae fraction, observed after the mouse antigen challenge.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-190 THE ROLE OF CD11D INTEGRIN IN EOSINOPHILIC INFLAMMATION D. O. Nascimento1,*, A. Zimmerman2, 1Laboratory Immunopharmacology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,2Program in Human Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City-Utah,United StatesThe prevalence of asthma worldwide is increasing for reasons that are unclear. Eosinophilic inflammation is a characteristic feature of asthma.Members of leukocyte integrin family (CD18) are present in eosino- phils and are involved in allergic response. The CD11d integrin is expressed on most human leukocytes, including eosinophils. The sur-face expression of CD11d in eosinophils can be regulated by variousstimuli and can function as ligand for VCAM-1. However the role of CD11d in asthma and in other allergic diseases is largely undened. In this study, we analyzed the role of CD11d in in vivo models of eosin-ophilic inflammation. In this study, CD11d knockout mice (KO) andwild type (WT) mice were injection of ovalbumin (OVA) and Al(OH) 3in saline on days 1 and 10. From days 19-24 after sensitization, mice were challenged daily with either OVA(5%) or PBS by aerosol. Six hour after the last aerolization, we observedthat KO mice shown lower inltration of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and less intense pulmonary inflammatory process than WT mice, after allergen challenge. Moreover, the airway responsive-ness (AHR) analyses in a plethysmography suggest a decrease in AHR in KO mice. The measured of IL-5 in BAL was increased in KO than WT mice. Nevertheless, there was no increase in the number ofeosinophils of allergic bone marrow KO mice. Intravital microscopyanalyses of the mesentery showed that allergic KO mice have less leukocyte rolling and adhesion compared with allergic WT mice. Moreover, our results showed problems in the migratory ability ofgranulocytes from KO mice toward chemotactic factor eotaxin, in atranswell system. Our results suggest the important role of CD11d integrin on migration process, airway responsiveness and in control of inflammatory mediators in vivo during allergic inflammatory responsein a mice model. This date provide new insights about the new candidate of anti-allergic therapies. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-191 Wageningen, Netherlands,3Nephrology and clinical immunology department, CHRU Tours,4Pharmacy department, University of Tours, Tours, France Several bowel diseases, such as colitis and Crohn's disease, affect the equilibrium of intestine tissue by promoting a high inflammatory con- text. The control of the inflammation by immune cells in the gut iscrucial in the prevention of these disorders. In particular, dendritic cells(DC) play a key role both in innate and in adaptative immunity. Depending on the state of maturation and on cytokine secretion, DC can induce either specic immune response or immune tolerance. During thematuration process, for example, in the presence of zymosan (TLR2 agonist), LPS (TLR4 agonist) or fermented product, DC change their morphology and the expression pattern of their maturation markers.Here, we investigated the effect of a bacteria-free supernatant fermentedbyBidobacterium breve C 50 (BbC50sn) on the maturation markers of human DC (hDC). BbC50sn was able to mature hDC after 48 h of stimulation by inducing the expression of the same prole of maturationmarkers such as CD25 and CD83 compared to other maturation pathway activated by BbC50sn was shown to be through at least Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2). Nevertheless hDC stimulated byBbC50sn demonstrated a specic kinetics of maturation markers expression compared to hDC stimulated by other TLR2 agonist such as zymosan. The precise mechanism of the anti-inflammatory pathwayinduced by TLR2 engagement by BbC50sn remains currently unknown.One possibility could be that TLR2 pathway could modulate innate immunity receptors. These data show that BbC50sn was able to induce the maturation of DC and to skew towards a pro-tolerogenic prole byinducing IL10 TLR2. The BbC50sn could have anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects in the gut environment and might therefore protect against inflammatory bowel disease.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Infection, sepsis and inflammation P-192 HEART RATE DYNAMICS DURING SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION M. Gholami1, P. University,2Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Program, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Republic Of Islamic Under healthy condition cardiac rhythm exhibits a complex dynamic which is due to a non-linear interplay between autonomic nervous system and cardiac pacemaker cells. Systemic inflammation is asso-ciated with decreased heart rate variability which is a strong predictorof survival in patients with sepsis. However, underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood. We hypothesized that cardiac pacemaker cells may act as a target for inflammatory cytokinesleading to alteration in heart rate dynamics during systemic inflam- mation. Systemic inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin (1 mg/kg) in rats. Cardiovascular signals wererecorded in conscious animals using telemetric system. Spontane-ously beating atria were isolated and beat-to-beat variation in isolated atria was studied using an organ bath system. Sample entropy was calculated to assess the degree of cardiac cycle regularity. Short-termfractal scaling component of the cardiac cycle were calculated byusing detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Endotoxemia was asso- ciated with a biphasic increase in heart rate in conscious rats. A signicant increase in cardiac cycle regularity was also observed inendotoxemic animals starting 3 h after endotoxin administration. Beat-to-beat variation of isolated spontaneously beating atria exhib- ited a scale invariant (fractal-like) dynamics in rats. However, short-term fractal scaling component incontrol atria was compatible with white noise ( a 1=0.53 \u00b10.07) which was signicantly altered to a1=0.19 \u00b10.02, p \\0.05) in endotoxemic atria. These data propose that altered cardiac cycle dynamics during sys-temic inflammation does not necessarily reflect the altered input from the autonomic nervous system, but rather a remodeling of the cardiac pacemaker dynamics by inflammatory mediators.Disclosure of interest: None declared.P-193 ENDOTOXEMIA IMPAIRS CHRONOTROPIC RESPONSIVENESS TO CHOLINERGIC STIMULATION AND DECREASES HEART RATEVARIABILITY IN CONSCIOUS RATS M. Gholami1,*, S. Hajizadeh1, Research Program, Tehran University of MedicalSciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic Of Cardiac cycle is regulated by a complex interplay between autonomic nervous system and cardiac pacemaker cells. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and increased cardiac rhythm regularity is associ- ated with poor prognosis in patients with sepsis. However, theunderlying mechanism of decreased HRV in sepsis is unknown. Incomplex systems, uncoupling of the regulatory centers is known to be related to greater regularity and less variability. The present study was aimed to test the hypothesis that impaired responsiveness of cardiacpacemaker to autonomic nervous system may lead to uncoupling ofthe cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms during systemic inflam- mation. Systemic inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin (1 mg/kg) in rats. Cardiovascular signals wererecorded in conscious animals using telemetric system. Heart rate dynamics was analysis using Poincare \u00b4plot. Spontaneously beating atria were isolated and chronotropic responsiveness to adrenergic andcholinergic stimulation was assessed using standard organ bath. Vagalmodulation of cardiac cycle (as assessed by SD1 in Poincare \u00b4analysis of HRV) exhibited a signicant reduction in endotoxemic rats. Endotoxemia was also associated with a signicant hypo-respon-siveness of isolated atria to cholinergic stimulation (IC50 5.8 \u00b10.3910 in in endotoxemic rats, P \\0.05). The chrono- tropic responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation was identical incontrols in comparison with endotoxemic rats. These data proposethat altered cardiac responsiveness to cholinergic stimulation may lead to uncoupling of cardiac pacemaker cells from autonomic neural control. This may explain decreased HRV during systemicinflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-194 TOXICITY STUDY OF ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ARISTOLOCHIC ACID IN WISTAR RATS P.

Male Wistar rats (200-210 g) were randomly divided into three groups in which the rats were intragastricallyadministered water or 100 mg/kg AA, and another group was intra-venously administered 100 mg/kg AA. Serum urea and creatinine were measured before and 7, 14 and 21 days after a single treatment. There was no signicant difference in serum urea and creatininebetween groups either at baseline, 14 or 21 days after the treatment. Agreat rise in serum urea and creatinine was observed at day 7 after the treatment. In addition, the intravenous AA signicantly increased lipopolysaccharide induced-liver damage measured with serum ala-nine transaminase (ALT) on day 22 after the treatment. These resultshighlight that (i) the intravenous aristolochic acid signicantly caused nephrotoxicity and precipitated liver damage induced by lipopoly- saccharide, and that (ii) these effects were not observed in ratsreceived AA through intragastric gavage.

Soriano1 1Medical School, University of Sa o Paulo,2Laboratory of Pathophysiology, Butantan Institute, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Sepsis induces a systemic inflammatory response leading to tissue damage and cell death. LPS tolerance changes inflammatory response and many studies have shown that tolerant mice have higher survival rates after a LPS challenge. To study potentially new mechanisms ofimmune regulation in endotoxemia, we examined macrophage func-tion in experimental tolerance. LPS tolerance was induced in Balb/C mice exposed to 1 mg/kg of LPS/day during 5 days. The injections were subcutaneous to avoid direct effect on peritoneal cells. Na \u00a8ve mice received distilled water. Peritoneal macrophages were iso-lated and we observed that LPS treated mice presented a larger number of peritoneal macrophages (1.6 \u00b10.4910 6vs. 3.7 C3b- or manose-receptor mediated phagocytosis evaluation. We found a reduction in the phagocytosis by Fc (41% in control vs 23%in tolerant group) and manose receptors (23% in control vs 16% intolerant group). On the other hand, ROS production was increased in macrophages from tolerant mice, both in basal (0.1 \u00b10.08 vs. 1.3\u00b10.6lMH 2O2) and after PMA stimulation (0.25 \u00b10.07 vs. 5.9\u00b11.5lMH 2O2). These differences can be due to a macrophage (reprogramming) activation as demonstrated by the expression of CD80 and CD86. We observed an increase of CD80 and decrease of CD86 expression in tolerant mice of 9 and 7%, respectively. Thesedata suggest that although phagocytic activity of macrophages is suppressed in tolerant mice, bacterial clearance may be more effective due to increased ROS production and antigen presentation to otherleukocytes.Financial support: FAPESP.

Weber1 Medicine and Biotechnology, Danube University Krems, Krems, Austria Introduction: A cell culture model to monitor endothelial activation in the early phase of Gram-negative sepsis has been established and used to test the effect of mediator modulation with various adsorbentpolymers for extracorporeal blood purication. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were activated with a conditioned med- ium (CM) which was obtained by a 4 h-stimulation of monocyticTHP-1 cells with 10 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pseu- domonas aeruginosa in a medium containing 10% human plasma. The aim of this work was to determine possible differences of THP-1 cells, PBMC, or monocyte activation and resulting differences inHUVEC stimulation.Methods: Density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque yielded PBMC and further negative selection with the MyPure Monocyte Isolation Kits (Dynal, Invitrogen) resulted in 95% pure an overnight resting period, THP-1 cells, PBMC, or monocytes were stimulated with LPS for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h (1 910 6cells/ml) and the CM were applied to HUVEC for 16 h. Protein secretion oftumour necrosis factor a(TNF- a), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 PBMC, and monocytes; however, THP-1 cells did not secreteIL-6 and IL-10. After stimulation of the HUVEC with the various CMfor 16 h, it was seen that concentrations of TNF- adecreased, IL-10 remained stable, and IL-6 increased. Only the IL-8 secretion from HUVEC was different for conditioned media obtained from THP-1cells, PBMC, or monocytes. CM from THP-1 cells lead to ofIL-8 from HUVEC, while CM from PBMC or monocytes resulted in a decrease of IL-8 concentrations after 16 h of HUVEC stimulation. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that expression of cytokines isdifferent for LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, PBMC, and monocytes, which also influences the subsequent activation of endothelial cells.

Res. 123determination of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern for management of antimicrobial therapy.Objectives: The aim of present study was to investigate the type of bacteria isolated from blood cultures and determination of their antibiotic susceptibility pattern.Methods: During 18 months, 2,790 blood culture samples werescreened. The positive blood cultures were examined and the organ- isms were identied as per standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all isolates by use of diskdiffusion technique, according to CLSI guidelines.Results: From total blood culture samples, 155 (5.6%) were positive. The most common isolated gram negative bacilli were Klebsiella pneumoniae 52 (33.5%), Eschericia (9.7%) coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) as pre-dominant gram positive cocci, all the isolated bacteria showed the highest degree of resistance to ampicillin (98.7%), cefalexin (70.3%) and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole also fully resistant to penicillin. Conclusion: Present study revealed that both gram positive and gram negative bacteria were responsible for bloodstream infections andmost of the strains were multi-drug resistant. The most commonisolated bacteria from blood cultures were Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli . Ciproflexacine was the most effective antibiotic against gram negative bacilli, while vancomysin was mostly effective against grampositive cocci.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-199 TNF-ALPHA INCREASES CILIA-DRIVEN TRANSPORT IN THE MOUSE TRACHEA prevents via its highly effective clearance functions the contamination of the lower airways by pathogens. These specialist epithelium cells are not only in contact with the gas phase, in addition they can also be influenced byinflammatory mediators carried in the blood stream. These mediators alter the protective function of the cilia epithelium (Jain et al. 1995). Since TNF- aplays a key role within the inflammatory cascade, we investigated its effect onto the cilia-driven particle transport (CPT).Material and methods: Adult male mice (15 weeks old) were sacriced by an overdose isoflurane, subsequently the trachea was rapidly removed under sterile conditions and transferred into an incubation chamber of anOlympus upright brighteld microscope. CPT and cilia-beat-frequency(CF) were continuously recorded over a period of 130 min as described previously (Ko \u00a8nig et al. 2009) while exposed to different doses of TNF- a. RT-PCR was implemented to demonstrate TNF- a-receptor expression in tracheal epithelium.Results: RT-PCR experiments provided evidence of the constitutive expression of TNF- a-receptor type 1. Exposure to TNF- ainduced a concentration dependent increase of CF and CPT that occurredapproximately with a latency of 45 min. CPT and CF were signi- cantly higher after 51 min of incubation when compared to control (p\\0.05 for 360 ng, p \\0.001 for 1,000 ng, p [0.05 for 100 ng). The increase of CF showed a strong correlation with the velocity ofCPT (r =0.86). Conclusion: Exposure to TNF- ainduces an increase in CPT and CF within 45 min, hence it improves the cilia clearance function of thetrachea. This may prevent further contamination of the lower airways and may also contribute to reduced inflammation periods. Futurestudies will investigate the cellular mechanisms of the observed TNF- aresponse. References Jain B, et al. Am J Phys. 1995;268:911-917. Ko\u00a8nig P, et al. PLoS declared. NF- JB ACTIVATION S.

Clinical studies have shown that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) inhibit the pro-gression of atherosclerosis. Recent studies have attributed additionalanti-oxidative characteristics to the anti-hypertensive drug lercanidi- pine, a third generation CCB. An anti-inflammatory effect of lercanidipine has, however, yet to be established and therefore wecarried out a series of in vitro studies to investigate anti-inflammatoryeffect and possible mechanism of action of lercanidipine in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) induced by interferon- c(LPS/IFN- c). Pretreatment with lercanidipine (1 or 10lM) suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) and interleukin-1 b(IL-1b) caused by LPS/INF- on nitrite and To investigate the mechanismof the action of lercanidipine, the extent of NF- jB activation will be monitored Lercanidipine concentration-dependently and the phosphorylation of inhibitory jBa (IjBa), resulting enhanced nuclear translocation of p65 protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that lercanidipine suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38. imply that the inhibition of NF- jB may be involved in the modulation of vascular inflammation response by lercanidipine.

P-201 INHIBITORY ACTIVITY OF ASPIRIN AND DICLOFENAC CANDIDA Dental Medicine, Titu Maiorescu University,2Faculty of Biology, Bucharest University, Bucharest, Romania Candida albicans is an opportunistic dimorphic fungus that exists as a commensally and colonizes mucosal surfaces of the oral and vaginalcavities and the digestive tract. It is the most common pathogen ofhuman fungal infection and can cause both supercial and serious systemic disease. The prophylactic and curative treatments with antifungal drugs can cause the appearance of Candida resistant- strains. The aim of our study was to evaluate the antifungal activity oftwo anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and diclofenac sodium, and investigate the effect of combination of these drugs with ketocona- zole. Two strains were isolated from pharyngeal secretions. Strainswere biochemical and albicans ATTC 10231 as reference strain. Viability cells tests were done in the presence of 2 mg/ml aspirin and diclofenac sodium and0.32lg/ml ketoconazole. Results showed that aspirin alone and aspirin-ketoconazole combination have the same effect on C . albicans strains and cell viability decrease with 70-74%. Unlike aspirin,diclofenac sodium-ketoconazole combination induced higher than diclofenac sodium alone (40-73% inhibition). The effect of aspirin and diclofenac was similar with activity of ketoconazole at MIC breakpoint. Antifungalactivity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was strain depending. According to our results aspirin and diclofenac sodium alone or incombination with ketoconazole have a remarkable antifungal activityagainst Candida albicans strains. Association of anti-inflammatory drugs with antifungal compounds could be more efcient for treat- ment of candidiasis.Keywords: Candida, aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs.Acknowledgments: This work has been supported by the national research project CNCSIS Human Resources TE66/2010.

Li2,3and Feng Liu, Xiaohua Wu, Yan 1Department of Anesthesiology, Daping Hospital,2Research Institute of Surgery,3State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and combined injury of China, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China Many documents suggested that the synergic effect of MD-2 to LPS stimulating on TLR4 might be critical step during LPS-TLR4 response signaling pathway. MD-2 has been considered as one of the most important and potential targets to interfere the activation ofexcessive inflammation caused by LPS. Varied efforts are being made to disable MD-2. In this research, we combined bioinformatics and the technique of phage peptide display to try to obtain peptides thatwould antagonize against MD-2. Based on our bioinformatics anal-ysis of MD-2 protein, NH2-FSKGKYKCV-COOH (K128-132) might be the key sequence for MD-2 binding LPS, thus random phage display peptide library Ph.D.-C7C was used for selecting antagonisticpeptide against the sequence. After three round selections, threepositive clones binding to the sequence were picked out. Further results showed that all three peptides can bind directly to the MD-2protein identied by Sulfo-SBED biotin Label transfer. In addition, all three peptides can inhibit the productions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in U937, THP-1 macrophage cell lines and health human peripheralblood monocytes stimulated by LPS in dose dependent manner.Furthermore, BALB/C mouse challenged by LPS (O111:B4) were used to estimated the protection of these peptides from sepsis, but only two of the peptides can reduce mortality of the infected micefrom 100 to 55.6% (5/9), and 54.5% (6/11), ofTNF-alpha and IL-6 in serum and homogenized lung were profound reduced in peptides treated group, moreover the pathological exam- ination showed that the pulmonary inflammatory responses werealleviated in peptides treated group. These studies demonstrated thatinterference focused at binding site between MD-2 and LPS might be one potential therapeutic strategy for LPS induced sepsis, and the two peptides might be considerable agents against sepsis.Disclosure of interest: H.

Faculty Of Pharmacy, Mersin, Turkey,2Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, The University of Tennessee, Center for Health Sciences, Memphis,United States NO produced by iNOS is responsible for endotoxin-induced vascular hyporeactivity and hypotension resulting in multiple organ failure.Endotoxic shock is also characterized by decreased expression of COX-1, CYP4A, and eNOS. Our previous studies demonstrated that dual inhibition of iNOS and COX with a nonselective inhibitorindomethacin restores blood pressure presumably due to increasedproduction of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) derived from arachidonic acid by CYP4A in endotoxemic rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a selective COX-1 inhibitor,piroxicam, on the endotoxin-induced changes in CYP4A1, of 2, PGE 2, 20-HETE, and NO. Injection of endotoxin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to male Wistar rats caused a fall in bloodpressure and an increase in heart rate associated with elevated renal 6-keto-PGF 1aand PGE 2levels as well as an increase in COX-2 protein expression. Endotoxin also caused an elevation in systemicand renal nitrite levels associated with increased renal iNOS proteinexpression. In contrast, systemic and renal 20-HETE levels and renal expression of eNOS, COX-1, and CYP4A1 were decreased in endo- toxemic rats. The effects of endotoxin, except for renal COX-1 andeNOS protein expression, were prevented by piroxicam (10 mg/kg,i.p.), given 1 h after injection of endotoxin. Endotoxin did not change renal hsp90 protein expression. These data suggest that a decrease inS150 Inflamm.

Olszewski1,3 1Department of Surgical Research & Transplantology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy Of Sciences,2Department of Microbiology, Medical University,3Department of Transplantation Surgery, Central Clinical Hospital, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Warsaw, Poland The purpose of present study was: (1) to evaluate frequency of virulence genes among Staphylococcus aureus (eta,fnbA, cna ,etd, strains yielded from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients; (2) to compare gene frequency among strains originating from patients with neuro- pathic (NFU) versus ischemic (IFU) foot ulcers and among MRSA vs.MSSA strains; (3) to assess distribution of multi-virulence gene pre-senting isolates among S. aureus strains. Gene analysis showed that eta was more often associated with MRSA than MSSA isolates from NFU and with MSSA than MRSA strains from IFU patients (p \\0.05). The presence of eta, fnbA andedin genes was more often seen in S. aureus strains yielded from ulcer tissue compared to toe web swabs of DFU patients and in strains yielded from ulcer curettage of NFU vs. IFU patients (p \\0.05). S. aureus isolates originating from NFU were fre- quently characterized by simultaneous presence of 4-5 studied virulence genes. S. epidermidis. IS256insertion factor was signicantly more often associated with MRSE than MSSE isolates and its frequencywas higher in isolates yielded from ulcer tissue than toe web of DFUpatients. It suggests that detection of eta,fnbA andedin genes can be useful to discriminate between invasive and skin colonizing S. aureus strains and that IS 256insertion element might be a molecular marker of S. epidermidis invasiveness in DFU patients.

Indeed, we previously showed that MyD88, a key downstream adapter for most the TLRs, was involved the pathogenesis. We spe-cically focus on the TLRs 4 and 5, as these two receptors are themain ones involved in the recognition of P. aeruginosa , a flagellated Gram- bacterium like B. cenocepacia. for TLR4, TLR5 or both were infected intratracheally with a suspension of B. ceno- cepacia . Animals were then observed daily for signs of morbidity. Alternatively, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected at dif- ferent time points to further determine cytokine concentrations and the number of CFU of B. cenocepacia. We observed that the innate immune response of the host to B. cenocepacia lung infection was due to TLR4 and not to TLR5. As for the MyD88 -/-strain, TLR4-/- mice were protected from death and cytokine and chemokine syn- thesis to infection were reduced. By contrast, we observed a reducedpathogen burden in the case of TLR4 -/-mice compared to the enhanced (but transient) pathogen burden observed with MyD88-/- mice, suggesting that another TLR was involved in bacterial clear- ance. The data clearly demonstrate a deleterious implication of TLR4in the host to B. cenocepacia lung infection. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Materials and methods: Skin, subcutaneous fat, muscle and fracture gap callus were obtained from 155 adult patients operated on due toclosed comminuted fractures of tibia or femur, 75 because of non- alignment of bone axis and 80 due to delayed fracture healing. Results: Aerobic bacteria were isolated from gap callus of 12%healing and 31% non-healing fractures. In subcutaneous tissue andmuscles isolates were found only sporadically. No anaerobic bacteria were detected. PCR amplications of 16 s rRNA were found positive in 40% of callus specimens proving presence of bacterial DNA evenwhen no isolates were found. The 95% similarity of the geneticpattern of some strains from foot skin and callus, estimated with RAPD technique, suggested their foot skin origin. Conclusions: The colonizing bacterial cells and their DNA were detected in fracture callus but not other deep tissues. Contamination was precluded by lack of isolates in disinfected cutis, subcutis, muscles and materials used for sampling cultured after surgery.

The aim of our study was to compare characteristics of S. aureus strains isolated from patients with ischemic (IFU) and neuropathic (NFU) diabetic foot ulcers. Methods: Study was done on 36 S. aureus isolates obtained from ulcer base curettage (UC) and skin biopsy (SB) of patients divided into IFUand NFU group. For detection of fnbA and cna genes (encoding binding proteins for bronectin and collagen) bacterial DNA was extracted and PCR with specic primers was done. For detection of gene expression bacterial RNA was extracted and mRNA productionwas estimated in RT-PCR. Ability of biolm formation was deter-mined using Congo red agar (CRA) method and for production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) the staining with antiserum was used. For testing of in vitro enzyme production Difco spirit blueagar with activity was detected using 3% gelatin medium. Results: The prevalence rate of fnbA gene and its expression were more often associated with strains originating from UC and SB of NFU thanIFU. Expression of cnagene was higher in strains originating from NFU than IFU. The frequency of strains producing biolm was higher among isolates originating from NFU than IFU when tested by CRA method.Activities of gelatinase, DNase and lipase were found in higher rate ofstrains yielded from UC of IFU than NFU. Conclusions: It can be suggested that the high rate of PIA producing strains with hydrolytic enzyme activity present in IFU can beresponsible for the worse outcome of this type of ulcers in contrast toNFU.

Busemann1, University Greifswald, GermanyBackground: Post-operatively acquired immune dysfunction is associ- ated with a higher mortality rate in case of septic complications. Asdetails of this severe clinical problem are still unknown and intervention strategies are lacking, animal models are essential to characterise the mechanisms involved.Materials and methods: Isolated splenocytes were stimulated ex vivowith LPS and the release of cytokines was determined. The degree of surgical trauma was analysed by detection of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and IL-6 in serum.Results: We have adapted the previously described animal model ofintestinal manipulation (IMM) so as to provide a model of surgically induced immune dysfunction (SID). Following intestinal manipulation mice showed elevated serum levels of HMGB1 and IL-6. Ex vivocytokine release by splenocytes was suppressed at early and late timepoints in the post-operative period and the degree of suppression corre- lated with the extent of surgical trauma. Conclusions: In this study we describe a surgically-induced immunedysfunction (SID) animal model in which a signicant surgical trauma is followed by an immune dysfunction syndrome. This model may be qualied for the characterisation of the post-operativeimmune dysfunction syndrome and to analyze its inflammatorycomponents. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-209 GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR DIMERIZATION IN MACROPHAGES SUPPRESS INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES A. Kleyman1, J. P. Tuckermann1, M. Graeler2 1Tissue-specic hormone action, Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Centre Charite \u00b4, Berlin, Germany Endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) have a protective role in septic shock. GCs exert their effects via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that alters gene expression by binding to GC responsible elements(GRE) as a dimer in the promoter region of target genes or byinteracting with and thus interfering with other transcription factors as a monomer. We show that the GR in Macrophages (Mphs) is important for the repressionsystemic inflammation. Mice lacking the GR in myeloid cells (GR LysMCre) are highly susceptible to LPS induced septic shock. Also binding as a dimer to DNA is important for protection fro m septic shock. Mice with impaired GR dimerization (GRdim) display a strong lethality in septic shock models. Mphs from GRdimmice are resistant to suppression of some inflammatory mediators (IL1b, NO). We identied GR dimer controlled genes, possibly essential in inhibition of inflammatio n in a micro array analysis from Mph mRNA isolated from wt and GRdimmice. One of the genes encoded Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1). Sphk1 mRNA and activity of the enzyme was found to be up regulated synergistically in wt Mphs co-treated by InGR dimMphs the up regulation was signicantly attenuated, indicating that GR dimerization was required for this process.

Veranic1 1Institute of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana,2Department Of Rheumatology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,3Pathology Department, Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Universityof Utah, Salt Lake City, United States Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein involved in homeo- stasis of inflammation. SAA is necessary in host defense and hasbenecial properties in protection against viral and bacterial infections. Urothelial infections have been especially difcult to treat since latent intracellular pools of bacteria remain in urothelial cells, also after treat-ment with antibiotics, and cause episodes of recurrent cystitis withoutevident re-infections. To date it has been unclear whether SAA is present in infected urothelium and whether it could be protective against bacterial infections. The major aim of this study was to better understand the role ofSAA in murine infections of the urothelium with E. coli and determine thedifferential expression of SAA isoforms in the urothelium and in the serum (and whether SAA could act in a protective manner). Urothelial SAA protein was detected by immunofluorescence in mouse tissue.SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA expression in urothelium and mice. were detected by ELISA. The biolm inhibition assay was performed using crystal violet to stainadherent/biolm-associated bacteria adhered to plastic. Our experiments revealed that SAA is highly expressed in urothelial cells of E. coli infected mice versus non-infected mice. Especially, there is a highincrease in cytoplasmic SAA during infection as compared to the nuclearSAA in urothelial cells. We also have evidence that following E. coli inoculation into bladders, SAA1 mRNA expression is higher than that of SAA3 in the urothelium. SAA1/2 can act protectively, by inhibitingE. coli biolm formation. In conclusion, urothelial SAA is elevated sig-nicantly following E. coli infecti on. SAA could be a good serological marker for E. coli urothelial infection, where it might also perform bac- tericidal functions.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Hereditary and acquired factors areaccused in the etiology. Existence of large vWF multimers in plasma due to absence of ADAMTS13 is the major factor in the pathogenesis of purpura. ADAMTS13 absence of ADAMTS13 is also shown incertain diseases where there is increased tendency to thrombosis. Dengue is a viral disease with an increasing incidence worldwide. Recently, dengue virus (DV) infections have been associated with a deciencyof ADAMTS13. Thrombocytopenia is also another nding in DV infec-tion. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Aims: In an earlier study, we have d emonstrated signican tly lower levels of ADAM- TS13 and signicantly higher levels of vWF in the plasma of 30 patientswith venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolia vs 30 healthy individuals(p\\0.001). In this study, we aimed to determine the presence of anti- DV IgG in the same patient and healthy control groups, retrospectively. Methods: Thirty plasma samples from patients and 30 plasma samples fromhealthy individuals (totally 60) were par ticipated in this study. Plasma sam- ples were tested by anti-DV IgG ELISA. Results: Anti-DV IgG was detected in 13 of 30 (43%) and 3 of 30(10%) in patient and healthy control groups, respectively ( p=0.006). Conclusions: The presence of anti-DV IgG in 43% of the patients versus 10% of controls imply a possible association with DV infection, de- ciency of ADAMTS13 and the etiology of ( p\\0.05). However, the underlying mechanism should be claried. Roles of TNF- a IL-1band IL-6 in the development disseminated intravascular coag- ulation thus leading to microvascular thrombosis were well characterized.

Kalaci4, Mersin University, Faculty of Pharmacy,3Medical Microbiology, Mersin University, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin,4Orthopedics and Traumatology, Mustafa Kemal University, Hatay, Turkey Pathophysiology of osteoarthritis was associated with the accumula- tion of inflammatory mediators in the joint space. Accumulation of immunoglobulins secondary to chronic inflammation or exposure of antigen in the joint space has been well described. Parvovirus B19(PVB19) is a ubiquitous pathogen normally causes a mild short-livedillness. However, this virus is potentially capable of causing signi- cant pathology and of long-term persistence. Certain inflammatory disorders have been linked to PVB19 infection. Enhanced IL-6 pro-duction in hematopoietic cell lines transfected with NS1 protein ofPVB19, providing evidence that NS1 protein may be involved with transactivation of the IL-6 gene promoter. IL-6 is a ubiquitous and pleomorphic cytokine, multicellular in origin that acts on numerous cellsand tissues. Hence, NS1 protein expression could play a role in the ongoing inflammation and cell damage with persistent PVB19 infections in nonpermissive cells such as synovial membrane cells.Aims: To provide more insight into the possible role of this virus inthe etiology of osteoarthritis.Inflamm. Res. S153 123Methods: Synovial fluid samples from 42 patients with osteoarthritis and 10 healthy control (totally 52) were participated to this study.Anti-PVB19 IgG, anti-PVB19 IgM, IL-6 levels and by ELISA and PCR. Results: PVB19 DNA was detected in 28 of 42 (66.66%) and in 3 of 10(30%) in patients and controls. Anti-PVB19 IgG and IgM response weredetected in 21 of 42 (50.00%) and in 2 of 42 (4.76%) patients. Anti- PVB19 IgG and IgM were also detected in 1 of 10 (10.00%) and in 0 of 10 (0.00%) controls. IL-6 was positive in 15 of 42 (36%) and in 3 of 10(30%) patients and controls. All IgG (+) samples had PVB19 DNA(100%, p\\0.001). 11 of 15 (+) DNA (+) (73.33%, p\\0.05).

Jazani1,*, S. Shahabi1, M. M. Shishavan2, B. Sohrabpour2 Immunology Sciences, Urmia,2Microbiology, Islamic Azad University,Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran, Republic Of Islamic The strategies for treatment of systemic inflammation are based on neutralization of LPS or cytokines induced by it. Heat shock proteins(HSPs) inhibit production of pro- inflammatory cytokines. Carben- oxolone induces the production of HSPs. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the effect of Carbenoxolone in reduction of the severityof systemic inflammation induced by LPS in a murine model. 80%lethal dose of Salmonella typhimurium LPS was determined in balb/C mice, also appropriate dose of drug for efcient reduction in mortality was determined. LPS with drug were injected to different groups, indifferent times. LPSCarb group (injected with LPS + D-GalN and Carbenoxolone simultaneously) and LPS1Carbi.p. (Received Carbenoxolone by i.p. injection 1 h after LPS + D-GalN), after 24 h the mortality rate was calculated and the severity of necrosis mea-sured in the livers of survived mice. Then mice were injected withLPS + D-GalN and drug in different times, after 3 h serum samples were collected and the concentrations of TNF- aand IL-10 were measured. Administration of carbenoxolone with LPS + D-GalN reduced the lethality rate from 80 to 20%. The severity of necrosis in the liver of LPSCarb and LPS1Carbi.p. groups were signicantly decreased in compare with LPS group (injected by LPS + D-Gal) (P =0.01 and P=0.04 respectively). The concentration of TNF- ain mice received LPS were signicantly increased in compare with control group (P=0.032). The changes in the IL-10 concentrations were accompanied with changes in TNF- aconcentration. Carbenoxolone signicantly reduced TNF- aconcentration, inflammation and damage due to LPS, however changes observed in IL-10 concentration was in response to TNF-aconcentration changes.

Inflammatory stimuliinduce ectodomain shedding of soluble CD163 (sCD163). High serumlevels of sCD163 predicted mortality in some inflammatory diseases. We investigated sCD163 release and predictive power towards out- come in critical illness. This is a secondary analysis of 2 randomizedclinical studies. Critically ill patients (n =1657) received conventional (insulin administered only for blood glucoses [215 mg/dL) or intensive insulin therapy (glucose maintained at 80-110 mg/dL). Matched healthy volunteers (n =24) were included as controls. We measured serum levels of sCD163 as well as gene expression levels in liver biopsies. On day 1, critically ill patients had twofold higher sCD163 levels than controls (p \\0.001). Day 1 sCD163 levels were higher in patients with an ICU stay [5 days (long-stay) versus short-stay patients (p \\0.001). sCD163 further increased by day 5, 10 and 15 in long-stayers and remained elevated until the last day, the latter irrespective of short or long stay. Non-survivors and patients who developed new kidney injury, liverdysfunction, polyneuropathy or bacteremia had higher sCD163 levelsfrom day 1 onwards. Moreover, even after correction for baseline risk factors, elevated day 1 sCD163 levels remained independently predictive for organ damage, ICU stay, and mortality. Avoiding hyperglycemia withinsulin reduced sCD163 levels. Gene expression of CD163 in liver was strongly elevated in critically ill patients as compared with controls. Circulating sCD163 levels were elevated during critical illness, with theliver as a potential source. This study hallmarks elevated sCD163 asmarker of disease severity and predictor of outcome in critical illness. Reduced sCD163 with intensive insulin therapy supports reduced inflammation and may contribute to improved outcome with this therapy.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-215 SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF GLUTAMINE AND CIPROFLOXACIN IN REDUCTION OF SEPTIC Mazloomi2, Ilkhanizadeh3 1Department Urmia,2Zanjan Islamic Azad University, Zanjan, 3Pathology, Urmia University Of Urmia, Iran, Republic Of IslamicS154 Inflamm. Res. 123Systemic inflammatory response induced by over expressing inflam- matory mediators is the main pathogenic mechanism of septic shock.Glutamine (Gln), a non-essential amino acid, has been demonstrated to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine release through enhanced heat shock protein (HSP) expression. The aim of this study was theevaluation of the effect of co-administration of Gln and ciprofloxacinin reduction of septic shock severity caused by Pseudomonas aeru- ginosa in mice. Balb/c mice were divided to ve groups. Mice of the control negative group injected only with PBS and those of thepositive control group received 75% lethal dose (LD75) of Pseudo- monas aeruginosa . Mice of the remaining three groups were administered by ciprofloxacin, glutamine or both 30 min after injec- tion of LD75 of the bacteria. Five hours after injection of the bacteria,serum samples were collected and concentrations of TNF- a, IL-10 and HSP-70 were measured. Eleven hours after injection of the bacteria, livers of the mice were removed and the severity of necrosis was determined. The survival rate was considered for 10 days. Theresults showed that injection of glutamine in combination with cip- rofloxacin signicantly increased the survival rate and the IL-10 concentration and signicantly decreased theserum TNF- aconcentration and the liver necrosis in comparison with the positive control group. The ndings indicated that Gln has a synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin in reduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa -induced shock.

Kimura1 1Oral and Of Dentistry, Morioka, Japan Background: Streptococcus anginosus is a part of the normal flora found in human dental plaque. Although it has emerged that S. anginosus infection could be associated with oral, esophagus and gastric cancers, its pathogenic factors are still unclear. We previously identied bronectin binding protein gene, fbp62, which could associate the adherence of S. anginosus to mucosal epithelial cells. In this study, by using the fbp62 knockout mutant we investigated the pathogenic involvement of Fbp62 in an S. anginosus -infection model. Materials and methods: An fbp62 knockout mutant ( Dfbp62 ) was prepared by homologous recombination from S. anginosus NCTC 10713. The adhesive ability of Dfbp62 to the immobilized bro- nectin and HEp-2 cells was analyzed by using [3H]-labeled bacteria. The survival rate and the abscess formation were investigated in anS. anginosus -infection mouse model with ip injection of Dfbp62 . The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF- a, IL-6) of mouse macrophages was analyzed by real-time PCR.Results: The adhesive ability of Dfbp62 to HEp-2 cells as well as the immobilized bronectin was considerably reduced. In the mice infected with Dfbp62 , the mortality and the abscess formation were substantially lower than those in the mice infected with the wild typeof bacteria. However, no difference was observed in the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines between the macrophages from Dfbp62 - and wild type of S. anginosus -infected mice. Conclusions: The present ndings indicated that the bronectinbinding proteins, Fbp62, of S. anginosus could play an important rolein the adherence to mucosal epithelial cells, and suggested that the adhesive ability could be involved in the pathogenicity of S. anginosus .

Lai1 1Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan,2Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, China Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the effector arm of host innate immune defense system. The major functions of NKcells in killing tumor transformed or virus-infected cells were wellestablished. However, whether NK cells can directly kill bacteria remains poorly understood. In this study, using the pathogenic mycobacterium Mycobacterium kansasii as the study model, our results indicated that human NK cells directly kill mycobacteria in a contact dependent manner, using the cytolytic proteins, perforin and granulysin as the weapons. These results indicate that theantibacterial activity is constitutively expressed in NK cells, inwhich it requires prior activation, granulysin and perforin, plays the dominant role in NK cell antibacterial activity. Moreover, the expression of NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 upstream sig-naling molecule are enhanced.M. kansasii -enhanced granulysin and perforin expression and antibacterial activity are effectively inhibited by pretreatment with the inhibitors of JNK killing phenomenon by and granulysin was also observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis , suggesting a conserved killing mechanism. In conclusion, results from this study showedNK cells directly kill mycobacteria. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-218 SYK PLAYS Pharmacology, College Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, China Toll-like receptor (TLR) is a major family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Microbialpathogens can activate TLRs signaling and trigger dramatic immuneresponses. The Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) presents in innate immune cells and plays a key initiation of ITAM-containing immunoreceptors signaling and TLRs signaling. However, the precise role of Syk in TLRssignaling is still controversial. Here we show the dual role of Syk in TLR4-mediated signaling cascade and inflammatory gene expression in primary murinemacrophages. We found that Syk-decient macro-phages after LPS stimulation can induce higher expression levels ofinflammatory genes and proteins. Loss of Syk also increases TAK1 downstream signaling cascades activation after LPS stimulation. In contrast, less LPS-induced TBK1 activation and type I IFN (IFNb) geneexpression in Syk-decient cells than wild type cells were observed. InHEK293T overexpression system, we also found Syk interacts MyD88, TRAF6 and TRAF3. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of Syk in TLR4-mediated TAK1 and TBK1 signaling pathways and the opposite regu- latory effect on inflammatory responses. We anticipate our nding to be a starting point forth dual role of Syk in immune responses and thedelicate regulation of Sykcan tune the innate immune response to lessinflammation in late infection phase.

Kofler1 1Paracelsus Medical University Department of Pediatrics, Laura Bassi Centre Of Expertise, Therapep,2Department of Surgery, 3Department of Pediatrics, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria The neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been shown to be an important mediator in lung injury during polymicrobial sepsis. SP exhibits itsproinflammatory effects via increased capillary permeability and neutrophil extravasation. In a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, animals were protected against lung injury after administration of aspecic SP receptor antagonist. For the neuropeptide galanin no dataconcerning septic conditions are available so far. However, in murine skin, galanin has been shown to inhibit plasma extravasation induced by SP and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). This suggestsgalanin as an opponent of SP and CGRP in neurogenic inflammation. To study a possible role of galanin during systemic inflammation we investigated the expression of the galanin system, SP and TNF- a mRNA in organs of septic mice. Sepsis was induced in C57/BL6 miceby colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP), because this animal model mimics closely human septic conditions. Lungs were removed 12 h after surgery. Quantitative real time PCR was performed todetermine the relative expression of galanin, TNF- aand SP mRNA. We were able to detect a signicant up regulation of SP (60-fold) and TNF-a(110-fold) expression and a 50% down regulation of galanin in lungs of septic mice compared to sham operated animals. Theexpression of the galanin receptors R1, R2 and R3 was not changed. These results implicate that galanin is down regulated in the initial immune response to favour pro-inflammatory mediators. In furthercourse galanin might be increased as an opponent of SP to avoid anovershooting immune response, including vasodilatation, neutrophil accumulation and organ dysfunction.

P-220 Medical Care and Management,Pharmacology,3Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ChinaSeptic shock is characterized by severe hypotension and reduced response to vasopressor agents, called vascular hyporeactivity. Thehypotension and vascular hyporeactivity are associated with the development of multiple organs dysfunction which causes death eventually. Thus, it is important to investigate the mechanism of vas-cular hyporeactivity in septic shock. Among the cell signaling pathwaysthat are crucial to control vascular tone, Ca 2+-sensitization contraction has become more and more important. The small GTP-binding protein, RhoA, plays a crucial role in mediating smooth muscle contraction.Activation of RhoA leads to inactivation of myosin light chain phos-phatase via activation of Rho-kinase. It has been shown that Src family tyrosine can activate RhoA via phosphorylation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In addition, it is reported thatactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) can lead to Ca 2+-independent vasocontraction through activation of RhoA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of PKC and SFK in RhoA activity in thoracic aortae from endotoxemic rats. Rats received an intravenous injection oflipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg) for 4 h. After then, rats were sacriced and the thoracic aortae were endotoxic rats only. In addition, the phosphorylation of SFK was decreased by GF-109203 9in endotoxemic rats. In conclusion, PKC and SFK might play a more crucial role in RhoA activation and PKCmight play a more important role in activation of SFK endotoxemic rats. These results suggest that RhoA is related to vascular hyporeactivity caused by LPS-induced septic shock. In addition, PKC and SFK mightbe targets for improving vascular hyporeactivity.

P-221 THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF LEVOSIMENDAN ON PERITONITIS-INDUCED SEPTIC SHOCK WITH Care and Management,Pharmacology, National Defense Medical Center, 3Anesthesiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital,4Anesthesiology, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, China Sepsis/septic shock and its sequelae, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), are major contributors of mortality in critical ill patients. Levosimendan (LS) is a fairly new calcium sensitizer with positive inotropic properties without increasing myocardial oxygenconsumption. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of levosimendan inWistar rats with MODS induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Rats were divided into six groups: (1) sham-operation (SOP), (2) SOP+ vehicle [infusion dose (5% glucose) 30 ll/kg/min for 6 h, loading dose 120 ll/kg for 10 min i.v. at 3 h after SOP], (3) SOP + LS (infusion dose 0.3 lg/kg/min for 6 h, loading dose 12 lg/ kg for 10 min i.v. at 3 h after SOP) (4) CLP, (5) CLP+ vehicle[infusion dose (5% glucose) 30 ll/kg/min for 6 h, loading dose 120ll/kg for 10 min i.v. at 3 h after CLP] and (6) CLP + LS (infusion dose 0.3 lg/kg/min for 6 h, loading dose 12 lg/kg for 10 min i.v. at 3 h after CLP). Our results showed that LS (1)improved hypotension, hypoglycemia, and vascular hyporeactivitycaused by CLP, (2) reduced ALT, AST, creatinine, BUN and LDH in plasma, (3) reduced plasma NO and IL-1 blevel, anionS156 Inflamm. Res. 123levels and lung intestine polymorphonuclear (5)attenuated apoptosis of spleen, (6) improved metabolic acidosis, (7) improved the survival rate compared to the CLP + vehicle group. Thus, the benecial effect of LS may be attributed to reducing theplasma concentration of NO and IL-1 bas well as organ superoxide anion levels and decreasing lung, liver, intestine PMN inltration and spleen apoptosis, thereby decreasing the mortality rate in peritonitis- induced septic animals.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-222 MODULATION OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SEPSIS: ROLE OF LIPOXIN A4 R. Sordi1,*, O. Menezes de Fernandes3, Ponta Grossa, Ponta Grossa, Brazil Introduction: Pneumonia is the major cause of sepsis in intensive care units. Sepsis is the result of the host response to microbial infection,and can be considered as an excessive systemic inflammatoryresponse. Lipoxins (LX) are lipid mediators with potent anti-inflam- matory actions. Previous works show that pathogens may take advantage from the anti-inflammatory environment provided byLXA 4. The aim of this work is to study the role of LXA 4in sepsis. Methods: Pneumonia-induced sepsis was induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae (49108CFU/animal) in Swiss mice. Sham-operated mice were used as control. Mice received lip-oxin receptor (FPR2/ALX) antagonist BOC-1 (1 lg/kg; i.p.) soon after surgery and every 12 h in survival experiment. Six hours after sepsis induction, animals were sacriced and bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and tissues were obtained for analysis.Results and discussion: Neutrophils (PMN) migration to lungs from septic animals increased when compared to sham group. Animals exhibited a high degree of bacterial load in BAL, spleen and heart.Compared to septic mice, animals treated with BOC-1 exhibitedincreases of PMN number to the infectious focus and consequently a reduced bacterial load and dissemination. Interestingly, LXA 4levels in BAL from septic mice were higher compared to sham animals. Treat-ment with BOC-1 also increased survival rate. Therefore, LXA 4levels increased in sepsis and FPR2/ALX antagonist BOC-1 reduced bacterial load and improved survival. These data suggest for the rst time that areduction in anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the beginning of thesepsis process could be an interesting therapeutic alternative.

Hassler1, provides the rst barrier against patho- gens. It has evolved to recognise a broad range of pathogens anddiscriminate between self and non-self. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the crucial sensors of pathogen associated molecular pattern or PAMPS. Intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLR3, 7 and 9) localise inendosomes and recognize single stranded RNA and nucleotides fromviruses and bacteria. This interaction induces their conformational changes resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and up regulation of cell surface molecules in dendritic cells (DCs). In theabsence of stimulation, TLRs are retained in the endoplasmic retic-ulum (ER) together with another ER resident protein, UNC93B. Upon stimulation, they relocate to the endo-lysosomal compartment, allowing the recruitment of the adaptor molecule, MyD88, andthereafter, signal. It has been shown that mouse TLR9 requires pro-teolytic cleavage in the endosomes to be functional. This is an important step, as it is the activation of the MyD88 signaling pathway that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mat-uration in DCs. Indeed, upon stimulation, full length TLR9 is cleaved into a C-terminal-fragment and this processing is highly dependent on a cysteine protease named asparagine endopeptidase (AEP). also cleaved by AEP into a C-terminalfragment competent for signaling. Like TLR9, a boost in AEP activity, induced shortly after TLR7 stimulation, promotes TLR7 cleavage and correlates with an increased acidication in a putative AEP cleavage site stronglydecreases its signaling in DCs. In contrast, TLR3 processing and signaling seems to require a different set of proteases. As endocytic TLRs recognize DNA/RNA from various parasites, bacteria, virusesand are likely to play an important role in many inflammatory dis- eases, we are now developing infection models in AEP decient mice.

Fantappie1 1Institute of Medical Biochemistry,2Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,3Chemistry Department, Military Institute of Engineering, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Introduction: The functioning of the immune system is nely bal- anced by the activities of pro-inflammatory and or cytokines. Unregulated activities of these mediators canlead to development serious inflammatory diseases. Therefore, anti-cytokine agents that target biosynthetic pathways of pro-inflammatory cytokines would offer an attractive alternative to the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Recent data showed the capacity of VGX-1027 [(S,R)-3-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxasole acetic acid] to inhibit the increase of circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor aand interleukin-1 bin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice. In this study, we evaluated the role of DIC, a 5-(4-pyrildil)-4,5-dihydrois-oxasole derivate, as a potential anti-cytokine compound. Results: DIC levels with DIC also inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 assay DIC attenuated the LPS-induced DNA binding of NF-kB. In addition, it was found that treatment withDIC signicantly inhibited the activation of p38 and ERK MAP kinase. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-inflammatory effect of DIC in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages is via theMAP kinase pathway. Furthermore, in vivo, DIC conferred increase in the survival of mice that have been subjects to cecal ligation and puncture, an experimental sepsis model.Conclusions: We believe that the anti-cytokine activity of DIC couldbe due to the NF-kB/MAPK pathway inhibition. In addition, our data suggest that DIC may potentially play a role in the therapy of inflammatory disease as sepsis.Keywords: Pro-inflammatory cytokines, Sepsis, 4,5-dihydroisoxasole,NF-kB.

P-225 PREVENTIVE EFFECTS OF CHLORELLA ON LPS-INDUCED INFLAMMATION AND Pharmacy & Science, Tainan, Taiwan, China Inflammation is a host response to infection and is characterized by elevated inflammatory mediators. Two of the major mediators during inflammation, i.e. nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),are released by macrophages and neutrophils. Overt inflammation can lead to detrimental consequence, such as septic shock, which is known due to excessive NO and proinflammatory cytokines pro-duction. Chlorella has been shown to have various effects, including anti-inflammatory effect through inhi- bition TNF- aproduction), however its protection against LPS-induced sepsis has not been studied. In this study, we investigate protectiveeffects of Chlorella extract against LPS-induced sepsis in mice. Endotoxin-induced septic shock was initiated by injecting 20 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. Mice were given differentdosages of Chlorella extract (10, 20, 30 mg/kg, orally) 30 min after the treatment of LPS. Serum NO production was prepared and measured as nitrite (using Griess reagent), IL-6 and TNF- awere concurrently monitored by using commercial ELISA kits. Themortality rate was observed 12, 24, and 36 h after the LPS treatment. Chlorella extract administration decreased LPS-induced mortality as evidenced by increased survival rate in a dose dependent manor. Thesurvival rate remained as high as 95% in those mice treated with 30 mg/kg of Chlorella extract compared to 40% of survival rate in the control (vesicle treatment) 36 h after LPS injection. Chlorella extract treatment also signicantly suppressed LPS-induced extract reducing inflammatory mediator and proinflammatory cytokines production.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-226 INFLUENZA A INDUCES MUC5AC,A MAJOR SECRETED PULMONARY MUCIN, IN A 7, Paris, France,4Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: The airways mucus gel performs a critical function in the defense of the respiratory tract against pathogenic and environ- mental challenges. In respiratory infections, mucins such as Muc5ACcould be protective and able to sequester pathogens [1].Aims: (1) To determine whether IAV (seasonal and pandemic Influ- enza A strains) is able to modulate Muc5AC production in airway epithelial cells. (2) To dissect the molecular pathways involved inIAV modulation of Muc5AC synthesis. Results: We demonstrate here that seasonal and pandemic strains infection of NCI-H292 cells (MOI =1) induced signicantly MUC5AC gene expression. Influenza (H3N2), themost virulent strain, lead to a signicant Muc5AC increase compared to mock-treated cells, and this was dependent on viral replication. Moreover, using the same strain, we showed that in vivo infection ofC57Bl/6 mice with 150 or 300 pfu lead to a threefold increase ofMuc5ac RNA expression at day 3 and 4 post-infection compared to PBS-treated mice. We demonstrated that the Sp1 transcription factor is involved in IAV-induced MUC5AC gene expression and that this ismediated by the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Next, we showed that this pathway was initiated upstream by a matrix metalloproteinase (TACE)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activationand that TGF-a of the ligands implicated in EGFR activation [2, 3].Conclusion: We show for the rst time that IAV up-regulates Muc5AC through a TACE/EGFR/MAPK pathway and that this induction is IAV-replication dependent. We are studying now if up-regulation protects against IAV infection or whether Muc5AC over-expression is deleterious in IAV-induced deleterious exacerbations in chronic lung diseases, such as asthma or cystic brosis.

This study evaluated and com-pared postoperative complications of patients who were operated on bysurgeons ranging in clinical experiences. These surgeons included an oral surgeon specialist, a PhD student in Oral Biology, and a senior dental student. In the preoperatory period and on the second and seventh post-operative days, the following parameters were analyzed: pain, infection,swelling, trismus, body temperature, C-reactive protein levels and sali- vary neutrophil counts. During surgery the following parameters were analyzed: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, oximetry, heartrate, anesthesia, amount of local anesthetic, bleeding, surgery difculty and duration of surgery. There were some differences in the surgery duration, local anesthetic amount, anesthesia quality, bleeding,pain experienced, trismus, C-reactive protein levels and salivary neu-trophil counts. However there were no changes in hemodynamic parameters, rescue analgesic medication, wound healing, swelling, body temperature, conrmed case of dry socket or any other type of localinfection in the patients. Taken together, the results of the present studysuggest that antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary after LTMR no matter what the surgeons' clinical experiences were.

We have now evaluated the role of TRPV1 insepsis by using a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and utilised. into the peritonealcavity of both WT and TRPV1KO mice when compared to sham ani- mals. No difference was observed in the total cell number between CLP WT and TRPV1KO mice but a reduced number of intact mononuclearcells were found in TRPV1KO peritoneal cell samples. Analysis ofapoptotic genes in the peritoneal cells by Q-PCR showed that CLPTRPV1KO mice presented increased expression of FAS, p53 and cas- pase-3 when compared to CLP WT mice. Also, peritoneal TNF alevels were higher TRPV1KO when compared to CLP WT mice. CLP increased the peritoneal nitric oxide (NO x) and ROS (superoxide and H2O2) levels in WT but not in TRPV1 KO mice. In vitro phagocytosis was assessed in cultured peritoneal macrophages obtained from WT showed impairedphagocytosis. of PI3 K phagoly- sosome formation, were reduced in CLP TRPV1KO in comparison to CLP WT peritoneal cells. Our results provide novel evidence that TRPV1 can regulate immune cell functioning and survival in sepsis. Wesuggest that TRPV1 protection in sepsis is related to its role in regu-lating immunity.

P-230 DIFFERENTIAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IN MACROPHAGES BY HOSPITAL, Taiepi, Taiwan, China Introduction: This study is designed to explore the differential inflammatory responses in macrophages by the different resistantstrains of vancomycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). Materials and methods: Macrophages (RAW264.7 cell line) wereinfected using two strains of VSSA and VISA isolated from a patientwith septic arthritis. The time course was 0, 6, and 12 h and the doses were 1 910 3,19104, and 1 9105CFU/ml, respectively. Gene (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase, IL-1beta, IL-6, and reverse chain reaction (RT-PCR). COX-2 protein expression and signal transduction were evaluated by western blotting and electro- phoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively.Results: COX-2 and 5-lipoxygenase gene expression did not influ-enced by starvation within 12 h. COX-2 gene induction by VSSA and VISA infection in macrophages was in a dose-dependent and time course-dependent manner. VSSA yielded an intense, signicantresponse compared to VISA in early infection (6 h) and also produced similar effects by dosage experiments ( p\\0.05). The 5-lipoxygenase pathway did not demonstrated similar responses. VSSA also produceda higher level for IL-1beta and IL-6 gene expression than VISA did.TNF-alpha showed an increase tendency but no signicant difference. COX-2 protein expression showed signicant difference at a con- centration of 1 910 5CFU/ml VSSA and VISA. Signal regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and NF-kB activation. Conclusion: Our data may suggest that changes of Staphylococcus aureus strains to the antibiotic sensitivity may induce differential inflammatory responses in macrophages and play an important role in the host inflammatory adaptation.

Thiemermann2, Hauser3, Brohi1 1Centre for Trauma and Neurosciences,2Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, 3Department of Surgery, Division of Trauma, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA Introduction: Traumatic injury generates an inflammatory response which is proportional to injury severity. Candidates for traumaAlarmins include HMGB1, Mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) and eukaryotic nucleosomes. We wished to investigate the role of these substances in the sterile inflammatory response to tissue damage whenisolated from other activators of inflammation.Methods: Blood was drawn from human trauma patients on arrival to a major trauma centre. Injury severity score (ISS) and admission base decit (BD) were used to identify a ''Trauma'' cohort (T) with tissueinjury and no hypoperfusion (ISS [4, measured inplasma using ELISA or qPCR. Results: 300 patients were recruited. Levels of MtDNA (27.18 qPCR cycles, range 24.7-28.1, p =0.002) were higher in the T cohort compared to C (27.6 cycles, range 26.9--28.4). Cycles correlatedwith ISS (p \\0.001, r 2=0.1) and were not influenced by shock (BD). HMGB1 demonstrated a similar trend but not a dose-dependent increase. Nucleosome levels were not raised in the T cohort. HMGB1was elevated in the TS cohort (17.0 ng/ml range 0.0-160.0, p\\0.001) compared to C ng/ml 0.0-68.3) and levels correlated with base decit (p \\0.001, r 2=0.1) but not ISS. In the TS cohort, nucleosome levels (19.6 Au range 0.0-114.2, p \\0.001 vs. C: 4.7 Au range =0.01) and BD (p=0.02, r2=0.07). Conclusions: After traumatic injury, in the absence of shock and otheractivators of inflammation, circulating MtDNA levels reflected injuryseverity. These molecules may be trauma alarmins. Nucleosomes were not released by tissue injury alone. HMGB1 levels increased in proportion to the base decit and not injury severity. Ourstudy ndings suggest that HMGB1 may not be passively released by pure tissue damage in human trauma. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-232 TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLR) 2 E 4 AND THE ADAPTER MOLECULE MYD88 PLAY A ROLE IN SEPSIS-INDUCED ACUTE KIDNEYINJURY C. O1,2 1Medicine, Federal University of Sa o Paulo,2Immunology, University of Sao Paulo, Sa o Paulo,3Pathology, Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil Introduction: Sepsis is considered one of the main causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients, mainly due to bacteria infection.TLR2 e TLR4 are important innate immunity receptors responsible for pathogen-associated molecular pattern structure recognition thatwhen activated, they trigger, with the adaptor molecule MyD88, a signaling cascade that results in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.Objective: To study TLR2, KO, TLR4 KO and MyD88 KO male mice were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)with two perforations using 23G needle. Blood and kidney tissuesamples were collected after 24 h for analysis. Results: After 24 h, TLR2 KO, TLR4 KO e MyD88 KO animals subjected to CLP presented preserved kidney morphology, with loweracute tubule necrosis scores. We observed less areas hypoxia and TLR4 KO animals presented a tendency towards less injury, while MyD88 KO animals were completely protected compared mRNA (IL1- b, TLR4 KO and MyD88 KO kidneys whencompared to WT. We observed less neutrophil inltration in MyD88KO kidneys 24 h after sepsis. MyD88 KO animals also presented higher survival scores when compared to WT animals. Conclusion: Here, we concluded that the innate immunity participatesin sepsis-induced polymicrobial AKI, P-233 ROLE OF ESTRADIOL ON MODULATIONOF INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS AND RESISTANCE TO INFECTION INDUCED BY ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS F. M. Garcia1,*, R. S. Saia2,E .C .C a \u00b4rnio1 1Department of General and Specialized Nursing,2Department of Physiology, University of Sa o Paulo, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Background: It has been demonstrated that ovarian hormones modulate immune response during inflammatory conditions, acting in production of cytokines, as well as nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the participation of estradiol in the resistance to infectionand also, in nitrate and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- a)p r o d u c t i o ni n rats submitted to Enterococcus faecalis infection. Materials and methods: Experiments were performed in female Wi- star rats ovariectomized and treated for 3 consecutive days with twodoses of estradiol (50 or 100 lg/kg) or vehicle. On the third day, 2 h after the last injection, each rat received an intraperitoneal injection of bacterial suspension of Enterococcus faecalis. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture at 6 and 24 h after bacterial inoculum administra-tion, for blood culture, plasma nitrate and was detected by chemiluminescence, while TNF- awere determined by ELISA sandwich kit. Furthermore, the microbiologicalS160 Inflamm. Res. 123tests were determined in blood and liver at the same experimental periods.Results: Estradiol at the higher dose was effective in decreasing bacterial dissemination in the liver (p \\0.05), but not in blood at 6 and 24 h after bacterial challenge. Moreover, estradiol also increasedsignicantly plasma nitrate concentration only at 24 h (p \\0.001), while TNF was increased at both time evaluated (p \\0.05). The febrile response was observed 3 h after Enterococcus faecalis administration, but it did not demonstrate statistical difference amongthe experimental groups.Conclusion: These data suggest that estradiol does not have effect in body temperature of ovariectomized rats submitted to Enterococcus faecalis infection. However, it seems to be effective to oppose the bacterial spread in liver, and also modulate the production ofinflammatory mediators, such as NO and TNF- a. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-234 S-NITROSYLATION AND EPIGENETIC REGULATION DURING ENDOTOXIN TOLERANCE E. C. Rios1,*, F. G. Soriano2 1Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil,2Cl\u00b4nica Me \u00b4dica, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in low levels induces a resistance state called tolerance, with a silencing of inflammatory genes. Endotoxin-tolerant cells and leukocytes from septic patientsexhibit alterations of the cellular signaling that can protect against a lethal challenge of LPS. This condition is regulated by several mechanisms, included changes in chromatin structure, an epigeneticprocess of gene reprogramming. Nitric oxide (NO) participates of thetolerance conditions. It is known that the interaction of NO with cysteines residues, the S-nitrosylation, could alter the structure of enzymes and consequently its functions. We investigated whether thetolerance could modulate the S-nitrosylation of enzymes involved inthe epigenetic regulation such as the Histone Deacetylases (HDAC), responsible by a repression in the gene expression, and consequently modulate the production of the proinflammatory mediators. THP-1human promonocytes were cultivated in RPMI (C group), submitted to tolerance to LPS (T group 500 ng/mL during 24 h) or challenge (D group 1 lg/mL during 24 h). We used tricostatin (TSA 30 nM) to inhibit the HDAC activity, LNAME (100 lM) to inhibit the NO release and SGNO (0.5 mM) as NO donor. The HDAC activity and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF) were measured with ELISA kits. S-nitrosylation was assessed by biotin switch and the NO levelsby Griess Reaction. Tolerance increased the total amount of S-nit-rosylated proteins. We found reduced HDAC activity in the T group that was associated to increasing of S-nitrosylated HDAC-2. Endo- toxin tolerance cells demonstrate a reduced levels of IL-10 (p \\0.05) and IL-6 (p \\0.05). However, the administration of HDAC or NO inhibitors repressed the effects of the tolerance in HDAC activity as well as cytokines production.Our results demonstrate an important role of endotoxin tolerance in the epigenetic regulation and suggestthat the S-nitrosylation may have implication for inflammatory repression.

Cunha2,E .C .C a \u00b4rnio3 1Physiology,Pharmacology,3General and Specialized Nursing, University Of Sa o Paulo, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Background: Nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor- a(TNF- a) and interleukin (IL)-10 play a key role in innate immune system con- trolling microbial infection. However, during septic shock theirexacerbated formation is associated with several deleterious compli- cations, as hypotension. Cholecystokinin (CCK) was rstly described as a gastrointestinal hormone, but immune cells express their recep-tors, suggesting a possible involvement of this hormone in modulationof inflammatory response. Our aim was to evaluate the role of CCK on NO, TNF- aand IL-10 production during endotoxemia lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypotension.Materials and Male Wistar rats injec-tion of CCK (0.4 or 40 lg/kg) 10 min before LPS (1.5 mg/kg) administration. The mean arterial pressure and cardiac output were monitored continuously during 6 h after endotoxin injection. Blood wascollected for plasma nitrate, TNF- aand IL-10 determinations at 2, 4 and 6 h after LPS. Nitrate was detected by chemiluminescence, while cyto- kines were determined by ELISA sandwich kits.Results: The LPS induced-hypotension was reverted by the pretreat-ment with CCK only at the lower dose tested (p \\0.01). Moreover, CCK reduced plasma nitrate levels at 2 and 6 h after LPS adminis- tration (p \\0.05), but did not alter TNF- aproduction. The plasma IL- 10 concentration was increased (p \\0.05) by CCK administration at 2 and 4 h after endotoxemia. Conclusion: These data suggest that CCK improves hypotension and reduces NO formation during endotoxemia in rats. Furthermore, CCKregulates positively anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 synthesis, how-ever do not a. interest: None declared. P-236 WNT5A Boch8, Y.

Wnt signaling moleculesplay important roles in bone biology, apoptosis and chronic inflamma-tion. Recent studies have suggested an association of these molecules with various disorders including cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. We previously demonstrated that Wnt5amRNA expression was up-regulated in chronic periodontitis tissue whencompared to non-periodontitis tissue. In this study, we investigated the modulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression by periodontopathic bacteria. gingivalis LPS, (E. coli) LPS, IL-6, IFN- b, or IFN- c. To investigate the involvement of NF-jB and JAK/STAT pathways in the modulation of Wnt5a expression, inhibition assay, trans-fection, western luciferase assay and expression was signicantly up-regu-lated by P. gingivalis LPS than E. coli LPS. P. gingivalis LPS induced Wnt5a mRNA expression and NF- jB activity. P. gingivalis LPS markedly reduced the cytosolic level of I jBathan E. coli LPS. The induction of Wnt5a mRNA expression augmented by co-stimula-tion with IFN- cand IFN- csynergistically enhanced the P. gingivalis LPS Wnt5a expression through STAT1 in parallel with the acti-vation of NF- jB.

LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE EXPOSURECHANGES THERMOREGULATORY RESPONSE RATS R. S. Saia1,*, G. Bertozi2, F. Q. Cunha2,E .C .C a \u00b4rnio3 1Physiology,Pharmacology,3General and Specialized Nursing, University Of Sa o Paulo, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Background: Early life immune challenge has been considered an adaptive defense strategy against pathogens when the innate immune system is not completely developed. Our aims were to evaluate whe- ther neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge alters bodytemperature response in adult female rats during endotoxemic shock and whether ovarian hormones may participate in this response. Methods: Female Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with LPS(100lg/kg) (nLPS) or saline (nSal) at post-natal day 14. Then, experiments were performed in adults submitted to endotoxemic shock (10 mg/kg), surgically implanted with biotelemetry probes to body temperature monitoring. Blood were collected to measure tumornecrosis factor (TNF)- aand interleukin (IL)-10 levels at 1 and/or 2 h after LPS administration. Results: The LPS injection in adult nSal rats caused an initial hypo- thermia, followed by a febrile response. However, nLPS showed anincreased hypothermia and an attenuation of fever (p \\0.05). The bilateral ovariectomy abolished the difference in body temperature between the nLPS and nSal rats. Ovariectomized rats treated withestradiol cypionate (ECP) restored hypothermia and the suppressed febrile response (p \\0.01). Moreover, the same results were not obtained when the animals were supplemented with ECP and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The nLPS rats displayed a signicant reduction in TNF- alevels and an increase in IL-10 levels when compared to nSal animals (p \\0.01). The ECP injection sig- nicantly enhanced IL-10 and suppressed TNF- ain nLPS (p\\0.001), but it did not change the inflammatory response in the nSal rats. The ECP + MPA regiment in the nLPS rats reduced TNF- a, but eliminated IL-10 stimulation in comparison to the nSal group.Conclusion: These data suggest that neonatal LPS challenge alters the thermoregulatory response during endotoxemic shock in adulthood and estradiol could mediate this difference.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-238 PKC-HIS REQUIRED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL CEREBRAL MALARIA BUT DISPENSABLE FOR ASSOCIATED LUNG PATHOLOGY M.-L. Bourigault1,*, M. Fauconnier2, PKCHis required for the development of experimental cerebral malaria but dispensable for associated lung pathology Cerebral malaria is the most severe neurological complication in children and young adultsinfected with Plasmodium falciparum . In mice T-cell activation is required for the development of Plasmodium berghei ANKA ( PbA)- induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). In order to characterize the T cell activation pathway involved, we addressed the role of proteinkinase C-Theta (PKC- h) in ECM development. Here we report that PKC-hdecient mice are resistant to ECM development. In the absence of PKC- hno neurological sign of CM developed after blood stage PbA infection. Resistance of PKC- hdecient mice correlated with unaltered cerebral microcirculation and absence of ischemia, as documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiog- raphy (MRA), while wild-type mice developed distinct microvascularpathology. Recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells, and ICAM-1expression were reduced in the brain of resistant mice while the pul- monary inflammation and edema associated with PbA infection were still present in the absence of functional PKC- h. PKC- hdecient mice however developed high parasitemia and succumb at 3 weeks with asevere anemia. Therefore, PKC- hsignaling is crucial for the develop- ment of brain microvascular pathology resulting in fatal ECM but not for pulmonary inflammation and edema.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Spore-forming bacteria such as the genus Bacillus make convenient probiotics as they can survive transit through the stomachintact and in the gut. The present study was carried out for the iso-lation of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) producing Bacillus subtilis from a traditional Korean fermented soybean paste which is con- sumed commonly as a low cost source of high protein food and safefood. All B. subtilis and B. licheniformis isolates demonstrated inhibitory activity against S. aureus using agar spot inhibition assay. Interestingly, one strain B. subtilis (BS1800) displays a wide range of antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC) and S. typhi , but aeruginosa andS. marcescens Furthermore, BS1800 completely killed E. coli, EHEC andS. typhi after 3 days coculture in LB broth using viable cell count on MacConkey agar. The bactericidal effect on EHEC and strain specic. BLS of BS1800 was puried using ammonium sulfate precipitation and was shown to have a molecular mass of 8 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. We therefore proposestrain BS1800 as a suitable candidate probiotics for use in the pre- vention and treatment of infections caused by EHEC and S. typhi . Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-240 MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES INDUCES EXACERBATEPULMONARY INFLAMMATION IN MICE E. M. Soares1,*, A. Secatto1, C. P. Buzalaf2, E. G. Soares3, C. Tuberculose, Rio Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a virulent intracel- lular infects and persists in host macrophages, resulting ingranuloma formation and collagen deposition in the lung. The mecha- nisms that confer resistance to Mtbor results in establishment of disease are poor understood. Data from the literature suggest that differences inMtbvirulence contribute to setting up of the disease. Objective: Our purpose was investigated the immune response and lung pathology in mice infected with isolates recovered from patients with noncavitary (SV009), cavitary (SV038) and extrapulmonary(SV068) active and H37Rv (virulent) Mtb f Mtb strains or PBS. Neutrophils and mono- nuclear cells recruitment to the lung were accessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF). Colony formating units (CFU), lung histology, (NO) and cytokines were evaluated 15, 30, 60and 90 days post infection (p.i.).Results: Mice infected with H37Ra and H37Rv survival until the end of 60 days p.i. when compared with clinical isolates. Mice infectedwith SV009, SV038 and SV068 induced more cellular recruitment (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) into BALF at 30 and 60 days p.i.Spleen CFU recovered 90 days p.i. was higher in mice infected with SV009 strain. Histology of lung tissue, demonstrated that animals infected with SV068 present greater number of foamy macrophagescontaining of neutrophils perivascular and perialveolar spaces mainly at 60 days p.i.; and this animals produced more NO than the other strains at 30 days p.i. Cytokines production were variable, especially IFN- c, TNF- a, IL-6 and IL-10, and may be modulating the exacerbation of inflammatory response.Conclusion: Our ndings suggest that SV009, SV038 and SV068 can be more virulent than the other Mtb strains.

Du Sang, Saint-Etienne, France Platelets are anucleated cells that play a major role in primary hae- mostasis but their role in inflammation has now been recognized.Platelets contain and secrete various immunomodulatory factors, which behave as ligands for immune receptors. Platelets express several transcription factors that exert non-genomic functions. Wetested for the relevance and the nality of platelets TLR4 pathways. Expression of TLR4 on the platelet surface was determined by flow cytometry analysis. Western blot was performed TLR4 is expressed on human platelets and the percentage of CD41 +TLR4+platelets increase after TRAP stimulation compared to unstimulated control.Following the addition of E. coli orS. minnesota LPS there was no signicant alteration of CD62P expression. There were striking dif- ferences the levels of the sCD40L, sCD62P, PF4, RANTES andPDGF-AB induced by two different LPS stimuli. Western blot anal- yses using antibodies to MyD88 and TRIF subunits showed that both proteins were consistently present in puried human platelet lysates.We indeed observed that E. coli LPS platelet stim- ulation modulated antibody 4G10. Finally, supernatants from short term cultured platelets stimulated with two different LPSstimulate differentially blood mononuclear cells with different pat-terns of cytokine secretion. These data demonstrate a different panel of these chosen secreted cytokines that may reflect consistent varia- tion in the composition of platelet supernatants secreted after TLR4engagement. This data question the sentinel role of platelets in theirenvironment, their capacity of sensing differentially even through one given PRR, and their subsequent immunoregulatory function.

Ma Spain Host immune responses to xenografts show similarities to those of ghting infection. In this study we investigated the effect of xeno- geneic stimulation and xenoantibody induction on bacterial infection.Lewis rats were immunized with different protocols of hamster bloodand assessed how these procedures affected the development of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Rats that received three injections of hamster blood at 2-week intervals (IgG Group) elicitedvery anti-hamster IgG and relatively low specic IgMantibodies at day 40 after initiating the immunizations. Day 40 was thus selected to conduct CLP in this rat cohort. Another set of rats received three injections within a week inducing high titers of anti-hamster IgM and relatively low IgG levels at day 5 after the rst injection (IgM Group). They were assigned for CLP at day 5. Mul- tiple hematological, biochemical and general-health parameters weremonitored during Group showed a signicant increasein blood neutrophils (two, sixfold; p \\0.05) p \\0.05) just prior to CLP, whilst IgG Group did not show changes. A CLP procedure that produced a mild septic state was notassociated with any mortality in IgG Group, whereas in IgM Groupresulted in higher mortality [8/17 (47%), p \\0.05]. In a more severe CLP model IgG Group showed an improvement of rat general-health parameters that did not reduce mortality (68.7 vs. 76.5% controls).We also determined xenoantibody reactivity to bacteria isolated from blood of septic rats. Interestingly, we observed a threefold increase in IgM and IgG reactivity to Enterococcus faecalis using sera from Group IgM rats collected just prior to CLP, but not to Escherichia coli. In conclusion, the generalized immune response induced by a short xenogeneic stimulation had a detrimental effect on the septic process, despite the induction of antibodies that cross-react with someof the microorganisms isolated in the blood.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-244 HYPERTONIC SALINE SOLUTION DECREASEPULMONARY IN RODENT Brazil Hypertonic saline solution (HS solution, NaCl 7.5%) has shown to modulates immune function favorably and decrease organ injurytriggered by endotoxic shock. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effects of HS solution on the mechanism involved in acute respiratory injury, in an experimental model of endotoxemicshock. Wistar rats (220-260 g) received lipopolysaccharide\u2014LPS(10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, ip) and volume after 15 min. The animals were assigned in four groups (n =6 per group): control group (not subjected to LPS); LPS group (injected with LPS 10 mg/kg i.p); HSgroup (injected with LPS and treated with hypertonic saline, 4 mL/ kg) and NS group (injected with LPS and treated with normal saline, 34 mL/kg). At 24 h after treatment, pulmonary mechanics, pulmon-ary edema, and lung histology to evaluate collagen deposition weremeasured. Hypertonic solution improved pulmonary resistance, compared to LPS and NS groups. HS presented a reduction of 52 and 65% in the resistance. Collagen deposition showed reduced on HSgroup compared to LPS and NS groups, 61.5 and 82.2% respectively.There were no differences in pulmonary elastance and pulmonaryedema with HS. Therefore, we concluded that treatment of endo- toxemic shock with HS solution can decrease pulmonary damage andimprove the respiratory function. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-245 PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-TREATED RATS: INVOLVEMENT IN THE INITIAL STEPSOF DISEASE nized as multifactorial and remains unclear. This disease whichpresents two characteristic lesions, senile plaques and neurobrillarydegeneration is specic to humans. Until now, there is no relevant animal model at our disposal. Recent evidence suggesting that inflammation may be a third important component which may con-tribute actively to disease progression, we hypothesized that repeatedinfections during a lifetime facilitate Alzheimer's disease via neuro- inflammation and oxidative stress. Aim: The aim of this study was to mimic an infectious state in ratsusing acute or repeated LPS administration (1 mg/kg; i.p.). Methods: After LPS administration, reactive (NOx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE) were used as inflammatory and oxidative stressmarkers in different brain regions and/or blood. Moreover cogni- tive, cholinergic system and memory function have been assessed on animals after peripheral inflammation (LPS).Results: We have shown memory impairment and cholinergic systemdisorders after LPS treatment. LPS also induced a disruption of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). We also observed that LPS exposure signicantly increased ROS and NO cortex production (26 and 63%,respectively) associated with a signicant decrease in blood vitamin E (40%). Conclusion: These results indicate a possible relationship betweenperipheral infection/inflammation, neuroinflammation and distur-bances of the cholinergic system which could initiate AD in patients.

Wistar rats (220-260 g) received lipopolysac-charide\u2014LPS (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, ip) and volume after 15 min. The animals were assigned in four groups (n =6 per group): control group (not subjected to LPS); LPS group (injectedwith LPS 10 mg/kg i.p); HS group (injected with LPS and treatedwith hypertonic saline, 4 mL/kg) and NS group (injected with LPS and treated with normal saline, 34 mL/kg). At 1,5; 4 and 24 h after treatment, serum concentration of cytokines and at 24 h aftertreatment heart brosis were measured. Collagen deposition inheart decreased in HS and NS compared with LPS group, 38.5 and 49%, respectively. Serum concentration of cytokines showed decreased level of IL-10 in HS (22.3 \u00b13.77) and NS (24.15 \u00b11.6) treatment compared to LPS (43.84 \u00b17.36) at 24 h; decreased level of IL-6 in HS (1,839.7 \u00b1914.96) and NS (1,330.38 \u00b1455.46) level compared to LPS (11,583.7 \u00b11065.7) at 1,5 h and decreased level of IL-6 in HS (8,333.46 \u00b11,631.6) and NS (4,026.6 \u00b11,933) compared to LPS (14,040.4 \u00b13,142.5) at 4 h after treatment, p\\0,05.

Human Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of UTAH, Salt lake, UTAH, USA Survival during sepsis requires both swift control of infectious organisms and tight regulation of the associated inflammatory response. The aim of this study was investigate the role of CCL2 and NO in clearance of bacteria after CLP model. For this, mice weresubjected to CLP model. After 6 h, the numbers of CFU counts andmeasured of mediators were determined. To investigate the role of CCL2 in clearance of bacteria, the animals were treated with anti- CCL2 and 6 h after CLP the peritoneal fluid were collected. Thenumbers of CFU were signicant increased in anti-CCL2 group. treated with CCL2 or anti-CCL2 and stim- ulated with E. coli presented the signicant increased in numbers of CFU after anti-CCL2 treatment and decreased in numbers of bacteriaafter CCL2 treatment. These results suggest an important role in the elimination of CCL2 in models of bacterial sepsis. To investigate the involvement of NO in more bacterial elimination, we submitted thedecient mice of iNOS (iNOS -/-) to CLP. We observed in numbers of CFU in iNOS -/-group. In order to examine the relationship between CCL2 and NO in clearance of bacteria, peritoneal macrophages of decient mice to CCL2(CCL2 -/-) and WT mice were stimulated with LPS, IFN-g or LPS + IFN-g, and the NO production was determined. We observed the signicant decreased in NO levels into CCL2 -/-group after all treatments when compared to the control group. In order to investi-gate the signaling pathway involved in NO production by macrophages treated with CCL2, we analyze the ERK1/2 pathway by immunolocalization technique. After CCL2 treatment we observedthe increase in fluorescence of pERK and iNOS. We conclude that the CCL2 and NO are important mediators involved in better eliminationof bacteria in models of sepsis. We observed that CCL2 promotes the release of NO by a mechanism associated with ERK1/2 pathway signaling.Support: CNPq/PAPES/FIOCRUZDisclosure D. M. Klinman2 1Department of Anesthesiology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany,2Cancer and Inflammation Program, NCI Frederick, Frederick, USA Background and objectives: Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) expressing ''CpG motifs'' mimic the immunostimulatory activity of bacterial DNA. CpG ODN interact with TLR9 to stimulate an innate immune response characterized by the production of Th1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We predicted that microarrays could be usedto identify reproducible changes in gene expression induced by CpG ODN activation in mice treated in vivo over time, and that network analysis would allow us to identify regulators of gene expression.Methods: cDNA was generated from total RNA isolated from spleencells of mice 30 min to 3 days after in vivo treatment with 400 lgo f CpG or control ODN. Hybridization was performed on murine gen- ome microarrays (NCI). Analyses were conducted on fourindependently derived RNA samples for each time point. R2 was 0.90 \u00b10.04 for all matched samples. Network analysis was per- formed using ingenuity pathway analysis.Results: Gene activation (p \\0.00001) was observed within 30 min of CpG ODN treatment, peaked at 3 h, and fell to near background levels after 72 h. TNFa, IL-1b, NF-kB and IFNg played central roles in up-regulating the early expression of immune related genes. Twodistinct patterns of gene expression were observed: One subset ofgenes was activated shortly after CpG ODN administration and remained up-regulated for a prolonged period, while unique subsets of additional genes were activated at specic time points, and wererapidly down-regulated. Several genes responsible down- SOCS1) were identied. Conclusions: This analysis identies two distinct patterns of generegulation associated with CpG induced activation of the innateimmune system of mice. A small number of regulatory genes triggers the patterned up-regulation of immune related genes from 30 min through 72 h. A separate set of down-regulatory genes subsequentlydampens what would otherwise be a continuous positive feedback loop.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-249 INDUCTION OF herpesvirus. Primary infection with HCMV causes several healthproblems and once resolved, infection is followed by persistence of the virus in a latent form. The virus can be reactivated, resulting in a reemergence of the virus and development of complications in severaldiseases. HCMV is carried by monocytic or pre-monocytic cells and canbe reactivated when these cells are recruited to inflammatory sites. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are bioactive lipid mediators impli- cated in inflammatory processes and associated diseases. CysLTsmediate their activity via, at least, two major receptors CysLT1R andCysLT2R, both expressed on peripheral blood monocytes. Objective: We investigated the potential for cysLTs to and/or macrophages major immediate (MIEP) activationwas assessed using luciferase gene-tagged promoter constructs. Results: In macrophages and mature DCs, we found an increase of HCMV mRNA and protein expression after 48 h of stimulation withcysLTs. HCMV mRNA and protein expression in immature DCs wasinduced by cysLTs during and after differentiation. These cells are normally non-permissive to viral replication. CysLT1R antagonist did not prevent cysLT-induced HCMV mRNA and found a of MIEP enhancer transcription inHEK293 cells stably transfected with the CysLT2 receptor. This increase was reduced by NFkB and PKC inhibitors by 100 and 34% respectively.Conclusion: Our data indicate that cysLTs, via CysLT2R stimulation, activate latent HCMV and may increase HCMV replication.

Weiss1 1Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are key to cell survival. Our previous work used an adenoviral vector (AdHSP) to enhance Hsp70 expression in amodel of sepsis that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We have shown that AdHSP attenuates activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-jB pathway and limits cell division in pulmonary epithelial cells. We hypothesized that AdHSP attenuated NF-kB activation at multiple pointsin the I jBadegradative pathway. Other sets of preliminary studies revealed that AdHSP treatment decreased the expression of several cell division markers by limiting over proli feration of alveolar type II cells, by inhibiting hyper-phosphorylation of the regulatory retinoblastoma protein (Rb). However, AdHSP-induced HSP70 expression, is only one technique for protecting the lungs. We propose that the heat shock response (HSR) is activated, in part by the membrane dependent calcium channel receptortransient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1). We showed that selective antagonist of the TRPV1, and TRPV1 siRNA can abolish the heat shock and Capsaicin-induced activation of HSR and theconsequent accumulation of Hsp70, 90 and 25 chaperones in variousmammalian epithelial cells. Capsazepine treatment prevented Capsaicin- induced stabilization of I jBaand cell to cell adhesion and induced apoptosis. The Capsazepine-mediated blockage of the heat shock responsewas conrmed with EGTA, a calcium chelator, suggesting that HSR- sensing and signaling in mammalian cells depends on the transient entry ofcalcium by way of Ca channels, as in the case of the TRPV1 vanilloid receptors. Treatment of breast carcinoma cells with Etoposide and Caps- azepine showed a reduction in the expression of HSPs, and activation ofpro-apoptotic pathway.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure is a major cause of ALI induction. Female sex hormones (FSH) mayexert protective or deleterious effects on Th1 and Th2-mediated lunginflammation. We investigated herein the modulatory role of FSH on Th1 lung inflammation induced by LPS notably on cell recruitment. Material and methods: Seven days after ovariectomy (OVx), ll/g). The animals were euthanized 24 h thereafter, and the cells present in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), peripheral blood andbone marrow lavages were quantied. Furthermore, lung myeloper- oxidase (MPO) activity was also analyzed. Otherwise intact animals were subjected to the same procedures and served as controls (Sham-OVx group).Results: LPS increased the number of cells in BAL from both OVx and Sham-OVx groups regarding their respective controls and the basal groups. There was a marked increase in total BAL cells in theOVx + LPS group over Sham-OVx + LPS. Neutrophils and lym-phocytes in BAL of OVx + LPS group signicantly increased relative to Sham-OVx mice. Interestingly, after instillation of LPS, OVx induced a reduction in the total number of bone marrow cellsregarding Sham-OVx + LPS. No changes in the circulating leukocyte countings were detected among all groups. Finally, LPS increased lung MPO activity in OVx group when compared with Sham-OVx + LPS.Conclusions: FSH exerts an endogenous control of inflammation by downregulating the trafc and the lung accumulation of inflammatory cells induced by LPS exposure. Thus, it is conceivable that FSH-depriving conditions could blunt endogenous control of inflammatoryprocess. Financial bacterium present in the lung of up to 80% of cystic brosis (CF) patients, causing hypersecretion of airway mucus,chronic inflammation and airway obstruction. The mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa induces mucus hypersecretion are incompletely understood. In the present study we aimed to determine whether andhow P. aeruginosa flagellin leads to mucus hypersecretion. Methods: (i) Human airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292) were infected in vitro for 24 h with a wild-type (WT) P. aeruginosa (PAK strain), with its flagellin-decient mutant The amounts of MUC5AC,MUC5B and MUC2 mucins protein), interleukin-8 (IL-8), either the WT PAK strain or with DFliC mutant and the amount of mucins expressed in the lung was determined by RT-PCR and Alcian blue staining. Results: (i) Infection with WT PAK, but not with the DFliC, lead to: (a) production of a signicantly high level of MUC5AC both in vitroand in vivo in lung of WT mice; and (b) an increase in the level of IL- 8 cells production; (ii) treatment of cells with P. aeruginosa -flagellin induced MUC5AC expression through ERK1/2 dependent pathway; (iii) similar levels of mucins mRNAs were detected in the lung ofWT, TLR4 -/-and TLR5-/-mice infected with WT PAK. However, signicantly lower levels of mucins were detected in the lung of MyD88-/-and TLR4/5-/-mice compared to WT mice. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate P. aeruginosa flagellin induces airway mucin hypersecretion through TLR5-dependent and independent mechanisms. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-253 THE ROLE OF CD11D INTEGRIN IN THE PHYSIOPATHOLOGY OF SEPSIS INDUCEDBY SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM O. Nascimento1,*, A. P. Foundation\u2014 FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,2Program in Human Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake-Utah, USA Integrins are adhesion molecules that play a pivotal role during inflammatory process. The most relevant integrins for leukocyte are members of including neutrophilsand macrophages. CD11d integrin has been associated withpathological events in some inflammatory diseases, as rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the existing data, the pathophysiological role of thismolecule remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the central role of CD11d integrin in the inflammatory processes in model ofSalmonella infection. In this study, we used CD11d Knockout mice (CD11dKO) and wild type (WT) mice infected by an intraperitonealinjection of Salmonella Typhimurium and S. aureus . Our results showed that CD11dKO mice were more susceptible to infection. In CD11dKO mice we observed higher bacteremia, decreased migration of leukocytesto the peritoneum and increased levels of TNF- a, IL-6 and MIP-1 a,2 4 and 72 h after infection, when compared to the WT. Macrophages seem to be important cells in the onset of the observed responses, which are mediated by specic factors of Gram negative and independent of theCD11b and TLR4 expression. Moreover, our results showed problems inthe migratory ability of granulocytes from Cd11dKO mice toward che- motactic stimuli. We did not observe any correlation between the expression of CD11d integrin and nitric oxide production and presence ofapoptotic cell death, after infection. However, we have shown correlation between CD11d integrin and IL-1 band IL-18 production. Our results indicate an important role of CD11d molecule in the inflammatoryresponse after Salmonella infection and suggest a different role of CD11d integrin in Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial infections. Moreover, our results suggest for the rst time the involvement of CD11d integrin in inflamossoma activation.Disclosure of interest: PARACOCCIDIOIDES BRASILIENSIS WITHIN HUMAN MONOCYTES VIA MANNOSE RECEPTOR MODULATION L.

Soares1 1Department of Microbiology and Immunology, IB, UNESP, 2Botucatu Blood of Medicine, Introduction and objectives: IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine and its role in paracoccidioidomycosis, a deep mycosis, is not fullyunderstood. The effect of IL-18 on monocyte activity against P. brasiliensis (Pb) was studied by evaluating the fungicidal activity, H 2O2production, the modulation of TLR2, IL-10, TNF- a, IL-12 and IL-15 production after challenge in vitro with fungus.Methods: Monocytes were stimulated with IL-18 and treated with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4, anti-CD14 and/or by and IL-18, IL-10, TNF- a, IL-12 and IL-15 production ELISA. The results showed that IL-18 increased FR from infectedmonocytes and the blockage of receptors with specic neutralizing antibodies showed that this effect of IL-18 was mediated by MR. The challenge with Pb18 also increased MR, TLR2 and TLR4 expression.No alterations on H 2O2levels were observed. The challenge with Pb18 and Pb265 induced IL-12 and IL-15. with MR increase, while TNF- aand IL-10 production was associated with TLR4 and TLR2 respectively. The high IL-12 production was not related withnone of receptors studied.Inflamm. Res. S167 123Conclusions: Although IL-18 was able to induce high levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines, the effect of IL-18 on the increase of FR frommonocytes would be due to modulation of MR that in addition to facilitate the entry of the fungus in the cell, will activate a new molecular pathway that links engagement of MR with peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor (PPAR c) activation, which regulates the macrophage inflammatory response, thereby playing a role in paracoccidioidomycosis declared. P-255 A NOVEL PEPTIDE FOR TREATMENT OF MIDDLE EAR FLUID AND ASSOCIATEDHEARING IMPAIRMENT IN OTITS MEDIA S. H. Hefeneider1,*, S. L. McCoy1, D. R. Trune2 113therapeutics, INC.,2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA Objective: To reduce inflammation and subsequent hearing loss in otitis media (OM)Background: OM is characterized by inflammation and fluid in themiddle ear, which can impact hearing. No current therapeutic addresses this fluid and accompanied hearing impairment. We have identied a peptide, P13, derived from the vaccinia virus A52R pro-tein. Pathogens such as viruses produce proteins during the infectiousprocess which have been demonstrated to modulate the human immune response. P13 demonstrates potent in vitro cytokine inhibition in response to toll-like receptor signaling.Methods: Murine middle ear inflammation was induced by transtym- panic injection of heat-killed S. pneumonia. Twenty-four hours post- bacterial injection, animals with documented middle ear inflammationwere treated with either P13 or control administered systemically, ortopically as ear drops. Inflammation was documented by middle ear histology, and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) used to monitor hearing.Results: P13, administered after inflammation was established,decreased middle ear fluid area, number of cells in middle ear fluid, and tympanic membrane thickness. Most importantly, P13 decreased both the severity and duration of hearing impairment. Five days afterbacterial injection, P13 reduced hearing loss approximately 50% as compared to controls. By day 13, hearing thresholds in P13 treated animals returned to normal, while control groups continued to dem-onstrate signicant hearing impairment.Conclusions: P13, administered topically as ear drops, reduced inflammation and reduced hearing impairment in a murine model of middle ear inflammation. Preclinical data suggests that P13 may beuseful as a treatment for the fluid retention and hearing impairmentseen in patients with otitis media. Disclosure of interest: S.

Souza1,*, T. Gonc \u00b8alves-Silva1, M. F. Costa Silva1, Aplicada, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 1FIOCRUZ,2UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Severe malaria, or cerebral malaria (CM), is responsible for 2 millions deaths each year, and is characterized by fever, cerebral commitment and respiratory distress. Even though pulmonary edema and acuterespiratory distress syndrome are described during CM, the inflam-matory response in the lungs has not been characterized yet. The aim of this study was to characterize lung inflammation during experi- mental severe malaria. One day after the infection, P. berghei (5910 6infected RBC)-infected C57BL/6 mice presented increased lung and viscoelastic pressure when compared to non-infected mice. Morphometric and histologicalanalysis revealed edema formation and leukocyte accumulation in theinterstitial tissue (but not in the alveolus) 5 days after the infection. A signicant increase in the numbers of total leukocytes 3 days (mainly due to neutrophils) and 5 days (mainly due to gd and abT cells) after infection was observed. Lung tissues of P. berghei - infected mice presented increased levels of the cytokines TNF, IFN- c and IL-6, at day 3 and The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)- derived lipid mediator leukotriene (LT)B 4was detected at day 3 post- infection. Our results demonstrate that P. berghei infection triggers an important lung inflammation, which is characterized by mechanical changes at the early phase of malaria infection, followed by edemaformation, production of inflammatory mediators and leukocyteinltrates.

Ortiz-Navarrete1,*, A. Perez-Lopez1, R. Rosales-Reyes2, C. Alpuche-Aranda3 1Biomedicina Molecular, Cinvestav,2Medicina Experimental, UNAM,3Direccion, INDRE, Mexico, Mexico It has been demonstrated that Salmonella are able to infect and sur- vives within B-lymphocytes but there is no information regardingB-lymphocyte ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to Salmonella infection via TLR or NLR pathways.S168 Inflamm. Res. 123Objectives: To analyze the ability of Salmonella infected B lymphocyte to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines CpG, 48 \u00b18. RANTES secretion (pg/mL) was not different among different magnitude infection: NI, 165 \u00b10, MOI =10, 300\u00b110, MOI LPS, and 97 \u00b120. In regards of NLR pathway, B lymphocyte were able to secrete IL-1b(pg/mL) in response to Salmonella infection (NI 0 \u00b10 and MOI =10, 88 \u00b120). Conclusions: These data show that B-cells are not impaired to pro-duce pro-inflammatory mediators in response to Salmonella infection. These mediators are produced by TLR pathway (TNFa and IL-6) as well as by NLR pathway (IL-1b), however in contrast to macrophages B-cells are able to resist the cytotoxic effect of these cytokines. Theability of B-lymphocytes to resist this event could make them a good ''niche'' for Salmonella favoring disseminated infection. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-258 NITRIC OXIDE-GUANYLATE CYCLASE-PROTEIN KINASE G AXIS ACTIVATION CONTRIBUTE TO NEUTROPHIL DYSFUNCTION AND MORTALITY IN SEPSIS C. Barja-Fidalgo1,*, H. A. Paula Neto1, J. C. Alves-Filho2, F. O. Souto2, F. Spiller2, R. 1Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Do Estado de Janeiro,2Department of Pharmacology, FMRP-USP, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil In severe sepsis neutrophils present a state of unresponsiveness to chemotactic stimuli. This correlates with a poor prognosis and may contribute to worsen the clinical outcome in sepsis by precluding anefcient bacterial clearance. Experimental data have implicated nitric oxide (NO) in this phenomena. However NO synthesis inhibition in sepsis leads to increased mortality despite the restored neutrophilmigratory function. This could be at least in part due to an inhibition ofthe microbicidal effects of NO, suggesting that a better understanding of the roles of NO in sepsis is required. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms triggered by NO that lead to decreased neutrophil che-motactic responses in sepsis. Our results show that stimulation ofhuman neutrophils with lipopolysaccharide, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) well as lipotheichoic acid, a TLR2 ligand, decreased in vitro neutrophil responsiveness to classic chemoattractants as interleukin-8,leukotriene B 4and fMLP. These effects involved of the NO/guanylate cyclase (GC)/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway. Further we that NO-GC-PKG signaling induces both CXCR2 and BLT1 internalization which was paralleled by increased expression ofthe GPCR kinase, GRK-2. Based on these ndings we inhibition could restore neutrophil migration without impairing NO microbicidal activity. In fact, we found that pharmacological inhibitionof GC activity in an experimental model of sepsis resulted in increasedsurvival, restored neutrophil migration and increased bacterial clear- ance, while inhibition of NO synthesis rendered mice susceptible to infection and increased bacterial counts. Finally we show that GCinhibition increased survival even after the onset of sepsis, suggestingits potential clinical application. Together our results suggest amechanism by which NO interferes with neutrophil chemotaxis and point to GC as a potential therapeutical target in sepsis.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

After weaning, both groups were administered a nor-moproteic diet. Following the isolation of lymphocytes from, foursystems were formed: negative control composed by lymphocytes (C-), positive control added with lipopolysaccharide (C+) and two systems, MSSA and MRSA, stimulated by the strains. Cytokinemeasurements were performed using ELISA kits (Quantikinea m, R&D Systems) from samples collected in the supernatant after cul- tured for 24 h incubation. Statistical analysis were run using Student t test and Mann-Whitney assuming a signicance level of p \\0.05. Results: malnutrition led to the decrease of ponderal growth as well as reduction in the production of IFN- cin the systems C+ (p and MRSA (p =0.002). How- ever, there was no statistic difference concerning the production ofIL-12 in all systems: C+ signicance for the of (p=0.394), MSSA (p MRSA (p =0.124). In addition, none statistically signicant differences were observed among methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant strains for all tested cytokines in all experimental groups.Conclusion: The model of neonatal malnutrition revealed disorders in body mass. Moreover, the production of IFN- cwas also compro- mised. MRSA and MSSA cytokineconcentrations in all groups.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-260 THE ROLE OF CPLA2-ALPHA IN PSEUDOMONASAERUGINOSA-INDUCED LUNG INJURY Y. Wu1,*, D. diseases a), which catalyzes the acid (AA) and its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However, the mechanisms and role of cPLA2a in P.a.-induced lung injury have not been investigated. Here, we investigatedlung inflammation and mortality in mouse models of pulmonary infection by a laboratory (PAK) and a clinical strain (CHA) of P.a. CHA revealed to be more potent than PAK in inducing lunginflammation and animal mortality. cPLA2 a-null mutation attenuated animal mortality caused by both PAK and CHA but failed to reduce lung inflammation or bacterial proliferation. CHA infection led to increased mortality in CF compared to non-CF mice. Pharmacologicalinhibition of cPLA2a attenuated CHA-induced CF mice mortalitywithout interfering with lung inflammation. CHA triggered AA and PGE2 release and cPLA2 aphosphorylation in lung epithelial cell line A549 at higher levels than PAK. This was accompanied by A549 cells. However, inhibition of cPLA2a had partial effect on IL-8secretion. CHA caused LDH release by A549 cells at higher extentthan PAK both of which were reduced by cPLA2a inhibitors. Toge- ther these nding suggest that cPLA2 aplays a role in P.a.-induced lethality in pulmonary infection models including CF. This effectseems to occur via a process related to cPLA2a-induced toxicityindependently from lung inflammation and bacterial proliferation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-261 C5A IS PRODUCED DURING INFLUENZA A INFECTION AND CONTRIBUTES TO NEUTROPHIL RECRUITMENT AND LUNGPATHOLOGY C. C. Garcia1,*, W. Weston-Davies2, R. C. Russo1, L. Tavares1, Rachid3, Belo Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, UK, 5CNRS, Orleans, France Influenza A viruses infect millions of people worldwide causing annual epidemics and pandemics. Potent inflammatory responses are commonly associated with severe cases of Influenza A infection. Complement system is an important mechanism of innate andhumoral responses to infections that is activated during Influenza Ainfection and mediates viral neutralization. C5a is an anaphylatoxin that was reported to be produced in patients infected with the last H1N1 pandemic virus. We hypothesized that C5a contributes to lungpathology following Influenza A infection and that the reduction of C5a levels could decrease inflammation. To address this question C57Bl/6j mice were infected intranasally with 10 4PFU of the mouse adapted Influenza A virus WSN/33 H1N1 or inoculated with PBS(Mock). After 1, 4, 7 and 10 days mice were killed and submitted to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in order to determine C5a levels usingELISA. In another experiment, we used a salivary derived protein from blood-sucking ticks with potent C5a scavenger action\u2014OmCI\u2014 to treat a group of Influenza A infected mice prior to infection anddaily until day 5; another infected group received PBS. After 6 daysof infection mice were killed, BAL performed and lungs collected. We found increased levels of C5a in BAL from the fourth to the 10th day of infection. Treatment with the C5a scavenger protein reducedC5a levels in BAL and also reduced neutrophil inltration to theairways, lung epithelial injury and overall pathology induced by the infection, without affecting viral clearance. This suggests that C5a targeting during Influenza A infection could be a promising approachto reduce excessive inflammatory reactions associated with the severeforms of the flu.

Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, BeloHorizonte, Brazil. Sepsis is the mainly cause of mortality in intensive therapy units. Recently, we demonstrated that severity of the sepsis associates with afailure of neutrophil migration to the infection focus. The eventdepends on CXCR2 desensitization by a mechanism mediates by GRK-2 induction. In the present study, it was CLP ligation and punction) model in TLR9 decient mice (TLR9 -/) mice to determine the role of this receptor on the process. Compared with WT, the TLR9-/-mice submitted to severe CLP did not present failure of neutrophil migration to infection focus, resulting in low bacteria,systemic inflammatory response and high survival rate. Investigatingthe mechanism by which the deciency of TLR9 could prevent the failure of neutrophil migration, it was observed that neutrophils derived from septic TLR9 -/-mice expressed high levels of CXCR2 and reduced GRK2 induction. Therefore, the poor outcome of severesepsis correlates with TLR9 activation in neutrophils which induces CXCR2 desensitization with consequent neutrophil paralysis.

McCoy1 113THERAPEUTICS, INC.,2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA Objective: To reduce inflammation and decrease mortality in murine models of systemic inflammationBackground: Sepsis is a prevalent and life-threatening medical condition characterized by development of a dysregulated inflammatory immune response and associated tissue damage. This dysregulated inflammatoryresponse is initiated by activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in response to bacteria and/or bacterial products such as LPS. We have identied a peptide, P13, derived from the vaccinia virus A52R protein.Pathogens such as viruses produce proteins during the infectious processwhich have been demonstrated to modulate the human immune response. P13 demonstrates potent in vitro cytokine inhibition in response to toll- like receptor signaling.Methods: P13 was tested in two murine models of systemic inflam-mation, both for inhibition of cytokines, and for prevention of mortality. Animals were treated with P13 administered subcutane- ously, followed immediately by administration of LPS, and serumexamined 2 h later for TNF- a. In separate experiments, mice wereinjected i.p. with LPS and 2 and 6 h later treated subcutaneously with P13 or scramble control peptide. The mice were monitored every 3-4 hfor lethality and the experiment was terminated after 96 h. In the second model, mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). At 1.5 h post- CLP, one group of mice was treated i.v. with P13 and a second grouptreated subcutaneously. The control group was left untreated and micemonitored over a 156 h time period for survival. Results: P13 demonstrated signicant inhibition of serum TNF- a (approximately 50%) following LPS injection. In both the LPS andCLP mortality models, P13 improved survival approximately40-50%. Conclusions: P13 reduced cytokines and improved survival in murine models of systemic inflammation. This has implications in treating humansystemic inflammatory diseases.Disclosure of interest: S.

P-266 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS IN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOSPITAL OF DURRES FOR THE PERIOD2000-2005 N. Jani1,* 1Durres Regional Hospital, Durres, Albania Background: The streptococcal infections present one of the greatest problems of the infectious diseases. These are the commonest bac- terial infections in humans. They cause tonsillitis, pyogenic infections, scarlatina, acute rheumatoid arthritis etc.Objectives: epidemiologic features of streptococcalinfections in Durres for 2000-2005. (2) Demographic social description of population being studied. (3) Making evident the determining, eti- ologic factors of diseases in population. (4) Identifying the groups withhigh risk to develop diseases. (5) Dynamic description of the infections according the respective years. Materials and methods: Study was done at Durres hospital for theperiod 2000-2005, was retrospective. Were included 603 patients for6 years, 359 females, 244 males. 393 patients lived in city and 210 patients in rural area. Study was divided in 4 age groups: 19-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years and over 50 years. Population was classi-ed according to profession: workers, ofcials and unemployed. Alldata were taken from registry of the in-patients, in which there included specic examinations and bacteriological assay. Results: Majority of cases were from city 65%, towards 35% fromrural area. 60% of subjects of cases, pharyngitis 35%, 3% were arthritis and nephritis. The most affected groups according to age were: 19-30 years (48%), and 31-40 years (23%). The majority of the cases belonged to the yeargroup 2003-2004, and the minority to the year 2000. Conclusion: Related to our results we concluded that sex plays a role in the epidemiological results. Anginas were the most frequent dis-ease. The greatest number of the patients belonged to the active agegroup, related that to the life style which induces eating outside and making a collective life. So we concluded that age was an important factor in the distribution of the diseases.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res. S171 123P-267 THE EFFECT OF MAJOR INFLAMMATORY BURN INJURY ON IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD T LYMPHOCYTES R. Bakry1, M. Elshazly2,* 1Department of South Cancer Institute, 2Plastic Surgery Department, Assiut University Hospitals, Assiut, Egypt Background: Lymphocytes immunephenotyping is a reflection of the functional level of immune system. It was found that serum soluble b2- microglobulin ( b2 M) may modulate the function of T lymphocytes. Our aim in this work is to determine the activation state of T cells after major burn by detection of CD25 as an early activating marker of T-lymphocytes andHLA-Dr expression as a late one and their relation to b2-microglobulin. Methods: T lymphocytes of 26 major burn patients complicated with infection were analyzed in 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks after burn injury, usingmonoclonal antibodies of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25 and HLA-Dr byflowcytometry and comparing them with those of 26 apparently healthy donors. Serum level of b2 M was also tested using ELISA technique. Results: There was a statistically signicant reduction in CD3 +Tl y m - phocytes (p \\0.000), CD4/CD8 ratio (p =0.01) in the rst 24 h compared to controls. The CD3+cells increase after 2 weeks (p =0.03). HLA-Dr was markedly increased after 2 weeks (p =0.001), while absolute number of CD25+T lymphocytes was lower than controls. The b2 M of patients samples of the study were signicantly higher than that of the controls (P values: \\0.000, \\0.001 and \\0.000 respectively). Signicant negative correlations were detected between mean values ofb2-microglobulin in 24 h and 1 week samples and both values of CD3 and CD4 positive cells. Moreover, there was a signicant negative cor- relation between mean values of b2 M in the 24 h samples and values of CD25 expression.Conclusions: The data obtained suggested persistent activation of Tlymphocytes at 2 weeks after major burn inflammation. HLA-Dr expression can reflect post burn lymphocyte activation. Extensive destruction of tissues by the mechanisms of necrosis may be a basicreason for the increase of b2 M serum level and the signicant reduction in number of activated lymphocytes which explained by negative correlations observed in this study.

Pereira2 1Cellular and Molecular Biology,2Cellular and Molecular Biology, University Of Sao Paulo, FMRP/USP, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil The Nlrc4 inflammasome is triggered in response to contamination of the host cell cytoplasm with bacterial flagellin, which induces pyroptosis, a form of cell death that accounts for restriction of bacterial infections.Although induction of pyroptosis has been extensively investigated in response to Salmonella typhimurium andLegionella pneumophila , little is known regarding the role of the inflammasome for restriction of non-pneumophila Legionella species. Here, we used ve species of the Legionella genus to investigate the importance of the inflammasome forrestriction of bacterial infection in vivo. By infecting mice decient for inflammasome components, we demonstrated that caspase-1 and Nlrc4contribute to restriction of pulmonary infection with L. micdadei ,L. bozemanii, L. gratiana ,a n d L. rubrilucens .Legionella longbeachae ,a non-flagellated bacterium that fails to trigger pyroptosis, was notrestricted by the inflammasome and induced death in the infected mice. Incontrast to L. longbeachae ,fl a g e l l i nm u t a n t so f L. pneumophila did not induce mice death; therefore, besides bypassing the Nlrc4 inflamma- some, L. longbeachae may employ additional virulence strategies to replicate in mammalian hosts. Collectively, our data indicate that theNlrc4 inflammasome plays an important role in host protection against opportunistic pathogenic bacteria that express flagellin.

Fjell1, R. E. Hancock1 1Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Classical (M1) and alternative (M2) polarization of mononuclear cells such as monocyte and macrophages, is known to occur in response to challenges within a micro-environment, like the encounter of a pathogen. Lipopolysaccharide, also known as endotoxin (LPS), is apotent inducer of inflammation and M1 polarization. LPS can alsogenerate an effect in mononuclear cells known as endotoxin tolerance, dened as the reduced capacity of a cell to respond to LPS activation following an initial exposure to this stimulus. Using systems biologyapproaches in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytederived macrophages involving microarrays and advanced bioinfor- matic analysis, we determined that gene responses during endotoxin tolerance were similar to those found during alternative polarization,featuring gene and protein expression critical for the development of key M2 mononuclear cell functions, including reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, expression of genes involved in phago-cytosis as well as tissue remodeling. Moreover, expression ofdifferent metallothionein gene isoforms, known for their role in the control of oxidative stress and in immunomodulation were also found to be consistently up-regulated during endotoxin tolerance. Theseresults demonstrate that after an initial inflammatory stimulus,mononuclear cells undergo an alternative polarization probably to control hyper-inflammation and heal the affected tissue.

Cognasse1,2, major immunomodulatory molecule is soluble CD40L (sCD154) and activated platelets are estimated to produce 95% of the plasma sCD154pool. It has been recently shown in mice that HIV-1 Tat induced acti- vation of platelets resulting in sCD154 release. In this work we investigated platelet activation state and their ability to release sCD154upon stimulation in HIV-1 infected patients under HAART. We notedthat membrane expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P did not differ signicantly between HIV-1 infected-patients and healthy donors (respectively 14.1 \u00b19.2 and 10.9 \u00b12.7%) suggesting that platelets were not activated in HIV patients. However, we evidenced asignicant difference in plasma soluble CD62P (sCD62P) levels between HIV-1 (82.7 \u00b127 ng/ml) and donors (43.9 \u00b120.4 ng/ml) that could result from CD62P shedding from the membrane of activated platelets. Then we examined sCD154 plasmalevels and we noted that they were signicantly higher in HIV-1 patients compared to healthy donors (p \\0.01), i.e. 2.4 \u00b11 and 1 \u00b10.9 ng/ml, respectively. Next, we tested whether thrombin was able to induce therelease of sCD154 by platelets from HIV patients. We observed that platelet isolated from HIV patients respond as well as platelets from healthy donors to thrombin stimulation by releasing comparableamounts of sCD154 (respectively 2.6 \u00b11.5 and 2.3 \u00b11.3 pg/ml for 3910 8platelet) whereas only healthy donor platelets could release a signicant amount of sCD62P upon stimulation (55.4 \u00b124 vs. 25.6 \u00b19.9 ng/ml for 3 9108platelet for HIV patients). This suggests that while activated platelets of HIV patients are not able anymore torelease sCD62P, they remain able to release sCD154 and could therefore boost an inflammatory response in case of treatment failure.

Leoveanu1 1National Institute of Infectious Diseases M Bals,2University of Medicine and Pharmacy Carol Davila, Bucharest, Romania Objective: Biomarkers of inflammation are related to cardiovascular- diseases, insulin resistance and premature aging. Our aim is to eval- uate the level of inflammatory biomarkers in young adult HIVseropositive patients with undetectable viral load under antiretroviraltherapy. In Romania, HIV-infected population is made mainly of young adults, parenterally infected in their childhood, before 1990 and multiexperienced afterwards.Methods: We present the preliminary results of an ongoing prospectiveRomanian research grant (PNCDI2 no.62077/2008) on HIV infected patients undergoing HAART, recruited in a tertiary care hospital, dur- ing 12 months. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF chemotactic protein 1 (hsPCR) were monitored every 6 months. Results: Our study included 106 patients, characterized by: M:F ratio 1.3; median age of 31 years, mode age of 20 years; median CD4 cellcount 492/mmc (IQ 334;738). Subjects with undetectable values TNF 0.6;4.6), respectively. There was no impor-tant difference of median values of these markers between the patients with undetectable HIV viral load and those with detectable viremia. Even though the majority of patients had levels within the normalrange, we found signicant increases of TNF alpha, IL-6, MCP-1 between the rst 2 follow up visits.Conclusions: Despite controlling HIV replication, it seems that levels of inflammatory markers are slightly increasing in our HIV seropos- itive young adults. Except for antiretroviral therapy, specic anti-inflammatory medication might improve the inflammatory status ofthese patients in order to prevent cardio-vascular and metabolic dis- eases at early age or premature aging.

Pinheiro1,2, L. Yusen3, C. Libert1,2 1Department for Molecular Biomedical Research, VIB,2Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology,Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, 3Pediatrics, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, USA The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase (MKP) family of proteins plays an important role in regulating inflammation by inactivating MAP kinases. MKP-1/DUSP-1 is a nuclear, dual specicity to dephosphorylate MAP kinases. Weare interested in TNF-induced systemic inflammation, because webelieve that a tight control of this inflammation might increase the therapeutic value of TNF in cancer therapy. Since glucocorticoids protect very well against TNF-induced inflammation, and since MKP-1 is strongly induced by glucocorticoids, we hypothesize that MKP-1 can also regulate TNF-induced inflammation. In general, our results demonstrate that MKP-1% mice are more sensitive to TNF-inducedinflammation in the liver, and show high levels of apoptosis inintestinal cells. These results can be mechanistically explained by a prolonged JNK activation and consequently stronger induction of AP- 1 dependent genes and induction of apoptosis. To go deeper into themechanism behind this sensitivity, the sensitivity of JNK1% andJNK2% mice to the in vivo effects of TNF was studied. In contrast to JNK1%, JNK2% mice are protected against TNF-induced lethal shock. Furthermore, the sensitivity of MKP-1% mice could bereversed by knocking-down JNK2, since double knock-out MKP-1/ JNK2% mice showed enhanced resistance to TNF. Disclosure interest: None declared. P-273 CIRCULATING COX-DERIVED EICOSANOID(S) INHIBITS MACROPHAGE FUNCTION IN MICE AND HUMANSWITH LIVER DISEASE A. O'Brien1,*, K. Massey2, 1Medicine, UCL, London,2Bradford School of Pharmacy, University Of Bradford, Bradford, UK Introduction: We hypothesised that a circulating plasma factor caused leukocyte immunoparesis in liver cirrhosis.Methods: Mice peritoneal macrophages were cultured in media sup- plemented experiments were performed on human monocyte-derived macrophagestreated with LPS in media supplemented with 25% plasma from healthy volunteers or inpatients with advanced liver cirrhosis. ESI/LC-MS/MS lipidomic plasma analysis plasmareduced LPS-induced TNF- aproduction, which was completely reversed by Indomethacin, with no effect of naive plasma (p\\0.01). Lipidomics media with healthy volunteers' plasma (n =8) compared to culture media alone (p \\0.001). In contrast TNF- a secretion from macrophages co-incubated profound immune suppressionobserved with 4/10 of the cirrhosis samples. The immune suppressive effect was partially reversed by the PGE2/D2 receptor antagonist (p \\0.05) with trends in PGE2/12HETE. Conclusion: This is the rst description of immune inhibitory prop-erties of COX-1/2 derived lipids within BDL mice and cirrhosispatients'. Whilst immune suppressive properties of PGE2 have been previously demonstrated, PGF2 amay have an unexpected role. Acknowledgments: Wellcome Trust.Disclosure of interest: None declared. Environment and inflammation P-275 DENDRITIC CELLS ACTIVATED BY THEPARTICULATE MATTER ROFA EXACERBATE THE PULMONARY ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION F. M. Arantes-Costa1,*, L. Z. Grund1, C. Lima1 1Immunoregulation Unit, Special Laboratory of Applied Toxinology, Butantan Institute, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Background: Studies suggest that pollutants are important cofactors in the development and exacerbation of lung diseases. Dendritic cells(DC) are crucial in regulating immune responses and play an important role in both the induction and maintenance of asthma. However, the mechanism of action of DC on the exacerbation of lunginflammation induced by particulate matter is unclear. Objectives: We evaluated in vivo the role of residual oil fly ash (ROFA) in the exacerbation of inflammation in a murine model of asthma and inin vitro assay the effect of ROFA in the maturation of BMDC inresponse to allergen (OVA); and using a cell transfer assay the capacity of ROFA-pulsed BMDC to modulate the allergic inflammation. Methods and Results: In vivo: We evaluated in lung, lymph nodes andspleen of the OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice challenged with CD40 in CD11b+F4/ 80+macrophages. ROFA exposition exacerbated lung inflammation induced by OVA, increasing eosinophilia and goblet cells as well a decreasing the number of Treg, IFN-g+and IL-5+T lymphocytes in lung tissue. number of mDC,IFN-g +and IL-5+T lymphocytes and activated macrophages. Using an adoptive transfer model, we also showed that ROFA-pulsedBMDC transferred to allergic mice after challenge exacerbated eosinophilic airway inflammation. In vitro: BMDC were pulsed withOVA and/or ROFA. The pollutant by itself induces the maturation of BMDC increasing the expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of cytokines and MMPs. The activated status of BMDCinduced by OVA was sustained after ROFA stimulation.Conclusion: ROFA promotes the maturation of mDC, which lead to an enhanced effector Th2 cell activation that could be one of the mechanisms of pollutant-enhanced allergic inflammation.Support: FAPESP and CNPqDisclosure of interest: None declared. P-276 SIGNALING THROUGH TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORSENHANCES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ASTHMA IN MICE EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANT DURING NEONATAL PERIOD K. T. Dos Santos1,*, J. Florenzano1, J. P. S. Peron2, E. E. A. Baptista1,N .O .S .C a mara2, M. N. Muscara \u00b41, S. K. P. Costa1 1Pharmacology,2Imunology, University of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Objective: Neonatal mice exposure to ambient pollutant 1,2-naph- thoquinone (1,2-NQ) enhances animal susceptibility to inflammationat adulthood. Since Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals function as crucial sentinels of infectious and non-infectious antigens throughout the respiratory tract, this study was undertaken to examineTLRs as a potential signaling pathway of this response.Methods: Under approval of USP Animal Ethics Committee, TLR4 -/-and MyD88-/-knockout (KO) neonate mice and their wild type (WT) were exposed three times via nebulization to 1,2-NQ or itsvehicle. Eight weeks later, and challengedwith ovalbumin (OVA). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed and samples collected 24 h after the last challenge. Eosin- ophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bone marrow (BM),cytokines in BAL, IgE in serum and mRNA expression of TLRs and adaptors molecules in lung were measured. Results are mean \u00b1SEM forn=6 animals. Stats were by ANOVA plus Bonferroni's test. Results: Increased number of eosinophils was seen in BAL and BM ofWT mice exposed to 1,2-NQ and OVA compared to allergic WT mice exposed to vehicle. The lung mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR7 or TRIF molecules was higher in WT mice exposed to 1,2-NQ,with or without OVA, compared to WT mice exposed to vehicle.TLR4 -/-and MyD88-/-KO mice exposed to 1,2-NQ and OVA exhibited a signicant decrease in BHR, cytokines concentration (but not IgE) and eosinophils counts in BAL (2.5 \u00b10.5 and 1 \u00b10.19104 cells/BAL) compared to TLR4-/-and MyD88-/-KO mice exposed to vehicle and OVA (39 \u00b18 and 9 \u00b119104cells/BAL, respectively). Conclusion: TLRs may serve as a signal transduction pathwayincreasing susceptibility to allergic response in mice exposed to ambient pollutant during neonatal period. This might be one mech- anism that contributes to common pulmonary illnesses in childrenliving heavy trafc areas.Acknowledgments: FAPESP, CAPES declared.S174 Inflamm. 123P-277 OF Due to their unique physico-chemical characteristics, nanoparticles (NPs) are now one of the leading technologies. As a non-metal oxide, silica (SiO 2) NPs have found extensive applications in industry and biomedicine, hence leading to possible occupational, medical and/orenvironmental exposures. Aiming at evaluating their toxicologicalimpact, we asked the question of SiO 2NPs acting as immune adjuvants. Experiments were carried out on dendritic cells (DCs) which immuno- logical role is to initiate an adaptative immune response whenantigens and' 'danger signals' ' are concomitantly present within their surroundingenvironment. Under these conditions, DCs undergo a maturation process leading to phenotypical modications. We therefore investigated whether SiO 2NPs may alter this process. Primary cultures of both human cyte derived DCs (MoDCs) to 100 nm SiO 2particles. Particle size and zeta potential were characterized using photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and ze-tametry, respectively. After 24 h, NPs internalization, cell viability andmarkers of cell maturation were studied. Using fluorescent NPs, micro- scopic observations revealed that NPs were found within the DCs after 24 h of exposure. Cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that both DCs typesshowed about 20% cell death after 24 h of exposure to 100 lg/mL SiO 2 NPs. Phenotypic analyses, carried out at this subtoxic concentration, showed that both MoDCs and BMDCs undergo a maturation process after SiO 2NPs exposure as evidenced by signicant upregulation of maturation markers at their surface (CD40, CD86, and CCR7 or CD83) as suggest that SiO 2NPs may have an impact on the immune system function through the maturation of MoDCs and BMDCs. Furtherexperiments will be dedicated to the understanding of signaling pathways involved in such a maturation process. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-278 EARLY-LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO POLLUTANT INDUCES DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITYTO LUNG INFLAMMATION IN C57BL/6 MOUSE GENDER J. Florenzano1,*, K. T. Santos1, S. A. Teixeira1, M. A. A. Barreto1, M. N. Muscara \u00b41, S. K. P. Costa1 1Pharmacology, University Of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Objective: Whereas prior to puberty cases of asthma is higher in boys than girls, post puberty there are similar numbers in both genders.Moreover, it is known that children living close to high density trafc areas have enhanced susceptibility to respiratory diseases. The pur- pose of this study was to evaluate whether early-lifetime exposure to1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), a diesel exhaust contaminant, induces differential lung inflammation in juvenile male and female mice.Methods: Under approval of USP Animal Ethics Committee, neonate mice were exposed three times via nebulization to 1,2-NQ or itsvehicle. Sixteen days later, animals were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed and samples collected 24 h after the last challenge. Leuko-cytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bone marrow (BM) orcytokines in BAL were measured. Results are mean \u00b1SEM for nanimals. Stats were by ANOVA plus Bonferroni's test. Results: The OVA response in prior exposed 1,2-NQ male miceinduced a signicant increase of leukocytes, characterized by in BAL (71 \u00b118910 4cells/BAL) and BM (38\u00b139106cells/BM) compared to BAL (19 \u00b149104cells/ BAL) and BM (14 \u00b129106cells/BM) of female groups. In the BAL male group, the Th1/Th2 cytokine concentration wassignicantly higher compared to the female group, but the BHR was similar in both groups prior to exposure to 1,2-NQ. Conclusion: Our results show, for the rst time, that upon neonatalexposure of male and female mice to 1,2-NQ pollutant, the allergic response to OVA during puberty was still greater in male mice compared to female, thus suggesting that males are at greater risk thanfemales. This may be related to increased differences of cytokineconcentration in males compared to females. Acknowledgments: Fapesp, CNPq and CAPES for nancial support.

P-279 EFFECTS OF CARBON NANOTUBES ON CYTOKINE SECRETION BY PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS FROM HEALTHY SUBJECTS AND ALLERGICPATIENTS G. Laverny1, A. Strasbourg, nanotubes (CNT) are promising engineered nanomaterials. However, nanosized particles are likely to exhibit pro-inflammatory activity and increase immune response to allergens. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of CNT on the secretion ofcytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) fromhealthy subjects or mite-allergic patients. Freshly prepared PBMC, stimulated receptor adaptative (miteallergen extract) stimulus were cultured for 48, 72 h or 5 days, respectively, in the presence or absence of multi-walled CNT (0-100 lg/mL). The cytokine not altered by CNT in PBMC from both healthy subjects or allergic patients. In PBMC from healthy subjects, secretion of TNF- a, lipopolysaccharide in a dose-dependent manner by the nanomaterials. Signicant increases in the release of these cytokines were also observed in PBMC from healthy subjects stimulated with a TLR-2 orTLR-3 agonist, suggesting a pro-inflammatory activity patients, CNT 123IL-5 production, although they increased asecretion evoked by LPS. However, IL-2 and IFN- csecretion induced by PHA in PBMC from both healthy and allergic subjects was increased by the presence of CNT. These data demonstrate that multi-walled CNT interfere differently with innate and adaptative immune responses in humanPBMC and suggest differences in sensitivity to multi-walled CNTamong cells of the immune system.

The toxicity of invivo HQ exposure on neutrophil mobilization into the E. coli lipo- polysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed lung was investigated. Methods: Male Swiss mice were exposed to aerosolized vehicle(control) or 12.5, 25 or 50 ppm HQ (1 h/day/5 days). One hour afterlast exposures, animals inhaled LPS (0.1 mg/ml/10 min). Three hours later, number of circulating leukocytes and in the bronchoalveolar lavage were quantied Neubauer molecules circulating neutrophil and lungmicrovessels quantied by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively; myeloperoxidase activity was measured in the pulmonary tissue by colorimetry; cyto-kines in the BALF were determined by by flow levels were measured by high performanceliquid chromatography.Results: In vivo HQ exposure increased plasma MDA levels and oxidative burst in circulating neutrophils, and reduced LPS-induced neutrophil migration into the BALF, as these cells were maintained inthe pulmonary tissue. The reduced number of cells in the BALF wasnot dependent on alterations on circulating leukocytes in the BALF and lung but elevated which not further enhanced by fMLP in vitro stimulation. Conclusions: Low levels of HQ exposures affect circulating neutro-phils, which may contribute to the impaired host defense during intoxications.

G. Kazantseva1,*, Of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand Aims: To assess the effect of smoking and the HLA-DR shared epi- tope (SE) copy number on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation and the expression of inflammation-related genes in rheu- matoid synovium. To consider the effects of the polycyclic benzo( a)pyrene (B aP), in human U937 cells. Methods: Synovial membrane tissues were obtained at joint replacement surgery from patients fullling ACR criteria for RA. Patient smokingstatus was established retrospectively. Patients were typed for synovial tissue was assessed using qRT-PCR. U937 cells were treated with phorbol12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and/or B aP. Western blotting was used to assess AHR knockdown by AHR-targeted siRNA. Statistics utilised variance of ANOVA regression analysis.Results: Smoking responsible for AHR activation in synovia ''reported'' by signicantly increased expression of both AHRR ( P\\0.01) genes. Although not signicant, there was a trend towards more IL17A expression in synovia fromnon-smoking RA patients ( P=0.06) with double copies of the SE (P=0.08). Synovial MMP9 expression was affected by both smoking ( SE copy number ( P=0.007). In vitro, PMA-activated U937 cells responded to B aP treatment with increased expression of AHR and MMP9 genes. AHR knock-down through RNA interference reduced MMP9 expression consistent with a role for AHR in transcriptional regulation of this gene.Conclusions: Smoking impacts directly on joint synovial tissue in RA. MMP9 is the rst identied gene that is influenced by the combined effect of smoking and the SE copy number in RA. PAHs, such as B aP have a role in regulating MMP9 gene expression in U937 cells. Thedata suggest reciprocal and synergistic roles for smoking and the SE in rheumatoid inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-282 DOUBLE WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES INDUCE IL-1 BSECRETION IN HUMAN THROUGH use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), public concern about their potential risk to human health has also risen. Although recentstudies showed the in vitro and in vivo pro-inflammatory potential ofCNTs, the inflammatory signaling pathways triggered by these particles in human monocytes remain unknown. Here, we showed that CNTs- free LPS did not induce synthesis and secretion of TNF a, IL-1band IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines donors. However, CNTs increased IL-1 bsecretion in a dose dependent manner when monocytes were primed with LPS Toll-like receptors ligands. Moreover, we demonstrated that CNTs-increased IL-1bsecretion was specically caspase-1 dependent. Furthermore, by a siRNA approach targeting Nrlp3 receptor in human monocytes, we highlighted a decrease of IL-1 bsecretion in response to CNTs. Alto- gether these data demonstrate for the rst time the involvement of theNlrp3 inflammasome pathway in the pro-inflammatory effect of CNTs. Then, we explored the signaling pathway leading to the Nlrp3 inflam- masome activation in response to CNTs. We showed that CNTs-induced IL-1 bsecretion was dependent on potassium efflux.

Ben-Othman2, Tunisia,3Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Athens, Athens, Greece Species of the red algae genus Laurencia elaborate an astonishing variety of structurally unusual secondary metabolites frequently presenting anti-inflammatory properties. From Laurencia grandulifera, we have isolated and characterised, by means of spectral data analysesneorogiotriol, a new tricyclic brominated diterpene. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of this compound.Methods: The anti-inflammatory effect of Neorogiotriol was evalu- ated both in vivo using carrageenan-injected rats in the paw and in vitro on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 macrophagesstably transfected Results: in vivo study demonstrated that intra-peritoneal injection of neorogiotriol (1 mg/kg) resulted in the signicant reduction ofcarregeenan-induced rat oedema in the paw. In vitro, our resultsshowed that neorogiotriol treatment decreased the luciferase activity in LPS- cells. Further study indicated that this compound also signicantly inhibited therelease of nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that neorogiotriol could play asignicant role in the inhibition of inflammatory processes.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-284 ACTIVATION OF G-PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR 43 BY SHORT CHAIN FATTY ACIDS REGULATES INFLAMMATION ON ACUTE GOUT:ROLE OF DIET AND COMMENSAL MICROBIOTA A. T. Vieira1,2,*, E. De Leon2, D. Shim2, Schilter2, K. Maslowski2, Melbourne, Australia acids (SCFAs) are produced by bacterial fermen- tation of dietary ber and bind to GPR43 modulating inflammatoryresponses. Gout is an inflammatory disease characterized by release of uric acid crystals into the joint cavity and neutrophil inltration that leads to tissue damage. Our aims are understand the mechanismof SCFAs as well as, the role of GPR43 in gout. Treatment withSCFA protected mice from injury by intra-articular injection of Monossodium Uric Acid crystal showing that GPR43ko mice presented reduction in inflammatory parameters after gout induction due deciency on recruitment of cells, when compared to MSU-injected WT mice. Germ-free mice, which noexpress SCFAs, showed similar ' 'hiporresponsive' ' and inhibited recruitment of cells. However if we treated GF with acetate before challenged with MSU, this ' 'phenotype' ' was reversed. Thus, microbiota-induced SCFA and GPR43 activation are necessary for proper neutrophilrecruitment. However, SCFA treatment during an established inflam- matory response promoted resolution of the inflammation. We suggest that endogenous microbiota shapes the host's ability to respond toinflammatory stimuli. The presence of SCFAs provides a link betweendiet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism and inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-285 EVALUATION OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH NATURAL PRODUCTIN CUTANEOUS WOUND HEALING: THE USE OF CAPYBARA OIL P. C.

Res. S177 123In the interaction culture and nature is remarkable use of wildlife for medicinal purposes in different human societies. The oil extractedfrom subcutaneous fat of capybaras ( Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris ) has certain properties that help in curing respiratory diseases, arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, and also acts as a powerful healing for externalwound (although not proven in clinical and experimental research).The aim of this work is assess cutaneous wound healing in Swiss mice with the topical application of capybara oil. Forty-two Swiss mice, male, adults were allocated into two groups (N =42): capybara oil group (N =21, divided into three subgroups with N =7) oil treated; and control group (N =21, divided into three subgroups with N =7) who received no treatment. The daily application of oil was about standardized circular wound of 0.6 mm diameter on the dorsum ofeach animal. At days proposed (7, 14 e 21 days after injury), micewere deeply anesthetized with Thiopental; were then xed to the surgical table to collect morphological data and surgical specimens. Wound excised with 1 cm margin of healthy skin around the lesion,deep to the fascia muscle, were xed and prepared accordingly the histological routine to be analyzed on light microscopy. Statistical analyses were realized (ANOVA test, p \\0.0001). In Swiss mice, 7 days after wounding, the capybara oil group presented a thickerneoepidermis than control group. In all groups mast cells were present, but the capybara oil group showed a higher amount of mast cells than the control group in 7 days after wounding. Wound con-traction was evaluated showed a progressive reduction in wound areaduring the experiment, but 7 days after injury, the wound area was less in the capybara oil group. The capybara oil seems to exert a benecial effect on the cutaneous wound healing.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Paulo, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Evaluation of the respiratory burst induced by receptors Fc cR (for the Fc portion of IgG) and CR (for complement) was carried out inrheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients presenting the active disease or not. Simultaneously, the cooperation between these receptors and their expression, the chemotaxis of peripheral blood neutrophils, and thesystemic activity of the complement system were also investigated.Neutrophils were stimulated with IC-IgG (immune complex of IgG) opsonized with normal human serum (NHS) or not, or opsonized with RA serum (RAHS). ROS (reactive oxygenspecies) production by RA neutrophils of patients with active orinactive disease responded to IC-IgG opsonized with NHS. However, these neutrophils presented poor Fc cR/CR cooperation, as indi- cated by decreased ROS production upon stimulation with IC-IgGopsonized with RASH. Neutrophils of active RA patients presentedsignicantly augmented CR1 and CR3 expression, as well as slight elevation in Fc cRII and Fc cRIII expression. Only patients with active disease exhibited positive correlations between Fc cR and CR. The complement alternative pathway was activated and the chemotaxic activity of RA serum was increased only in the case of patients withactive disease. Taken together, these results indicate that severalabnormalities of the complement system exist at the systemic level, as reflected by the neutrophil function, particularly in RA patients with active disease. Namely, these abnormalities are impaired membranereceptor cooperation, activation of the alternative pathway, andpresence of pre-existing chemoattractant factors in the serum, which together may contribute to RA pathogenesis.

P-287 MODELING HUMAN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN NHP: TYPE II COLLAGEN IN 1PharmaLegacy Laboratories, Shanghai, China,2Bolder BioPATH, Inc., Boulder, USA Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rodent models have been extensively used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research. An RA model in non-humanprimate (NHP) is particularly demanded because of the close phylo-genesis that provides the cross-reactivity to human for different development compounds using most modern drug technologies. How- ever, NHP RA model has been reported extremely difcult because ofthe low and inconsistent disease incidence. We studied type II collagen induced arthritis in Cynomolgus monkeys. Following immunization with collagen, the disease progression was monitored for 8 weeks.Overall the arthritic incidence reached 87% and the average arthriticincidence of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint reached near 90%, signicantly higher than what was previously reported. The average swelling of PIP joint increased approximately by 45%. Radiography,histopathology and histomorphometry analysis of the joint bones wellsupported the arthritic disease with the similar characteristics of human RA joints. The average arthritic score was signicantly reduced with the single agent treatment of methotrexate or dexamethasone. Our resultsdemonstrated the successful establishment of an reliable CIA in Cyno- molgus monkeys, providing a valuable tool for studies of RA disease in pathogenesis, biomarker, translational research, and most importantly,anti-arthritic therapeutics as well as other relevant diseases, such asanemia of chronic disease and arthritic pain.

Res. 123angiogenesis; however, its role in tumor immunity of host remains unclear. In this study, we investigated effect of MIF on tumor pro-gression and generation of tumor regulatory T cells (Treg). The results showed that tumor growth rate was signicantly lower in MIF knockout (KO) mice than in wild type (WT) mice when syngenic colon cancercells (CT26 cells) were injected. The inltration of CD4 (+) and CD8(+) T cells in tumor mass was signicantly higher in MIF KO mice than in WT mice. Flow cytometric analysis of both spleen and tumor cells revealed that MIF KO mice had signicant lower levels of tumor-associated Treg than WT mice. In parallel, the expression of GITR andCTLA-4 was also reduced in MIF KO mice. Interestingly, there were three cases of tumor rejection among twenty MIF KO mice, but not in WT mice. The number of CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells in these micewith rejection was further increased as comparable to tumor-na \u00a8ve mice. Moreover, the frequency of Treg was much lower in spleen of tumor-rejected mice than in those of tumor-bearing MIF KO mice. In contrast, when induced by anti-CD3 + IL-2 + TGF-b, the number ofthe Treg in the spleen was signicantly higher in MIF KO mice than in WT mice, suggesting that these stimuli may be associated with the decreased Treg in MIF KO mice. As expected, MIF KO mice showedsignicant lower levels of IL-2 production by spleen cells stimulatedwith anti-CD3 than WT mice. In the mean time, both IFNg production by spleen cells and the frequency of CD8 (+) and IFNg (+) cells were not different between the two groups. Taken together, our data suggest thatMIF promotes tumor growth in mice by increasing tumor Treg throughthe regulation of IL-2 production. Thus, anti-MIF treatment might be useful to enhance adaptive immunity of host to colon cancers. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-289 LONG-TERM ANTIBODY PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF LONG-LIVEDANTIBODY-SECRETING CELLS (ASC) ARE SUSTAINED BY TWO DISTINCT SUBTYPES OF MEMORY CD4 + T CELLS L. Z. Grund1,*, E. N. Komegae1, M. Lopes-Ferreira1, C. Lima1 1Immunoregulation Unit, Laboratory of Applied Toxinology/ Department of Immunology, Butantan Institute/ICB, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Introduction: The rising awareness of the importance of long-lived antibody-secreting cells (ASC) for the maintenance of protective andautoimmune humoral memory generates research efforts to gain moreinsight into the biology, migratory behavior and mainly survival mechanisms. We previously demonstrated that Thalassophryne nat- tereri sh venom induces a humoral memory immune response in mice with the differentiation of ASC B220 negdependent on IL-5 and IL-17A secreted by T cells. However, how and when CD4+ T cells participate of the generation of ASC still not understood.Objective: Evaluate the importance of effector/memory CD4+ T cellsin the maintenance of ASC. Methods and Results: To investigate the phenotypic features of effector/ memory T cells, BALB/c mice were immunized three times with 10 mgof venom in alum and killed at days 15, 49 and 121. Our results show anearly formation of effector CD4 + T cells in the peritoneum and bone- marrow (BM) and memory CD4 + CD44 + T cells expressing bothCD40L and Ly6C in spleen and peritoneum and expressing Ly6C only in BM. In the memory phase, the effector CD4 + T cells migrate to spleenand the CD4 + CD44 + CD40L + Ly6C + memory T cells exit from the spleen remaining in the peritoneum. Bone-marrow is the appropriated niche for CD4 + CD44 +Ly6C + central memory T cells. To conrm the importance of memoryCD4 T cells in memory Ab production, adoptive transfer of memory cells from spleen and BM was conducted. Bone-marrow cells from long- lasting venom immunized mice, but not control or splenic cells, inducedhigh and persistent levels (80 days after transfer) of specic antibodyproduction (IgG1 and IgG2a) in na \u00a8ve impaired in CD4 or CD28 KOrecipients. Conclusions: Thus, in the memory phase of immunity, centralmemory helper T cells are maintained in BM as resting but rapidlyexpressed CD40L and efciently induced the production of high- afnity by B lymphocytes. Support: Research Laboratory, Benesis Corporation, Osaka, Japan Many autoimmune diseases (ADs) are characterized by the produc- tion of autoantibodies (autoAbs) specic for self-antigens. mechanism for the pathogenesis of autoimmunity isunknown. On the other hand, Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg)exhibits therapeutic effects in the treatment of variety of ADs in clinical practice, while the precise mechanisms have also been left unclear. Innate B cells or B-1 cells, which produce mainly naturalantibodies including weakly autoreactive antibodies, have a distinct lineage different from conventional B cells or (B-2 cells). Recently, B-1 cells are shown to play a role in development of ADs when theyare activated, and the class-switch is induced upon stimulation of theirtoll-like receptor (TLR)9 with unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide. Here we show that IVIg treatment in mice injected with CpG inhibits the proliferation and activation of B-1 cells. Upon stimulation of B-1cells with CpG in vitro, IVIg attenuated the autoantibody productionas well as the IL-10 production that is necessary to induce CSR, while it did not reduced the IL-6 production. The inhibitory effect of IVIg was dependent on the F(ab 0)2but independent on the Fc. In addition, IVIg upregulated the expression of CD22, a B cell inhibitory receptor, on B-1 cells. However, IVIg treatment exhibited a comparable inhibitory effect on B-1 cells from wild-type and CD22-knockoutmouse. Inspections of IVIg-induced modulation such as phosphorylation and ERK, but not IRAK-1 and p38 MAPK. We propose a novel inhibitorymechanism of IVIg in ADs, in which IVIg inhibits TLR9 signalingthat leads to production of autoreactive antibody in a F(ab 0)2-depen- dent manner.

Aharoni1,*, eilam2, A. Stock1, Arnon1 1Immunology,2The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel The roles of inflammatory versus neurodegenerative processes in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in its animal model exper-imental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are controversial. Novel treatment strategies aim to act within the CNS to reduce inflammation and induce neuroprotection and repair processes. In thisstudy we analyzed and compared the in situ pathological manifesta-tions of relapsing-remitting PLP- and chronic MOG- induced EAE models, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immu- nohistochemistry. The effect of immunomodulatory treatment byglatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) on myelin damage/repair and on motor neuron loss/preservation was studied in both models. TEM analysis revealed multiple spinal white matter damages, demyelina-tion, axonal degeneration and axonal loss, with different occurrencein the two EAE models. Hence, in the relapsing-remitting model most of the axons manifested myelin aberration, whereas in the chronic model axonal degeneration was more widespread. Remyelinatingbers with thin compact myelin sheathes were detected mainly in thePLP model and their number increased with time. Loss of motor neurons was manifested only in the chronic model. In GA-treated mice, smaller lesions and higher amounts of normal appearing axonswere found, with preservation of motor neuron number and formation.Furthermore, for each time point, signicantly more remyelinating bers were counted, three to sevenfold elevations from untreated mice. These effects were obtained even when GA-treatment wasapplied in a therapeutic schedule after the appearance of clinical symptoms. In conclusion, demyelination and remyelination are characteristic to relapsing-remitting PLP-induced EAE thechronic MOG-induced model axonal degeneration and somatic neu-ronal pathology are mainly manifested. The remyelination and neuronal preservation induced by GA are in support of neuroprotec- tive consequences of immunomodulatory treatment in these modelsDisclosure of R.

Heat shock proteins areevolutionary conserved proteins that maintain the cellular integrity and are possible targets for regulatory T cells. Objective: To investigate the immunological effects of Lactococcus lactis that secretes Hsp65 from Mycobacterium leprae in EAE model. Methods: Animals received for four days continuous feeding of either Hsp65-producing L. lactis (Hsp65), wild type (WT) L. lactis or water (control). Seven days after the last feeding, EAE was induced inC57BL/6 mice by subcutaneous injection of CFA, MOG 35-55 in the base of the tail and pertussis toxin i.p. Results: Prophylactic treatment of mice with Hsp65, but neither with WT nor water, prevented the induction of EAE regarding the clinicalscores. Such effect was followed by decreased frequencies of earlyactivated CD4 +CD69+T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, and late activated T lymphocytes CD4+CD44+in lymph nodes mesenteric and inguinal, as well as in the spleen. Moreover, frequencies of Treg cellswere higher in Hsp65 than in WT or water-treated mice. Conclusion: Hsp65 L. lactis was effective in preventing EAE in mice through increase of Treg cells. Nevertheless, the mechanismsinvolved in such regulation need to be elucidated.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-294 INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES Pediatrics, Max McGee Center for Juvenile Diabetes, Wisconsin, USA Inflammatory cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of differ- ent autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease in humans as well as in animal models. IL-21, and IL-15 are pro-inflammatory cytokines and theyexert their biological effects at various stages of the immuneresponses. We have shown previously that IL-21 can synergize with IL-15 or IL-7 to reduce the threshold of TCR signaling, while simultaneously increasing the production of effector cytokines such asTNFaand IFN c. IL-21 maps to one of the shared autoimmune disease susceptibility loci in humans and mice. In non obese diabetic (NOD) mouse that develops spontaneous autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), IL-21 is a candidate gene in the Idd3 locus. C57BL/6 derived Idd3allele protects NOD mouse from T1D. As IL-2 also maps to the same locus, the relative contribution of IL-2 and IL-21 to the disease pro- cess is not well understood. It has been shown previously that NODmouse lacking the receptor for IL-21 does not develop autoimmunediabetes. Here we report that the absence of IL-21 protects the 8.3 TCR transgenic NOD mice from diabetes. Similarly we observed that NOD mice that lack the expression of IL-15 show reduced incidenceof type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that IL-21 and IL-15 may beimplicated at different stages of disease development in the NOD mouse model. Disclosure of interest: None declared.S180 Inflamm.

David1,*, Objective: To identify a relationship between existing TPOAb among pregnant woman and its relation with their outcome of pregnancy, morbidity of autoimmune thyroiditis, to justify screening ,when would be the best time for doing it.Materials and methods: The study included 120 pregnant, romanianwomen, ages 18-40. We used one-time screening TPOAb, one-time screening TSH and FT4. We performed also a cost-effectiveness analysis of the screening. When probabilities were not available, wewere estimated using expert clinical judgment.Results: At initial presentation all the women were euthyroid. 10.83% had positive TPOAb level. The complications were found to be more signicantly raised among positive TPOAb cases. It seems that auto-immune disease can increase the risk of reproductive failure. The administration of L-T4 prevent the risk for developing hypothyroidism during gestation and reduces pregnancy loss and preterm delivery.Conclusions: The prevalence rate for thyroid autoimmunity in youngwomen seems high enough to justify the screening. Screening only high-risk women, however, would fail to diagnose woman with thy- roid disease. Screening pregnant women with TFTs in the rsttrimester of pregnancy is cost-saving compared with no screening,while screening using TPO-Ab is an economically favorable screen- ing strategy.

Wagner1 1Resverlogix Corp., Calgary, Canada,2Hooke Laboratories Inc., Lawrence, USA We have discovered a representative of a novel chemical scaffold (RVX-297) that prevents and treats established autoimmune disease. In vitro, RVX-297 inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 expression in humanU937 receptor concen- trations of IL-6 compared to the vehicle-treated controls, 4 h after5lg of LPS injection. RVX-297 was further evaluated in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is known to be dependent on IL-6 and IL-17, to determine its potential to modulate autoimmune disease invivo. EAE was induced in B6 mice via immunization with MOG 35-55and pertussis toxin injection. Oral administration of RVX-297 fromthe time of immunization prevented EAE development dose-depen-dently from 75 to 150 mg/kg b.i.d. Therapeutic administration of RVX-297 from the time of disease onset greatly reduced clinical signs of EAE dose dependently from 75 to 125 mg/kg b.i.d dose. Theefcacy of RVX-297 treatment when administered to mice eitherprophylactically or therapeutically was comparable or superior to the S1P 1agonist, FTY720. Further analysis of spleen and lymph node culture supernatants from mice immunized with MOG 35-55 and treated with RVX-297 found greatly reduced ex vivo antigen-inducedproduction of IL-6, IFN- c, TNF and IL-17A protein (70, 99, 80 and 80% respectively) compared to the vehicle-treated controls. Gene expression analysis of ex vivo cultures demonstrated up to 90%inhibition of IL-17, IFN- c, IL-1b, IL-21 and IL-4 mRNA. cumulative results suggest that RVX-297 inhibits Th1 and Th17 responses which are believed to play a critical role in the development and pathology of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, compounds fromthis scaffold represent potential novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including MS. Disclosure of interest: R.

To test antigen cross- presentation, CD11c+DCs were incubated with OVA followed by co- cultured with DO11.10 CD8+T, and expression of CD69 on DO11.10 CD8+T was examined, using chloroquine as inhibitor. Results: Repeated immunization with antigen causes systemic auto- immunity in mice otherwise not prone to spontaneous autoimmunediseases. Overstimulation of CD4 +T cells led to the development of autoantibody-inducing CD4+T(aiCD4+T) cell which had undergone TCRabut not TCR brevision and was capable of inducing autoanti- bodies. aiCD4+T cell was induced by de novo TCR revision but not by mere cross-reaction to antigen, and subsequently overstimulated CD8+T cells, driving them to become antigen-specic CTL.

P-298 IS CD177 1Cochin Paris, France Proteinase 3 (PR3) is a granular serine-proteinase, which is also present at the plasma membrane in a stable neutrophil subset. ANCAbinding to PR3 at the surface of primed neutrophils results in their activation. In neutrophils, PR3 has been shown to be associated with a number of protein partners but the function of these associationsremain to be dened. CD177 is a GPI-anchored on the same neutrophil subset than PR3. It has been pro- posed that CD177 is essential for PR3 membrane expression in the basal state. The rat basophilic cell line (RBL) has been used to studythe molecular mechanisms leading to PR3 membrane expression butunfortunately RBL-PR3 do not display PR3 membrane expression. We hypothesized that expression of CD177 would ''reconstitute'' the molecular ''scaffold'' of PR3 partners. We generated stable RBLtransfectant expressing either hCD177 or hPR3 or both. Membrane expressions of CD177 or PR3 were studied by flow cytometry under basal conditions or following degranulation or apoptosis. StablehCD177-transfected cells show a membrane expression under thebasal state in WT-RBL as well as RBL-PR3. However, in RBL-PR3 CD177 failed to trigger PR3 to membrane under the basal state. After degranulation PR3 membrane expression was similar in RBL PR3 andRBL-PR3 CD177. We found the same result in apoptotic cells;membrane expression of PR3 was similar in RBL-PR3 and RBL-PR3 CD177 in flow cytometry analysis. These cells have similar intra- cellular PR3 storage. In keeping with data from other groups, we alsofound that CD177 is a receptor for extracellular PR3, as demonstrated by the binding of exogenous PR3 to RBL-CD177 in the basal state contrary to RBL WT. CD177 appears to be a partner of PR3, whichcould play a role as a receptor for extracellular PR3, but it seems to beinsufcient for PR3 membrane targeting in the basal state in a cell model of neutrophils.

Re \u00b4gent1,2,3,4,*, H. Ly1,2,3, of hematology-medical oncology, Weill medical College of Cornell University, New York, United States Background: In giant cell arteritis (GCA), immunological studies suggest the existence of a triggering antigen of unknown nature activating T-cell in the arterial wall (1). In experiments performed inanimal models, a proliferation of T-cells from the xenotransplantsuggests a possible recognition of a locally expressed antigen (2).S182 Inflamm. Res. 123Objectives: We thus decided to use a proteomic approach in order to identify the target antigens of auto-antibodies directed against endo-thelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Patients and methods: Sera from 15 GCA patients were tested in pools of 3 sera and compared to a sera pool from 12 healthy controls (HC).Serum IgG reactivity was analyzed by use of a 2-D electrophoresisand immunoblotting technique with antigens from normal human cells (HUVEC) and 162 and 100 \u00b117 HUVEC and VSMC, respectively, whereas serum IgG anti- bodies from HC recognized 79 and 94 protein spots, respectively.Thirty spots from HUVEC were recognized by at least 2/3 pools andnot by HC. Nineteen spots from VSMC were recognized by at least 3/5 pools and not by HC. Among identied proteins we found lamin A/C, voltage dependent anion selective channel protein 2, annexin Vand other protein involved in cell energy metabolism and key cellular pathways. Conclusion: IgG anti-EC antibodies and anti-VSMC antibodies arepresent serum of patients with GCA.

P-301 IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET ANTIGENS OF ANTI-SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL ANTIBODIES IN PATIENTS WITH ANCA-ASSOCIATED SYSTEMIC VASCULITIS: A PROTEOMICAPPROACH A. Re \u00b4gent1,2,3,4,*, H. Dib1,2,3, C. C. Paris, France,5Division of Hematology-Medical Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, United States Purpose: In an experimental model, immunization of splenocytes or CD4 T cell with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is responsible for a pulmonary vasculitis after adoptive transfer (1, 2).Objectives: We thus decided to identify the target antigens of anti-VSMC in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Patients and 9 with micro-scopic polyangiitis (MPA), 9 with Churg Strauss syndrome (CSS), tested in pooled sera for groups of 3, were compared to a sera pool from 12 healthy controls (HCs). Serum IgG antibodies in the pools of patients with WG, MPA,CSS recognized 121 \u00b170, 57 \u00b129 and 66 \u00b114 protein spots, respectively, whereas healthy controls recognized 94 protein spots. Thirty one, 18 and 22 protein spots were specically recognized by at least 3/5, 2/3 and 2/3 pools of WG, MPA and CSS, respectively. Amongidentied proteins are lamin A/C, annexin and alpha-enolase. Target antigens are involved in cytoskeleton, cell energy metabolism, and other key cellular pathways.Conclusion: Anti-VSMC IgG antibodies are detected in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. They recognize cellular targets playingkey roles in cell biology and maintenance of homeostasis. The functions of these antibodies and their possible role in pathology need further investigation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Material and methods: we have used a two-dimensional electropho-resis and immunoblotting technique with protein extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We have tested sera from 18 SSc patients with (n =9) or without PAH (n =9), 9 sera from iPAH patients (3 sporadic, 3 familial and 3 dexfenfluramin-associatedPAH) and 12 sera from healthy blood donors as negative controls. These sera were tested at a dilution of 1/100 by pools of 3 for patients and in a pool of 12 for healthy controls. Targeted spots were identiedby mass spectrometry.Results: Serum IgG from SSc patients with or without PAH recognized 42\u00b14, 37 \u00b17 protein spots, respectively. IgG from patients with sporadic, familial or dexfenfluramin-associated PAH recognized 46, 30and 30 protein spots, respectively, whereas 53 protein spots were rec- ognized by IgG from healthy donors. 64 protein spots were recognized specically by IgG from SSc patients including 17 spots which wererecognised specically by PAH patients. Only six protein spots wererecognized by IgG from more than 75% of patients' pools of sera and not by the IgG from healthy donors.

P-303 IDENTIFICATION OF NEW AUTOANTIBODYSPECIFICITIES DIRECTED AT PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR BETA PATHWAY IN PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS G. Bussone1,*, H. Dib1, M. C. Tamby1, C. Broussard2, Publique-Ho pitaux de Paris,4pole de Me \u00b4decine Interne et centre de re \u00b4fe\u00b4rence France Introduction: Approximately 10% of SSc patients have no routinely detectable antinuclear antibodies (ANA), usually detected by indirectimmunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. For 20 to 40% of those withdetectable ANA, there is no identied specicity. In this work, we aimed to identify new target autoantigens in SSc patients. Methods: Using a proteomic approach combining 2-D electrophoresisand immunoblotting with HEp-2 cell total and nuclear protein extracts, we systematically analysed autoantibodies in the sera of 45 SSc patients tested in 15 pools from groups of 3 patients with thesame phenotype. A sera pool from 12 healthy individuals was used asa control. Proteins of interest were identied by mass spectrometry and analysed using Pathway Studio software. Results: We identied 974 and 832 protein spots in HEp-2 cell totaland nuclear protein extracts, respectively. Interestingly, alpha-enolasewas recognised by IgG from all pools of patients in both extracts. Fourteen and 4 proteins were recognised by IgG from at least 75% of the 15 pools in total and nuclear protein extracts, respectively,whereas 15 protein spots were specically recognised by IgG from at least 4 of the 10 pools from patients with non-identied ANA. The IgG intensity for a number of antigens was higher in sera frompatients than from patients with non-identied ANA. Interestingly, several identied target antigens are involved in the transforming growth factor-beta pathway. Conclusions: We identied several new target antigens shared amongSSc patients or specic to a given phenotype. These autoantibodiescould represent new diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for SSc.

P-304 AUTOIMMUNITY AND PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: Orsay,3Hopital \u00b4cle`re, Pulmonaire Se \u00b4ve`re, Clamart, France Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is dened as an increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure with normal pulmonary arterywedge pressure. It is widely accepted that immune and inflammatorymechanisms could play a signicant role in PAH genesis or pro- gression, but the pathophysiology is still unclear. Recent evidence has demonstrated a detrimental involvement of leptin in promoting thepathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases by controlling the regulatory T cells (Treg) onset. Despite this knowledge, the role of leptin in PAH is unknown. Here, we considered whether leptin pro-motes the immunopathogenesis of PAH by regulating Treg. To testthis hypothesis, we withdrew blood samples from patients with PAH with normal body mass index (BMI) (idiopathic (I), heritable (H) andconnective tissue disease-related (CTD)) and healthy control subjects. To measure serum leptin levels, we performed an ELISA test onserum samples. To detect circulating Treg and those expressing leptin receptor (ObR), we isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stained the latter with surface fluorescently tagged antibodies andselected Treg flow cytometry (FACS). Leptin was higher in PAH patients compared to controls. Furthermore, leptin was higher in IPAH and CTD-PAH patients compared to HPAH patients, whereas it did not differbetween IPAH and CTD-PAH patients. FACS analysis revealed thatTreg number was comparable in PAH patients and controls. However, the percentage of Treg ObR +was higher in PAH patients compared to controls and interestingly, it was even higher in IPAH and CTD-PAHcompared to HPAH patients. IPAH and CTD-PAH patients werecomparable. No correlation was found with BMI. Our ndings show for the rst time that leptin and its receptor are increased in PAH patients. Interestingly, IPAH and CTD-PAH are comparable. There-fore, leptin and its receptor could play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of PAH. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-305 USEFULNESS OF ANTI-CITRULLINATED PROTEIN ANTIBODIES DETERMINATION IN SYNOVIAL FLUID OF PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NON-RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS L. Laadhar1,*, D. Mrabet2, Hospital Al Manar Faculty of Medecine, Al Manar University, Tunis,Tunisia Objective: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) seem to be produced locally at the site of joints inflammation in the rst stage of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A strong correlation between serum ACPA (S-ACPA) and ACPA in the synovial fluid (SF-ACPA) is now sug-gested. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the usefulnessof ACPA determination in SF of patients with RA. Methods: A total of 52 patients with a knee-joint effusion (25 RA, 18 peripheral spondyloarthropathies (SPA) and 9 osteoarthritis (OA)) wereincluded in our study. SF samples were obtained by performing thera-peutic arthrosynthesis. IgG S-ACPA and SF-ACPA levels were determined immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We have also determinate IgG levels in serum and SF by nephelometry.Results: Higher levels of IgG ACPA in SF (p =0.045) and serum (p=0.045) were found in patients with RA respect to SPA and OA patients. There was a signicant and positive correlation betweenACPA in serum and SF (rho =0.516; p =0.007) not only in the RA group but also in patients with SPA. Serum ACPA discriminated RA from non-RA at cut off value of 2.7 U/ml (sensitivity 69%; specicity 78%; area under whereas SF-ACPA discrim-inated RA from non-RA at specicity 61%; AUC ACPA didn't give complement information to Disclosure of 123P-306 STUDY suggested the role of autoimmunity against alve- olar epithelium in the pathophysiology of the idiopathic pulmonary brosis (IPF). We recently evidenced the presence of a new circu-lating autoAb directed against periplakin (PPL) in both serum andBAL 16/40 (40%) IPF patients. The detection of IgG anti-PPL Abs was associated with a more severe disease (Am J Resp Crit Care Med, 2010). As, during auto-immune cutaneous bullous thevarious isotypes of autoAbs are associated different clinicalphenotypes, we wanted to evaluate the anti-PPL isotypes and their potential evolution during the course of the disease. Circulating IgA, IgG and IgG4 autoAbs directed against PPL were searched byimmunoblot using human placental amnion extract as an epithelial antigen source in the 40 patients with IPF. Among the 16 patients with anti-PPL IgG, 6 of them had IgG4 autoAbs and 9 of them had alsoIgA. Moreover, we could follow the serum of 2 patients with IPFduring the course of their disease. A semi quantitative evaluation could be performed. Mrs D was treated by steroids and immuno- suppressive drugs for 4 years but nally died with a severeexacerbation; she had an anti-IgA prole throughout the diseasecourse as anti-IgG4 were absent. Mr G. was followed for 2 years and became totally stable at the respiratory level under treatment; he had high levels of IgG4 and IgA anti-PPL at the beginning of the treat-ment, which almost completely disappeared at the last evaluation.After the evidence of this new antigen target during IPF, we now suggest that the isotypes could be also of importance. In particular, our preliminary data suggest the importance of follow up of the IgGand the IgA isotype during the course of the disease to distinguish the more aggressive forms of the disease. Further evaluations are under study to determine an eventual isotypic switch according to theresponse to treatment.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-307 TOLERANCE INDUCTION BY CO-IMMUNIZATION WITH DNAHSP65 AND RECOMBINANT HSP65 DID NOT AVOID FULL EXPERIMENTAL ENCEPHALOMYELITISEVOLUTION S. F. G. Zorzella-Pezavento1,*, F. Chiuso-Minicucci1, T. G. D. Franc \u00b8a1, L. L. W. Ishikawa1, L. C. Rosa1, C. L. (USP), Ribeira Preto, BrazilExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a demyelin- ating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system, whichinvolves autoimmune response to myelin antigens. It has been dem- onstrated that simultaneous co-immunization with a DNA vaccine and its cognate coded protein antigen can induce antigen-specicregulatory T cells (Treg) that are able to control the destructiveinflammatory reaction. Heat shock proteins (hsps), in special hsp65, are possible targets for Treg cells due to their enhanced expression in inflamed tissues and the evidence that hsp induce immunoregulatory Tcell responses. In this investigation we evaluated the prophylacticpotential of DNAhsp65 plus recombinant hsp65 co-immunization strat- egy on the development of EAE. Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 2 i.m. doses of DNAhsp65 + rhsp65. Animals were then submittedto EAE induction with a s.c. emulsion containing myelin oligodendrocyteglycoprotein (MOG) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant with BCG and 2 i.p. doses of Bordetella pertussis toxin, 0 and 48 h after MOG immunization. Co-immunization triggered a downmodulatory effect characterized bydecreased IFN- cand augmented IL-10 levels in cultures stimulated with rhsp65 compared to cultures from animals immunized only with DNAhsp65. However, this vaccinal strategy did not affect neither clinicalscore nor immune response to MOG. Mice previously co-immunizedwith DNAhsp65 + rhsp65 lost less weight than the other groups sub- mitted to EAE induction, but clinical scores were very similar among all animals with EAE. Anti-MOG IgG1 and IgG2a serum levels were similarbetween all groups EAE. Cytokine production (IFN- c,T N F - a,I L - 17, IL-10 and IL-5) from spleen cell cultures stimulated with MOG also did not reveal any immunomodulatory effect of this co-immunization strategy. We concluded that co-immunization with DNAhsp65 plusrhsp65 triggered a downmodulatory response but this was not able to avoid EAE development. Supported by FAPESP.

Maddur1,2,3,*, V. la Marie Paris 6, UMR S 872, de l'Ecole Me Compiegne, France Th17 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several auto- immune and inflammatory diseases. Circulating antibodies that mainly include IgG play an important role in immune homeostasis. Atherapeutic preparation of polyclonal IgG known as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is increasingly used in the treatment of diverse autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including those dis-eases where Th17 cells are also implicated. Therefore, we examinedwhether IVIg interferes with the development and function of human Th17 cells. To address this, Th17 cells were differentiated from na \u00a8ve human CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGF band IL-21. Th17 cells were amplied by stimulating memory CD4+ T cells in the presenceof IL-1 band IL-6. The effect of IVIg differentiationInflamm.

Lacroix-Desmazes: HUMAN TCELLS INDUCES THE REDISTRIBUTION FATTY ACIDS IN T cell activation is an important event in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Transformed malignant cells are known to greatly alter their metabolism of fatty acids as a mechanism that allows rapid cell proliferation. In this study, fatty acid metabolismwas evaluated in rapidly proliferating T cell receptor-stimulated pri-mary human T-cells. The distribution of fatty acids in these cells changed signicantly following cell stimulation and resembled that measured in the human Jurkat T cell line. The cellular content ofsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids was signicantly increasedin proliferating cells, suggestive of increased expression of fatty acid synthase and steroyl-CoA desaturase as is seen in cancer cells. Additionally, cellular arachidonate (20:4n-6) was redistributed in apattern that was unlike any other fatty acid. This was characterized by an accumulation in 1-acyl-PI, 1-alkyl-PC and 1-alk-1-enyl-PE species and a loss from 1-acyl-PC species in stimulated cells. This arachid-onate mass redistribution is accompanied by enhanced CoA-independent transacylase-mediated arachidonate-phospholipid remodelling. When the stimulus was removed from proliferating T cells, they stopped proliferating and the fatty acid distribution largelyreverted back to that of resting cells. To begin to identify enzymesinvolved in this remodeling, we measured signicant changes in the expression of regulating the cellularcontent and distribution of fatty acids may be potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with T cell proliferation.

Jones1, Schett3, M. Seed1 1Centre for Experimental Medicine and Rheumatology, William Harvey Research Institute, London, United Kingdom,2Synovo GmbH, Tu\u00a8bingen,3Division of Rheumatology, University of Erlangen- Nuremberg, arthritis (PIA) is an MHC dependent polyarthritis with inltrating activated CD4+ T cells, erosion of peripheral joints and greater susceptibility in females. Unlike collagen induced arthritis it has a chronic relapsing course. A dose-ranging study was carried outto determine the pristane dose that would induce relapsing arthritiswithout excessive adverse effects as dened by preset humane end- points and aimed to track disease progression on all individual peripheral joints. Pristane (75, 100 or 150 ll) was administered under light isoflourane anaesthesia, i.d. to the tail base to DA/OlaHsd rats.Controls received no injection. Rats were scored with a 16 point system recording swollen or red digits, knuckles, midfoot and ankle/ wrist between day 5-25 every 2 days and between day 25-100 twiceevery week. Paw swelling was measured with 0.02 mm graduation callipers. Adverse effects were monitored to Institutional ethical guidelines and approved by the UK Home Ofce. Paws were frozen orxed with paraformaldehyde. For all pristane doses, inflammationfollowed an acute phase followed by a chronic relapsing phase. Front and hind paws responded with signs of disease by day 20 followed by a decline nishing by day 40. Ankle swelling persisted to day 70.Relapse occurred in front and hind digits with some wrist involvement,as opposed to ankles and midpaws which did not. Hind paw swelling only occurred in the acute phase, fully declining by day 40. In the chronic phase, front paws were often characterised by swollenknuckles and there was a high incidence of severe distortion of frontdigits. Pristane was best tolerated at 75 and 100 ll. Conclusion: In PIA in DA/OlaHsd rats, chronic relapsing disease follows a course that differentiates between digits, wrists, ankles, andfoot thickness. Doses of 75ul and 100ul elicited a less severe and more manageable disease.

Previous work has shown that the therapeutic administration of exogenous Gal-1 to mice with arthritis can in fact reduce diseaseseverity through the induction of T cell apoptosis. In this current study we aimed to examine the functions of endogenous Gal-1, by per- forming the collage-induced arthritis model (CIA) in Gal-1 KO mice.Animals received an initial immunisation of chicken type II collagen(CII) in complete Freund's adjuvant (FA) followed by a booster on Day 21, which consisted of CII in incomplete FA. Animals were monitored daily for signs of arthritis from Day14 onwards. In terms of diseaseincidence, 92% of Gal-1 KO mice developed arthritis compared to 72%in the WT over the complete time course. The mean day of disease onset was also earlier in the Gal-1 KO (Day 25 \u00b11.56) compared to WT (Day 29 \u00b13.27) mice. A more severe arthritis was also apparent with the mean clinical score (7.55/12 \u00b11.11) in Gal-1 KO mice compared to WT (5.38/12 \u00b11.86). Histological analysis of joints taken from both phenotypes with similar clinical scores showed no differences in degree of synovitis and joint destruction. Counts of totallymph node cells revealed double the number of cells in Gal-1 KO compared to WT. Collectively these data indicate for the rst time, that endogenous Gal-1 has tonic inhibitory roles in the developmentarthritis affecting, in part, disease severity.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Of these 6 positive cases, 2 were having high titer of ANA, and 4 samples were moderately high titer of ANA. All of the positive individual's age was above 30 that can bedue to the effect of aging on autoantibody production in healthy population. Further investigations with larger number of samples can be helpful for precise determination of ANA prevalence inpopulation of western Iran.

P-313 THE ROLE OF MONOCYTES IN KIDNEY DAMAGE\u2014CELLULAR MARKERS ANDTHERAPEUTIC IN L. Carlin1, K. Woollard1, F. Geissmann11Center for Molecular and Cellular Biology of Inflammation, King's College London, London, United Kingdom Numerous studies highlight that monocytes are key-mediators of tissue damage in nephritis, including lupus nephritis. Previous published work in our lab has shown that CX 3CR1hiGr1-monocytes in mice and CD14dimCD16+monocytes in humans patrol blood vessels. These patrolling monocytes may scavenge dead cells and/or immune complexes. Furthermore, it has been shown that murine Gr1-mono- cytes selectively expand and accumulate inside renal capillaries duringnephritis, and that they are activated by immune complexes in anFccR-dependent way. Our lab recently published that CD14 dimCD16+ monocytes detect nucleic acids and mediate kidney inflammation in lupus patients. Nevertheless, little is known about the events thatgovern monocyte recruitment and their activation in the kidney. By using intravital single- and two-photon microscopy and fluorescent- labelled high and low molecular weight dextran we have been able toidentify and image in real time the glomerulus and associated struc-tures in CX 3CR1gfp/+Rag 2-/-cc-/-mice under conditions. Our hypothesis is that Gr1-monocytes patrol glomerular capillaries, detect immune complexes and are selectively recruited intothe kidney, where they induce tissue damage. Using the novel imagingtechniques developed in our lab we will be able to test our hypothesis and assess if the targeting of monocytes or a specic type of mono- cytes would be benecial in kidney declared. P-314 PREVALENCE OF ANTI- CYCLICCITRULLINATED PEPTIDE ANTIBODY IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN WEST OF IRAN Y. Shakiba1,2,*, A. Kiani1,2, N. Shakiba3, N. Moghimi3, S. 1Medical Biology Research Center,2Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah,3Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, kurdistan, Islamic Republic of Iran Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects a considerable number of populations during reproductive ages.RA is characterized by symmetric and erosive synovitis causes pro-gressive joint destruction and disability. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody is a more sensitive and specic test than Rheumatoid factor for diagnosis of patients with RA. Moreover, Anti-CCP antibody titer predicts the severity of erosive arthritis and diseaseoutcome. The objective of this study was to provide data regarding the prevalence of Anti-CCP antibodies in Iranian RA patients. Method: A total of 112 RA patients and 206 age and sex matchedhealthy controls from Kermanshah province (west of Iran) were enrolled in this study. All Patients fullled the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for RA and healthy controls did notsuffer from any known rheumatic diseases. 5 ml of blood samples werecollected and sera separated by centrifugation. Anti-CCP IgG antibody was measured using specic ELISA kits (Euroimmune). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 statistical software package.Results and discussion: Six of the controls (2.91%) and Sixty-eightout of 112 patients (60.71%) were positive for Anti-CCP antibodies. Sensitivity and specicity were 60.71 and 97.09%, respectively in this study. The results of this study showed that Anti-CCP antibody isprevalent in RA patients in west of Iran at 60.71%. Moreover, its prevalence seems to be higher in healthy controls in comparison toInflamm. Res. S187 123other countries populations.

Swierkot2, L. Ciszak1, P. Wiland2, I. Frydecka1,3 1Department of Experimental Institute Experimental of Rheumatology, 3Department role of IL-17 in Th1 defects in RApatients has been recently suggested. We investigated pro-inflam- matory and anti-inflammatory T helper phenotypes including Th17 and in order to clinical response to methotrexate (MTX) therapy.Methods: Eighteen patients with active RA and 15 healthy controlswere enrolled in the study. The frequencies of Th17 and Th1 cells in peripheral blood (PB) from individuals studied were determined by flow cytometry. IFN-gamma as well as IL-17 intracellular contentswere score (DAS28) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also determined before and after at least 4 months of therapy with MTX in a stable dose 15 mg/week.Results: Before therapy, we showed that clinical and biochemical signs of disease activity were present in all patients. Th17 population and intracellular contents of IL-17 were markedly heightened in RApatients compared to controls. In addition, imbalance in Th17/Th1ratio with predominance of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells was found in RA. After MTX treatment, we observed a signicant decrease in DAS28 and CRP levels in 17 out of 18 patients. Clinical improvementwas accompanied by normalization in Th17 population as measuredby both Th17 cell frequencies and IL-17 intracellular levels. In contrast, a signicant increase in spontaneous IFN-gamma production in CD4+ T cells was found in RA patients treated with MTX.Conclusions: We show that expansion of PB Th17 cells parallels theinflammation in active RA. Normalization of Th17 population after successful treatment with MTX contributes to Th1 systemic improvement, what is in agreement with IFN-gamma anti-inflam-matory effects in RA. The balance between these Th cell subsets would attenuate the inflammation levels and could thus be related to the remission period of RA.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Weattempted to nd out if the analysis of lymphocyte proliferation dynamics could be a good diagnostic approach distinguishing pro- spective RA from non-RA patients prior to nal diagnosis. Forty earlyUA patients were included based on routine clinical criteria and mea-surement of standard The inclusion criteria were considered todene the population of patients with UA, for whom the early classi- cation criteria is the main target especially in order to dene patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cellswere isolated from blood samples taken at UA diagnosis, stained withCFSE, mitogen-stimulated and analyzed by FACS. CD4 +CD28+cell cycle and G0-G1 time, % of dividing cells and number of divisions per cell were calculated. Final assignment of UA patients into RA and non-RA rheumatic diseases' groups based on EULAR criteria, was doneduring 2-year follow-up and confronted with laboratory and clinical ndings at initial UA diagnosis in search of parameters with predictive capacities. We found strong, signicant differences in all analyzedproliferation features between RA and non-RA groups. By thorough regression analysis we found that proliferation parameters were more relevant than disease activity and serological markers for distinction ofRA from non-RA, with both high specicity and sensitivity. Our resultshighlights a new innovative diagnostics tool for distinguish early RA among early UA, at the beginning of diagnosis procedure, early in the disease course, what allow to gain EULAR/ACR recommendations.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-317 TREGITOPE AND EXPERIMENTALAUTOIMMUNE Elyaman1,*, R. S. J. Khoury1 1Harvard Medical School, Boston,2Epivax, Inc., Providence, United States Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T-cell mediated, autoimmune disease targeting central nervous system myelin. Auto-reactive T cellsreacting to myelin antigens presented by antigen presenting cells drive the immune response. Expansion of CD4 +FoxP3+T cells (Tregs) is being considered as a means to restore tolerance.Methods: Using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we investigated the effects of the recently discovered regulatory T cell epitopes (Tregitope). Tregitopes arepromiscuous MHC Class II T-cell epitopes naturally located in the Fc and framework regions of Fab from IgG. Treated mice received 6 consecutive injections of human Tregitope 167 + 289 (200 lg/ mouse) i.p. in PBS between days 0-10 post-immunization. Controlmice received 6 9200lg doses of either ovalbumin (Ova, negative control) or 6 916 mg intravenous immunoglobulin (positive control).Results: Using MOG-TCR trans genic XFoxP3-GFP mice, we found that, in agreement with the tolerogenic effects of IVIG,S188 Inflamm. Res. 123Tregitope 167 + 289 administration expanded Tregsin vitro and in vivo and ameliorated EAE compared to Ova-treated controls.Tregitope decreased the frequency of IFNg-producing T cells and induced IL-9+ T cells in the periphery. We also found upregula- tion of Jagged2 on CD11b+CD11c -macrophages. Jagged 2 is a Notch ligand that has been shown to induce murine Treg cellexpansion. To understand the signicance of the enhanced Jagged2 expression, we treated EAE mice with anti-Jagged2 monoclonal signaling antibody. We found that anti-Jagged2 treatment expan-ded Tregs and suppressed IFNg-positive T cells suggesting thatTregitopes effects are at least partially mediated by Jagged2.

Cancer and inflammation P-318 NEUROTENSIN (NT) STIMULATES VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR MAST CELLS D. E. Cochrane1,* 1Biology, Tufts University, Medford, United States Mast cells play a key role in allergy and inflammation. When stim- ulated they secrete a host of mediators metabolites, angiogenic factor, VEGF. Studies show mast cells accu-mulate in and around many human tumors including colorectal, breast, lung, and gastric. Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and there is a positive relationship between the number of mast cellsaround tumors, microvasculature density, tumor growth anddecreased patient survival. These results suggest that mast cells, via the release of angiogenic factors like VEGF, support tumor-required angiogenesis. The peptide NT is secreted by a number of humancancer cells and is a potent stimulus of mast cell secretion in vivo andin vitro. Rat and human mast cells express NT-type 1 G-protein- coupled receptors (NTS-1) and NT's stimulation of mast cells, in vitro and in vivo, is blocked by pretreatment with the NTS-1 antagonist,SR48692. The accumulation of mast cells around tumors, the secre- tion of VEGF by mast cells and the secretion of NT by human tumors, prompted us to ask if NT would stimulate VEGF secretion fromhuman mast cells. HMC-1 mast cells withdrawn from serum wereincubated at 37 C for up to 24 h with various concentrations of NT or with media alone. The media was then assayed for VEGF via ELISA. NT stimulated a signicant, concentration-dependent increase inVEGF secretion that was blocked by pretreatment of the cells withSR48692 before stimulation by NT. VEGF secretion was also sig- nicantly reduced by pretreatment of the cells with p38 MAPK pathway and suggest promote angiogenesis by stimulating VEGF secre-tion from tumor-associated mast cells.

Disease, Chiba Center, City, inc., University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan Chemokines and chemokine receptors not only act as a potent che- moattractant for inflammatory cells, but also have the powerful ability in cancer metastasis and tumorigenesis. CrkL and c-ABL interactionis reported to transform into many malignant cells. We examined and evaluated the effect of CCR7 and CrkL, c-ABL on pulmonary ade- nocarcinoma specimens and the relationship of their mRNAexpression in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. 120 patients with pul-monary adenocarcinoma were included in this retrospective analysis. The expression receptors CCR7, ligands in were examined and evaluated the relation to prognosis.High mRNA expression of CCR7 in lung cancer patients indicated signicantly good prognosis than the groups of low expressions. The expression of CrkL and c-ABL mRNA had relationships with CCR7mRNA expression in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The expression of CCR7, CrkL and c-ABL were conrmed with immunohistochemical analysis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma specimens.

However, the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of SNL is still unclear, thus in this context, the objective of our study is to reveal the mechanism of anti-inflammatoryactivity of SNL, which would provide the basis of its medical usage. Themain aim of this study is trying to evaluate the anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects about Solanum nigrum Linn extracts (SNE). Here, we report that SNE signicantly inhibited the productions of NO andROS on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

Olszewski1,2 1Department of Surgical Research and Transplantology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences,2Department of Transplantation Surgery, Central Clinical Hospital, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Warsaw, Poland Background: Pancreatic cancer remains the most aggressive malig- nancy of all human cancers. Patients have an extremely poor prognosis, with 5-year survival less than 5% and a median survival of 6 months. These dismal statistics are due to a combination of low rateof resectability at presentation and inherently aggressive tumor behavior. Pancreatic cancer is characterized by inltrating tubular units embedded in desmoplastic stroma which is rich in immune cells,endothelial cells and broblasts. The question arises whether cancercell and inltrating macrophage enzymes may be responsible for cancer cells detachment and metastasis formation. Aim: To evaluate enzymatic activity in pancreatic cancer tissue.Materials: Tumor tissue samples were obtained from 25 patients whounderwent macroscopically curative resection. Patients had not received any preoperative radio- or chemotherapy. Tissue specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry using antibodies againstCD3, CD68, elastase. Gelatin zymography and around cancer nests and also in surrounding tissue.We also detected dense inltrates of T lymphocyte in tumor stroma. Zymography revealed that both active metalloproteinases were pres- ent in pancreatic cancer tumor tissue.Conclusion: The obtained results indicate that immune cell enzymaticactivity have impact on tumor progression. Tissue metalloproteinases 2 and 9 may influence tumor expansion. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-322 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR ENHANCES Medical School, Chonju, Republicof Korea Inflammation has been increasingly recognized as an important component of tumorigenesis. We have demonstrated previously thatplatelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent inflammatory mediator, hasthe ability to enhance tumor growth and metastasis via the activation of the transcription factor, NF- jB. The protein kinase. CK2 is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase. CK2 has been shown to induce NF-jB activation via direct degradation of I jBa. In this study, we investigated the role of CK2 in PAF-mediated NF- jB activation as well inhibitors, DMAT and tumor metastasis. CK2 inhibitors also blocked PAF-mediated decreases in the etoposide- induced caspase-3 activity PARP inhibitor, NAC endpoints were comparable to those of CK2 inhibitors. These data suggests that PAF enhances tumor metastasis CK2-dependent NF- jB CO2-INDUCED INCREASE OF THE PRESSURE V. Pancheva1, M. Pancheva1 1Bulgaria measured the pressure-temperature relationship of CO2 dissolved in saline for different concentrations, plotting the rst against the second. We found that in each diagram there are several inflex pointsand that the rst derivatives of all of them have one maximum always near the 37 /C176C, independently of CO 2content. Thus, we discovered a physical constant, explaining the human body temperature. On thatbase we created the following theory: (1) The capillary blood flow ispromoted using the Stirling-Malone engine cycle; (2) The working medium is the containing dissolved CO 2blood plasma, expanding by pressure fall, temperature elevation or by factors reducing the CO 2 solubility in it or producing additional CO 2, like acids; (c) The cap- illary glycocalyx chains (banded forward by the RBC passage) and the parachute formed RBC act as ratchet and pawl, determining their one-way motion\u2014a capillary pump; (3) The plasma expansion is onthe account of the nanobubbles at the liquid/solid site of the glyco- calyx chains, being maximal at 37 /C176C. All inflammatory agents have great solubility in blood (histamine) or react with its buffers or both,as formic acid, displacing the contained CO2 or producing newamounts of it. This raises the pressure in venules by capillary pumping and direct venules' CO2-induced pressure. We use this theory to treat inflammation and cancer, using, as well the discoveredby us: (1) Extremely strong penetrative feature of formic acid mol-ecules via biological membranes; (2) Its strong blood coagulating feature; (3) Its strong bactericidal and virucidal feature. The said, combined with the greater permeability of the inflamed tissue vesselsand the specic permeability of the cancer ones, kills instantlyselectively only the diseased tissue by disrupting the postcapillary venules, due to their greater diameter, when supplying to the nearest accessible place, even only 10% formic acid solution.

Garcia4, S. Preto, Brazil Tumors are composed, besides the tumoral cells, of a population of immune cells that inltrate to the developing tumor site and establish the tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Reciprocal interactions between neoplastic cells and their surrounding microenvironmentdetermine the tumor progression. Inflammation can foster or inhibit cancer growth, depending on the composition of inltrating cell populations and the stage of tumor development. Colorectal cancerrepresents a paradigm for these connections. Increased expression ofthe TF antigen is a common feature in malignant epithelia. a lectin from and has antipro- liferative effects on human colon cancer cells. In this study, weexamined the effects of jacalin on the initial stages of mouse coloncarcinogenesis induced by Methyl-N 0-Nitro-N-Nitroso-Guanidine (MNNG). Balb/c mice were given 4 intrarectal deposits of 0.2 ml solution of MNNG (5 mg/ml) twice a week for 2 weeks. Starting2 weeks before carcinogen administration, animals were treated orally (0.1 ml/mouse) with jacalin (0.005 and 0.05 mg/ml) twice a week for 10 weeks. At sacrice, the colons were removed, xed andprocessed for immunohistochemical analysis. When compared toanimals submitted to carcinogenic action, mice additionally treated with jacalin showed results similar to those of control animals. Upon lectin treatment, we observed a decrease in cell proliferation in thecolonic crypts, in the rate of stromal cell apoptosis, in the stromalexpression of COX-2 and number macrophages, the number of preneoplastic lesions increased when the lectinwas administered to mice submitted to the carcinogenic action. Theseobservations indicate that jacalin exerts protumorigenic effects on the colon and might reflect the manner in which it affects elements of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment.

P-325 FranceTherapeutic resistance of acute myeloid leukemia stem cells, enriched in the CD34 +38-123+progenitor population, is supported by extrinsic factors such as the bone marrow niche. Here, we report that when adherent onto bronectin or osteoblast niche components, CD34+38-123+progenitors survive through an integrin-dependent activation of GSK3 bby serine 9-dephosphorylation. Strikingly, GSK3b-mediated survival was restricted to female leukemic pro- genitors. The scaffolding protein RACK1, activated downstream proinflammatory TNF receptor, was spe- cically GSK3 bactivation through the phosphatase PP2A. In a mirrored fashion, male but not female normal adherent progenitors (CD34 +38-)0survival was partially dependent upon this pathway. Thus, the GSK3 b-dependent survival pathway might be gender-spe- cic in normal immature population and flip-flopped upon leukemogenesis. In search for compounds able to reduce cell adhe- sion-mediated drug resistance of leukemic progenitors, we previouslyfound flavonoid apoptosis specically in adherent leukemic cells. Importantly, we show that rutin inhibitedsurvival of adherent female leukemic progenitors (CD34 +38-123+) but spared normal female progenitors (CD34+38-). The pro-apoptotic effects of rutin were correlated with a decrease of GSK3 breproduced rutin-induced etoposide, and impaired theclonogenic capacities of adherent female leukemic progenitors. Together, our results strengthen GSK3 bas a promising target for leu- kemic stem cell therapy and reveal gender of patients as a newparameter in anti-leukemia therapy.

Ialenti1 1Department of Experimental Pharmacology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples,2Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Roma,3Clinical Immunology National Tumor Institute, 4Medical Oncology and Innovative Therapy National Tumor Institute, Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and its inci- dence has increased in the last decade. One important target identied in melanoma tumor progression is the Nuclear Factor- jB (NF- jB) pathway. In vitro studies have shown that IKK is constitutively activein human melanoma cells as compared to normal melanocytes, leading to NF- jB activation which in turn regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. These events are implicated as majormolecular mechanisms for melanocytes transformation [1]. It has been found that a short cell-permeable peptide spanning the IKK b NEMO binding domain (NBD), disrupted the association of NEMOwith IKKs in vitro TNF a-induced NF- jB activation in vivo [2]. In the present study we investigated the effect of the NBD peptide on survival of several human melanoma cell lines (A375, WM115, SK-Mel-5) as well as on the IKK/NF- jB signalling path- way. We report that NBD peptide inhibits the proliferation of allhuman melanoma cell lines used. Inhibition of cell growth was associated with direct inhibition of constitutive all cell lines tested. Using the A375 melanoma cell line, we show that inhi-bition of IKK/NF- jB signalling pathway by NBD peptide leads the expression of several NF- jB-dependent anti- apoptotic gene products and to the activation of caspase-3. Ourstudies suggest that a selective inhibition of IKK/NF- jB activation can be an effective strategy to be developed in the ght against cancer. 1. Ueda Y, Richmond A.

P-327 13-HODE DERIVED FROM LIPOXYGENASEPATHWAY IS INVOLVED IN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELL GROWTH J. J. Moreno1,*, M. Cabral1, R. Mart \u00b4n-Venegas1 1Physiology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain Arachidonic acid (AA) derived metabolites produced by lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways are synthesized by intestinal epithelial cell (Caco-2),and are involved in cell growth [1]. 15-LOX also converts linoleic acid a metabolite by Caco-2 in 10% fetal bovine serum (8.22 \u00b11.73 nM). The biological effects of 13-HODE on cell growth/cancer development are controversial. Thus, Hsi et al.[2] described a mitogenic effect in combination with EGF in human colorectal cells whereas Nixon et al. [3] reported an anti-tumorigenic effect by 13-HODE. Considering these ndings we aimed to study therole of 13-HODE on Caco-2 cell growth. Our results show that exogenous addition of 13-HODE (10-1,000 nM) induced a concen- tration dependent cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in Caco-2cultures. 13-HODE has two enantiomeric forms. Interestingly, 13 (R)-HODE presents higher mitogenic effects than 13 (S)-HODE, and these effects were blocked by ketoprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, suggesting that prostaglandins are involved in the effects of 13-HODEon Caco-2 cell growth. 1.

We aimed at determining theassociation between SNPs in inflammatory pathway genes and blad- der cancer risk according to COX2 expression levels in UCC. Methods: COX-2 expression was determined in 608 bladder cancercases from the Spanish Bladder Cancer/EPICURO study usingimmunohistochemical analysis in tissue microarrays. Information on recurrent cystitis was obtained for 334 low-COX2 and 274 high- COX2 expressing cases and 988 matched controls. 911 SNPs in 214inflammatory genes were genotyped in the same population. Polyt-omous logistic regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% condence intervals (CI) of bladder cancer risk. Results: A SNP in TLR9 (1486T [C, rs187084) was associated with a signicantly reduced risk of bladder cancer (OR =0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78, P =4.7e-06) in low-COX2 expressors. An interaction analysis considering 53 SNPs in 10 genes of the TLR pathway yieldedan OR (95% CI TLR9 rs2237094. Interestingly, an interaction between TLR9 -rs187084 and a history of recurrent cystitis was also found among high COX2expressors (OR =2.33, subphenotypes dened by COX-2 expression present differential genetic susceptibility, highlighting the complex etiology of UCC.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-329 INDUCEGROWTH AND PRO-INFLAMMATORY Recent data have expanded the concept that inflammation is a critical component of tumour progression. Now it is clear that the tumourmicroenvironment is one of the main participants implied in theneoplastic process. A marked inltration of mast cells has been observed in the stroma surrounding many tumors, but the precise effects of these cells are unknown. Our objective was to study 1-theeffect of mast cells on astrocytomas growth cell lines by targetinghistamine and inflammatory mediators 2- the influence of CD47 receptor activation by its agonist 4N1 on cytokines secretions. Rat peritoneal mast cells were co-cultured with human astrocytomasCCF-STTG1 and U87 cells. Proliferation was assessed by the col- orimetric MTS test and [ 3H]thymidine incorporation under conditionsS192 Inflamm. Res. 123allowing or not cell-to-cell contact between the different cell types. Cytokines secretion was measured using membrane array assays.Cytokines and CD47 receptor expression was assessed by RT-PCR. Mast cells increase the growth of U87 and CCF-STTG1 cell lines by about 50 and 40%; this effect required cell-to-cell contact between the2 cell from CCF-STTG1 and U87 cells lines in the presence of mast cells. Histamine increases the proliferation of both U87 and CCF-STTG1 human astrocytomas celllines. Moreover, IL6 expression was dose-dependently increased byhistamine in these cells. The CD47 receptor is expressed by mast cells, U87 and CCF-STTG1 cell lines. His activation by the agonist 4N1 induces the secretion of histamine by mast cell increases thelevel of pro-inflammatory cytokines RNAm expression by humanastrocytomas. Our data indicate that mast cells and CD47 receptor activation induce the growth of human astrocytomas cells lines and increase the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells,thereby likely contributing to tumour aggressiveness by enhancing the proliferation.

Lepique1,* 1Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil Human Papillomavirus, HPV, is the main etiological cause of cervical cancer. Asymptomatic women infected with HPV generate CD4 Th1cells against tumor antigens, while women with tumors show a spe- cic CD4 regulatory response. Mechanisms that generate regulatory responses in some women are not known. Our laboratory has beenusing the TC-1 mouse tumor model to study mechanisms of immune suppression by tumors. We have seen that about 10% of the total TC- 1 tumor population is composed by a M2-like macrophage expresses, among other cytokines, IL-10 and TGFb, bothpotential inducers of regulatory T cells. Aiming to understand the relationship between tumors and lymphoid organs, we transplanted puried na \u00a8ve T cells into RAG1 -/-mice and observed threefold more regulatory T cells being formed when recipients had TC-1tumors. On the other hand, transplant of E6/E7 peptides loaded tumor macrophages or CD11b+ cells from spleen of tumor bearing mice into na\u00a8ve recipients did not induce signicant increase in regulatory T cell phenotype, instead, we observed that in vitro antigen stimulated Tcells expressed Th1 cytokines, but not IL-2 and did not proliferate. Cytokine expression prole showed that tumor macrophages express a mix of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, while tumor cellsexpress cytokines like GM-CSF. Indeed, mice with tumors have approximately 3 fold more myeloid cells in the spleen than na \u00a8ve mice. In the spleen, we observed downregulation of upregulation of CCL2, to na \u00a8ve mice. Cytokine concentrationalteration in the spleen of tumor bearing mice may contribute to deciency in T cell activation, increased numbers of myeloid cells,poor myeloid cell activation. Our data indicate that conditioning of the host's lymphoid organs is important for generation of regulatory responses towards tumor antigens.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

In this study we evaluated the role of TXA 2in different physiological states using wound healing and cancer and methods: Mouse TXA 2synthase (C57) cells, then designated as C57-mTXAS. Only retrovirus vector introduced C57 cells were designated as C57-EV and used for control. Mouse bladder carcinomacells (MBT) were subcutaneously injected to C3H mice for bladder carcinoma model. One x 10 6cells of C57-mTXAS or C57-EV were directly inoculated to the tumor as the size of 0.5 90.5 cm. Tumors were extracted after 14 days of cell inoculation for thrombus ratemeasurement and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in sera was also measured. The urethane sponges were implanted to the back of C57 mice for wound healing model. C57-mTXAS or C57-EVinoculated to the sponges after 4 days of the implantation and spongeswere extracted then used for VEGF measurement and C57-mTXAS cell therapy successfully sup- pressed for the bladder tumor growth rate followed by induction of thrombonecrosis in vessel inside of tumors but not outside. Produc-tion of VEGF in sera was suppressed for acid C57-mTXAS into implanted sponges, signicantly induced VEGFand MVD after 6 and 12 days, respectively. The induction of VEGFand MVD were abolished with administration with OKY-046 and S-145. These result suggested that TXA 2may play different physio- logical role and its signal pathway such as stromal derived factor-1(SDF-1) would be claried in the future.Disclosure of interest: H.

P-333 DISSECTING THE ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS IN TUMOUR GROWTH AND METASTASIS WITH THE AID OF OPTICAL CELL TRACKINGAND 2-PHOTON Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst Sydney, Australia,2Riken Yokohama Institute, Yokohama city, Japan,3Monash University, Melbourne, Australia The immune system is critically involved in multiple stages of tumour growth and spread and the outcomes of this involvement canbe both benecial and harmful. Although neutrophils are abundant in many human and animal tumours, their role in cancer patho-genesis remains controversial. This is likely due to the fact that neutrophils can play a dual role in primary tumours: they can mediate tumour rejection but also promote angiogenesis and tissueremodelling which favour tumour growth. Furthermore, emergingevidence suggests that neutrophils may also have the ability to promote metastasis. Hence there is great potential for novel neu- trophil-based therapies in the treatment of cancer if the contrastingroles of neutrophils in tumour growth are properly understood. Wehave designed a system which utilizes 2-photon imaging together with a photoswitchable transgenic mouse Kaede to track neutrophils in real time inside tumours deposits and also to follow their fate asthey egress from the tumours. Using this method we show thatneutrophils form dynamic swarms inside primary tumour deposits. This swarming behavior may lead to tissue remodeling, as was previously observed in infections, and promote tumour growth andmetastasis. These results provide the rst information about the dynamics of neutrophil behaviour inside solid tumours and their fate as they egress primary tumour deposits.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-334 Sciences De Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia Inflammatory breast cancer is characterized by clinical symptoms including inflammation is the hallmark. This type of cancer remains poorly understood from a biological point of view: both the process ofcarcinogenesis than inflammation. In Tunisia, the incidence of inflammatory breast cancer is 5.7% and non-inflammatory breast cancer is 25-27%. Interleukin-10 and antiangiogenic. To test whether IL-10 pro-moter region polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to inflammatory breast cancer, we examined the contribution of inter- leukin-10 (IL-10) gene polymorphisms in Tunisian patients withlocalized or metastatic breast cancer and patients with Inflammatorybreast cancer IBC. In this study we looked SNP at position -627 (C[A) at the promoter regulatory region of IL-10 that has the ability to modulate the expression of IL10. The methodological approach toanswer our question is the case-control study. We analyzed by RFLP, SNP-627 (C [A) in peripheral blood samples collected from two groups of patients 22 with Inflammatory cancer (IBC) and 37 withnon-inflammatory breast cancer (non-IBC) belonging to differenthistological stages. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were compared between groups of patients and 55 healthy controls; and analyzed according to the presentation of the disease. In Tunisian population,comparison of allele frequencies showed a contribution of the A allelein the IL-10 promoter as a risk allele for the inflammatory form of breast cancer, the C allele in the IL-10 promoter was found protective against this type of cancer ( p=0.015). The expression level of IL-10 differs between individuals and this polymorphism in relation to the promoter region of the gene where several variations in the level of expression of the gene have been described. The low expressionalleles may be risk factors for inflammatory breast cancer.Disclosure of interest: None declared.S194 MODEL Haybaek2 1Institute of Experimental a. Clinical Pharmacology,2Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz,Graz, Austria Cannabinoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic properties, but their therapeutic use is hampered because of their psychotropic sideeffects. Atypical cannabinoids act via novel cannabinoid receptors and devoid of psychoactivity. O-1602 is such an atypical cannabinoid and its anti-inflammatory potential has been recently demonstrated inan experimental form of colitis. We were interested whether thiscompound may effect tumor growth in a mouse model of colitis- induced colon cancer. Male CD1 mice received 10 mg/kg of the car- cinogen azoxymethane followed by a 7-day exposure to 2% dextransulfate sodium supplemented in their drinking water. Mice were kept foranother 10 weeks during which tumors developed. Multiple tumors were found predominantly in the distal part of the colon. Treatment with O-1602 (3 mg/kg i.p. every second day over 3 weeks) signicantlydiminished tumor incidence by more than 30% (11 \u00b11.5 after vehicle vs. 7 \u00b11.2 after O-1602 treatment) and tumor area by more than 50% (67.3 \u00b113.7 mm 2after vehicle \u00b1sem; n =12;ttest). O-1602 is therefore able to reduce tumor burden in an inflammation-driven colon cancer model. Since atypical cannabinoids are not centrally active, they may become an attractive drug for the treatment of colonic and possibly other can-cers.

Studies in humans and animal models indicate that increasedinflammatory enzymes, such as elastase, and an imbalance in thecytokines are related to the development of cancer. We used a mul- tistage model of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to examine the involvement of during tumor development.

P-337 DUAL EFFECT OF SERUM AMYLOID A PROTEIN ON GLIOMAS F. H. Knebel1,*, R. C. Albuquerque1, S. S. Maria-Engler1, A. Campa1 1Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, University of Sao Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil The acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) has been proposed as a marker of tumor progression and there are evidence sustaining its participation in processes that favor carcinogenesis and metastasis, inspite of this, the possibility of direct activities of SAA on tumor cells remains to be addressed. Here, we have investigated the effect of SAA on two human glioma cell lines, A172 and T98G. SAA stimu-lated the proliferation of both lines, but had different effects onmigration and invasiveness behavior depending on cell line. SAA increases migration and invasion of T98G, whereas it decreased these in A172. Both lines expressed all the three isoforms of SAA and theproduction the protein was detected intracellularly. SAA affected theproduction of compounds present in the tumor microenvironment that can orchestrate tumor progression, such as cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effect of SAA onIL-8 production was remarkable for A172; whereas these cells did notproduce basal amounts of this cytokine, they were extremely responsive to SAA. On the other hand, T98G produced large amounts of IL-8 that was unaffected by SAA addition. SAA induced theproduction of (NO), increased the expression of (MMPs)-2 and -9, and down regulated the expression of the MMPs regulator gene RECK. These data based on in vitro assays are suggestive of thecontribution of SAA in cancer progression depending on the cell typeand concentration of SAA. In the case of gliomas, the most common brain cancer in adults, our data support previous ndings indicating a role for the inflammatory process in tumor susceptibility and therapy.Financing: FAPESP, CNPqDisclosure of interest: None ACTINICCHEILITIS AND ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA C.

S195 and mediators are components of the tumor microenvironment and inflammation has been proposed to representa mechanism to cancer development. Actinic cheilitis (AC) is an oral pre-malignant lesion characterized by discrete chronic inltrate and cellular abnormalities that might develop into oral squamouscell carcinoma (OSCC). The characterization of inflammatorymediators in the blood serum of pre-cancerous and tumor lesions has not been fully investigated. Besides, little is known about the role of elastase (ELA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, band GM-CSF in oral tumors or pre-malignant lesions. In the present study, we investigated the expression of these molecules in the blood of patients with actinic cheilitis and oral GM-CSF levels were increased in OSCC, while in the AC only ELA was elevated. Therefore, oral tumors strongly induced the production of inflammatory mediators related to neutrophils and macrophagesfunctions. Further studies are necessary to establish the signicance of these cells in human oral cancer. The understanding of the dif- ferences between a pre-malignant lesion and multiple mechanismsof OSCC-induced immune suppression may provide a range ofnovel targets for cancer prevention and therapies.

P-339 PROCOAGULANT AND PROTHROMBOTIC Republic of Korea The prothrombotic risk associated with chemotherapy including doxorubicin (DOX) has been frequently reported, yet the exactmechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that DOX can induce procoagulant activity in platelets, an important contributor to thrombus formation. In human platelets, DOX increased phosphati-dylserine (PS) exposure and PS-bearing microparticle generation.Consistently, DOX-treated platelets and generated microparticles induced thrombin generation, a typical feature of procoagulant activity. DOX-induced PS exposure was determined to be fromintracellular Ca 2+increase and ATP depletion which resulted in the activation of scramblase and inhibition of flippase. Along with this, apoptosis was induced by DOX as determined by the dissipation ofmitochondrial membrane potential ( DW), cytochrome DOX-induced PS exposure and procoagulant activity sig-nicantly, suggesting that ROS generation, Ca 2+and apoptosis were associated in DOX-enhanced procoagulant activity. Rat in vivo thrombosis models conrmed the prothrombotic effects of DOX through the mediation of platelet procoagulant activity, where DOXadministration resulted in increased venous thrombus formation alongwith increased PS exposure and DWdissipation, reflecting that DOX- enhanced procoagulant activity of platelets may lead to increased thrombus formation, indeed.Disclosure of interest: None declared.P-340 D. L. M. H. Brazil Within the context of tumors, macrophages have been increasingly recognized as central regulators. These cells are able to dramaticallyaffect the course of the disease and depending on their functional orientation, can present both pro- and anti-tumor activities. The aim of this study was to analyze the modulation of macrophage tumori-cidal activity by the lectin jacalin. We show that in vitro, jacalin(2.5-40 lg/ml) induced the production of both pro- and anti-inflam- matory mediators by human macrophages. Lower concentrations of the lectin (up to 5 lg/ml), when compared to the higher (from 10 to 40lg/ml), induced the secretion of higher levels of the anti-inflam- matory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- b. inflammatory cytokines TNF- aand IL-6 were secreted by cells stimulated with jacalin at all of the concentrations tested. For IL-12,high concentrations of the lectin determined the maximal responses. As assessed by MTT assays, when supernatants from macrophages stimulated with higher, but not with lower concentrations of the lectinwere added to cultures of human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29), up to 25% reduction of cell viability was observed. These results indicate that jacalin, through its ability to exert a pro-inflammatory activity, can direct macrophages to an anti-tumor phenotype.Financial support:FAPESP.

Our aim in this study was to evaluated and compared CCL2 and CCL5 and theirreceptors major CCR2 and CCR5 genes expressions in Tunisian patients,with localized or metastatic breast cancer and patients with IBC. We analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of two chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 genes and their receptors in biopsy samples collected from two groups ofpatients 19 with IBC and 34 with non-IBC. Results obtained allowed usto assess the correlation of expression of these chemokines to the histo- logical classication and their prognostic implications especially in IBC. Our results show that an almost universal expression of CCL5 and CCR5mRNA with 100% of IBC tumors express at least one of these markers, and 95% of these tumors express both markers at once, whereas this expression is less frequent in non-IBC.

Curiel1 1CTRC,2Cellular and Structural Biology,3Medicine, UTHSCSA, San Antonio, United States Cancers promote suppressive mechanisms hampering protective anti- tumor immunity. Reversing tumor-associated immune dysfunction is an attractive cancer immunotherapy strategy. Although most patientswith cancer are elderly, most preclinical studies are performed inyoung animals. We studied two immunotherapies for B16 melanoma in young (\\6 (Tregs) or myeloid-derivedsuppressor cells (MDSCs), two immune regulators known to impede anti-tumor immunity. Treg numbers were comparable at baseline and following tumor challenge in young and aged mice. Denileukin dif-titox (DT) reduced Treg numbers equivalently in young versus agedanimals. However, Treg depletion reduced tumor growth and improved tumor-specic immunity only in young mice. Thus, either aged anti-tumor immunity is ineffective even with reduced Tregs, orother suppressive mechanisms exist. Aged mice had higher MDSC numbers both at baseline and upon tumor challenge. Depleting MDSCs with anti-Gr-1 antibody improved tumor-specic immunityand reduced tumor growth signicantly better in aged versus youngmice. Strikingly, only in aged mice, Treg depletion led to anunexpected and undesired increase in MDSC, suggesting that Treg depletion could fail in older patients from increased MDSCs. Tregsdepletion also resulted in myeloid cells increase in na \u00a8ve young and aged mice. Combining Treg depletion with MDSC depletion increased clinical response in aged tumor-bearing mice, consistentwith the hypothesis that Tregs negatively regulate MDSC in aged butnot young tumor-bearing mice. These data demonstrate that anti- tumor immunity can be effective in aged individuals provided that underlying immune dysfunction is correctly identied and reversed.Treg depletion efcacy could be enhanced in aged individuals bysimultaneous MDSC depletion. Cancer immunotherapies must be tailored to account for age-dependent immune differences. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-346 SPACE-TIME ORGANIZATION OF LYMPHOCYTES IN TERTIARY LYMPHOIDSTRUCTURES IN HUMAN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS L. De Chaisemartin1,2,*, J. The secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) are classically described as the place of initiation of adaptive immune responses. Aside from theclassical SLO, there is a rapidly growing body of evidence that under inflammatory condition, the inltrating immune cells are able to organize into structures called ''tertiary lymphoid structures'' pre-senting a high degree of similarity with the SLO. Accumulatingevidence indicates that adaptive immunity can be initiated indepen- dently of SLOs. Here, in human lung cancer, we have characterized the immune cell inltrate as well as their in situ organization. Wehave described that immune cells can be organized into tertiary lymphoid structures in some tumors. We called these structures ''Tumor-induced Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissues'' (Ti-BALT) as they were not observed in non-tumoral lung. Moreimportantly, we demonstrated that a high density of these structures was associated with long-term survival in lung cancer patients. Thus, we wanted to explore the structural and cellular organization of thesestructures compared to canonical secondary lymphoid organ, as wellas to determine which chemokines and receptors are involved in T- and B-cell recruitment into Ti-BALT. By flow cytometry and con- focal microscopy, we showed that Ti-BALT are predominantlycomposed of CD4+ TIL with naive and central-memory phenotypes.The ratio CD4/CD8 T cells is unchanged in Ti-BALT whereas the ratio CD45ro/CD45ra T cells is much more in favor of memory T cells in Ti-BALT compared to lymph nodes. We also demonstratedthat TIL in or out Ti-BALT have a distinct chemokine receptor prole. This data is in accordance with the expression of chemokines on micro-dissected Ti-BALT versus non-Ti-BALT areas. A betterknowledge about the immunologic function of tertiary lymphoidstructures in a tumor context is an important prerequisite for the development of immunological intervention strategies involving creation or suppression of these structuresDisclosure of interest: None ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF) AND MATRIX 2 9 (MMP-2, 9) D.

Epidemiological and animal studies have indicated that consumption of Allium plants like shallot is associatedwith a reduced risk of cancer development. Here, we investigated theeffects of aqueous extract of shallot on critical steps and mediators of in vitro angiogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with aqueous extract of shallot at 100-1,500 lg/ml for anti- proliferation, anti-migration and anti-tubulogenesis. In addition the effect of the extract on VEGF secretion, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, 9) expression was assayed using Elisa, gelatin zymographyand RT-PCR, respectively. Treatment with aqueous extract of shallotat 500 lg/ml and higher concentrations resulted in signicant decrease of endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tubulogen- esis. Moreover this extract showed a dose dependent inhibitory effecton VEGF secretion and MMP-2, 9 expression. Altogether, theseresults indicated that shallot is a potent anti-angiogenic herb of genus Allium. Aqueous extract of shallot exerts its inhibitory effect through production of essentials mediators of angiogenesis includingVEGF and MMPs. Disclosure of Melo Barbosa1,*, R. B. Callado1, C. A. A.

Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, 4Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States Integrins expressed by tumor cells are strongly implicated in various cell functions including those promoting metastasis and have also been linked to chemoresistance. Produced by activated T cells, naturalkiller cells, and dendritic cells, IFN-g has a pleiotropic role in theimmune response. In addition, IFN-g is a key player in Inflammation as it activates macrophage and neutrophil that then secret Reactive oxygen species and other cytokines. Inflammation is often associatedwith hypoxia which is link to metastatic, aggressive and resistant cancers. Our studies demonstrated that hypoxia increases the expression of integrins at the cell surface of lung cancer cells. In thisstudy, we describe a new anti-cancer role for interferon gamma (IFN-g); we show that IFN-g markedly inhibits the expression of aVb5, aVb3, and b1 integrins on lung cancer cells both in normoxia and in hypoxia, inhibits metastases and invasion, and chemosensitise lungcancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our studies revealed the anti-inva-sion and anti-metastatic activity of IFN-g on lung cancer cells as treated cancer cells lose their ability to adhere, proliferate, migrate, invade, form colonies, and are signicantly less efcient at inltratingthe lungs. We also demonstrate that IFN-g signicantly increases theefcacy of several drugs on resistant cancer cells both in vitro (nor- moxia and in hypoxia) and in vivo. We propose to combine IFN-g with currently used low efcient chemotherapeutic agents to poten-tiate their antitumor efciency for the treatment of chemoresistant tumors. This would allow the use of lower doses of chemotherapy, and consequently prevents their associated side effects. Such IFN-gcombined therapies would efciently eradicate primary and meta-static resistant lung cancers. Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res.

Haghighi1, F. H. Haghighat1, S. A. Amirian1 1School of Physiotherapy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Objectives: Conservative treatment should be tried prior to surgical treatment in knee osteoarthritis. This study was designed to evaluate the short-term effects of manual therapy on pain relief and functional improvement in knee osteoarthritis in comparison with taping.Methods: The study included 36 patients who were diagnosed ashaving knee osteoarthritis according to the ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria, and had complaints lasting for more than 1 year. All the patients had stage 2 or 3 osteoarthritis radiographicallyaccording to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria. Eighteen patients (mean age 50 \u00b10.6 years; range 40 to 60 years) received manual therapy. Manual therapy applied on knee for 30 min daily for a total of 10sessions in 2 weeks. Eighteen patients (mean age 50 \u00b10.9 years; range 40 to 60 years) received a total of 6 sessions of taping for a total of 2 weeks. Pain with numerous rating system and functional per- formance using the WOMAC questionnaires was assessed before andimmediately after each treatment. The patients were evaluated beforeand after treatment in terms of pain by using of numerical pain scale (NRS) and functionality using the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis index.Results: The scores of all instruments showed signicant improve- ments following treatment in both groups (p \\0.001). Post treatment changes in relation to baseline scores differ signicantly between thetwo groups. (p \\0.05).manual therapy was better than taping in treatment of osteoarthritis of knee.

Granjeiro3, P. A. Melo4 1Basic Science Department, Odontology Faculty,2Odontology, Fluminense University, Niteroi, 4Pharmacology, CCS\u2014Basic Science Department, Federal University of Rio De Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilIntroduction: The inflammatory response induced by Dieffenbachia picta , san ornamental plant, is a result of tissue mechanical lesion caused by calcium oxalate needles. The toxicity arrises from its ability to cause painful edema of oral mucous membranes after chewing on the stem. Angioneurotic tongue edema caused by D. picta sap in live mice was standartized (DIP et al. 2004, 2011).Methods: The tongue edema measures were done with a digital tachymeter, 2 h after topical application (0.1 mL) of D. picta sap. The mice were treated 15 min after edema induction, by injection or capsaicin (1% 50 mg/kg) for 5 weeks; bilateral sections (5 mm) of lingual nerve were done in rats, 21 days beforetongue edema induction. D. picta -induced mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed in mice by measuring hind paw withdrawal thresholds to an increasing pressure stimulus using an analgesymeter with a wedge- shaped probe. Paw withdrawal thresholds were measured before andup to 30 min after an intraplantar injection of 0.01-0.1 mL of the plant sap associated with anesthetic solutions. Results: All local anesthetic solutions showed anti-edematogeniceffects. Partial reduction of tongue edema was observed after pretreatment with capsaicine and after lingual denervation. Sap-induction hipernociception was dose response and completely abolished by ropivacaine. Conclusions The key to reduce D. picta inflammatory reaction is inhibit antidromic vasodilation and axon reflex flare,reducing mastocyte degranulation and release of tachykinins from nerve endings. Ropivacaine maybe showed better results because it seems to function not only as a local anesthetic, blocking neuro-transmission in the damaged tissue, but also leading to a local vasoconstriction, as well as an unspecic antagonist response on nociceptors involved in peripheral pain.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-352 A RAPID AND RELIABLE MODEL OF ORAL OEDEMA TO Biology Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, UK We have developed a model to screen for anti-inflammatory effects in the oral cavity. A range of doses (25-1,000 mcg in 0.1 ml) of car-rageenan (CG) were injected into the upper lips of anesthetized animals (mixture of ketamine/xylazine, 15/90 mg/kg, subcutaneous), or intraplantarly (ipl) in Holtzman rats (150-180 g, male) at timezero. Control rats (C) received the same volume locally (0.1 ml),either in the lip or the hind paw of physiological saline at time zero. Increased thickness of the lip or hind paw was measured with a digital caliper (Mytutoyo, Japan) for up to 6 h following injections. CGinduced a signicant and dose-dependent increase in lip thickness incomparison with controls (Delta CG 500 mcg/site =4.12 mm; Delta C=0.023 \u00b10.005 mm) with a maximal effect occurring at 1 h after injection, in contrast to 3 h (Delta CGat 500 mcg/site =1.68 \u00b10.04 mm; Delta C=0.08 \u00b10.004 times, non-selective (2 mg/kg indomethacin; 20 (NSAIDs) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), given s.c. 30 min before CG, reduced oral and paw oedema to a similar extent.

Inflamm DERIVATIVES: NOVEL CANDIDATES, WITH DOUBLE POTENTIALITY, FOR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY JOINT THERAPY E. El Hayek1,*, N. France Osteoarticular diseases (OD) such as arthritis and osteoarthritis are characterized by inflammation leading to articular cartilage destruc-tion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) targeting cyclo-oxygenases (COXs), improve rheumatic symptoms by reducing the production of prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2), the main eicosanoid con- tributing to pain and inflammation in OD. However these drugs areassociated with various side effects (gastrointestinal and cardiovas-cular toxicities) caused mainly by an impaired balance between COX- 1 and COX-2. Thus, the strategy of novel anti-inflammatory drugs development could be to inhibit production of COX substrateswithout modifying the eico- sanoids upstream COXs. This enzyme is known to be involved in thepathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases including OD. We havedeveloped novel GIIAPLA2 specic inhibitors have an anti-inflammatory OD. We hypothesize that oxadiazolone derivativescould activate PPAR. In order to test our hypothesis, we transfected rabbit articular chondrocytes with that C8 the PPRE- dependent transcription more powerfully than rosiglitazone. C8 effect on PPRE involves at least in part PPAR cactivation, but not PPAR a nor PPAR b/d.

The current study, approved by UFPR'sAnimal Use Ethics Committee, assesses the effects of RTX injection into the trigeminal ganglion in inflammatory and neuropathic models of thermal hyperalgesia.Methods: RTX (200 ng) or vehicle (2 ll) were microinjected into the right trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male Wistar rats (200 g). After injection, rats were submitted to surgery for placement of twoloose silk 4.0 ligatures around the right infraorbital nerve. Ipsilateralthermal stimulation of snout was conducted daily by application of either heat ( *50/C176C, from source placed 1 cm from vibrissal pad) or cold (1-s tetrafluoroethane spray) stimuli. Decreased latency for headwithdrawal or vigorous snout flicking, or increased facial groomingbehavior duration indicated heat or cold hyperalgesia. One week after RTX, other rats received a 50 ll injection of carrageenan (50 lg), formalin (2.5%) or vehicle into the upper lip and carrageenan-inducedheat hyperalgesia or formalin-evoked nociception were recorded. Results and conclusion: The eye wipes test conrmed the success of trigeminal ganglion C-ber deletion in RTX-treated rats (4.1 \u00b11.2 wipes) versus vehicle-treated rats (22.8 \u00b12.6 wipes). Nerve injury surgery induced heat and cold hyperalgesia in saline-treated rats, starting on Day 2 and lasting until Day 9, but these responses on Days 3, 6 and 9 were abolished in RTX-treated rats. Carrageenan inducedheat hyperalgesia formalin were unchanged by RTX treatment. Thus, trigeminal ganglion neurons expressing TRPV1 are crucial for the development of orofacial inflammatory and neuro-pathic thermal hyperalgesia.Financial REUNI (Brazil). P-355 DESIGN, SYNTHESIS AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY OF NEWLYSYNTHESIZED THIAZOLO[3,2-B][1,2,4]TRIAZOLE DERIVATIVES OF IBUPROFEN M. Amir1,*, M. W.

Literature survey reveals that 1,2,4- triazoles represent an important pharmacophore, and play a vital role asmedicinal agents showing diverse biological activities such as anti- inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular and anticancer. Furthermore, condensed heterocyclic compounds having system have also been reported topossess anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Arylalkanoic acids are an important class of NSAIDs, but their use has been asso- ciated with gastro-intestinal toxicity. It has been reported in literaturethat modication of carboxyl function of representative activity and reduced ulcerogenic poten- tial. To reduce their toxic effects a number of derivatives have been prepared and in some of these carboxylic group has been replaced by5-membered heterocyclic moieties such as thiazole and 1,2,4-triazole.In the present study we have synthesized some newer analogues of 2-(4- isobutyl-phenyl)-propionic acid (ibuprofen) having thiazolo-triazole moiety. The tested compounds showed potent anti-inflammatoryactivity as compared to standard drug ibuprofen at the same oral dose. The compounds showing signicant anti-inflammatory activity also showed maximum reduction in severity index along with minimumlipid peroxidation, with no hepatocyte necrosis or degeneration. Thusthese compounds represent a fruitful matrix for development of new class of non acidic anti-inflammatory agents.

Here, we have investigated the ability of SP to induce oro-facial nociception and thermal hyperalgesia and the role of NK1 receptors on two models of orofacial inflammatory pain. Male Wi- star rats (200-250 g) were used in all protocols, which werepreviously approved by the UFPR's Committee on the Ethical Useof Animals (authorization # 424). Rats, pre-treated or not with captopril (5 mg/kg, i.p.), received SP (1-100 lg/50ll, into the upper lip) or vehicle and were placed in observation cages forevaluation of the facial grooming behavior up to 15 min. Thirtyminutes later, rats were submitted to ipsilateral application of either heat (*50/C176C heat source placed 1 cm from vibrissal pad) or cold (1-s tetrafluoroethane spray) stimuli to the snout. Heat and coldhyperalgesia were estimated as decreases in the latency to displayhead withdrawal or vigorous snout flicking, or increases in duration of bilateral facial grooming behavior, respectively. Additional groups of rats received the selective NK1 receptor antagonistSR140333 (10 lg/50ll or 1-3 mg/kg) 30 min before the injection of carrageenan (50 lg/50ll) or SP (1 lg/50ll) or 1 h before the injection of formalin (2.5%, upper lip) and the heat hyperalgesia orformalin-induced nociception was assessed. SP (at 1 lg/50ll) induced heat hyperalgesia, but failed to evoke signicant facial grooming or cold hyperalgesia, even in rats pre-treated with cap- topril. Systemic treatment with SR140333 prevented SP andcarrageenan-induced heat hyperalgesia and reduced by about 50%the rst and the second phase of nociception induced by formalin. Our results suggest that NK1 receptors may represent a potential target for the control of orofacial inflammatory pain. Financialsupport: Sano-Aventis, Fundacao UFPR-TN, respectively.

In this double-blinded, received ketorolac sublingually and piroxicam sublingually during two separate appointments after lower third molar extraction ofsymmetrically positioned lower third molars. A surgeon evaluatedobjective parameters and patients documented subjective parameters comparing postoperative results for a total of 7 days after surgery. Patients treated with either sublingual ketorolac (40 mg) or piroxicam(20 mg) reported low pain scores during postoperative period. Simi- larly, the subset of patients who received ketorolac sublingually exhibited similar average amount of analgesic rescue medication(paracetamol) when compared to the subset of patients who receivedpiroxicam sublingually ( p[0.05). Additionally, values for mouth openings measured just prior to surgery and immediately following suture removal 7 days later were similar among patients ( p[0.05), and the type of NSAID used in this study showed no signicant differencesbetween swellings on the second or seventh postoperative days (p[0.05). In summary, pain, trismus and swelling after lower third molar extraction, independent of surgical difculty, could be success-fully controlled by ketorolac administered sublingually (40 mg) or piroxicam administered sublingually (20 mg) and no signicant dif- ferences were observed between the type of NSAID used in this study.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-359 A LINK BETWEEN PRIMARY HYPERALGESIA AND BLOOD FLOW IN ARTHRITIS E. S. Fernandes1,*, J. V. Bodkin1, S. D. Brain1 1Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London, UK We have previously shown that i.art. injected CFA can cause sec- ondary mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the mouse paw viadistinct TRPV1- and TRPA1-dependent mechanisms (Keeble et al., 2005; Fernandes et al., 2010). We are now trying to establish a link between primary mechanical hyperalgesia and blood flow in animalswith arthritis. CD1 mice (12 weeks old) received a unilateral intra- articular injection of CFA (10 ll/joint; ipsilateral joint) in the knee. The contralateral joint received 10 ll of saline. Primary hyperalgesia was assessed by using a pressure application measurement deviceonce a week, over 4 weeks. Animals developed primary mechanical hyperalgesia for 3 weeks after arthritis induction. We also assessed blood flow in the knee joint in these animals by using a Moor laserDoppler flowmeter. Two weeks after arthritis induction, baseline kneeblood flow was recorded. At this time point, primary hyperalgesia was more accentuated in the ipsilateral joint. We found that blood flow was increased in both ipsilateral and contralateral knee joints (1.3-and 1.7-fold increase, respectively). Interestingly, blood flowrecordings were 25% higher in the contralateral when compared to the ipsilateral joint. We therefore, suggest a link between primary hyperalgesia and blood flow regulation. Further investigations arenecessary to fully understand the link between blood flow and pain in arthritis. Work supported by the Arthritis Research UK and British Heart Foundation.Keeble, et al. Arthr interest: A POTENTIAL LINK BETWEEN THE TRPA1 AND TRPV1 RECEPTORS IN VIVO A. A. Aubdool1,2,*, R. Graepel1, S. D. Brain1,2 1Cardiovascular Division, King's College London, London, UK, 2Centre for Integrative Biomedicine, King's College London, London, UK Recent evidence suggests a potential interaction between the TRPA1 and TRPV1 receptors as the TRPA1 receptor is known to be co- expressed in 50% of all TRPV1-positive sensory neurons [1]. Both receptors are activated or sensitised in inflammation and involved incutaneous neurogenic vasoactive responses [2]. This study investi-gated vivo deletion of TRPA1 affects TRPV1 (capsaicin)- mediated responses and the role of TRPV1 TRPA1 (mustard- oil)-induced cutaneous blood flow in pharmacogenetic studies.Peripheral blood flow was measured, as a marker of in vivo activationin the ears of anaesthetised mice using laser Doppler techniques for 30 min following topical application of agents. Ear swelling was also determined as a measure of oedema formation. Topical application ofcapsaicin (10 mg/ml) induced a signicant ( p\\0.05) and similar increase in blood flow and swelling in the ipsilateral ears of wild-type and TRPA1 knockout mice. Furthermore, mustard-oil (1%) inducedvasodilatation was greater in with TRPV1 antagonist (5 CD1 mice pre-treated with vehicle (2% DMSO, h), respectively. No signicant change in oedema for-mation was observed. This study provided evidence that capsaicin-induced vasodilatation and swelling do not involve TRPA1 receptor. Our previous ndings showed that mustard-oil induced 3]. Thepresent study shows may also be involved in regulating TRPA1-mediated neurogenic responses in mouse vasculature. Our results highlight that genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade ofTRPV1 may potentiate TRPA1-mediated responses in the mouse skinat least.

P-361 INHIBITION OF INFLAMMATORY PAIN BY A NATURAL PRODUCT EXTRACTED FROMTHE RED ALGAE LAURENCIA GLANDULIFERA: AN OPIOID-MEDIATED MECHANISM R. Pharmacognosy, University of Athens, Athens, Greece Diterpenoids extracted from the red algae Laurencia sp. were isolated and tested for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in models of visceral pain. The structure and the relative stereochemistryInflamm. Res. S203 123of this compound were established by means of spectral and data analyses.Methods: The analgesic effects of the diterpenoid extract were eval- uated on two in vivo models of abdominal pain induced by the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid (1%) or visceral pain inducedby the intracolonic administration of mustard oil (0.001%). In vitro,calcium mobilization recordings in primary cultures of mouse dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons were performed. Results: Mouse treatment with the diterpenoid extract (intraperitoneal,1 mg/kg per mouse) inhibited nociception induced by both acetic acidand mustard oil. Further, the pretreatment of sensory neuron with this compound (300 lM) inhibited signicantly free intracellular calcium mobilization induced by PAR 2agonist (200 lM) or histamine (100 lM) treatment. The effects of the Laurencia sp. extract treatment on hista- mine-induced calcium flux was blocked by naloxone, an antagonist of opioid receptors. The use of specic antagonist of Kappa and mu (naltrindole, nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride andCTOP) conrmed the implication of mu and kappa opioid receptors. Conclusions: These results showed strong analgesic effects for a diterpenoid extracted from red algae, demonstrating opioid receptoractivation properties for this natural product. This diterpenoid extractcould be considered as a new natural product that could be use in the management of pain. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-362 UMBELLULONE, THE OFFENSIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE HEADACHE TREE (UMBELLULARIACALIFORNICA), STIMULATES THE TRIGEMINOVASCULAR SYSTEM VIA TRPA1 ACTIVATION S. J. Vriens3, Prenen3, G. Siena1, Avonto4, Di L. Petrocellis5, P. 1Preclinical University of Florence, Florence, Italy,2Preclinical and CLincal Pharmacology, University Italy,5CNR, Naples, Italy,6Pharmacology, University of Arizona, Tucson, USA,7Chemistry and Organic Natural Compounds, University of Naples, Naples, Italy The California bay laurel ( Umbellularia californica ), has been known by native Americans as the headache tree', because the scent of itsleaves produces violent headache crises. However, the mechanism by which U. californica causes headache is unknown. We recently described a case of cluster headache-like attacks triggered by theinhalation of the scent of U. californica . The major volatile constit- uent of the leaves U. californica is umbellulone, monoterpene ketone. The irritant properties of umbellulone are recapitulated by its ability to affect respiration, heartbeat, and blood circulation in labo-ratory animals, eventually causing death. Despite the b,b-dialkyl substitution, a structural feature known to suppresses Michael reac- tivity, umbellulone reacted quickly with thiols, suggesting that it could act as a trigeminovascular stimulator via TRPA1 activation. Wefound that umbellulone selectively stimulates TRPA1 expressing HEK293 and rat trigeminal ganglion neurons, but not untrans- fected cells or neurons after TRPA1 blockade. Umbellulone alsoreleased CGRP from trigeminal nerve terminals. In wild type mice, but not in TRPA1 decient mice, umbellulone excited cultured tri-geminal neurons. Finally, the increase in rat meningeal blood flow induced by umbellulone applied to the rat nasal mucosa was selec- tively inhibited by TRPA1 and CGRP antagonists. TheTRPA1-dependent ability of umbellulone to activate the trigemino-vascular system, thereby causing nociceptive responses and CGRP release, represents a plausible mechanism for U. californica C. Bellintani1, P. Cressoni1, G. Farronato1 1Orthodontics, University of Milan, Milan, Italy Aim: The aim is to underline the importance of the paediatric dentist and orthodontist in the contribution to the early diagnosis of PsoriaticArthritis (PA), avoiding and preventing the orofacial and systemiccomplications. Materials and methods: Psoriatic Arthritis is a chronic systemic dis- ease that is difcult to detect. The diagnosis is made mainly onclinical grounds based on the ndings of psoriasis and inflammatoryarthritis of the joints. Many reports have described the damaging effects of PA on the temporomandibular joints (TMJs), but no study has clearly reported the TMJ as the rst articulation to be involved inPA. This work reports a case of PA that was diagnosed several years after a TMJ onset because no other signs apart from psoriasis were present.Results: The missed early diagnosis resulted in severe TMJ damage.The TMJ can be the rst joint involved in PA. It is often unilateral, with a sudden onset. Symptoms include pain and tenderness of the joint area and the muscles of mastication, morning stiffness, tirednessin the jaws, joint crepitation, occasional painful swelling of the TMJcapsule and painful mandibular movements associated with a pro- gressive decrease in the interincisal opening. In severe cases, ankylosis of the TMJ may occur.Discussion: the diagnosis of PA of the TMJ is difcult and is made mainly on the basis of the systemic presentation of the disease. In general, the diagnosis is based on a triad of psoriasis, radiographicevidence of erosive polyarthritis, and a negative serologic test for RF.Conclusions: For a correct, early diagnosis of PA, collaboration between the dentist and rheumatologist it is very important. The dentist should recommend in addition to exercise and local paintreatment, an occlusal splint to help keep the TMJs working properly,improve function, relieve pain, reduce swelling, and prevent further severe TMJ damage.

The most effective treatment for Bothrops snake- bites is antivenom (AV) therapy. However, this procedure does notreverse the local reaction caused by the venom. Other alternatives arebeing investigated with the purpose of diminishing the local effect induced by bothropic snakebites that include the LED therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of LED therapyto revert the edema formation and hyperalgesia caused by Bothrops moojeni venom (BmV). Also, the effect on edema formation and hyperalgesia induced by BmV when the LED treatment is combinedwith the use of AV was also evaluated. Male swiss mice were used.To measure the edema formation and hyperalgesia, 1 lg/paw (50 lL) of BmV was injected into the right paw of mice. The edematogenic effect was evaluated by pletismograph at 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hafter BmV injection or saline. The LED therapy on hypernociceptiveeffect induced by BmV was evaluated using a Von Frey test applied before, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after venom injection. The animals had been treated with red LED ( k635 nm, density of energy of 4 J/cm 2, irra- diation time of 41 s and area of 1.2 cm2) and infrared LED ( k945 nm, density of energy of 4 J/cm2, irradiation time of 38 s and area of 1.2 cm2) applied: 30 min and 3 h after the venom injection. The results showed that paw edema and hyperalgesia caused by BmV wassignicantly reduced by red and infrared LED. Treatment with AV did not modify the edema formation or hypernociception caused by BmV. The combined therapy with LED and AV did not modify theLED effect. In conclusion, both LED therapy signicantly reducededema formation and hyperalgesia caused by BmV, suggesting that LED therapy should be considered as a potentially therapeutic approach for the local effects of Bothrops species.

Siena1, P. 1Preclinical and Clinical In particular, oxaliplatin produces early-developing, painful and cold-exacerbatedparesthesias. However, the mechanism underlying these bothersomeand dose-limiting adverse effects is unknown. We hypothesized that the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a cation channel acti- vated by oxidative stress and cold temperature, contributes tomechanical and cold hypersensitivity caused by oxaliplatin and cis-platin. Oxaliplatin and cisplatin evoked glutathione-sensitiverelaxation, mediated by stimulation and the release of calcito- nin gene-related peptide from sensory nerve terminals in isolated guineapig pulmonary arteries. No calcium response was observed in cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons or in na \u00a8ve Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exposed to oxaliplatin or with lower potency, cisplatin, evoked a glutathione-sensitive cal-cium response in CHO cells expressing mouse TRPA1. One single administration of oxaliplatin produced mechanical and cold hyperal- gesia in rats, an effect selectively abated by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. Oxaliplatin administration caused mechanical and cold allo-dynia in mice. Both responses were absent in TRPA1-decient mice. Administration of cisplatin evoked mechanical allodynia, an effect that was reduced in TRPA1-decient mice. TRPA1 is therefore required foroxaliplatin-evoked mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, and contrib-utes to cisplatin-evoked mechanical allodynia. Channel activation is most likely caused by glutathione-sensitive molecules, including reactive oxygen species and their byproducts, which are generatedfollowing tissue exposure to platinum-based drugs from cells sur- rounding nociceptive nerve terminals.

Keeble1 1Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London, London, UK The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor is expressed predominantly on sensory nerve bres and is activated by avariety of noxious stimuli including heat [43/C176C, protons and a variety of inflammatory mediators. Therein, TRPV1 plays an integral role in the pain response and, thus, has been highlighted as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain. However, TRPV1 antagonists cause hyperthermiain humans and animals which is associated with increased thermo- genesis and decreased cutaneous blood flow (Romanovsky et al., 2009). The present study has investigated the effect of the TRPV1 antagonistsSB366791 (Gunthorpe et al., 2004) on thermal nociception, bodytemperature and capsaicin-induced vascular responses in mice. Female, CD1 mice (Charles River, UK) were used for all experiments in accordance with the Scientic Procedures Act 1986. Mice were injectedi.p. with SB366791 (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (10 ml/kg). Thermal noci-ceptive responses in both paws were measured 4 h after injection of SB366791 or vehicle using the Hargreaves test. Body temperature was measured using radiotelemetry via subcutaneously implanted trans-mitters (DSI). For measurement of vascular responses, capsaicin orvehicle was applied to the ears and exposed knee joint synovial mem- branes of urethane-anaesthetised mice and blood flow was measured by laser Doppler imagery (Moor instruments). SB366791 increased ther-mal nociceptive thresholds ( P\\0.05) without increasing core SB366791 had no signicant effect on capsaicin-induced vascular responses. Thus, to conclude, SB366791can increase thermal nociceptive thresholds in mice without increasingcore temperature. This may be due, at least in part, to the lack of inhi- bition of vascular responses by SB366791. (N-2-HYDROXYBENZOYL TYRAMINE) IN RATS F. C. F. Sousa1,*, A. M. R. Carvalho1, C. P. Leite1, N. F. M.

Amifostine (AMF) is an antioxidant agent used in management of some anticancer side effects. This study aimed toevaluate the protective effect of amifostine on OXP-induced PSN. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (protocol 27/08). Swiss male mice (25-35 g) were divided into II: for 4.5 weeks;III: AMF (1, 5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg, s.c.) injected 30 min before OXP. Mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal allodynia and Rota-rod tests were performed Histopathology for dorsal of signicantly decreased mechanic and thermal nociceptive threshold from 14th day on ( p\\0.01) when compared to control group. AMF treatment inhibited these effects in all doses tested ( p\\0.001), and the best dose was 25 mg/kg, which increased mechanic (94.33% of AUC) and thermal (100.85% of AUC) nociceptive threshold compared to OXP group. Locomotor impairment was not evidenced through Rota-rodtest. Furthermore, we observed edema and neurons atrophy in dorsal horn of OXP group, not showed in control and improved in AMF group. OXP group had overexpression of Fos, CASP3, nNOS, nitrotyrosine, a reduced expression when tocontrol group. AMF group had hypoexpression of Fos, nitrotyrosine and increased NMDA expression, but not altered CASP3, nNOS, iNOS expression when compared to OXP group. These results sug-gest that AMF protects tissue and sensory changes on OXP-inducedNSP, probably through an antioxidant effect, since it inhibited c-Fos, nitrotyrosine expression, and through an antiapoptotic signaling mediated by receptor.

After 10 weeks, rats were sacriced under deep anesthesia and sciatic nerves were isolated for various bio-chemical and molecular estimations.Results: Chronic alcohol (35%) treated rats developed neuropathy after 6 weeks, which was evident from decreased tail flick latency (thermal hyperalgesia), paw withdrawal threshold in Randall-Sellitotest (mechanical hyperalgesia) and von-Frey hair test (mechanicalallodynia) along with enhanced in oxidative-nitrosative stress and inflammatory mediators (TNF a, IL-1 band TGF- b1 levels). Co- administration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate signicantly and dose-dependently prevented behavioral, biochemical and molecular chan- ges associated with alcoholic neuropathy. Conclusions: The current ndings the neuroprotectivepotential of epigallocatechin-3-gallate attenuating the behavioraland alterations associated with alcoholic neuropathy through modulation of oxido-inflammatory cascade.

P-372 ROLES HISTAMINE AND SEROTONIN FORMALIN-INDUCEDRAT ARTICULAR De Federal University of Santa Catarina-UFSC, Florianopo \u00b4lis, Brazil Antihistamines have been shown to produce analgesia in some situ- ations, but also hypernociception in experimental models, which may explain why they are not always effective analgesics in clinic situa-tions. Herein, we investigated the effect of antihistamine on thearticular incapacitation, edema, and plasma leakage (PL) induced by formalin in the rat knee joint. Low and high doses of the brain per- meant H1 antihistamine promethazine increased anti-histamines loratadine and cetirizine only increased this formalin effect. None of the treatments changed the edema and PL. Loratadine given locally with formalin increased incapacitation, but had no effectwhen administered in the contralateral knee. Systemic loratadine was also without effect when formalin was co-injected with sodium chromoglycate. Histamine (0.05; 0.5 and 5 nmol/knee)decreased incapacitation change in the edema or PL. Cetiri- zine prevented the antinociceptive effect of the H1 agonist. Serotonin (1, 10 and 100 nmol/knee) administered alone did not cause inca-pacitation, but increase the edema and the highest dose changed thePL. When co-injected with formalin, serotonin only enhancedInflamm. Res. S207 123incapacitation and the highest dose also increased the edema. NAN 190 (0.1 and 0.6 pmol/knee), cyproheptadine (0.16 and 0.5 pmol/knee), and ondansetron (0.26 pmol/knee) decreased the incapacitation without changing the edema or PL. These results suggest that in the rat knee joint the histamine H1 receptor seems to play an antinoci-ceptive role, while serotonine is important for the formalin-inducedeffect.

Levy2,*, Headache Research Group 1Anesthesia, BIDMC, Boston, USA,2Anesthesia, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA Menstrual-related migraine headaches occur in about half of all women migraineurs. The mechanisms that play a role in mediatingthe increased propensity of women to develop migraine headachesduring this hormonal phase is unknown, but the abrupt decline (withdrawal) in estrogen levels during the premenstrual phase has been suggested to play a role. Mast cells (MCs) play an important rolein inflammation and are found throughout the intracranial meninges where they are thought to play a key role in migraine headache triggering. We postulated that changes in meningeal MC densitycould serve as one factor that modulates the propensity to developmigraine headache such as during menstrual migraines. We therefore examined whether changes in estrogen levels modulate the density of meningeal MCs and whether this effect increases the propensity ofmeningeal sensory neurons to become activated by common migrainetriggers. In cycling female rats, meningeal MCs exhibited fluctuations in their density with increases noted during the stages of reduced estrogen levels of estrous and diestrus 1. An increase in meningealMC density was also noted in ovariectomized (OVX) females sub- jected to an experimental estrogen repletion and withdrawal paradigm. In electrophysiological experiments, systemic administra-tion of the migraine triggers nitroglycerin or CGRP resulted inenhanced activation of meningeal sensory neurons during diestrous 1 compared to the high estrogen stage of proestrous. Migraine triggers- evoked neuronal enhanced animalssubjected to exogenous estrogen withdrawal paradigm when com-pared OVX rats. The MC stabilizing agent or depletion of meningeal MCs ameliorated the estrogen- related enhanced responses of meningeal sensory neurons. We pro-pose that estrogen-related recruitment of MCs to the meninges play animportant role in the pathophysiology of menstrual migraines. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-374 EFFECTS OF CXCR2 AND TRPV1 SELECTIVE ANTAGONISTS IN THE MODEL OF HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS INDUCEDBY CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE IN RATS F. N. Dornelles1,*, E. L. Andrade1, M. M. Campos2, J. B. Calixto11Pharmacology, Federal University (HC) is a common side effect observed in patients under chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CYP). The urotoxic sideeffects of CYP are attributed to the metabolic compound andcan be partially prevented by the uroprotector agent 2-mercaptoethene sulfate (Mesna). This study analyzed the anti-inflammatory and the antinociceptive effects of the selective CXCR2 and TRPV1 receptorantagonists\u2014SB225002 and SB366791\u2014in the rat model of CYP-induced HC. Male Wistar rats were used (200-220 g) and HC was induced by a single injection of CYP (200 mg/kg, ip). Breathing rate, closing of the eyes, and specic posture were scored at different timepoints after cystitis induction as nociception indexes. The mechanical hypernociception was measured with Von Frey laments in the bladder area and in the rat paw. As inflammatory parameters, hemorrhagepresence, edema formation, and bladder weight were determinedmacroscopically at 24 h after CYP administration. The neutrophil migration and inflammatory cytokines prole was assessed 4 h after cystitis induction by means of myeloperoxidase (MPO activity) and IL-1band TNF a, respectively. As expected, Mesna treatment was able to reduce in a signicant manner all the inflammatory and the nociceptive parameters induced by CYP. Of note, the pre-administration of SB225002 (1 mg/kg the hemorrhage, the edema formation and the neutrophil recruitment, as well the increase in MPO activity and the elevation of IL-1b. Interestingly, the treatment with either SB225002 or SB366791 markedly reduced the bladder wet weight and the nociceptive respon-ses. The present results indicate that CXCR2 and TRPV1 antagonists might represent important alternatives to prevent nociception following chemotherapy with CYP.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-375 EFFECT OF INTRA-ARTICULAR MEN16132 AND DEXAMETHASONE MIA-ENDUCEDOSTEOARTHRITIS Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease causing pain and disability. Inflammatory mediators are responsiblefor synovitis and pain transmission, and contribute to the pathologydevelopment. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intra-articular administration of the kinin B2 receptor antagonist MEN16132 anddexamethasone on pain response in the experimental model of OAinduced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in rats. Material and methods: MIA (1 mg) and 7 days later MEN16132 (1-3-10 lg), dexamethasone (10-30-100-300 lg) or their combi- nation were injected in the right knee in a volume of 25 ll. Pain was measured with the incapacitance tester for the following 21 days. Results: MIA was able to produce pain and to increase the levels ofbradykinin and prostaglandin metabolite in synovial fluid. MEN16132or dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent and long lasting analgesia with a maximum effect of about 60% inhibition of pain at the doses of 3-10 and 100-300 lg/25ll, respectively. In this model MEN16132 was about 30-fold potent than dexamethasone. The producing a of pain, caused analgesia of about 40-45%, ascribable to the sum of the respective antinociceptive effects. Conclusion: Intra-articular combination of low doses of MEN16132and dexamethasone induces an additive increase of analgesia thatmight allow to reduce the doses of corticosteroids for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated to diseases such as osteoarthritis.

Neuroinflammation: central and peripheral nervous systems P-376 MMP-9 LEVELS IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERALSCLEROSIS: EMERGING EVIDENCE Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the motor neurons of the spinal cord and brain. Degenerationof spinal motor neurons leads to muscular atrophy and weakness without accompanied sensory changes, whereas degeneration of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex leads to hyper-reflexia. Because of itsrapid and progressive clinical course, ALS patients generally die within2-5 years of onset. Matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs) are a relatively large family of more than 20 Zn 2+- containing, Ca2+-requiring endo- peptidases, characterized by their ability to digest components of theextracellular matrix. Excessive expression of MMPs may result in tissue damage. Therefore, precise control of the regulation of expression and activity of MMPs is important physiologically and pathologically. ALSpatients were selected using the World Federation of Neurology (WFN)clinical criteria. Elisa kit for the estimation of MMP-9 was obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA and was measured as per the manufacturer's specications. Standard curve was prepared as perthe instructions and the MMP-9 levels were expressed as ng/ml. Resultsshow that the neuroinflammatory marker, MMP-9 levels in the serum of ALS patients were signicantly ( P\\0.01) increased with respect to control subjects and also showed signicant correlation ( R 2=0.9) with the duration of the disease. Neuroinflammation can both be a cause, and a consequence of chronic oxidative stress which is produced by gluta- mate excitotoxicity. Cytokine-stimulated microglia generate copiousamounts of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, creating astress upon ambient neurons. Conversely, oxidants can stimulate pro- inflammatory gene transcription in glia, leading to various inflamma- tory reactions including production of MMP-9.Disclosure of interest: None P-377 NAAG REDUCES Mostafalou1, A.

Evidence suggests that glutamate receptors are involvedin inflammatory response carried through the COX-2 up regulation. In present study we aimed to investigate the effect of NAAG (10 mg kg -1) on carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. Methods: Acute inflammation was induced by subplantar injection ofcarrageenan 1% (w/v), in the right hind paw of the rats. The animals received an intraperitoneal injection of NAAG 20 min before induction of inflammation. The severity of inflammation was assessed4 h later using maximum paw edema volume, Area Under Cur- ve(AUC), microscopic changes of inflamed paw, measurement of markers; myeloperoxidase(MPO), lipid peroxida-tion(MDA in paw tissue.Results and conclusion: NAAG reduced maximum response and AUC by 52.56 and 58% ( P\\0.001), respectively, compare Microscopic studies indicated signicant reduc-tion in neutrophil inltration. MPO by was decreased by 88.13% ( P\\0.01) compare to controls, but there were no sig- nicant reduction in SOD and GPx activity. The results, for the rsttime, suggest that NAAG may be involved in inhibiting peripheral inflammation and it is possible that exerts this effect by modulating systemic glutamate levels.Keywords: N-acetylaspartylglutamate, inflammation, myeloperoxidase, carrageenan. Disclosure of State University of New York-Downstate Med Ctr, Brooklyn, USA,2Estee Lauder Research Laboratories, Estee Lauder Companies, Melville, USA Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling messenger with a broad range of functions in both the central and peripheral nervous sys-tems. In the skin, NO is involved in vasodilation, melanogenesis,and immune/inflammatory processes. NO is synthesized from L- arginine 3 isoforms of NO synthase can be induced toexpress iNOS inflammatory cytokines. Preliminary studies using human immortalized keratinocytes (hTERT) demonstrates that iNOS is induced in a time- and dose-dependent manner by UVB andcytokines such as CGRP, substance P, and VIP. To extend these ndings, we selected primary cortical neurons as a primary culture paradigm with cellular lineage distinct from keratinocytes. Expres-sion of all NOS isoforms following neuropeptide treatment (24 vs.48 h) was assessed by Western blot. Primary cortical neurons were treated in vitro with the nociceptive neurotransmitter substance P or bicyclic increase NO levelsin and compared to neurons that receivedbrain-derived (BDNF, 100 ng/ ll), 123factor known to increase nNOS. BMTd is known to increase nitric oxide levels in both melanoma and neuronal cells. Compared toBDNF control, tively upregulated iNOS at the protein level while have less of an effect on nNOS or eNOS. Our results provide additional support forthe involvement of iNOS upregulation in the development andtesting of agents of interest, which may specically modulate NO- related pathways.

Gibson1, W. S. McNeil2, A. Klegeris1,* 1Department of Biology, University of British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, Canada,2Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, Canada Activation of microglia and astrocytes contributes to neuroinflam- mation observed in a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Such chronically activated glial cells secrete an array of cytokines and inflammatorymediators, some of which may be directly toxic to neurons andcould therefore exacerbate neurodegeneration. Identifying the neu- rotoxins released by stimulated glial cells and searching for novel compounds that could be used to inhibit the neurotoxic activity ofglia were the goals of this study. We used immortalized monocytic and astrocytoma cell lines to model microglia and astrocytes respectively. In addition, we used primary human astrocytes. Lipo-polysaccharide and interferon-gamma, two potent proinflammatorymediators, were used to induce glial cell activation, which was accompanied by secretion of substances that were toxic to neuronal cells. We demonstrated that incubation of supernatants with phos-pholipase A2 group IIA-specic immunosorbents diminished theirtoxicity. We also prepared a series of four-coordinate cobalt com- pounds bearing beta-ketoaminato ligands which varied in the number of -CF3 We identied a cobalt complexthat the neurotoxic activity of glial cells at low micromolarconcentrations without affecting their viability. The anti-neurotoxic activity of this cobalt complex was reduced by specic inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The correspondingligand that did not contain cobalt was not effective. Our data indicate that phospholipase A2 group IIA could be one of the glial cell-induced neurotoxicity. We also compound in a MAPK-dependent manner. Cobalt-con- taining may have potential as anti-inflammatory agents benecial in neurodegenerative diseases.

N. Brandao1,*, J. P. S. Peron1,N .O .S .C a mara1, H. Weiner2, L. V. Rizzo3 1Sao Paulo University, Sa o Paulo, Brazil,2Harvard Medical School, Boston, USa,3Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Currently microglial cells have received great attention within the immune responses, due to the fact that its activation byinflammatory cytokines can promote the inltration and destruction of the central nervous system (CNS) specially in the case of multiple sclerosis (MS). Besides, the it has been shown that they are alsocapable of expressing suppressive molecules such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), able to suppress the proliferation of T cells. However, little is known about its true role in the pathogenesis of MS. Aims: This study aims to better understand the relationship betweenthe secretion of cytokines by activated microglial cells and theirconnection with the pathogenic Th17 cells. Methods: C57Bl6 animals had their spinal cords and brains removed and their mononuclear cells extracted. Later, cells were stimulated ornot with LPS or rm-IFN-g, for 24 h. IDO functional activity was also performed after co-cuture with MOG 35-55 specic 2D2 CD4 in the presence or absence of 1-methyl tryptophan, an IDO inhibitor.Results: Our results showed that, except for the TLR-4 and TLR-2, allthe other molecules showed a signicant increase in its expression after stimulation with LPS, which was not observed after IFN-g, except for TGF-beta and socs3. TLR-4 was decreased after IFN-g.Conclusions: Our data suggest that activation of microglial cellsthrough the TLR-4 is able to induce the synthesis of a series of cytokines both pro-(IL-6, IL-23) as anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-27, TGF-b and IDO). The results obtained here shows the ability of inflammatorymicroglial cells to produce inflammatory cytokines which are importantfor th17 cells maintenance. On the other hand, it has also a regulatory role, due to its capacity to inhibit T CD4 specic response. In summary, our data show the importance of microglial cells during EAE, both aspromoter or regulator of CNS inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-381 CYCLOOXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION IN ACTIVATED MICROGLIA/MACROPHAGES Y. Watanabe1, H. Onoe1,* 1Riken Center for Molecular Imaging Science, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan, 2Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Osaka Institute of Technology, Hirakata, Osaka, Japan Neuroinflammation occurs as a defensive response to pathogenic insult in brain and plays a crucial role in a variety of neurodegener-ative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) 123(PD). Cyclooxygenase (COX), prostanoid-synthesizing enzyme, is well known to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory process.Two distinct COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, are characterized as a constitutively expressed housekeeping enzyme and an inflammatory inducible enzyme, respectively. Recently, changes of COX-1 andCOX-2 in the brain of patients with ischemic, traumatic brain injuryand of several neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been reported, indicating that not only COX-2 but also COX-1 mediated neuroinflammation isa critical component in neuronal degeneration. In the present study, todetermine the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammatory process, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) study with 11C labeled ketoprofen-methyl ester its acid form rather spe-cic to COX-1, during neuroinflammatory process of rats which wereintracranially injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or quinolinic acid (QUIN). In addition, the cell type of COXs expression during neur- oinflammation was determined by immunohistochemical studies. Inthe PET studies, both LPS and QUIN increased 11C-KTP-Me accu- mulation in the inflamed hemisphere. It peaked at day 1 after the injury at which microglia/macrophages was activated with COX-1 butnot with COX-2 expression. In addition, the increased accumulationof 11C-KTP-Me was decreased rapidly from day 3 after the injury. This time-course of11C-KTP-Me was closely corresponded to that of changes in number of COX-1 expressing activated microglia/macro-phages in the inflamed area. These results strongly indicate that COX-1 but not COX-2 expression in microglia/macrophages is critically involved in the neuroinflammatory process in the brain.

Kim1,*, Jee Hoon Lee, Kwang Soo Kim, Ilo Jou 1Department of Pharmacology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea Oxysterols are oxidized cholesterol metabolites generated enzymati- cally or non-enzymatically during bodily metabolic processes. Theyfunction as ligands for liver X receptor (LXR), thus perform important roles during lipid metabolism and transport. Recently, anti-inflamma- tory actions of them attracted the interests of many researchers, but theprecise mechanism of actions are largely unknown. In the present study,we unraveled that 22( R)-hydroxycholestrol (HC), a family member increased MAPK induction in brain astrocytes. Transcript levels of MKP-1 showed peak levels in 3 h, butprotein levels were sustained up to 12 h and more prominent, sug-gesting that MKP-1 expressions are regulated at post-transcriptional levels. Moreover, experiments using actinomycin D revealed that 22(R)-HC increased MKP-1 mRNA stability in a LXR receptor-inde- mRNA stability is regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), of which HuR is a representative RBP that increase mRNA stability. As expected, 22( R)-HC increased cytoplasmic translocation of HuR in immunohistochemistry and nuclear/cytoplasmic fraction-ation experiments. Since nucleus/cytoplasm shuttling of HuR is regulated by its phosphorylation on Ser residues in the hinge region, we rst tested the involvement of PKC, using its pharmacologic inhibitors.Immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies against phospho-serineand revealed that R)-HC increased cytoplasmic translocation of phosphor-HuR, whereas nuclear phospho-HuR was decreased. Muchremains to be claried to reveal in-depth mechanisms underlying HuR translocation, our data show that 22( R)-HC-induced MKP-1 expres- sions are regulated at the post-transcriptional levels via HuR translocation. Considering the importance of MKP-1 during inflam- matory responses, the post-transcriptional regulation of MKP-1 by22(R)-HC suggest a novel target during post-transcription, which might be efcient because rapid modulation is possible.

Wise1 1School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China Isolated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells are a valuable model for studying the neuronal sensitizing effects of inflammatory agents such as prostaglandin E2. Under in vivo conditions, the soma of each DRGneuron is closely enveloped by a sheath of satellite glial cells. Recentstudies suggest that inhibiting glial cell communication may attenuate pain responses to nerve injury. When DRG cell cultures are prepared from adult rats, the non-neuronal (glial) cells make up the majority ofcells. Puried cultures of these glial cells appeared to proliferate moreslowly than those cultured with neurons, therefore the aim of this study was to determine if neurons regulated proliferation and activation of glial cells. Three groups of DRG cells were prepared: mixed DRG cellcultures (neurons were 31 \u00b13% total cells); neuron-enriched cell cultures (neurons were 73 \u00b15% total cells); and glial cell cultures (glial cells were 97 \u00b11% total cells). After 6 days in culture, there was a signicant increase in the number of glial cells (as %Day 1) only in themixed DRG cell and neuron-enriched cell cultures ( P\\0.05). Protein expression and viability (MTT assay) data was also signicantly greater in the mixed DRG cell group compared with the glial cell preparation(P\\0.05). The intensity of GFAP-immunoreactivity increased from Day 1 to Day 7, with no obvious difference between the three cell groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that DRG glial cells prolif- erate faster in the presence of DRG neurons when assayed in vitro,which may reflect the increased glial cell proliferation reported in intact DRG following nerve damage. Taken together, these results suggest that either intact DRG neurons release factor/s to prevent glial cellproliferation, or damaged DRG neurons release factor/s to stimulateglial cell proliferation.

P-384 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION OF PALMITOYLETHANOLAMIDE IN ANEXPERIMENTAL MICE MODEL OF SPINAL CORD TRAUMA E. Esposito1,*, I. Paterniti1, E. Mazzon1,2, T. Genovese1, R. Galuppo1, S. Cuzzocrea1,2 injury (SCI) has a signicant impact on quality of life, expectancy, and economic burden, with considerable costs associatedwith primary care and loss of income. The complex pathophysiology of SCI may explain the difculty in nding a suitable therapy for limiting neuronal injury and promoting regeneration. Althoughinnovative medical care, advances in pharmacotherapy have beenlimited. The aim of the present study was to carefully investigate molecular pathways and subtypes of glial cells involved in the pro- tective effect of PEA on inflammatory reaction associated with anexperimental model of SCI. The compression model induced byapplying an aneurysm clip to the spinal cord in mice is closer to the human situation, since it replicates the persistence of cord compres- sion. Spinal cord trauma was induced in mice by the application ofvascular clips to the dura via a four-level T5-T8 laminectomy.Repeated PEA administration (10 mg/kg i.p., 6 and 12 h after SCI) signicantly reduced the degree of the severity of spinal cord trauma through the reduction of mast cell inltration and activation. More-over, PEA treatment signicantly reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes expressing cannabinoid CB 2receptor after SCI. Importantly, the protective effect of PEA involved changes in theexpression of neurotrophic factors, and in spinal cord dopaminergicfunction. Our results enhance our understanding about mechanisms related to the anti-inflammatory property of the PEA suggesting that this N-acylethanolamine may represent a crucial therapeutic inter-vention both diminishing the immune/inflammatory response andpromoting the initiation of neurotrophic substance after SCI.

Nocentini2, E. and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy Inflammation is involved in a large array of pathological conditions as a homeostatic response aimed to tissue repair and to defend organfunctional integrity. Many signals and stimuli, including traumaticevents, can be responsible of inflammatory process activation. An uncontrolled and excessive post-traumatic inflammatory reaction may play an important role in the secondary injury processes, whichdevelop after spinal cord injury (SCI). Glucocorticoids (GC), among the most used drugs for SCI patients treatment, exert their anti- inflammatory action through the inhibition of lymphocyte proinflammatory molecules resulting in modication of lymphocyte migration and redistribution. Using GILZ transgenic mice, in which GILZ is selectively over-expressed in the T-celllineage, we show that GILZ antagonizes the development of SCI inmice further suggesting that GILZ is an anti-inflammatory molecule that mediates the effect of GC and represents a potential pharmaco- logical target for immune responses modulation in inflammatorydisorders such as SCI. In particular, leukocyte inltration, NF- jB activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and tissue were signicantly reduced in GILZ-TG mice. These results indicateGILZ acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule in experimental SCI.Results could suggest for new therapeutic approaches alternative to treatment with GC.

Chile Introduction: Scavenger receptor A (SR-A) is involved in recognition of endogenous molecules and pathogens, and inflammatory activa- tion. It was considered to be expressed almost exclusively in myeloid cells. However, we described for the rst time the presence of SR-Ain astrocytes, which provide key functions for the modulation response. Results: Astrocytes derived from SR-A -/-or SR-A+/+mice were stimulated with LPS or Polyinositic acid (Poly I, a SR-family-A ligand).In contrast to microglial cells, which showed little dependence on SR-A mediated activation, we demonstrated the participation of SR-A on the activation of NF- jB pathways, and the signaling pathways were evaluated. The absence of SR-A had no effect on the activation of ERK1/2 or JNK induced by inflammatory stimulation. In contrast, NF- jB transcriptional factor was unable to translocate into the nucleus of SR-A -/-astrocytes, as it normally does in SR-A+/+astro- cytes exposed to LPS. At the functional level, astrocytes from SR-A-/- mice exposed to proinflammatory ligands produced 50% less NO than SR-A+/+astrocytes, whereas NO production by microglia was similar for both genotypes. On the other hand, LPS or Poly I stimulated SR- A-/-astrocytes increased by 4-fold their production of IL-1 bcompared with SR-A+/+counterparts. Discussion: Our results show that proinflammatorymolecules of from SR-A -/-animals activated MAPK but not jB signaling, resulting in higher levels of IL-1 bbut lower NO production compared with SR-A+/+astrocytes. Altogether, we pro- pose that SR-A is involved in the modulation of the inflammatoryresponse of astrocytes. Supported by grant Fondecyt 1090353 (RvB). Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Higher ver- tebrates have a limited ability to regenerate efciently their CNS. Incontrast, some invertebrates as leeches can completely Inflamm. Res. 123after injury. From a specic leech nervous system EST library, we characterized two specic factors. First, HmC1q (for H. medicinalis ), homologous to vertebrate C1q, was glial cells. In chemotaxis assays, leech microglial cells were shown to respond to human C1q. The effect was reduced when microglia waspreincubated with signalling pathway inhibitors (pertussis toxin orwortmannin) or a specic anti-human gC1qR antibody suggesting the involvement of gC1qR in C1q-mediated migration. By using a recombinant HmC1q, the chemotactic effect was shown to bedependent on a specic C1q binding cell surface protein. Second,HmIL-16, a homologous of interleukin-16 (IL-16) human active form was detected in leech nervous system and was involved in microglia recruitment. By using either an anti-human IL-16 antibody or anti-HmIL-16 antibody, the cell migration was signicantly reduced. In human, mature IL-16 might bind to CD4 (as receptor) to stimulate migration of immune cells. Interestingly HmIL-16 was shown to promote human CD4 + T cell migration. Indeed an anti-human IL-16antibody, an IL-16 antagonist peptide or the soluble CD4 highly reduced the chemotactic effect. Thus HmIL-16 effect might be the result of binding to a protein homologous to human CD4. This studyemphasizes the role of leech factors in the microglial cell recruitmentknown to be essential for neuron repair and, in invertebrates, high- lights the presence of potential ''cytokines'' that are highly evolutionarily and functionally conserved in CNS.Disclosure of interest: None declared. MODULATION OF NEUROINFLAMMATORY ACTIVATION OF GLIAL CELLS BY TGF B1 IS MEDIATED BY THE INDUCTION OF MKP-1 EXPRESSION B. Flores1,*, R. von Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Catolica De Chile, Santiago, Chile Rationale: Chronic neuroinflammation has been suggested as a driv- ing force for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid- b(Ab) deposition, the phosphorylation of MAPKs and activation of NFjB pathway inducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and reactive species like nitric oxide (NO) that have been shown to accelerate neurodegeneration and contribute to progression of pathol-ogy. Negative regulation of MAPK signaling is exerted by MAPKphosphatases (MKPs), being MKP-1 the archetype of the family. TGFb1 is an inflammation modulator whose level is increased in AD. We have previously shown that TGF b1 has a neuroprotective role against A btoxicity, and recently it has been demonstrated that its signaling pathway is impaired in AD. These ndings suggest that TGFb1 has a key role in the pathogenesis of AD, although the molecular mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effect has notbeen completely elucidated. Here we studied the potential role of MKP-1 in the modulatory effect of TGF b1 on cytokine- and A b- stimulated glial cells. Results: Using rat primary glial cultures, wefound that TGF b1 prevented the NO production in a time- and dosis- dependent manner, being most effective after 48 h of pretreatment. This was correlated with an increase in MKP-1 expression, prevention of MAPKs activation and attenuation of NF jB p65 translocation Suppression of MKP-1 expression by siRNA altered themodulation of inflammatory response by TGF b1. Conclusions: We show for the rst time that TGF b1 induce the expression of MKP-1 in glial cells, inhibiting MAPK signaling andpreventing cytokine- and A b-mediated neuroinflammation. These nd- ings reveal mechanisms of the protective actions of TGF b1 and point out TGFb1 signaling and MKP-1 as new targets for the treatment of AD. This work was supported by Fondecyt 1090353.

The of PD. Nuclear-kB factor (NF-kB) is a tran-scription factor involved in cellular defense response, apoptosis and regulation of inflammatory genes expression. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the influence of reactive glia cells in the a-syn expression and NF-kB activation in SH-SY5Y cells infected wild-type (WT) or A30P a-syn. were prepared from 1 day Wistar pups. Cortices were isolate and cells were dispersed with 0.25% trypsin. Cells were placed onto flasksand maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. We challenged SH-SY5Y cells transduced with LV system with con- ditioned medium (CM) from reactive glia previously treated with LPS(1 mg/ml). The expression of a-syn was evaluated by Western blot assay. Cell nuclear extract was used to run EMSA to measure NF-kB binding activity. Exposures of SH-SY5Y cells transduced with LV vectors expressing wild-type or mutant (A30P) a-syn protein to CM from treated glia cells produced a pronounced increase in a-syn expression when compared to control treated cells. In addition, CM induced an increase in NF-kB activation in nuclear extracts from SH- SY5Y cells infected with LV vectors expressing WT protein whencompared to control group. Our results suggest a putative interaction between a-syn expression and NF-kB signaling in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Therefore, a-syn can be converted to a toxic compound in the presence of a chronic inflammatory condition whichmight be linked to NF-kB signaling cascade.

Teixeira1,*, I. G. Barbosa1, R. B. Res. S213 123Introduction: There is a growing body of evidence indicating the involvement of immune and/or inflammatory dysfunction andimpaired neuroplasticity in the physiopathology of bipolar disorder (BD), a condition that affects millions worldwide. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate circulating levels ofa series of cytokines, chemokines and neurotrophic factors in BDpatients in comparison with healthy controls. Secondary analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of BD diagnosis and state (euthymia or mania).Methods: Fifty-three BD patients (19 in euthymia and 34 in mania)and 30 healthy controls were comprehensively assessed with a structured psychiatric interview (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and psychopathological scales (Young Mania Rating Scaleand Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). ELISA. Results: There were no signicant differences in the proportion ofgender, age and years of schooling between controls and BD patients. In univariate analysis, BD patients presented increased levels of BDNF, CXCL10, but decreased levelsof and CXCL8 in comparison with controls. In multi-variate analysis, elevated plasma levels of sTNFR1 ( p\\0.001) and CCL3 ( p=0.003) were associated with BD diagnosis. The logistic regression modelpresented good adjustment in Hosmer-Lemeshow test and a predictorpower of 85.7%. No variable was associated with mania state in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: The present study corroborates the view of inflammatory and neurotrophic mediators in BD physiopathology. Inflammatory BD trait.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-393 TNF ALPHA AND NO INFLUENCES ONPILOCARPINE-INDUCED SEIZURES C. P. Leite1,*, E. R. V. Rios1, N. F. M. Rocha1, A. M. R. Carvalho1, F. H. C. Melo1, E. T. Vena ncio1, M. M. F. Fonteles1 1Department Physiology Federal University of Ceara \u00b4, Fortaleza, Brazil Introduction: The inflammatory process is involved in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The control and knowledge of these changes can help treat these and other dis- eases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroinflammatorydependence on pilocarpine-induced seizure model in mice.Methods: Mice (28-32 g) were pretreated with thalidomide (25, 100 and 200 mg/kg, ip), an inhibitor of the release of TNF a, Infliximab (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg, sc), an antibody anti-TNF a, Aminoguanidine (25 and an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, orODQ mg/kg, ip), an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, and 30 min after was induced the seizure with pilocarpine (400 mg/ kg, sc). In the behavioral assessment was observed followingparameters: Latency for a rst seizure and latency to death. For sta- tistical analysis, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student- Newman-Keuls as post hoc. This work was approved by the localethics committee (protocol number 41/10).Results and discussion: Our results show the attenuation of the behavioral parameters (increased latency to rst seizure anddecreased of mortality) at higher doses of the groups pretreated with thalidomide and infliximab. In groups pretreated with the higher dose of Aminoguanidine and in a dose of 10 mg/kg of ODQ showed theincreased latency and survival of animals death.Conclusion: We demonstrate the neuroprotective activity of thalido- mide and infliximab, which may be related to the decreased amount of TNF, while, aminoguanidine and ODQ to increase the survival ratecan be related to an aggressor effect of nitric oxide via cGMP.Financial support: CNPq and CAPES.

Badreldin2 1Physiology, United Arab Emirates University, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates,2Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Sultan Qaboos University, Collegeof Medicine and Health Sciences, Muscat, Oman The adverse cardiovascular events associated with acute exposure to particulate air pollution are exacerbated among individuals with hyper- tension. This study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular effect of diesel exhaust (DEP; 15 lg/mouse) on TO mice made hypertensive by implanting osmotic minipump infusing angiotensin II or vehicle (con-trol). On day 13, the animals were intratracheally instilled with DEP (15lg/mouse) or saline. 24 h later, pulmonary exposure to nicantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in it caused a signicant decrease of SBP in hypertensive(HT) mice ( -16 %, p \\0.005). The PaO 2was decreased, and PaCO 2 was increased in DEP-treated HT mice compared to NT mice treated with DEP (P \\0.05). Number of circulating platelets was DEP-treated versus saline-treated HT and DEP-treated NT mice. Moreover, DEP exposure of NT mice showed a prothrombotic effect in pial arterioles compared to saline-treated NT mice (P \\0.05). Interestingly, in DEP-treated HT mice the prothrombotic events weresignicantly aggravated compared to saline-treated NT and DEP-treated HT mice. The direct addition of DEP (0.1-1 lg/ml) to untreated mouse blood signicantly induced in vitro platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion, and these effects were potentiated in blood of HTmice. DEP caused the activation of intravascular coagulation which was conrmed by a shortening of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) following in vitro exposure toDEP (0.25-1 lg/ml). The effect of DEP on aPTT was potentiated in the plasma of HTmice. It can be concluded that the thrombotic events caused by DEP are exacerbated in HT mice. Our ndings, therefore, provide a plausible explanation for the cardiovascular morbidity and mortalityaccompanying urban air pollution. Disclosure of interest: A.

Res. 123P-395 IS PENTRAXIN 3 A MORE SENSITIVE MARKER OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE TO PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONTHAN HIGH-SENSITIVITY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN Silesian Center for Heart Disease, Zabrze, Poland,2Department of Internal Diseases, Medical University of Silesia, Bytom, Poland Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) and pentraxin highly conserved pentraxin superfamily. CRP is syn-thesized in the liver and may represent a systemic response to localinflammation, whereas PTX3 is synthesized locally at the inflamma- tory sites by endothelial and smooth muscle cells or by monocytes/ macrophages and may represent a rapid marker for local inflammationat sites of vessel injury. We compared plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and PTX3 concentrations after bare-metal stent (BMS) drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. 33 patients with stable coro-nary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronaryintervention (PCI) were divided into two groups: 1-16 patients (BMS group); and 2-17 patients (DES group). All patients were scheduled for an elective, 6-month clinical follow-up. Major adverse cardio-vascular events (MACEs) (death, re-hospitalization for acutecoronary syndrome, target vessel revascularization) were assessed. Results: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Patients after BMS implantation had a highermedian PTX3 concentration 1.19 ng/mL (0.72-1.33) ng/mL (0.55-1.02, =0.04). Median concentrations (0.78-1.1) versus 0.89 mg/L (0.7-1.0), respectively (p Six of 33 patients had MACEs during follow-up. The cut-off value plasma PTX3 levels after PCI compared with BMS. hsCRP levels were comparablebetween the two groups. Thus, PTX3 may be a more sensitive markerof local inflammatory response due to vessel injury than hsCRP. Both PTX3 and hsCRP had a high predictive value for MACE during fol- low-up.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-397 SPARC Leuven, Belgium Acute viral myocarditis is a serious condition, which can cause sud- den cardiac death in previously healthy adults. Despite intenseresearch to unravel the mechanisms underlying the severeinflammation by cardiotropic viruses, treatment for acute myocarditis is primarily supportive, and specic therapies targeting inflammationare needed. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated a role for extracellular matrix proteins such as Osteonectin (SPARC) and Thrombospondin-2 in the wound healing process after myocardialinfarction and in pressure overload. Here we investigate the role ofmatricellular protein SPARC in the coxsackie B3 (CVB3) murine model of viral myocarditis. Exposure to the CVB3 virus resulted in a biphasic response of SPARC cardiac transcript levels, with a twofolddecrease after 24 h and a fourfold increase at 7 days. This was alsoobserved in protein levels at 5 and 11 days post infection, respec- tively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed low SPARC expression under normal conditions with an abundant presence after11 days of viral presence. Immunofluorescence studies conrmedSPARC expression on CD-3 positive lymphocytes and V-CAM positive cells, but not capillaries, CD45-positive leukocytes or F4/80-positive macrophages. SPARCWT and null mice were exposed to the CVB3 virus, and an increased mortality was observed in the SPARC null mice, associated with increased cardiac inflammation. To further demonstrate the role ofSPARC in myocarditis, adenoviral over-expression of SPARCimproved the mortality in both SPARC WT and null mice. These data demonstrate the protective role of SPARC in viral myocarditis and suggesting that SPARC may be a novel target for the treatment ofviral myocarditis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-398 LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOPULATIONS IN LYMPHNODES AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD. A COMPARISON BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH STABLE ANGINA AND ACUTE CORONARYSYNDROME K. Backteman1,*, J. Ernerudh1, L. Jonasson2 1Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linko \u00a8ping University, Linko \u00a8ping, Sweden, Linko \u00a8ping University, Linko \u00a8ping, Sweden Atherosclerosis is characterized by a chronic immune response. An increased Th1 activity has been associated with plaque instability and risk of acute cardiac events. Lymphocyte analyses in blood are widely used to evaluate the immune status in patients with coronary arterydisease. We investigated whether thoracic lymph nodes (LN) frompatients with stable angina (SA) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) revealed changes in the immune response that were not detectable in peripheral blood (PB). PB and thoracic LN were collected in 13patients with SA and 14 patients with ACS during coronary by-pass surgery. PB and LN lymphocytes were assessed by cell compositionthat was different from PB with a higher proportion of B cells, lower proportions of CD8+ T cells and NK cells and a twofold higher CD4/ CD8 ratio. CD4+CD69+ cells were markedly enriched in LN[47(39-55)%] versus [1.1(0.9-1.7)%] while Th1 (CD4+IL -18R+) cells were more frequent in PB [5.9(3.7-7.3)%] versus [2.4(1.6-4.8)%]. Foxp3+ regulatory T cells were somewhat increased in LN [4.5(2.7-6.0)%] compared with PB [2.0(1.3-2.7)%]. Tregs wereinversely related to Th1 cells in PB (p \\0.05), but not in LN.

However, the few changes observed in PB of ACS patients compared with SA patients were not mirrored in thoracic LN indi- cating that LN analyses in patients with advanced coronary arterydisease do not add any information to PB analyses.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-400 CHARACTERIZATION OF ENDOTHELIALDYSFUNCTION PERIODONTITIS RATS D. S. Dalbo J. M. Farias3, R. Olchanheski Jr1, R. Sordi2, J. C. R. Vellosa1, F. A. Santos3, L. C. W. Brito1 have shown that periodontitis, an inflammatory disease from an infection of the oral cavity, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in the development of CVD. The aim of the presentstudy was evaluated endothelial function in an experimental model ofperiodontitis. Methods: Procedures were approved by ethic committee. A ligature was placed around rat mandibular and maxilar molars to induce periodon-titis. A simulated procedure was performed in the Sham (Sh) group. Seven, 14 or 28 days after procedure, effects of intravenous injection of acetylcholine (Ach), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or phenylephrine(Phe) on blood pressure (BP) were evaluated. Acetylcholine andphenylephrine response were also assessed in constantly perfused mesenteric bed. The blood was obtained for analyze serum lipid prole. Results and discussion: There was no difference in BP reduction toSNP in either group and in none of the evaluated times. Fourteen daysafter ligation, Ach response in BP was signicantly reduced in liga- ture-induced periodontitis when compared tom Sh group (Ach 30 50.6 \u00b14.1; Ligature 31.5 \u00b13.3 mmHg, n =8; p\\0.05; expressed as change in MAP). There was no difference in Ach response in other times (7 and 28 days). In mesenteric beds removed 28 days after ligature procedure, the response to Phe wassignicantly increased while the response to Ach was decreased. Sevenand 14 days after ligature no changes in response to Ach or Phe were observed. The ligature resulted in plasma LDL increase 14 days after procedure. Plasma cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides were not changedin any time. Periodontitis-induced endothelial dysfunction and increasein LDL levels may be involved in the early development of CVD.

P-401 THE FREE RADICAL SCAVENGER CAN EFFECTON THE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS IN ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE FOLLOWING THROMBOLYSIS RT-PA T. Nakase1,*, S. Yoshioka1, M. Sasaki1, A. Suzuki11Department of Stroke Science, Research Institute for Brain & Blood Vessels, Akita, Japan Background: It has been reported that the better outcome after rt-PA therapy could relate to the reduction of inflammatory response. The rt-PA administration was reported to decrease the activation ofastrocytes after ischemic insult. In this study, we explored whether theinflammatory response is altered by rt-PA therapy and whether the free radical scavenger administration can reduce the inflammatory response providing better outcome or not.Methods: Acute ischemic stroke patients were consecutively enrolledin this study (n =57, 72 \u00b112.2 yo). Thrombolysis with rt-PA intravenous administration was performed on 11 patients. IL-6, oxi- dative LDL (OxLDL) and the radical productivity were measured asinflammatory biomarkers at 3 time points: before medication, 4 and 24 h following medication. All patients were classied into cardio- (n =10) by clinical examinations and records. Neurological alteration was assessed by comparing NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission and at 1 month later. Results: IL-6, OxLDL and the radical productivity were signicantlyincreased at 4 and 24 h following medication in rt-PA administrationcompared with conventional therapy (p \\0.02). Whereas, patients with both rt-PA and free radical scavenger administration showed 32% reduction in IL-6 and 18% reduction in OxLDL at 24 h fol-lowing medication as compared to patients with only rt-PA. Moreover, rt-PA and free radical scavenger treated patients exhibited better outcome compared with only rt-PA treated patients (NIHSSreduction: 9.4 and 1.7, respectively), although NIHSS was not dif-ferent on admission (15.3 and 19.8, respectively). Conclusion: The free radical scavenger could decrease the inflam- matory biomarkers which were amplied by rt-PA administration.Reduction of provide better outcome.Disclosure declared.

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a key molecule that binds to the receptor activator of the nuclear factor-kB(NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), and differentiation. Inaddition, OPG protects against vascular calcication. This study aimed to evaluate the biological effects of thrombin on OPG pro- treated with various concentra- tions (0, 0.1, 2.4, and 4.8 U/mL) of thrombin for 24 h. Thrombin-induced OPG production in was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RANKL expression in HuDMECs was estimated a reverse-transcriptase polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR). The influence of thrombin on OPG pro-duction in HuDMECs and the thrombin signaling pathway were investigated using inhibitors. Results: Thrombin induced OPG production in the HuDMECs In addition,thrombin-induced OPG nding suggests that thrombin- activated HuDMECs may contribute to bone metabolism and vascular healing, partly through the OPG/RANKL system.

P-403 ROLE OF MAST CELLS ON THE CINC-2 PRODUCTION, NEUTROPHILS MIGRATION AND BONE RESORPTION IN SHR ANIMALSSUBMITTED TO PERIODONTAL DISEASE S. H. Oliveira1,*, L. Belini1, Arac \u00b8atuba, Brazil The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of CINC-2 and neutrophil migration (NM) in the and Wistar (180-200 g) (Protocol 52/06) submitted to periodontal disease (PD) and the role of mast cells (MAST) on this process. Thus, a group of animals wasdepleted of MAST by treatment with compound 48/80 (48/80), i.p.After 5 days, the animals were performed ligation of the rst molars counterparts with silk thread to induce PD. The induction was also performed in animals of the groups that did not receive treatment withthe 48/80 and after 7 and 14 days, GT were collected for the deter-mination of CINC-2 production by ELISA, the MN was evaluated by the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the mandibles were dis- sected and radiographed to evaluate the level of the bone resorption(BR) using Digora software. We observed that the levels of CINC-2tends to increase in W and SHR animals in the presence of PD. CINC- 2 is increased in the absence of MAST in SHR with 7 days after induction of PD and tends to increase in animals W without MAST7 days after induction of PD. In animals with 14 days of induction, the SHR with PD showed a signicant increase over its control. NM observed into the GT in SHR with PD is higher when compared withW animals with PD, both 7 and 14 days after disease induction. Thismigration was decreased in MAST-depleted SHR animals but not in animals W. The induction of PD, since we observed higher BR in all animals with PD. The presence of MAST increases BR only in SHR14 days after induction of PD. In conclusion, we observed that thepresence of MAST enhances the inflammatory process in SHR and BR with PD but not in animals W. In contrast, the presence of MASTdecreases the production of CINC-2 suggesting that this chemokine is not related to bone resorption and neither MN in this Y. Lim1, Hsu1, N. Tedla1, C. L. Geczy1 1Pathology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase reactant. Levels are elevated in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and deposits are localised inmacrophages in atheroma. SAA is an important mediator of inflam- mation and coagulation. It increases monocyte/macrophage cytokine factor (TF). Similarly, the calcium-binding pro-tein, S100A12, is expressed in foam cells and macrophages in vesselswith atherosclerotic lesions, and circulating levels are elevated in CAD patients. S100A12 has pro-inflammatory properties, but our recent studies indicate its pleiotropic activities. Immunoafnity experimentsusing human serum showed that SAA bound S100A12, suggesting functional interaction. Western blotting of sera from CAD patients conrmed low (10 kDa) and high mass SAA (200 kDa) and S100A12(200 kDa), suggesting complex formation with components of HDL.We assessed whether S100A12 influenced the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic functions of SAA in vitro. S100A12 did not directly induce cytokines in human secretory pathway was by S100A12. Conversely, S100A12 did not suppress LPS-induced cytokines or alter SAA-induced TF pro-coagulant activity, indicating selective effects.S100A12 and SAA share similar putative receptors, but competition studies indicated that this was unlikely. SAA activates the pathways were inflammatory processes. Since S100A12 downregulated SAA-induced cytokine production, and bound SAA in plasma, it may protect circulating monocytes fromactivation when SAA and S100A12 levels are elevated during inflam-matory episodes. However, S100A12 is unlikely to moderate the reported SAA-induced prothrombotic tendencies of circulating mono- cytes in patients with CAD.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-405 PREVALENCE AND ASSOCIATED FACTORSFOR ASYMPTOMATIC PULMONARY of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of KoreaInflamm. Res. S217 123Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of the rare but devastating complications in connective tissue diseases. PAH insystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is underrecognized in the clinical eld. Early identication of PAH is important and can alter the natural course.Objectives: To estimate point prevalence of asymptomatic PAH anddetermine the associated factors for PAH in a cohort of SLE patients Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study of 101 patients with SLE were recruited in a single tertiary centre. Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy was performed to estimate the pulmonary arterial pressures. PAHwas dened as resting systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) C40 mmHg, in the absence of left heart disease. The patients were also evaluated with respect to their clinical and serologic features,and disease treatment.Results: PAH was identied in eight patients (7.9%) who had no history of interstitial lung disease. Fourteen patients (13.8%) had sPAP of anti-Ro/SSA antibody (12.5 vs. 66.3%, p =0.03) was observed in patients with PAH than patients without PAH. Of note, serum uric acid (UA) was signicantlyhigher in patients with PAH than in those without PAH (7.8 \u00b12.2 vs. 5.4\u00b11.9 mg/dl, p =0.002). However, no signicant differences in disease duration, Raynaud's phenomenon, antiphospholipid antibod- ies were found between these groups. In multivariate analysis, higherserum UA level was independently associated with the presence ofPAH. Interestingly, serum UA level correlated signicantly (r =0.453, p \\0.001). Conclusions: Clinically silent PAH is not uncommon in SLE patients.Serum UA level may be useful as a surrogate marker for screening of PAH. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-406 ZERO FLOW GLOBAL ISCHEMIA-INDUCED INJURIES IN RAT HEART ARE ATTENUATED BY NATURAL HONEY M. Naja1,*, F. Zahednezhad2, M. Samadzadeh2, H. Vaez2 1Department of Pharmacology, Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran Objectives: In the present study, effects of preischemic administration of natural honey on cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction sizeduring zero flow global ischemia were investigated in isolated rat heart. Materials and methods: The isolated hearts were subjected to 30 min zero flow global ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion thenperfused by a modied drug free Krebs-Henseleit solution throughoutthe experiment (control) or the solution containing 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2% of natural honey for 15 min before induction of global ischemia (treated groups), respectively. Cardiac arrhythmias were determinedbased on the Lambeth conventions and Myocardial infarction the control group, while preischemic perfusion of honey (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2%)reduced \u00b111, \u00b11.1% (P \\0.001), respectively. A direct linear correlation between honey concentrations and infarction size reduc-tion was observed (R 2=0.9948). In addition, total number of ventricular ectopic beats were signicantly decreased by all used concentrations of honey (P \\0.05) during reperfusion time. Honey (0.25, 0.5 and 1%) also lowered incidence of irreversible ventricularbrillation (P \\0.05). Moreover, number and duration of ventricular tachycardia were reduced in all honey treated groups.Conclusion: Preischemic administration of natural honey before zero flow global ischemia can protect isolated rat heart against ischemia/ reperfusion injuries as reduction of infarction size and arrhythmias.Maybe, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of honey,reduction of necrotized tissue and providing energy sources may involve in these cardioprotective effects of honey.

One mechanism is ability of MSCs to secrete cytokines. It is important assess changes of growthfactors in serum after therapy. Purpose: Assess TGF b, VEGF-C and GM-CSF concentrations in the serum of rats after postinfarct intramyocardial injection of mesen-chymal stem cells.Materials and methods: The experiment were conducted on 32 adult male Wistar rats. Myocardial infarction was simulated by the cry- odestruction of the left ventricular anterior wall. Mesenchymal stemcells were derived from rat bone marrow and injected into myocar-dium 21 days after cryoinjury. In the control group, normal saline was infused. The blood levels of TGF b, VEGF-C and GM-CSF were measured at 3, 7 and 14 days.Results: The mean serum TGF bin group with MSCs was 40.53 \u00b17.9 ng/ml on day 3, and this signicant (p \\0.05) increase a compared with control group (15.99 \u00b16.9 ng/ml). The maximum TGF bconcentration after transplantation (62.35 \u00b1 33.02 ng/ml). On day 20.8 \u00b1 10.02 ng/ml. The maximum VEGF-C concentration in the group with MSCs was noted on day 3 after transplantation 132.2 \u00b118.94 pg/ml. By 7 days VEGF-C levels reduced to 72.88 \u00b129.48 pg/ml. There was an increase the content of VEGF-C by day 14. No statistically signicant differences between control and groups with MSCs were observed. GM- CSF concentration was 14.05 \u00b16.08 pg/ml and there were no signi- cant changes on 7 and 14 days. No statistically signicant differencesbetween control and treated groups were observed. Conclusions: Introduction of mesenchymal cells into the infarcted myocardium stimulated increase TGF bin the peripheral blood of rats.

P-408 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFLAMMATION AND VITAMIN D IN ALGERIAN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION Y. Ghedada1,*, N. Kacimi1, G. Kacimi1S218 Inflamm. Res. 1231Central Hospital of Army Mohamed Seghir Nekkache, Algiers, Algeria Introduction: Hypertension is a multifactorial trait resulting from the combined influence of environmental and genetic determinants. It remains a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is there-fore one of the most important causes of premature morbidity andmortality in developed and developing countries. Very recent studies have focused on the relationship between inflammation and arterial stiffness in essential hypertension. Furthermore, according to thelatest research, Vitamin D deciency may increase the risk ofdeveloping hypertension. Because of lingering uncertainty of these associations, we examined in this study, the link between serum concentration of vitamin D and inflammation in blood samples ofAlgerian patients with hypertension. The Inflammation status was evaluated with serums levels of ferritin and c-reactive protein. Patients and methods: The study was conducted on 53 Algerian patientssuffering from hypertension: 34 women and 19 men. The middle agewas: 49 \u00b17.5 years. For each patient, we measured serum of: CRPus and Ferritin by immunoturbidimetric assay D by electrochemiluminescence technology on elecsys 2010.Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides byenzymatic colorimetric method on integra 400. Results: In our cohort of hypertensive patients, we noted a signicant elevation of CRP levels on the one hand and low levels of vitamin D onthe other. The correlation coefcient between CRP and vitamin D was (r=0.39, p \\0.0005). A positive correlation was found between CRP and LDL cholesterol (r =0.13, p \\0.001) but not with other lipid parameters. And no correlation was observed between ferritinand vitamin D in both sexes. Conclusion: In conclusion, our work reveal the existence of a close association between low serum levels of vitamin D and inflammationassessed by CRP levels and not by ferritin levels in hypertensivepatients in Algeria.

Hannou1, France locus, which contains the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a, is associated with an increased risk of age-related inflam- matory diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, inwhich macrophages play a crucial role. Monocytes can polarize towards classically (CAM U) or alternatively (AAM U) activated macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition ofthese phenotypes are not well dened. a phenotype resembling macrophages. In line with this observation, p16 -/-BMDM displayed a decreased response to classically polarizing IFNg and LPS and an increased sensitivity to alternatively polarizing IL-4.Furthermore, mice transplanted with p16 -/-bone marrow displayed higher hepatic AAM Umarker expression levels upon Schistosoma mansoni infection, an in vivo model of AAM Uphenotype-skewing. Surprisingly, p16-/-BMDM did not display increased IL-4-induced STAT6 signaling, but rather a decrease in STAT1 and IKKa,b phos- phorylation, which correlated and a phage activation and polarization via the JAK-STAT pathway with possible roles in inflammatory diseases.

Brain1 1Cardiovascular Division, Kings College London, London, UK Background: The CGRP family of peptides, signal via unique receptors that comprise of a G-protein-linked calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) with a single transmembrane protein receptor associatedmodifying protein (RAMP) that forms 3 distinct types, RAMP1,RAMP2 and RAMP3. Of these, CLR linked with RAMP1 leads to a high afnity CGRP receptor, CLR with RAMP2 or RAMP3 leads to ADM receptors (McLatchie et al., 1999). We and others have goodevidence that ADM mediates vascular protection through the CLR- RAMP2 receptor (Tam et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2009). Material and methods: RAMP1, 2 & 3, CLR, ADM and CGRP geneexpressions were monitored in human carotid endarterectomy speci-mens in stable and unstable lesions (Collot-Teixeira et al., 2009). Total RNA was extracted from unstable (n =15) and stable (n =12) atherosclerotic lesions, retrotranscribed and gene expression wasassayed using quantitative real time PCR. Gene expression datanormalisation was carried out against the geometric mean of three reference genes (18S, GAPDH and PPIA) and analysed using the DDCt method. Statistical analyses were performed using unpairedt-test with Welch's correction. Results: Results show a signicant decrease of RAMP1 gene expression and increase in RAMP2, CLR and ADM gene expressionsin ''unstable'' atherosclerotic ''stable'' parts ofthe lesions. RAMP3 and CGRP did not show any change in expression. Conclusion: CGRP is a potent vasodilator with vascular protectiveproperties and structurally related to the vascular protective peptideADM, with which it shares a unique family of receptors. This study suggests that the CGRP receptor pathway may be downregulated as the atherosclerotic plaque develops, but conversely the ADM pathwaymay be upregulated. The switch in the signalling activities of thispeptide family as the plaque develops is of potential interest to understanding possibly lack of adverse effects for CGRP antagonists, currently under development for migraine.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res. CORONARY SYNDROMES PRESENTED WITHOUT ELEVATION, NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS IN ACUTE SYNDROME (PLEATRIAL) N. Lomakin1,*, A. Gruzdev1, B. Sidorenko1 1Cardiology and Internal Medicine, Central Clinical Hospital of President Department, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: NSAIDs are the most frequently prescribed drugs in the world. There are a lot of controversial information published duringrecent years about NSAID cardiosafety. It is still unclear do NSAIDs develop cardioprotective or negative effects in acute coronary patients. Aim of the study was to investigate safety and efcacy oflornoxicam, nonselective COX-inhibitor, in patients with acute cor-onary syndrome (NSTEACS) and to evaluate the influence of lornoxicam on the inflammatory markers. Methods: Overall 85 patients with NSTEACS were randomized to theprospective single-blind trial to receive lornoxicam (8/12 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg) or aspirin alone for 15 days. Primary end points were: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct, nonfatalstroke, unstable angina.Results: According to the 6 months follow-up there were a signicant reduction of primary end points in patients receiving lornoxicam compared with placebo (8.5 vs. 33.3%, OR =0.18, P =0.006). There was also signicantly lower unstable angina event rate in lornoxicamgroup (4.2 vs. 18.1%, OR =0.20, P =0.04). CRP the lorn- oxicam group (n =47) were signicantly lower at 15 days compared to placebo and base line levels [from 19.3 to 7.62 mg/l in lornoxicamgroup (60.5%) vs. from 41.1 to 26.1 mg/l in placebo group (36.5%),p\\0.01]. There were also nonsignicant lower IL-6 levels at 15 days in the lornoxicam group [from 15.3 to 5.0 pg/ml in lornoxicam group (67.4%) vs. 18.4 to 9.02 pg/ml in placebo group (50%), p \\0.15]. The anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels were signicantly higher at 15 days in lornoxicam group compared with placebo (p =0.04). No adverse complications associated with the lornoxicam treatment wereobserved.Conclusion: Lornoxicam plus aspirin was associated with signicant reductions in adverse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome patients without ST-segment elevation. Additional larger trials are required toconrm the ndings of this study.Disclosure of interest: None OF Niigata, JapanObjectives: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease which is accelerated by chronic infection such as periodontitis. NKT cells havebeen shown to accelerate atherosclerosis in mouse model and human. NKT cells can recognize lipid antigens derived from bacterial pathogens presented by CD1d, and have a potent ability to produceIFN-c, a potentially pro-atherogenic cytokine. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the role of NKT cells in infection-related ath- erogenic response in mouse model. and methods: CD1d -/-mice with C57BL/6 background and C57BL/6 mice which administered a-galactosylceramide (aGalCer) were orally infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis ,a representative pathogen of periodontitis, 10 times at 3-day intervals. After completion of infection alveolar bone loss and atherogenesis-related gene expression in liver and artery were examined.Results: CD1d -/-mice demonstrated less alveolar bone resorption increased resorption IL-6 level was increased inboth CD1d -/-andaGalCer-administered mice. In liver, gene expressions of and TNF- awere down-regulated in up-regulated in aGalCer-administered mice. In artery, CCL2 and early growth response 1 gene expression wasdown-regulated and natriuretic peptide precursor B was up-regulated in CD1d -/-mice compared to wild type mice, however, opposite tendency was seen in aGalCer-administered mice. Conclusion: In accelerating process of atherogenesis by chronicperiodontal infection, NKT cells play a role as effectors which pro- mote inflammatory response in liver and artery.

CXCL12, CXCR4 and CXCR7 protein expression, hemodynamic parameters, right ventricular mass, extent of vascular remodeling andperivascular progenitor cell accumulation were studied. Chronichypoxia-exposed mice showed increased total lung tissue expression of CXCR4, CXCR7 and CXCL12 after development of pulmonary hypertension. This was associated with signicantly increased rightventricular systolic pressure, and evidence of right remodeling and perivascular c-kit+/sca-1+ progenitor cell accumulation. CCX771 administration did not abro- gate these effects. In contrast, administration of AMD3100, whetheralone or combined with CCX771, prevented vascular remodeling, pulmonary hypertension and perivascular accumulation of c-kit+/sca- 1+ progenitor cells, with a synergistic effect of these agents.

P-415 EFAVIRENZ INDUCES HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ACCUMULATION THROUGH MAC-1 AND GP150.95 ACTIVATION S. Orden1, C. Pablo1, J. V. Esplugues1,2, A. Alvarez1,2,* 1Department of Pharmacology, University of Valencia, Spain, 2CIBERehd, Valencia, Spain Background: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as myo- cardial infarction and atherosclerosis. Efavirenz (EFV) is one of themost widely used antiretroviral agents and, thus, cannot be ruled outas a causal agent of these side effects. The present study was designed to assess the role of clinically relevant doses of EFV on human leu- kocyte-endothelial cell interactions in vitro, which are a hallmark ofthe early stages of these pathological states.Methods: The interaction leukocytes-peripheral blood (HUVEC) was analysed using the par-allel plate flow chamber system. Leukocyte b 2integrin and endothelial expression of adhesion molecules was evaluated by flow cytometry. A one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test were per- formed and statistical signicance was set at *p \\0.01 (vs. vehicle). Results: Clinical concentrations of EFV induced dose- analysed, EFV was found to increase Mac-1 and gp150.95 expression in both neutrophils and monocytes, despiteproducing no effect on the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1 Blocking antibodies against Mac-1, gp150.95 or prevented the rolling PMN induced by EFV.Conclusions: EFV induces signicant human leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions at clinically relevant doses and promotes the acti- vation of Mac-1 and gp150.95. This leukocyte activation may beresponsible for the leukocyte recruitment that leads to the vasculardamage associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction observed in HIV patients treated with HAART.

Kondo1 1Department of Forensic Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan,2Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, JapanThe ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) mediates the main proteolytic pathway of targeted protein degradation in the cell. UPS dysfunctionhas been observed in animal models of pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy and failure. UPS dysfunction has also been implicated in failing human hearts. Both clinical observation and some animalexperiments have suggested that proteasome functional insufciencymay play an important role in the development of congestive heart failure. It has been well elucidated that IFN- cresults in replacement of the with and b5i, respectively. The different proteasome complexes, such as the regular proteasome and immunoproteasome, exhibit different catalytic efciencies. These catalytic alternations in the immunoproteasome produce well-dened effects on the antigenprocessing for major histocompatibility complex class I. However, aprecise function of immunoproteasome in a pressure overload-induced heart remodeling has not been identied. To address this, we examined mouse model of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy induced bytransverse aortic banding (TAB) using Balb/c mice (WT) and IFN- c decient mice. Three weeks after TAB, substantial hypertrophic changes of the hearts were observed in WT mice with mild broticchanges of the left ventricle. On the other hand, IFN- cdecient mice exhibited more signicant hypertrophic change with exaggerated brosis in the hearts, compared with WT mice. After TAB, both mRNA and protein levels of immunosubunit b1i (LMP2) signicantly increased in left ventricles of WT mice but not in those of IFN- c decient mice. Furthermore, more signicant polyubiquitinated pep- tides accumulated in the hearts of IFN- cdecient mice, compared with WT mice. These observations suggest that IFN- cplays a protective role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy though the induction of immunoproteasome activation.

Among identied proteins are cyto- skeleton proteins and enzymes implicated in glycolysis. Ingenuitysoftware analysis interestingly showed that numerous proteins over- expressed in HMVEC-D compared to HUVEC are implicated in the retinoic acid pathway.Conclusion: Major differences were observed between proteomes ofmacro-vascular and micro-vascular EC.

Increased plasma endothelialmicroparticles (EMPs) are biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in CV diseases, associate with high-risk angiographic lesions and predict future CV events in CAD.Aim: To investigate the role of SAA in EMP generation in culturedprimary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and determine whether EMPs could reflect SAA-induced procoagulant and/or proinflammatory responses in HCAEC.Methods: HCAEC were stimulated with human recombinant SAA(1,000 nM; 4, 8, 16, 24 h). EMPs were isolated from culture super- natants by differential centrifugation. Flow cytometry was used to number, Annexin V binding, CD31, CD62E and IL- 8 levels (p \\0.01). CD62E antigen was expressed only on SAA- induced EMPs and reflected time-dependent changes in CD62EmRNA levels, indicating cell activation. TF mRNA expression, TF surface exposure and activity in HCAEC peaked at 4 h following SAA stimulation and were accompanied by TF surface exposure andactivity on EMPs. Later during SAA stimulation TF expression and activity progressively decreased in SAA-induced HCAEC and EMPs, suggesting tight TF regulation.Conclusion: SAA release of EMPs from primary SAA-induced EMPs reflected early procoagulant and late proin-flammatory HCAEC responses and may serve as surrogate biomarkers and/or mediators of SAA-induced changes of endothelial 1Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Do Estado Do De Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,2Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal de e Inovac \u00b8ao, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Cardiovascular diseases represent the major cause of mortality in western countries. Among these conditions, atherosclerosis is themost prominent one. A hallmark of atherosclerosis is the atheroma- tous plaque formation, characterized by different disturbances, like vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation. Under the effectof different pathological stimuli, VSMC are able to migrate and proliferate, contributing to the brous cap formation. Notably, these events occur mainly in sinuous vessels, and are associated to turbulentblood flow, what may lead to hemolysis and consequent free hemeaccumulation. Our group has characterized heme as a proinflamma- tory molecule that mediates its effect via NADPH oxidase complex activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this workwe aim to elucidate the putative role of free heme in VSMC physi-ology and the molecular mechanisms underlying the affected processes. We observed that free heme induces VSMC migration and proliferation in a ROS-dependent manner. Heme-induced ROS pro-duction relies on diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor completely abolished this effect, and also and pro-liferate effect. Additionally, heme activates pathway, such as MAP kinases and NFkB. It was also observed a critical and with HO inhibitorspotentiated heme proliferative effect. In summary we show that free heme induces VSMC proliferation via NADPH oxidase activation, which is elegantly counter-regulated by HO-1 activity, and thedepiction of the signaling events underlying this process may lead tothe development of novel and more effective therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases (Financial Support: FAPERJ, CAPES, CNPq).Disclosure of interest: None HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC PATIENTS ATORVASTATIN Anadolu University Faculty of Pharmacy, Eskisehir, Turkey Statins which inhibit the enzyme HMG CoA reductase are used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. These HMG-CoA reductaseinhibitors have antiinflammatory properties, but their effect on neopterin which are produced by interferon-g stimulated macrophages largely unknown. Also chitotriosidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO)are produced during the inflammatory process in pro-atherogenic statewithin the vasculature. In this regard we aimed to search effects of atorvastatin terapies on inflammation which induce cardiovascular disease risk in hypercholesterolemic patients.Material and methods: The study included 30 patients who were diagnosed as hypercholesterolemic (0 month) ( [200 mg/dl). All patients were treated by atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 3 months(3 months). Control group was composed of healthy individuals(n=30). Bloods samples were taken before and 3 months after treatment. Neopterin levels were measured by HPLC method, MPO activity was measured by spectrophotometric method and chitotrios-idase activity were measured by fluorometric method in both groups.Results: Chitotriosidase activity was higher in hypercholesterolemic patients compared to control. (37.8 \u00b112.3 vs. 21.5 \u00b18.4 nmol/L, p\\0.001).

Both MPO and neopterin levels decreased after 3 months atorvastatin therapy in hypercholesterolemicpatients (p \\0.01 U/L for both). Conclusions: Atorvastatin therapy is effective therapeutic strategy in decreasing inflammation which increases the incidence of cardio vascular diseases in hypercholesterolemic patients beyond decreasingserum Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey Introduction: Hypercholesterolemia usually occurs prior to the onset of atherosclerosis and renders tissue more susceptible to inflammation. In this process some markers of activated macrophages like chitotriosi-dase and myeloperoxidase are released into circulation. In this regard we aimed to assess the antiinflammatory effects of atorvastatin and glitazone using an in vivo hypercholesterolemic rat model.Material and methods: The control group (group I) fed basal diet. Allother animals fed with hypercholesterolemic diet which contains 2% (w/w) cholesterol and 1% cholic acid in basal diet for 8 weeks.

Jonasson1 1Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linko \u00a8ping, Sweden,2Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical Medicine, Linko \u00a8ping University, Linko \u00a8ping, Sweden Atherosclerosis is considered a Th1-dominated inflammatory disease, but there is a growing interest for the role of CD8+T cells. The cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells has been reported to be influenced by CD56. We hypothesized that the distribution and cytokine-producing capacity of CD56+CD8+T cells was altered in patients with coronary artery disease compared with healthy individuals. We also examinedif the expression of Annexin 1 in CD56 +CD8+T cells was related to a Type 1 response. Blood was collected from 30 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 36healthy controls. Blood sampling was repeated in patients at 3 and12 months. T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using antibodies to CD3, CD8 and CD56. Whole blood from 9 ACS, 14 SA and 10 controls was stimulated ex vivo and intracellular staining for IFN- cand Annexin 1 was determined by flow cytometry. Data are given as mean (SD). Total numbers of CD56 +CD8+T cells were similar in ACS and SA but higher compared with controls, 184 (160) versus 109(83) cells/ ll, p=0.003. The proportions of CD56 +CD8+T cells were expanded in patients, 30 (19) versus 23 (11)%, p =0.05, not changing over time. Upon mitogenic stimulation, the majority of CD56+CD8+T cells produced IFN- cand TNF, but no IL-10, IL-13 or IL-17, with no difference between ACS, SA and controls. After stimulation, an increased expression of Annexin1 was seen in IFN- c+ cells, p \\0.001. However in ACS, the Annexin 1 MFI expression was markedly lower compared with SA and controls, 45735 (8381),65581 (9369), and 70806 (20372), p =0.001. In and SA patients, accumulations of peripheral CD56 +CD8+T cells seem to be a constitutive phenomenon independent of clinical manifestation. Thecells are high producers of IFN- cand TNF which may indicate an increased Type 1 activity in the patients. The differential expression of Annexin 1 highlights its potential role in ACS.

It is known that hESC or hESC-EC do not respond to LPS [1]. Thus, the full extent of how these hESC-EC function is notknown. Endothelial cells release the vasoconstrictor hormone endo- thelin-1 (ET-1), elevated levels of which are associated with vascular inflammation. In the current study we have compared the ability ofunstimulated human endothelial cells from umbilical vein (HUVEC),human aorta (HAEC) and the microvasculature of the lung (HMVEC) hESC-EC to release ET-1. ET-1 is produced by endothelial cells under basal culture conditions, but can be increased further by agonistsincluding thrombin. hESC-EC were derived as described previously[1]. All cells were cultured for 24 h in endothelial cell specic medium (Lonza-EGM2). ET-1 release in conditioned media was measured by ELISA. For hESC-EC and HUVEC, experiments were run in paralleland cell number was assessed by nuclear staining with DAPI andautomated cell counting. HAEC and HMVEC were run in separate experiments but under ET-1 (data are mean \u00b1SEM). How- ever, hESC-EC failed to release detectable levels of ET-1 in this time period ( \\42 pg/ml). There was signicant other types of human endothelial cells, hESC-EC released relatively low levels of ET-1. As ET-1 can contribute to cardiovascular disease thiscould represent a benet of hESC-EC over native endothelium in adamaged organ. However, the ndings remain preliminary and a detailed examination of the ET-1 pathway in these cells remains the subject of investigation.

Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is a cytokine produced by lymphocytesthat mediates a wide variety of inflammatory, immunostimulatory, andantiviral responses. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the clinical manifestation of the chronic development of coronary artery atheroma,with the nal process of plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis. The aim of this study sought to assess the association of LTA Thr26Asn polymorphism with AMI. One hundred and sixty eight AMI patientswere compared to 169 healthy controls. The Frequencies of the LTAThr/Thr, Thr/Asn, and Asn Asn genotypes among AMI patients were 45.8, 46.4, and 7.8%, respectively, and in controls were 43.1, 45, and 10.9%, respectively. There was no signicant difference in the distri-bution of LTA Thr26Asn genotypes or in the allelic frequenciesbetween AMI patients and controls (P =0.098). The frequency of Asn/ Asn genotype not increased with the number of stenoses in coronary vessels in AMI patients. In conclusions, the LTA gene is not associatedwith susceptibility to AMI and not influences the severity.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Soares2,* 1Department of Pathology, School of Medicine-UNESP, of Tropical Diseases, Botucatu, Brazil,4Department of Surgery and Orthopedics, School of Medicine-UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil Introduction and objectives: Arterial peripheral disease is a con- dition caused by the blocking of blood flow as a result of cholesterol deposit in the arteries of the arms, legs and aorta. Studies have shown that macrophages in the atherosclerotic plaqueare highly activated, and this process makes these cells importantantigen presenting cells, with the development of a specic immune response, having LDLox as a possible inducing antigen. As functional changes of cells which participate in the athero-genesis process may occur in the peripheral blood, the objective ofthe present study was to evaluate plasma levels of anti -inflamma- tory and inflammatory cytokines such as, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IFN- c, IL-10 and TGF- bin patients with peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans, as well as the level of monocyte activation in the peripheral blood through the ability of these cells to release hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and to develop fungicidal activity of patients were detected by ELISA. Monocyte cultures activated with TNF- aand IFN-cwere evaluated by FA against C. albicans using plating and CFU recovery and by H 2O2production. Results: Plasma levels of all cytokines were signicantly higher in patients compared to those detected in control subjects. Monocytes from control group did not release substantial levels of H 2O2, however, these levels were signicantly increased after activation with IFN- cand TNF-a. We found that patient's monocytes, before and after the acti- vation process, showed lower responses than control subjects. Similar results were found when FA was evaluated. The results of the patientswere always signicantly smaller than those detected for controls. Conclusions: The results revealed an unresponsiveness state of patient's monocytes in vitro probably due to the high activationprocess occurring in vivo as evidenced by high plasma levels ofcytokines.

Among a variety of soybeans, black soybean displays superior biological activities to yellow or green soybeans such as in antioxidant capacity,anti-inflammatory activity and anticancer activity. However, fewstudies have been directed on the effect of black soybean on car- diovascular function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of black soybean extract (BB) on platelet activation, a critical con-tributor to thrombotic diseases. In the freshly isolated human platelets, 20% ethanol extract of black soybean has shown potent and selective inhibitory activities on collagen-induced platelet aggrega-tion while yellow bean extract had no activities. Serotonin secretionand P-selective expression, important factors for platelet-tissue interaction were also decreased along with reduced thromboxane A 2 formation by BB treatment. These in vitro results were further con- rmed in ex vivo platelet aggregation measurement and in vivovenous aggregation and FeCl 3-induced thrombus formation. clotting time and bleeding time was not affectedby BB administration, indicating that black soybean can be a novel dietary supplement for the prevention of thrombotic diseases and improvement of blood circulation.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-428 MOLECULAR PATTERN AND HLA-DR INB- THALASSEMIA PATIENTS COMPLICATED BY MYOCARDITIS IN UPPER EGYPT Bakry1,*, Khaled A. 1South Egypt Cancer Institute HLA Lab and Molecular Biology Lab, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut, are common in the Mediter- ranean population and were reported to be common in Egyptians. In dilated cardiomyopathy, immune related disorders show preferentialassociations with HLA genes. It was known that the mutationsoccurred with b- thalassemia major have a strong relation to severity and complication accompanying the disease. We aimed to study the frequency of the previous mentioned mutations and HLA-DR inUpper Egyptian b- thalassemia patients. Patients and methods: The study included 68 Egyptian patients with b- thalassemia major classied into two groups; the rst group was 35 patients suffering from left sided heart failure, while the second groupformed from 33 patients without heart failure. PCR amplicationusing ve oligonucleotides primers to the concerned mutations. Dot- blot analysis was carried out with allele-specic probes and detectionwas done by using streptavidin-peroxidase and Chemiluminescent liquid detection. HLA class II-DR was investigated for all patients and controls using sequence specic oligonucleotide (SSO).Results: The following frequencies were signi- cantly increased in patients with heart failure with a P value of \\0.02, Odds Ratio (OR) =3.3 and p \\0.01, OR =2.1, respectively. A statistical signicant difference was found between patients who are positive for IVS-I-1 and patients with heart failure (p \\0.02). Conclusions: The recorded frequencies of tested mutations are veryclose to the previous studies which were performed in Egyptian b- thalassemia patients. Immunogenetic pathogenesis mediated mecha- nism attributed to myocarditis must be considered in addition to other risky factors as iron overload.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-429 ESTABLISHMENT OF A CORONARY ARTERITISMURINE MODEL BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF PURE INNATE IMMUNE LIGANDS T. Hara1,*, H. Nishio1, S. Japan, 2Pathology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan Rationale: There is a line of evidence that activation of innate immune Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. With respect to nucleo- tide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLRs) proteinfamily, an exact role in the cardiovascular system remains to beclaried. Objective: We investigated the effects of stimulants for NLRs on human artery endothelial cells in vitro and murine arteries in vivo.Methods and Results: Human coronary artery endothelial cells(HCAEC) were challenged in vitro with microbial components that stimulate NLRs or TLRs. We found the stimulatory effects of NLR and TLR ligands on the adhesion molecule expression and cytokinesecretion by HCAEC. Based on these in vitro results, we examined the in vivo effects of these ligands in mice. Among NLR Furthermore, coronary arteritis/valvulitis developed after direct oral administration or ad lib drinking of FK565. The degree of respective vascular inflammation was associated with per-sistent high expression of proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine andmatrix metallopeptidase genes in each tissue in vivo by microarray analysis. Conclusions: This is the rst coronary arteritis animal model inducedby oral administration of a pure synthetic Nod1 ligand. The presentstudy has rst demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specic vascular inflammation, especially coro- None declared.Inflamm. Res. S225 123P-430 DEVELOPMENT OF A PRIMARY HUMAN MACROPHAGE-DERIVED FOAM MODEL TO STUDY INFLAMMATORY AND PRO-RESOLVINGMEDIATORS ISSUED FROM ARACHIDONIC, EICOSAPENTAENOIC AND DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACIDS cellular inltration in the arterial intima of several cell types, including monocytes. Then, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and become foam cells after oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake. The aim ofthis work was to develop a model of primary human macrophage-derived foam cells and to study their inflammatory prole. We have focused our attention on the capacity of macrophage-derived foam cells to metabolize polyunsaturated free fatty acids into inflammatoryand pro-resolving molecules. Methods: this purpose, monocytes from human donor were dif- ferentiated into macrophages, which were then incubated in thepresence of oxLDL. The uptake of oxLDL was associated with anincrease of total cholesterol and a higher level of cholesterol ester into the cells. We have then incubated those cells in presence of arachi- donic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids to evaluate thecapacity of macrophage-derived foam cells to synthetize lipid medi-ators after their stimulation by a phorbol myristate and a calcium ionophore. Supernatant were then collected and mediators analyzed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology to quantitatively evaluate bioactive lipids production. Results: We showed that in presence of oxLDL, macrophage-derivedfoam cells produce more inflammatory (TXB2, PGE2) and oxidativestress mediators (5-oxo-ETE) than cells that have not received ox- LDL. On the other hand, those cells still have their capacity to produce pro-resolving mediators such as the precursors of resolvins,protectins and maresin.Conclusions: Taking together these results demonstrate that the model of human macrophage-derived foam cells developed here is a valu- able tool to screen the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid on theresolution of inflammation in an atherosclerotic plaque.

Natural products and their analogues modied syntheti-cally are molecules of great interest. The aim of our investigation is to study the anti-inflammatory effect of the natural product extracted from Tabebuia , lapachol, and its synthetic derivative, a new ptero- carpanquinone. LQB 118, in the inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation model, using C57J/BL6 mice. Our results demonstrated that intraperitonial treatment with 1 mg/kg of lapachol or LQB 118 reduced neutrophil influx to lungs in mice submitted toinhaled LPS (0.5 mg/mL). Additionally, LQB 118 reduced the con-centration of the inflammatory mediators TNF-a and KC in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). These effects of LQB 118 are comparable to those of dexamethasone or aspirin, two well-estab-lished anti-inflammatory drugs. The reduction of mediatorsconcentration by LQB 118 is partially due to reduction of NF-kB activation in the cell lungs. In vitro, LQB 118 also inhibited TNF-a production in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells of human peripheralblood (PBMC). The highest concentration tested (100 mM) was able to inhibit almost 100% of TNF-a liberation. These data conrm the anti-inflammatory action of lapachol observed in a paw edema model(Almeida de et al., 1990), and reveal the lapachol derivative, LQB118, as a potent modulator of inflammation, through the reduction of inflammatory mediators.

The airway epithelium acts as a barrier protecting the lung from inhaled substances notably airborne pollutants. In some respiratoryinflammatory disease such as asthma, these substances can either induce and/or exacerbate the disease. Situated beside airways epi- thelial cells and at the junction of innate and adaptative immunity,dendritic cells (DCs) have an important role in setting up howimmune responses are initiated and perpetuated. The aim of our study is to better understand how bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) could interact with DCs particularly when epithelium is submitted toenvironmental risk factor such as particulate matter (PM). For thispurpose, we used a coculture system composed of BECs differenti- ated in air-liquid interface and monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (iDC), placed on basolateral side of BECs. Particulate matter arethen added on apical surface of BECs. The expression of different cytokines/chemokines (IL-8, CCL-20, TSLP for example), which are notably involved in T cell activation and DCs chemoattraction, wasstudied in BECs by RT-PCR or ELISA. We have shown that cocul-ture of BECs with iDC could regulate release of some molecules involved in inflammation process or DCs chemoattraction. However, addition of PM on this system seems to have little effect on theseexpressions. Devising of BECs/DCs coculture system could allowimitating rst step of airways epithelium responses to inhaled sub- stances and notably better understanding the modulation of antigenic presentation and immune system activation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.S226 Inflamm. Res. 123P-434 CRUCIAL ROLE OF IL-1 AND IL-23 IN EARLY IL-17A EXPRESSION LEADING TO PULMONARY INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS I. Couillin1,*, P. Gasse1, N. Riteau1, V, Paris, France Idiopathic pulmonary brosis is a devastating as yet untreatable dis- ease. Using the murine model of bleomycin-induced acute lung injuryresulting in pulmonary brosis we reported before that neutrophilairway influx, remodeling and lung brosis depend on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to mature IL-1b production. Since interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokineinvolved in neutrophil recruitment and chronic lung pathologies, we asked whether IL-17 plays a role in lung injury-induced inflammation and brosis. We nd that IL-17A pulmonary expression is upregu-lated after bleomycin or rmIL-1b administration in the airways. Lunginflammation, remodeling and brosis are diminished in IL-17RA decient mice or after IL-17A antibody neutralization. Early IL-17A producing cells in response to lung injury are mostly gdT cells and ina lesser extent CD4abT cells. Finally local bleomycin or IL-1badministration enhanced pulmonary inflammation, remodeling and brosis which are IL-23p19 dependent. In conclusion, we highlighted the existence of an IL-1b-IL-23-IL-17A axis. IL-17A and IL-17RAsignaling play a pivotal role in bleomycin-induced acute lung inflammation and brosis, IL-1b and IL-23p19 expression being critically involved in IL-17A dependent lung pathology.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-435 EFFECTS OF NCX 226, A COMPOUND TARGETING ENDOTHELIN RECEPTORS ANDNO PATHWAY, ON MONOCROTALINE-INDUCED PULMONARY HYPERTENSION AND BLEOMYCIN-INDUCED LUNG FIBROSIS MODELS A.

NO is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-brotic actions and improve microcirculation. We tested the effects of NCX 226 in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension (PAH) in the rat andbleomycin-induced lung brosis in the mouse, in comparison withbosentan. Methods: PAH : monocrotaline s.c. was administered to Sprague- Dawley rats then treated orally with test compounds (NCX 226 andbosentan in equimolar doses to 100 and 300 mg/kg) for 21 days.Endpoints: right ventricular pressure (RVP) and cardiac mass ratio. Lung brosis : Bleomycin was instilled intra-tracheally in C57BL/6 mice then treated orally for 14 days with NCX 226 or bosentan(equimolar at 10 and 30 mg/kg). Endpoints : airways resistance, logical (collagen, andbiochemical reduced RVP but only NCX 226 had signicant reductions in weight ratio of right ventricle/left ventri-cle + sectum. Both compounds did not affect systolic blood pressure . Lung brosis : Both test drugs prevented bleomycin-induced airway stiffness, being NCX 226 better. High dose NCX 226 was signicantly more effective than equimolar bosentan in mg/ vs. vehi- cle*or vasculogenesis. Conclusion: NCX 226 and bosentan were active in the two models. NCX 226 showed improved efcacy over bosentan on RVP and cardiacmass ratio in PAH and in reducing key inflammatory parameters (e.g., leukocyte inltration, TGF- band oxidative stress) in lung brosis, conrming a potential benecial role for NO in THE LUNG INFLAMMATION INDUCEDBY INTESTINAL ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION MODIFIES OVER THE DAYS OF REPERFUSION L. B. Vitoretti1,*, A. C. Breithaupt-Faloppa1, J. A. Gimenes-Ju \u00b4nior1, L. S. Sudo-Hayashi1, B. W. Tavares de Lima1 1Pharmacology, Icb University Of Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Experimental and clinical studies have reported that intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induces acute lung inflammation (ALI), which is characterized by the release of many inflammatorymediators, neutrophil inltration and increased vascular permeability. It is known that inflammatory mediators, generated at the site of intestinal I/R, are transported by lymphatic system and, reaching thelungs, contributes to ALI. Nevertheless, data on late effects ofintestinal I/R in ALI are still fragmented. Material and methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 45 min of ischemia of the superior mesenteric artery and then to 2, 24, 72 or120 h of reperfusion. After these times of reperfusion, the activity ofmyeloperoxidase (MPO) and the extravasation of Evans blue dye (EB) in lungs were determined. Some inflammatory mediators in lymph and in lung explants were quantied.Results: The MPO activity and the EB extravasation in lung after 2 h ofreperfusion increased, but have not changed from basal after 24 and 72 h. However, after 120 h of reperfusion they increased again. Lymph collected from intestinal I/R animals contains signicant amounts explants reperfused animals revealed that while the levels of IL-1b increased during the hours of reperfusion, the levels of IL-10 decreased. Theamount of IL-6 is higher after 2 h of reperfusion than in the othersperiods studied, whereas the levels of VEGF increased only after 120 h of reperfusion.Inflamm. Res. S227 123Conclusion: Our data indicate that the time of reperfusion mediates lung inflammation. Lymph and blood-borne inflammatory mediatorsparticipate in the onset/maintenance of pulmonary inflammation. It is possible that the regulation of endogenous control of inflammation is altered and may contribute to pulmonary inflammation observed after120 h of reperfusion.Financial support: brosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR protein is amembrane chloride channel expressed on mucosal epithelia as lung. Defective membrane CFTR is instrumental in mediating lung inflammation. Inflammatory cells secrete serine-proteases as neutro-phil elastase (NE), which have well described deleterious effects onthe integrity of lung tissue. However, the effect of proteases on CFTR has not yet been addressed. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of NE on CFTR both at structural and func-tional levels. Our results show that NE is able to induce thedegradation of CFTR protein in lung epithelial cells leading to a loss of CFTR function. We also demonstrate that NE-induced CFTR NE is able to up-regulate calpa \u00a8n activity of calpa \u00a8ns. For the rst time we demonstrate here that NE, a serine-protease, induces the degradationof CFTR protein via a calpa \u00a8n-dependent pathway in airway epithelial cells. NE-induced CFTR degradation also leads to a loss of CFTR function. These results are of crucial importance since the absence ofCFTR plays a pivotal role in the induction of lung inflammation.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Ivanina2 1Department of Pediatrics, Lugansk State Medical University, 2Lugansk Municipal Children's Hospital No. 2, Lugansk, Ukraine Aim: To study peculiarities of clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children with connective tissue disorders (CTD). Methods: 64 children aged 1-18 with CAP were studied during 1 year.Patients were divided for analysis into two age groups: children up to3 years old (group A, n =16), and aged 4-18 (group B, n =48). All patients had manifestations of CTD. CAP was clinically and radio-graphically diagnosed with detection of serum antibodies (IgG and IgM) against intracellular pathogens measured by immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The presents of CTD made necessaryassessment of status of cardiovascular system in all patients.Results: All patients had CAP caused by atypical pathogens with indistinct clinical manifestations and symptoms. Recurrent course of CAP was in 54 (84.4%) patients. CAP caused by Chlamydophila pneumonia (Cp) was more frequent in group A\u2014in 15 (93.7% of thegroup) patients. CAP caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia (Mp) was more frequent in group B\u2014in 44 patients (91.6% of the group), in 6.8%\u2014together with Cp, in 27.3%\u2014with Cytomegalovirus . Asthma was diagnosed in 29 (45.3%) patients mainly of group B, with recurrentCAP in 10 (34.5% of patients with asthma); 62.1% of these children had pulmonary hypertension (PH). 44.4% of patients with PH had evidence of pulmonary brosis (PF), which led to pneumatocele (PC) in 27.7%,polyserositis (PS) in 11.1% and spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) in 3.4% of patients. Conclusions:1. Close relationship between CTD and CAP is revealed.2. Cp CAP was more frequent in children up to age of 3 years, Mp CAP\u2014in children aged 4-18. 3. More than one-third of patients with asthma had recurrent CAP.4. Asthma in children with CAP and CTD was more severe with development of PH, PF, PS, SP. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-439 ACTIVATION OF CALPAINS TRIGGERS LUNG INFLAMMATION INDUCED BY HYPERINFLATION D. Liu1, R. D. Minshall2, D. Schwartz1,G .H u2,* 1Anesthesiology,2Anesthesiology and Pharmacology, University Of Illinois College Of Medicine, Chicago, United States Proinflammatory cytokine generation and neutrophil inltration into the lung during mechanical ventilation are thought to play important roles in the development of ventilator-induced lung injury, although the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms which trigger lunginflammation are still not clear. Calpains, a family of Ca 2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases, have been shown to be involved in the inflammatory response and multiple organ failure. The aim of thepresent study was to determine the role of calpain in the pathogenesisof lung inflammation due to mechanical ventilation. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to high (28 ml/kg) tidal volume ventilation for 2 h in the absence and presence of pharmacological calpain inhibitor.Additionally, depletion of calpain expression in pulmonary micro-vascular endothelial cells in vivo using siRNA was performed at 48 h before ventilation. Mechanical ventilation caused a rapid (within minutes), persistent calpain activation and lung inflammation asevidenced by neutrophil recruitment, production of the cytokinesTNF-aand IL-6, hyperpermeability, and lung edema formation. Pharmaceutical depletion of calpain-1 or calpain-2 signicantly attenuated theseinflammatory responses caused by lung hyperinflation. Inhibition of calpain activation also reduced eNOS-mediated NO production and subsequent ICAM-1 phosphorylation induced by mechanical stretch.This study demonstrates that calpain activation during mechanicalventilation may trigger lung inflammation via eNOS/NO-mediated ICAM-1 phosphorylation and neutrophil recruitment. Thus, inhibition of calpain activation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for theS228 Inflamm.

P-440 INCREASED IL-33 EXPRESSION IN CYSTIC (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective CFTR in the CF lungdisease featuring mucus hypersecretion, neutrophilic inflammation,and impaired lung be fatal. Early life- Pseudo- monas aeruginosa (Psa) infection of the lungs occurs in 70% of individuals with CFTR mutation. Understanding the mechanisms bywhich CFTR mutation and Psa infections lead to airway inflammation and tissue injury is key in the process of designing future therapies. Interleukin (IL)-33 is an IL-1-like cytokine promoting neutrophilrecruitment and survival during sepsis. Other studies suggested thatbiologically active IL-33 would only be released upon cell necrosis. The potential role of IL-33 in CF disease has not yet been explored. Therefore, we sought determining whether IL-33 expression is ele-vated in CF lungs and if Psa infections contribute to its release. Ourresults showed increased IL-33 expression in airway epithelial cells (AECs) of CF lung tissue compared to healthy biopsies. Upon exposure to Psa diffusible material, AECs expressing the most com-mon mutation of CFTR, DF508, secrete more IL-33 than cells with wild-type CFTR gene. Upon infection with Psa, CFTR-decient mice also displayed increased up-regulation of IL-33 expression compared with wild-type littermates. Our results demonstrate for therst time that IL-33 is elevated in the airways of CF patients and propose that it is a Psa infection-triggered inflammatory time-bomb as IL-33 is released following tissue injury during exacerbations. Ourdata suggest that targeting IL-33 may provide a novel avenue to limitexaggerated airway's neutrophilic inflammation and morbidity in CF lung disease. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

GLPG0259, a potent inhibitor of MAPKAPK5 currently in Phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis, was characterized in various in vivo and in vitro models of inflammation and showedstrong capacity to inhibit cytokine-induced MMP expression as well as innate immune response. In view of similar processes in COPD pathogenesis, we investigated the efcacy of GLPG0259 in was proled in the addition of poly(dI-dC). IL-6 and CCL5 RNA levels were determined by qPCR. The in vivo efcacy was characterized in the mouse LPS model (serum TNF alevels) and in a 4-day tobacco smoke mouse model of COPD (inflammatory cellcounts and cytokine levels in bronchoalveloar lavage fluid (BALF), inflammatory gene expression in lung tissue). In NHBECs, GLPG0259 concentration-dependently inhibited both IL-6 and CCL5.In the strongly reduced the into to the p38 inhibitor BIRB796.

Sakalauskas1 1Department of Immunology,2Lab of Pulmonology, Institute for Biomedical Research, Lithuanian University Of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania Background: Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a newly described proinflam- matory cytokine which is expected to have an important role in autoimmune disorders. Recently, it was shown that chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary diseases have a component of autoimmunity, thoughthe role of IL-32 in those diseases is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate IL-32 concentration in different tissue compart- ments from patients with COPD, asthma and compare with healthysubjects.Methods: Outpatients aging from 40 to 80 years with stable COPD (n=51), asthma (n =31), and healthy subjects (n =9) were stud- ied. IL-32 concentration in IL-32 concentration was signicantly increased in all studied tissue compartments from patients with COPD in comparison toasthmatics and healthy and signicantly correlated with smoking history (pack years). There was no statisti-cally signicant difference of IL-32 concentration between asthmatics and healthy subjects. Conclusion: The fact that IL-32 concentration is increased in patientswith COPD and related to the smoking history let us suggest that IL- 32 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.

PDE4 inhibitors are in various stages ofdevelopment with roflumilast in particular being approved in Europe for treatment of COPD. OCID 2987 a novel PDE4 inhibitor was evaluated in murine models of asthma and COPD.Methods: In LPS induced acute lung injury model Sprague-Dawleyrats were exposed to LPS (100 mg/ml) for 40 min. For evaluation of neutrophil influx BALF (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid) was collected at 6 h and for TNF- aestimation at 1.5 h. In COPD model C57 mice were exposed to the tobacco smoke of 10 cigarettes/day for 20 days. 24 h after last cigarette smoke exposure BALF was collected and differential cell counts conducted. In guinea pig model of asthma,animals were sensitized and challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin.BALF was collected 48 h after last ovalbumin challenge for total cell count and differential cell count.Results: In LPS induced acute lung injury model OCID 2987 pro- duced inhibition of neutrophil influx in BALF of cigarette smoke exposed mice. 1 mg/kg dose of OCID 2987 resulted in 70.24% ophils in post challenge in guinea pigs.Conclusion: 2987 is a potent, selective PDE4 inhibitor animal models of asthma and COPD. OCID 2987 has completed the Phase I regulatory requirement and is expected to start FIH dosing by April 2011.Disclosure of IL-10 BY MACROPHAGES: STUDY OF IN VITRO CELLULAR INFECTION BY METHICILLIN-RESISTANT/METHICILLIN-SENSITIVE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS B. H. Galva o1,*, T. B. Costa1, N. G. Morais1, T. M. Almeida1, C. R. Weber1, C. M. M. B. De Castro1 1Tropical Medicine, Federal University Of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil Objective: To compare levels of IFN- c, IL-12, and IL-10 produced by alveolar macrophages (AM) among groups of well-nourished (N) andmalnourished (MN) rats, followed by in vitro cellular infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin- sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Methodology: Male Wistar rats (n =12) were breastfed by rats whose diet contained 17 and 8% of protein during lactation (N and MN group). After weaning, both groups were administered a nor-moproteic diet. Following the macrophage isolation, four systemswere formed: negative control composed by macrophages (C -), positive control added with lipopolysaccharide (C ?) and two sys- tems, MSSA and MRSA, stimulated by the strains. Cytokine releasewas evaluated after 24 h of incubation.Results: Malnutrition led to the decrease of body mass as well as reduction in the production of IFN- cin the systems C ?(p=0.001) and MRSA (p =0.001). However, it was not observed signicant difference among systems C -(p=0.707) and MSSA (p =0.065). IL-12 levels analysis demonstrated that malnutrition caused a decrease of such cytokine in all systems: C ?(p=0.009), C-(p=0.006), MSSA MRSA (p =\\0.001). In addition, no signicance was observed on the production of IL-10, C?(p=0.729), and MRSA strains, statistically signi- cant differences were only found in the production of IFN- c(MSSA vs. MRSA (N) Student t test). Conclusion: The model of neonatal malnutrition revealed disorders in body mass and compromised the production of IFN- cand IL-12.

Szabo1,*, L. F. MacKenzie1, G. R. P. J. Cross1, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is emerging as a means to control inflamma- tory disorders. The SH2-containing inositol-50-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) metabolizes PI[3,4,5]P3 to PI[3,4]P2. SHIP1-decientmice exhibit a marked degree of inflammatory cell recruitment into the lung, leading to pulmonary inflammation. Pharmacological, allosteric activation of SHIP1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects (Onget al., Blood, 2008). Here we overview the biological effects of AQX-1125, a small molecule SHIP1 activator, a current clinical development candidate. AQX-1125 induced a concentration-dependent increase in the catalytic activity of human recombinantSHIP1 enzyme. AQX-1125 suppressed Akt phosphorylation in AQX-1125 inhibited degranulation of wild-type bone mar-row-derived mast cells, but not of SHIP1-decient cells. Asphosphoinositide signaling plays a key role in cytokinesis, the effect of AQX-1125 was tested on leukocyte chemotaxis. AQX- 1125 chemotaxis. AQX-1125 long terminal half-life ( [5 h) in rodents and dogs, and yielded high concentrations in the lung. AQX-1125 exertedanti-inflammatory effects and reduced inflammatory cell inltrationinto the BAL in a rat ovalbumin-mediated airway inflammation model, in a rat pulmonary inflammation model induced by LPS, and in a mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced airway inflam-mation. AQX-1125 markedly reduced the production of multiplechemokines/cytokines in the lung. Thus, SHIP1 activation may have utility for the treatment of respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. The rst-in-class SHIP1 activator AQX-1125 demonstrates ideal drug-like properties and has recently entered Phase I clinical testing.

E. Blaauboer1,2, R. Netherlands,3Kinemed, Emeryville, United States The bleomycin-induced pulmonary brosis model in the mouse is the most common model to investigate potential new therapies for idio- pathic pulmonary brosis (IPF). The main read-outs used to quantify theseverity of brosis are based on the amount of collagen deposition(either measured using histological sections or by biochemical assay). However, this becomes a problem when the model is run using a ther- apeutic treatment protocol in which treatment is only started afterbrosis has been allowed to establish. Since the production of collagen (the main component of brous tissue) already starts during in the initial inflammatory phase, the window for measuring effects of new com-pounds is much smaller in the therapeutic protocol versus preventivetreatment. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of collagen deposition during bleomycin-induced lung brosis in C57Bl/6 mice using deuterated water (D 2O) to label newly formed collagen synthesis. Furthermore, we used whole gene array analysis in combination withthe ToxProler software to differentiate between the different path- ways induced during brosis. Array analysis showed that inflammatory processes were maximal during the rst week of disease, while extra-cellular matrix related pathways were maximal during the second and third week after induction, after which they slowly returned to base line levels. The new collagen assay showed that during the rst week alreadysubstantial collagen formation took place, despite strong upregulationof inflammatory processes. The production of collagen was further upregulated during the second and third week, after which collagen synthesis returned to pre-induction levels. This high level of collagensynthesis during the rst week explains the difculties in obtainingsufcient window during therapeutic treatment. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-448 COMMD1 AND CSN5: TWO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROTEINS IN THE CONTEXT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS? A. De Becdelievre1,2,3,*, A. Aissat1,2, (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes an epithelial anion channel. Morbidity is mainly due to the lung disease, characterized by achronic neutrophilic inflammation. Deregulation of inflammatorypathways is observed in the airways of CF patients, as evidenced by anInflamm. Res. S231 123increased AP-1 activity and NF- jB response. pro- cytokines such as IL-8 are increased. CSN5 and COM-MD1 are two proteins involved in the trafcking of CFTR but also in inflammatory processes. We observed a larger proportion of COM- MD1 and CSN5 in the nucleus of CF cells. We studied the influence ofCOMMD1 or CSN5 overexpression/extinction on NF- jB pathway epithelial cells (IB3-1 and S9, respectively). To decipher the underlying mechanisms, we have rst performed a set of luciferase assays and NF- jB binding assays in order to test NF- jB transcriptional activity in the presence or absence of each protein.TNFastimulation produced a higher increase of NF- jB activity in CF versus non CF cells. Overexpression of COMMD1 and CSN5 in the same experimental conditions decreased NF- jB activity by half in both cell lines. As IL-8 promoter contains AP-1 and NF- jB responsive elements, we performed such experiments with the wild-type and mutant constructs. Our preliminary results did not show a clear-cut effect on IL-8 promoter. However, new experimental conditions suchas IL-1 bstimulation are currently investigated. Our results show for the rst time the anti-inflammatory properties of COMMD1 and CSN5 in bronchial cells. These data could expand investigations to otherchronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructivepulmonary disease.

P-449 ROLE AND COX-2 IN THE RELEASEOF PROSTANOIDS IN MURINE LUNG AND ISOLATED LUNG FIBROBLASTS W. R. Wright1,*, N. S. Kirkby1,2, L. S. Harrington1, M. H. Lundberg1, M. J. Paul-Clark1, D. Warner2, J. A. Mitchell1 1Cardiothoracic Pharmacology, Imperial College,2John Vane Science Centre, Barts and the London School of Scienceand Dentistry, London, United Kingdom Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rst enzyme in the conversion of ara- chidonic acid to prostanoids. There are two isoforms of COX; COX-1,which is constitutively expressed with a homeostatic role in most tis- sues, and COX-2, which while constitutively expressed in some discreet sites is generally inducible by growth factors and during inflammation.In the current study, we have used tissues and cells from knock-out miceto investigate the relative contributions of COX-1 and COX-2 to PGE 2 production by lung tissue ex vivo and by proliferating lung broblasts invitro. Lung tissues death) and incubated (37/C176C) for 30 min in DMEM containing 50 lM calcium ionophore (A23187). Release of PGE determined lung broblasts from COX-1-/-and COX-2-/-mice were explanted and cultured before being seeded in 96-well plates at sub-confluence (5,000-8,000/well) and incubated for 24-48 h in the presence of 10% FCS. Accumulated release of PGE 2was then measured as above. Over 30 min PGE 2was released by lung pieces from wild type (1,117 \u00b155 pg/ml) and COX-2-/-(2,013 \u00b1255 contrast,proliferating lung broblasts pg/ml) COX-2-/- (1,194 \u00b1617 ng/ml) mice (n using cells from 2-3 separate mice for each genotype). These results show that COX-1 activity underpins the stimulated release of PGE 2in healthy mouse lung tissue. Con- versely, COX-2 activity predominates in proliferating lung broblasts,which may be important as COX-derived PGE 2mediates proliferation of lung broblasts [1]. Our results suggest a switch in COX isoform in lung cells during proliferation which could be relevant to our under-standing of conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary brosis Disclosure of STRESS MARKERS IN PULMONARY FIBROSIS INDUCED BY BLEOMYCIN ARE STRAIN DEPENDENT R.

Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of and pulmonary brosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whetherthere is any signicant genetic influence on the development oflung brosis related to oxidative stress after bleomycin stimulus. Methods and Results: C57BL/6, DBA/2 and BALB/c male mice were divided in control group (50 lL saline; i.t., n =10 each strain) and bleomycin (Bleo) group (0.1 U/kg i.t., n =10 each strain). After 21 days the mice were sacriced. The lungs of 20 animals were homogenized for oxidative stress marker determinations and com- pared with the respective control groups by with Tukey post-test.Lung ventilation was performed in 10 animals of each group and elastance and resistance determined. Malondialdehyde equivalent levels were increased in the C57BL/6 Bleo group (p \\0.01), and were decreased in DBA/2 and BALB/c (p \\0.0001) when compared with the respective control strain group. Both activity and expression of catalase were increased in C57BL/6 Bleo group (p \\0.01), decreased in DBA/2 and when compared groups BALB/c \\0.01). Nitrite in C57BL/6 and BALB/c (p \\0.01) Bleo groups. Lung resistance was increased in C57BL/6 Bleo group (p \\0.01) and in DBA/2 (p \\0.05). Conclusion: Our results shown that C57BL/6 mice are more suscep- tible to redox imbalance and oxidative damage and bleomycin response in DBA/2 and BALB/c strains we not associated with oxi-dative stress injury.

Res. 123P-451 INHIBITION OF THE NUCLEAR MSK1 INFILTRATE FIBROPROLIFERATION IN A (OB) is the manifestation of chronic allograft rejection after lung transplantation and is charac- terized by obstruction of the small airways with inflammatory inltrate and brosis. Our hypothesis proposes the nuclear kinaseMSK1 (Mitogen- and Stress-Activated Kinase) as an actor in OB via the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. Methods: A mouse model of heterotopic tracheal transplantation (iso-and allograft) was used. Mice were treated intraperitoneally up to21 days (D) with compounds inhibiting MSK1: H89 mg/kg/day) and fasudil (30 mg/kg/day) vs solvent 5%). Total was from IL-6 mRNA levels and +85 \u00b14% at D0, whereas the expression of MSK1 mRNA is unmodied in the isografts. Likewise, the expression of IL-6 mRNA in the allografts at D7 is compared lymphocyte inltration is observed, of 92 \u00b13% for H89 and 90 \u00b15% for fasudil at D7 as compared to controls. At D21, H89 and fasudil inhibit thetracheal obstruction in allografts by 80 and 45%, respectively, com- pared to controls. No effect of H89 or fasudil is observed in isografts. Conclusion: Our data show that the nuclear kinase MSK1 is over-expressed upon graft rejection in our model of OB, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Pharmacological and tracheal obstruction. Thus, MSK1 is proposed as a potential therapeutic target to combatOB after lung transplantation. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-452 HEME OXYGENASE 1 INDUCTION REDUCES LUNG OXIDATIVE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION AFTER INTESTINAL ISCHEMIAAND REPERFUSION INJURY J. A. Bertoni1, L. B. Vitoretti1,*, M. Correa-Costa2, A. C. Breithaupt-Faloppa1, A. Lino dos Santos R. Oliveira Tavares de Lima1 1Pharmacology,2Immunology, ICB University Of Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (intestinal I/R) frequently occurs in human pathological conditions, and it has been consid- ered as a signicant cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It is thought that polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mediators generated in the setting of oxidative stress, such asreactive oxygen species (ROS), have important roles in its patho- physiology. In this sense, we hypothesize that heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) up regulation, an enzyme with antiinflammatory and anti- oxidant activities, could modulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes and neutrophils recruitment in the lung after an intestinalI/R, therefore inducing cytoprotection. Upon anesthesia male Wi-star rats were subjected to 45 min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Before ischemia, one group of rats had the lymphatic thoracic duct sec-tioned and another group of rats was treated 48 and 24 h beforeinduction of SMA occlusion with an HO-1 inductor, Hemin by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. HO-1,superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2, catalase (CAT) mRNA weredetermined in the lung tissue. Intestinal I/R determined a signi- cant increase of MPO activity in lung that was reduced in rats upon lymphatic duct sectioned. Hemin treatment of rats increasedthe activity of HO-1, SOD-1 and SOD-2, but did not modify the expression the CAT in lung tissue. In addition, the MPO activity in lung tissue was signicantly reduced in hemin-treated group ascompared with non treated rats upon intestinal I/R. Our dataindicate that HO-1 decreases neutrophils recruitment and upregu- lates the expression of antioxidant enzymes, reducing inflammation of lung tissue after intestinal I/R. Moreover lymph factors seem notbe involved with HO-1 effects.Supported by FAPESP(2007/07139-3 and ROFLUMILAST REDUCES RELEASE OF IL-8 AND VEGF FROM AIRWAY EPITHELIALA549 CELLS EXPOSED TO CIGARETTE SMOKE EXTRACT (CSE) AND LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS) T. Victoni1, M. Lanzetti2, Konstanz, Germany Introduction: Cigarette smoke is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where bacterial infections account for acute exacerbations. IL-8 and VEGF are increased a selective PDE4 inhibitor approved for severeCOPD in EU. We investigated the effects of Roflumilast N-oxide (RNO), the active metabolite of roflumilast on the release of IL-8 and VEGF from airway epithelial A549 cells by CSE and LPS.Methods: CSE was prepared from the smoke of Kentucky 2R1 cig-arettes bubbled into FK-12 medium. A549 cells nM, 300 nM, 1 lM), (10 nM) and exposed to CSE (0.4% [10%) with or without LPS (0, 1 lg/ml) for 24 h. IL-8 and VEGF were determined by ELISA in culturesupernatants. Results: CSE (0.4-10%) increased VEGF release from A549 cells to a maximum of 1.7-fold versus control but did not induce IL-8 release.LPS at 0.1 lg/ml moderately increases VEGF release but not IL-8. However, adding LPS (0.1 lg/ml) to CSE (2% or at 100 nM, 300 nM and 1 lM reduced release of IL8 by about 85% and of VEGF by 70-80%Conclusions: CSE increased the release of VEGF but not IL-8 fromA549 cells. The additional presence of LPS synergistically enhanced the release of both mediators. CAPES/COFECUBproject. Disclosure of interest: Musculoskeletal COMPARATIVE STUDY OF (MFF) VERSUS IN OF R.

Iba \u00b4nez1,*, M. J. Alcaraz1, N. Maicas1, Guede2, M. das Vin as, Ourense, Compostela University Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Introduction: The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an auto- immune disease characterized by persistent synovial inflammation aswell as articular cartilage and bone destruction, is greater in women compared with men and can be related to menopause. Estrogen deciency has demonstrated to increase incidence and progression ofRA. We have shown previously that CO-releasing molecule, CORM- 3 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CORM-3 on the inflammatoryresponse as well as on cartilage and bone metabolism in comparisonwith alendronate (ALN). Methods: Two weeks after ovariectomy was induced in DBA/1J mice. ALN (100 lg/kg po once a day) and CORM-3 (10 mg/kg ip once a day) were adminis-tered from day 22. The clinical score was studied using a scale of 0-2 in each paw. Mice were killed at day 36 or 50. Histological analyses were performed on hind paws. Trabecular microarchitecture wasanalyzed by lCT. Results: CORM-3 treatment resulted in a signicant reduction of the clinical score with respect to the control animals (OVX + CIA). Thebone parameters of tibia of animals treated with CORM-3 were similarto na \u00a8ve group at day 36. At day 50, CORM-3 reduced chondrocyte death compared with control group. ALN administration did not improve the clinical score nor the articular cartilage damage. At day50, ALN administration showed to be an effective treatmentto reduce bone resorption. Conclusions: These data corroborate the anti-inflammatory role of CORM-3 and demonstrate protective effects against cartilage destruc-tion. In addition, CORM-3 is able to reduce the bone loss in the earlyphase of the disease. ALN conrms its antiresorptive action in this animal model of arthritis + osteoporosis but it fails to protect joint cartilage damage. Therefore, these data suggest that a combination of both drugscould be an effective strategy in postmenopausal arthritis. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-457 ELEVATION OF BOMBINA VARIEGATA PEPTIDE 8 IN MICE WITH ARTHRITIS Takahashi1, K. Hirai1, 1231Department of Rheumatology, The Jikei University School Medicine, Tokyo, Background and objective: Bombina variegata peptide 8 (Bv8)/ prokineticin-2 is a protein isolated from skin secretions of the frog. Bv8 has diverse functions, being involved in angiogenesis, gastroin-testinal motility, neurogenesis, circadian rhythm regulation, hormonerelease, and the pain threshold. Recently, Shojaei et al. reported an interesting study on angiogenesis: tumor-derived G-CSF mobilized bone marrow Bv8-positive cells to tumor sites, and these cells wereCD11b+/Gr1+, promoting tumor angiogenesis via the mediation ofBv8. The purpose of this study was to investigate Bv8 in mice with type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods: We induced CIA in male DBA/1J mice. The number ofCD11b+/Gr-1+ cells in peripheral blood from these mice on days 28 and 35, were examined by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted from the joint on days 21, 24, 28, and 35, and examined for G-CSF, Bv8,PKR1, and PKR2 mRNA expression by real-time examined using PKR1 and PKR2 antibody. To determine bone marrow-derived Bv8 positive cells in synovial tissue, we induced CIAin bone marrow chimera mice and performed histological analysis.Results: The level of G-CSF mRNA expression was elevated and the number of CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells in peripheral blood increased in the CIA group. The level of Bv8, PKR1 and PKR2 mRNA expression inthe joint was elevated in the CIA group. In addition, an increase in Bv8-positive cells was observed in the synovium and bone marrow in the CIA group. Bv8-positive cells in the synovium partially derivedfrom bone marrow and most Bv8-positive cells observed in the syn-ovium were positive for Gr-1. Conclusion: Bv8 was elevated in the synovium and bone marrow of CIA mice, suggesting that Bv8 plays an important role in the path-ogenesis of arthritis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-458 ULTRASONOGRAPHIC EVALUATIONOF ASYMPTOMATIC HAND University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background: Articular manifestation is common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and results from variable involvement of joints and tendons. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) is a sensitivetechnique in detecting abnormalities of joints and tendons. Objectives: To evaluate sonographic abnormalities in SLE patients who were currently asymptomatic in hand and wrist joints, and tocorrelate those with clinical parameters.Methods: Eighty SLE patients without arthralgia were enrolled. Age and sex-matched 17 healthy controls and 11 SLE patients with arthralgia were included as controls. MSUS using a 5-13 MHz lineararray probe was performed in wrist, 2nd and 3rd MCP joint, andflexor tendons of 2nd, 3rd and 4th nger of nondominant side. Results: Of 80 SLE patients, wrist synovitis was found in 42 patients (52.5%) and MCP synovitis was noted in 41 patients (51.3%).Tendinitis and tenosynovitis were detected in 32 patients (40%) and 12 patients (15%), respectively. These abnormalities were observed morefrequently in selected SLE patients with arthralgia (n =11). More- over, synovial thickness in joints and tendon thickness were greater in patients with arthralgia compared to those without (P \\0.006 and P\\0.03). However, only alteration found in healthy subjects was synovitis in MCP joint (5.9%). Among patients without arthralgia, patients with synovitis had shorter disease duration (P =0.022), while patients who showed tendinitis had higher mean age of disease onset(P=0.002). Importantly, tendon thickness was positively correlated with mean daily prednisolone dosage (r =0.23, P =0.037). Conclusions: Asymptomatic joint and tendon involvement of hand and wrist is common in SLE patients. Longitudinal study is needed todetermine if silent sonographic abnormalities will develop relevantmusculoskeletal symptoms in those patients and progress to more serious pathology leading to deformity.

Cavaleiro5 1Faculty of Pharmacy,2Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra,3Orthopedics and Bone Bank Department, University Hospital of Coimbra,4Faculty of Medicine,5Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Fac. Pharmacy/CEF, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) plays a major role in arthritic dis- eases by promoting the expression of inflammatory and catabolicmediators, namely nitric oxide (NO). Our previous study showed thata fraction (named Falpha-p) of the essential oil from the leaves of Juniperus oxycedrus , mainly composed of a racemic mixture of alpha-pinene [2,6,6-trimethyl-bicyclo(3.1.1)hept-2-ene] decreases IL-1-induced NF-kB activation and NO production in human chondro-cytes. This study aimed at further elucidating the mechanism of action of alpha-pinene. NF-kB activation was evaluated in the human chondrocytic cell line, C-28/I 2, by western blot for cytoplasmic phospho-IkB-a levels and by ELISA for DNA binding activity. To determine the ability of the test compounds to directly inhibit NO production, regardless of their effect on NF-kB-dependent iNOSexpression, nitrite levels were measured by the Griess reaction inhuman chondrocytes treated with the test compounds after pretreat- ment with IL-1 for 18 h to induce iNOS expression. Falpha-p decreased the levels induced by IL-1 alone, respectively. When added 18 h after IL-1, Falpha-p decreased nitrite levels to 42.1% \u00b17.3. The commercial (+) of alpha-pinene less effective whilethe ( -) enantiomer had no signicant effects. (+) alpha-pinene probably accounts for most of the ability of Falpha-p to inhibit IL-1- induced NF-kB activation and NO production. The later seems to involve NF-kB dependent and independent mechanisms, probablythrough direct inhibition of iNOS activity.

Sassi1, N. Gadgadi1, M. Kallel-Sellami1, Makni1, S. Sellami1and Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis laboratory research 1Immunology Department, La Rabta Hospital Al Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia Aim: The Notch family is involved in cell differentiation during embryogenesis. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes undergo morphological and biochemical changes leading to the de-differentiation process. Inthis study, we were interested in the involvement of the Notch pathwayin human articular chondrocyte de-differentiation. Methods: Human articular cartilage was obtained from cadavers after informed consent of the family. Chondrocytes were isolated then sub-jected to several cell culture passages and treated with or without the [ N- [N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl- optical microscopy. Immunoblot was performed to study the expressionof differentiated chondrocyte markers (Collagen II, aggrecan) and de- differentiated chondrocyte markers (collagen I, metalloproteinases and nitric oxide synthases) as well as Notch Without treatment, de-differentiationresulted in broblast-like morphology. This was conrmed by immunoblot analysis, which showed an increase in collagen type I, metalloproteinases, nitric oxide synthases and a decrease in collagentype II and aggrecan expression. With DAPT treatment, de-differ-entiation was delayed. Immunoblot analysis showed during the rst passages inhibition of collagen type II and aggrecan expression, which then was re-expressed during the last passage, suggestingchondrocyte re-differentiation. Conclusion: In this study, we showed that inhibition of the Notch receptor not only delayed the de-differentiation process, but alsoleaded to chondrocyte re-differentiation, which conrms theinvolvement of the Notch pathway in chondrocyte de-differentiation. This suggests that modulation of this pathway could constitute a new therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoarthritis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-461 INHIBITION OF PROSTAGLANDIN D2 SIGNALING PREVENTS THE PROGRESSIONOF DUCHENNE K. Aritake1,*, S. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked muscle disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy andweakness. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, whichencodes the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. We have found that hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (HPGDS) was induced in grouped necrotic muscle patients. Cytosolic form ofphospholipase A 2and cyclooxygenase-2, the upstream enzymes of the arachnoid acid cascade, were similarly observed in the HPGDS- positive bers. We performed functional analysis of prostaglandin D 2produced by HPGDS in DMD and developed a novel therapy forDMD based on the inhibition of PGD 2signaling. HPGDS was induced in the necrotic muscle bers of chemically induced rat and mouse models of DMD and in genetically dystrophin-decient mdx mice and DMD dogs. The necrotic muscle in models consti-tutively expressed HPGDS. Oral administration of HPGDS inhibitorfor 5 days prevented the expansion of muscular necrosis in mdx mouse, as measured by X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging. mdx mice were treated with HPGDS inhibitor for 30 days, and then the recovery of muscle strength, necrotic muscle volume evaluated byX-ray CT, locomotor activities and muscle histology were examined. The HPGDS inhibitor decreased the volume of necrotic muscle, improved locomotor activity and the histological analysis revealedthat the inhibitor prevented the expansion of muscle damage. Thesedata demonstrate the pathological role of PGD 2produced by HPGDS in the expansion of muscle necrosis. These results indicate that PGD 2 produced by H-PGDS is involved in the expansion of muscle necrosis in DMD and that inhibition of PGD 2signaling is a novel therapy for DMD.

Russell1 1Centre for Physical Activity and Nutrition Research, School of Exercise and Nutrition Science, Deakin University, Burwood, Australia,2Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,3Monell Chemical Senses Centre, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States Objective: Oleocanthal has been shown to mimic the actions of a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and acts as a through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). NSAIDs attenuate proliferation in C2C12 myoblasts through COX inhibition.COX-2 dependent prostaglandin synthesis is required in muscleregeneration and is implicated in myoblast proliferation. Therefore the use of anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibitors may be detrimental to muscle growth and regeneration. The objective of the present study isto determine if a natural NSAID such as oleocanthal has adverseeffects on myoblast proliferation in vitro. Methods: Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were grown in 96 well plates. Cell viability was determined by fluorescent assay (CytoTox-Fluor, Pro-mega). Myoblasts were treated with 0.1, 0.5, 5, 10 lM oleocanthal for 24 h. DMSO (0.24%) was used as a vehicle control. Myoblast proliferation was determined by the incorporation of 25 lM 5-bromo- 2 0-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 24 h in the presence of oleocanthal. BrdU levels were measured a 405 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm. Results and discussion: Concentrations of oleocanthal between0.1-5 lM were not toxic to myoblasts over 24 h. Additionally, these concentrations did not affect myoblast proliferation. NSAIDs are prescribed for the treatment of pain associated with inflammatory related disease states such as arthritis leaving patients susceptible topotential adverse effects on skeletal muscle. Long term ingestion of a naturally occurring NSAID such as oleocanthal at low concentrations may have pharmacological benets without compromising musclegrowth or regeneration. Ongoing studies are presently determining theanti-inflammatory effects of oleocanthal in attenuation of inflamma- tory markers P-463 AS A DISEASE ACTIVITYMARKER FOR ADULT of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea Objective: Recent investigations have shown that the serum level of interleukin-18 (IL-18) is extremely high in adult-onset Still's disease(AOSD) patients and is closely related to disease activity. However,IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP), a natural antagonist of IL-18, and free IL-18 in AOSD have not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of free IL-18 as an activity marker ofAOSD. Methods: A total of 133 Korean subjects were enrolled in this study. They are consisted of 43 AOSD patients meeting Yamaguchi's cri-teria, 30 unaffected controls, 30 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients,and 30 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. The AOSD patients were divided into three groups according to disease course, and into active or inactive groups. The inactive patients were further subdivided intoa remission group and a maintenance group. IL-1 b, IL-6, TNF- a, IFN- c, IL-18 and IL-18BP concentrations were measured by ELISA kit. Free IL-18 levels were calculated by applying the law of mass action. Results: Despite high levels of IL-18BP, the level of free IL-18 wassignicantly higher in the AOSD patients higher than in the controls. Free IL-18 levels in the remission group were lower than in the mainte-nance group (remission 660.6 \u00b1713.3 pg/mL, maintenance 8482.9 \u00b111138.0 pg/mL, p =0.021).When we followed patients showing normal range of acute phase reactants, most patients still showed higher serum levels of free IL-18, and part of them had a flareup later on.Conclusions: Free IL-18 level represented the disease activity in the AOSD patients, and could be a useful marker in AOSD patients whether continuous immune modulating therapy is necessary.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-464 PK AND PD PROFILE OF GLPG0259,A SMALL MOLECULE MAPKAPK5 INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS F. Namour1,*, F. Vanhoutte2, J. Beetens2, L. Gheyle3, blocks the release of mediators of inflammation (IL-6, TNF a) and cartilage erosion (MMPs) in disease-relevant cells and in synovial cultures. In the mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, GLPG0259 reduces paw inflammation and protects bone and cartilage. Therefore, GLPG0259may offer a promising new approach for the treatment of rheumatoidarthritis (RA). Here we determined the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) (PD) prole of GLPG0259 including exploration of interaction with methotrexate (MTX).GLPG0259 solution was administered orally in a dose range of1.5-150 mg as single doses and in a dose range of 25-75 mg q.d. for 14 days as multiple doses. Single doses of 50 mg as an oral solution were compared to capsule formulations in fasted and fed state. Singledoses of MTX were administered before and at steady-state exposuresof 50 mg GLPG0259. The PD effects of GLPG0259 were assessed by monitoring a gene signature in blood samples. GLPG0259 was gener- ally well tolerated with no adverse effects on ECG, vital signs orlaboratory parameters in healthy volunteers. GLPG0259 showed a dose-proportional PK prole over the dose range tested, substantiating a once-daily oral dosing regimen. Exposures reached steady state afterone week of q.d. dosing and exceeded levels seen in the mouse CIAmodel. The combination of MTX and GLPG0259 did not influence the PK prole of either compound, allowing for the combination therapy in patient studies. Similar PK and safety proles were observed for thecapsule formulations. Furthermore, GLPG0259 altered a specic genesignature. GLPG0259 showed good safety and a PK prole that sup- ports once daily dosing. Based on these results, a Phase II dose-nding study was initiated, evaluating three dose levels of GLPG0259 in RApatients with an inadequate response to MTX. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-465 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC IMMUNIZATION WITH TNF-KINOID IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WITH SECONDARYRESISTANCE TO alpha (TNF a) with monoclonal anti- bodies (mAbs) has been very successful in the treatment of severerheumatoid arthritis. However, nearly 30% of the patients failed torespond and most of them escape mAb efciency during time. Active immunization with a TNF-Kinoid induces self polyclonal anti-TNF aantibodies and effectively treats TNF amediated arthritis in transgenic mice. This novel therapeutic strategy could be an attractive alternative to anti-TNF amAbs.Inflamm. Res. S237 123Objectives: We evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, clinical response to TNF-K in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who developsecondary resistance methods: (TNF-K, Neovacs is an immunotherapeutic composed of recombinant humanTNFaconjugated to KLH as a carrier protein, inactivated and adju- emulsion. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (DAS28 C3.2) with history of positive clinical response to one anti-TNF amAb followed by secondary failure are being enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-con-trolled, phase 2, dose escalation study to evaluate three different doses of TNF-K. Immune responses are being evaluated through titration of anti-TNF aand anti-KLH antibodies with isotyping, evaluation of neutralizing capacity and of cellular responses. Clinical response isbeing assessed by regular evaluation of DAS28, ACR and EULAR scores and titration of C reactive protein Results: Up to now, no related serious adverse event has been reported.Few minor and transient local and systemic reactions have been observed following immunization. Safety, immunological and clinical results will be presented.Conclusions: Active immunization with TNF akinoid to induce a polyclonal, self anti-TNF aantibody response is an attractive and promising new therapeutic concept in rheumatoid arthritis.

ADIPONECTIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH JOINT INFLAMMATION AND CARTILAGE DEGRADATION IN OSTEOARTHRITIS A. Koskinen1,*, K. Vuolteenaho1, S. Juslin1, R. Nieminen1, T. Moilanen2, E. Moilanen1 1The Immunopharmacology Research Group, Medical School, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital,2Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement,Tampere, Finland Objectives: Adipocytokine adiponectin is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and appetite, and possibly in the developmentof insulin resistance. Recently, it has also been shown to regulate inflammatory responses. The aim of the present study was to inves- tigate the association and effects of adiponectin on inflammation andcartilage destruction in osteoarthritic joints.Methods: Blood and cartilage samples were collected from 35 male patients with OA, undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin and biomarkers of cartilage degrada-tion, i.e. COMP (cartilage oligometric matrix protein) and MMP-3(matrix metalloproteinase 3) were measured by immunoassay. Car- tilage samples were cultured for 48 h, and adiponectin released in the culture medium was measured and correlated to nitric oxide (NO),interleukin-6 (IL-6), MMP-1 and MMP-3 production. the effects of adiponectin on NO, IL-6, and MMP production in cartilage were studied in tissue culture experiments.Results: Plasma adiponectin concentrations correlated positively withbiomarkers of cartilage degradation, i.e. with COMP (Pearsonr=0.54, p \\0.001, ln transformation) and with MMP-3 (r =0.34, p=0.046). In addition, OA cartilage was found to produce adipo- nectin, and the adiponectin amounts released from cartilage in tissue culture correlated positively with the production of NO (r =0.34, p=0.049), IL-6 (r =0.39, p =0.037, ln transformation). Further, adiponectin was found to enhance production of NO, IL-6, MMP-1 and MMP-3 in OA cartilage in vitro by a p38 kinase dependent manner. Conclusions: These ndings suggest that adiponectin is involved inthe pathogenesis of joint inflammation and cartilage destruction inosteoarthritis. Disclosure of interest: None declared. Gastrointestinal diseases P-467 DETERMINATION ANTIBIOTICSUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN IN CAMPYLOBACTER JEJUNI AND CAMPYLOBACTER COLI ISOLATEDFROM CHILDREN WITH ACUTE DIARRHEA D. Khosravi1,*, Shamsizadeh2, E. Abasi Jundishapur of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Islamic Republic of Iran Background: For monitoring the drug resistance among Campylobacter populations which has become a serious concern worldwide, there is aneed to reliable and reproducible laboratory techniques. There are several methods; including disk diffusion, broth micro-dilution, agar dilution and E-test to apply to determine in vitro susceptibility prolesof Campylobacter to a range of antimicrobial agents. Objectives: The aim of present study was isolation of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from children with diarrhea and determination of antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates toclinically relevant antimicrobials. Methods: In total 220 stool samples of children with diarrhea were cultured on Preston agar and the isolated Campylobacter spp. were identied by further standard identication test. Susceptibility testingwas carried out using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and E-test. Results: In this study, 14 Campylobacter strains were isolated (6.36%), of which 9 cases (64.3%) were identied as C. jejuni and 5 cases (35.7%) as C. coli . Using disk diffusion, all the Campylobacter isolates were fully resistant to cephalothin, oxacillin and ampicillin followed by ceftazidime with resistance rate of 71.42%. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against bothisolated Campylobacter species. According to E-test results, Cam- pylobacter (92.85%), (92.85%) and ampicillin (78.57%).Conclusions: high-level correlation between theE-test and agar disk diffusion method in evaluating the resistance of Campylobacter spp. to tested antimicrobial agents.

BKR1 is an inducible receptor, activated in immune system by an inflammatory stimulus or after tissue damage (i.e. inflammatory bowel diseases). Thus, we investigated in rodents the role of BKR1 on intestinal inflammatory models using the selective antagonistSSR240612 (SSR).Methods: Acute intestinal inflammation was induced by indomethacin (20 mg/kg sc) in rats or by DNBS (6 mg/mouse rectal) in mice. A chronic model of colitis was evoked by TNBS (15 mg/rat rectal) in rats orby TNBS (1 mg/mouse rectal) in mice pre-sensitized with TNBS on dorsal skin. SSR and its vehicle were given orally by single or repeated oral treatment. Sulfasalazine was used as reference oral compound.Animals wasting syndrome was monitored daily; intestinal macroscopicdamage and colon histological analysis was evaluated after colon with- drawal. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistics. The results are expressed as mean \u00b1SEM of 7-10 animals for group. Results: In the indomethacin model, SSR (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) dosedependently prevented small intestinal ulcers formation; % of inhi- bition vs control 11, 31 and 60 respectively, p \\0.05. In DNBS colitis, SSR (30 mg/kg/bid for 3 days) signicantly reduced micecolon ulcers score (52%, p \\0.05), colon thickness and the loss of body weight. In rat TNBS colitis, SSR (30 mg/kg/bid for 4 days) signicantly inhibited ulcers (38%, \u00b10.13, p \\0.05. Histological analysis indicated a sig- nicant reduction of total microscopic damage (SSR 10.3 \u00b10.4; control 13.3 \u00b10.4, p\\0.05) and ulcers lesion in SSR treated rats. In mice chronic colitis model, SSR (30 mg/kg/bid for 3 days) inducedagain an overall recovery from the disease. Conclusion: These results suggest a possible role for BKR1 receptors in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation and indicate a potentialtherapeutic application of antagonists for treating inflammatory boweldiseases.

P-470 LYMPHATIC PUMPING INHIBITION: THE ROLE OF KATP CHANNELS 1Physiology & Pharmacology, 2Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Intrinsic contractile activity of lymphatic vessels is critical in tissue fluid homeostasis, immune cell trafcking and nutrient uptake. Correlation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dilated and/or obstructed mesenteric lymphatics is described in clinical settings and animal mod-els. In the guinea pig model of TNBS-ileitis, mesenteric lymphatic vessels are enlarged and their contractile function is impaired. This dysfunction can be caused by the action of inflammatory mediators.Among them, nitric oxide (NO), an inflammatory mediator upregulatedin intestinal inflammation can decrease lymphatic muscle contractilitythrough activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP). Our objective is to understand the role of K ATPin inflammation-induced lymphatic dysfunction and their possible dysregulation by NO using the guinea pig model of TNBS ileitis. Following initiation of the inflam- mation, animals were sacriced at day 1 for PCR and day 3 for in vitrostudies. Lymphatic tissues were microdissected out and real time PCRwas performed for K ATPsubunits Kir6.1 and SUR2B, as well as iNOS. Pharmacological studies were performed in vitro on isolated, cannulated mesenteric lymphatic vessels. The contractile activity was assessed in thepresence of 10 lM of the K ATPantagonist glibenclamide, inhibitor 1400 W, or the sGC ODQ. Our show that iNOS mRNAs was signicantly upregulated sham animals (p \\0.05). Administration of glibenclamide induced a large contractile response in the quiescentlymphatic vessels from TNBS animals (p \\0.0001). Administration of 1400 W and ODQ also improved lymphatic contractile activity in TNBS animals (p \\0.05). Our ndings suggest that K ATPand iNOS play a major role in the lymphatic contractile dysfunction seen in TNBS ani- mals. Identifying molecular targets to reverse lymphatic dysfunction can lead to pharmacological tools to treat intestinal inflammation.Disclosure of interest: GIARDIA DUODENALIS MUCOSAL MODULATE INTESTINAL CELL HOMEOSTASIS: A ROLE IN POST-INFECTIOUS- IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME? J. Beatty1,2,*, Calgary, Canada,4Biolm Research Group, 5Gastrointestinal Research Group,6Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada Acute enteric infections may initiate post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) via unknown mechanisms. Giardia duodenalis (G. intestinalis, G. lamblia is the cause of parasitic diar- rheal disease worldwide. Follow-up after recent outbreaks haveimplicated in the development of PI-IBS in a number ofpatients. Whether disruptions in the resident intestinal microbiota structure and/or species distribution by enteropathogens may be implicated in the pathogenesis of PI-IBS has yet to be determined.This study examined (1) whether Giardia trophozoites modify human intestinal mucosal biolms retrieved from intestinal biopsies, and (2) whether these biolm changes may disrupt human epithelial monolayers.Methods: Experiments in vitro used Caco-2 and HCT-8 intestinal monolayers. Representative, multi-species biolms were cultured anaerobically (72 h) on the Calgary Biolm Device from humanintestinal mucosal biopsies collected during routine colonoscopies.Results: Cell counts reveal Giardia promotes the planktonic growth phase of bacteria over that associated with the biolm structure. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that Giardia inhibits the secretion of the normal extracellular matrix covering the biolm.ELISA revealed that monolayers co-incubated for 3 h with Giardia - exposed biolms (24 h) exhibited greater levels of apoptosis, com- pared to those incubated with biolms not exposed endogenous mucosal grown from human intestinal biopsies. Our ndings indicate thatInflamm. Res. S239 123Giardia modies the communities. Giardia -exposed biolms disrupt the homeostasis of intestinal monolayers by enhancing their apopotic decay. These results pave the way towards a better understanding of the ramications that complex host-polymicrobial interactions have in chronic disease manifestation.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-472 COLITIS MODULATES LOCAL METABOLISM OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS NOT ONLY IN COLONBUT ALSO IN SECONDARY LYMPHOID ORGANS J. Pacha1,*, P. Ergang1, K. Vagnerova1, K. Vytackova1, I. Miksik1 1Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy Of Sciences, Prague 4, Czech Republic Glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that are regulated in part by activity of the enzyme11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11HSD1). This enzyme plays an important role in various dis-eases. We have shown recently that 11HSD1 is upregulated in bioptic samples taken from patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present study was (1) to characterize the role of proinflammatorycytokines in upregulation of colonic 11HSD1 and (2) to identify theeffect of inflammation associated with colitis on 11HSD1 in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Experimental colitis was induced in rats by the intracolonic administration of 2,4,6-trini-trobenzenesulfonic acid. Our results showed that colitis upregulated in the large intestine not only 11HSD1 mRNA and 11-reductase activity but also mRNA levels cytokines tumornecrosis factor a(TNFa) and interleukin 1 b(IL-1b). Similarly, colon tissue explants with TNF asignicantly increased 11HSD1 mRNA expression. In contrast, effect even if both cytokines upregulated Inflammation of 11HSD1 mRNA expression 11-reductase activity was found also in mesenteric lymph nodesand spleen, particularly in T cells. Comparison of 11HSD1 levels showed that enzyme expression was lower in MLN than in IEL and particularly in LPL. Thus, inflammation stimulates the reactivation ofglucocorticoids in lymphoid organs and in gut-associated lymphoidtissue. This reactivation system seems to exhibit a higher activation in the cells of the effector regions of mucosal immune system. Sup- ported by GA CR P303/10/0969.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-473 EFFECTS OF INTERFERON GAMMA ON AQUAPORIN 1 EXPRESSION IN MOUSEINTESTINAL EPITHELIUM M. Dicay1,*, C. Carati2, W. K. MacNaughton1 1Pharmacology & Physiology, University Of Calgary, Calgary, Canada,2Anatomy & Histology, Flinders University, Bedford Park, AustraliaAims: The water channel protein aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is widely expressed on epithelial cells with the primary purpose of regulatingtransmembrane water flux. Chronic inflammatory states like inflam- matory bowel disease (IBD) are characterized by high levels of interferon (IFN) cand exhibit abnormal transepithelial fluid flux. We sought to determine the effect of IFN con AQP1 expression in the intestinal epithelium. Methods: (1) C57Bl6 mice were given 4% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water to induce acute colitis and wereeuthanized at 3 days. Colons were removed and AQP1 expressionwas assessed by immunofluorescence. (2). Confluent CMT93 cells (mouse cell constitutively AQP1) on or inhibitor and then treated with IFN c(10 ng/ mL, 24 h) in serum free media. Cells were then lysed and protein levels for AQP1 and STAT1 were assessed by Western blot.Results: (1) In C57Bl6 mice, AQP1 immunoreactivity was observed in vascular endothelial cells and on the apical membrane of colonic crypt epithelial cells. Acute colitis induced by DSS was associated with a lossof crypt epithelial, but not vascular cells demonstrated a suppression in AQP1 protein expression after treatment with IFN cat 24 h. Pre-treat- ment with JAK2 inhibitor, but not STAT1 siRNA, prior to IFN c in of the IFN sup- pression of AQP1 protein expression. Conclusions: Epithelial AQP1 expression is reduced by DSS colitis in mice and by IFN cin CMT93 cells through a unique JAK2-dependent, STAT1-independent mechanism. Thus, inflammatory cytokines present during IBD are able to influence AQP1 levels and may con- tribute to the water transport deciencies observed in these diseases.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Vlasuk1 1Sirtris, A GSK Company, Cambridge,2Biomodels, Watertown,3Paul F. Glenn Laboratory & Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States The NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) has been implicated in a number of critical physiological functions including control of inflammation. Genetic and biochemical studies show akey role of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in the inflammatoryresponse. Most mediated deacetylation of p65/RelA directly reduces NF-kB transcriptional activity thus suppressing pro- inflammatory responses. SRT2104 is a novel small molecule thatactivates SIRT1 in biochemical and cell-based assays and has demonstrated selectivity against over 200 GPCRs, nuclear hormone receptors, enzymes and ion channels. In the present study the ef-cacy of SRT2104 to attenuate inflammation in DSS-induced colitiswas compared to the corticosteroid prednisolone. Colitis was induced by administering 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days following which the severity of the inflammatory response wasassessed by endoscopy. Treatment was then begun with SRT2104(1-30 mg/kg), prednisolone (3 mg/kg) or vehicle administered orally for 9 days followed by endoscopic analysis on days 7 and 13S240 Inflamm. Res. 123with mice sacriced on day 14 for histology. Prednisolone reduced colitis severity but worsened the body weight loss seen in thismodel. By contrast, SRT2104 produced a greater reduction in the colitis score compared to prednisolone while improving the loss in body weight. On histological examination, SRT2104 also produceda greater effect than did prednisolone. The ability of SRT2104 andprednisolone to reduce colitis was then examined in mice in which SIRT1 had been genetically knocked out in the gastrointestinal tract. Prednisolone was equally efcacious in wild-type and anti-inflammatory effect of SRT2104 absentin SIRT1 KO mice demonstrating a SIRT1-dependent efcacy for SRT2104. These data demonstrate that small molecule activators of SIRT1, like SRT2104, may have therapeutic value in inflam-matory disorders such as ulcerative colitis.Disclosure of interest: INHIBIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES IN RECURRENT TNBS-COLITIS: INSIGHTS FROM INTESTINAL TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS L.

Koning2 1TNO,2Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands A recurrent TNBS colitis model was established in BALB/c mice, by weekly intrarectal installation of increasing dosages TNBS. Devel-opment of disease in this model is evident from transient weight loss and increased weight and thickness of the colons. Histopathological evaluation of the colons show increased numbers of T cells (CD4+ andCD8+), mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition, multiplex analysis reveals elevated levels pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, IFN- c, IL-1b, MIP-1 a, suggesting the involvement of Th1 and Th17 cells. The development of these aspectsof colitis is sensitive to suppression by intrarectally or orally admin- istered budesonide. Prophylactic treatment by oral administration of L. plantarum or the VSL#3 probiotic mixture suppressed the develop- ment of recurrent TNBS colitis, evident from less macroscopicalterations, reduced mucosal inltration by inflammatory cells and IL-1b, MCP-1 and MIP-1 ato concen- trations comparable to those found in healthy mice. Transcriptomeanalysis of colon showed increased expression of mast cell proteasesanda-defensins in mice with colitis, but signicantly less in mice treated with probiotics.

We have been studying theeffects of the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN c) on intestinal barrier permeability, and recently identied the Src kinase Fyn as mediator of IFN c-induced intestinal permeability increases. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that mice decient in Fyn kinase wouldexhibit reduced disease in a by DSS. Methods: Twelve-to-fteen week-old, Fyn-decient and wild-typecontrol mice were either supplied tap water or water supplementedwith 2.5% (w/v) DSS for a ten day period (n =5-6/treatment group).Throughout the study, animals were monitored for weight loss, stool appearance and rectal bleeding. Upon autopsy animals were assessedfor colonic macroscopic damage, colonic length, hematocrit levels and myeloperoxidase activity. Further, colonic tissue was dissected and subjected to microscopic assessment of histopathology (0-12scale) based upon epithelial structure, cell inltrate, ulceration andchanges to intestinal smooth muscle. Results: Wild-type mice treated with DSS lost signicantly more body weight relative to Fyn-decient mice and had signicantlygreater decreases in hematocrit. Wild-type mice also had signicantlyshorter colon lengths following DSS treatment relative to Fyn -/- mice. Finally microscopic analysis indicated wild-type animals had substantially greater histopathology than Fyn-/-mice, typied by marked loss of epithelial architecture, cell inltrate, edema andsmooth muscle thickening. Conclusions: Fyn-decient mice exhibit reduced inflammatory dis- ease following exposure to DSS. Further examination of whether thisphenotype is due to improved intestinal barrier function or a modu- lation of the pro-inflammatory response will dene deciency.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

P-480 EFFECT OF LIPOXYGENASE PATHWAY METABOLITES ON INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION J. J. Moreno1,*, M. J. Rodr \u00b4guez-Lagunas1, R. Ferrer1 1Physiology, University Of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain recently demonstrated that cyclooxygenase metabolite prosta- glandin E 2induces the disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function through the interaction with EP 1and EP 4receptors. In the present work, our objective was to study the effect on epithelial barrier function of eicosanoids produced by the lipoxygenase Moreover, we further investigated the receptors and thesignaling pathways involved in this event. Paracellular permeability(PP) was estimated from fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran fluxes and transepithelial electrical resistance in differentiated Caco-2 cells. Our results suggest that 20-HETE and EETs/DHETs have no effect onPP whereas LTD 4, 5-HETE, 12-(R)-HETE, 12-(S)-HETE and 15-HETE increased this parameter. Moreover, our ndings indicate that cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 participates in the effects induced by LTD 4while no candidate was found for 5-HETE. For both eicosanoids, these effects were mediated through the activation of the phospholipase C/Ca2+/protein kinase C pathway in addition to cAMP- independent PKA activation. Furthermore, we observed a correlationbetween increased PP and the redistribution of TJ proteins. In con-clusion, on the basis of our results, we propose that lipoxygenase pathway metabolites could be contributed to the disruption of epi- thelial barrier function characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease.Supported by MICINN (BFU2007-61727).Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Va- nin-1 exerts a cytoprotective role on islet beta cells and consequentlycontributes to the progression of type 1 diabetes. We have investi- gated the contribution of human VNN1 to human gut inflammatory diseases. We sequenced the Vanin-1 gene in 400 IBD patients andcontrols and identied novel polymorphisms and mutations whichmight contribute to the progression of the disease by modulation of the enzymatic activity in gut epithelium. In parallel we developed novel tools to quantify cysteamine activity in tissues and show thatVNN1 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of patients with ulcera-tive colitis. We also document the presence of a seric form of the enzyme which may serve as a marker in various disease conditions. Preliminary results indicate that seric pantetheinase might be involvedin the control of systemic inflammation and blood homeostasis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-482 JAPANESE RICE WINE (SAKE)-DERIVEDCOMPONENTS HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT ON DEXTRAN SULFATE SODIUM (DSS)-INDUCED ACUTE COLITIS S. Wada1,*, R. Ohta2, Kiyono1, Y. T. Yoshikawa3 1Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences,2Food Sciences and Nutritional Health, Kyoto Prefectural University, Kyoto, 3Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is partly caused by dysfunction of immune system and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. Our previous studies identied an anti-inflammatory peptide; pyroglutamyl-leucine (pyro-Glu-Leu) in Japanese rice wine ( sake). The objective of the present study was to prepare pyroGlu-Leu rich fraction from food and check its therapeutic potency to IBD. Constituents in Japanese rice wine were fractionated into 10 fractionson the basis of isoelectric point and charge by an Fr. (pH 12.14) were prepared. Then, Fr. 1-5 was fractionatedby solid phase extraction using Sep Pak C18. Pyroglutamic acid and pyroGlu-Leu were rich in Fr. 6-7, and Fr. 8 and Fr. 9 also contained some amount of pyroGlu-Leu. Acute colitis was induced inmice by oral administration of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) indrinking water for 7 days. Mice were treated with each fraction at 30 mg peptide/kg body weight/day or various concentration of syn- thetic entire colitis induction period. Fr. 9 treatedgroup signicantly improved the colon length (p =0.05) and percent loss in weight (p =0.04) compared with control group on DSS- induced acute colitis. 0.1 mg/kg of pyroGlu-Leu treated group also signicantly improved percent loss in weight (p =0.05). On the other hand, Fr. 1-5 treated group signicantly reduced the colon length (p=0.02). The group treated with Sep Pak C18-unabsorbed fraction of Fr. 1-5 showed high mortality while all in control group survived.This result indicates that Japanese rice wine-derived components havea potent of therapeutic agent on IBD and pyroGlu-Leu might be one of these components, though Japanese rice wine contains low amount of detrimental substance within acidic and hydrophilic properties.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nitrosyl-ruthenium complex cis[Ru(bpy)2(SO3)(NO)]PF6 against ethanol-induced gas-tropathy. Swiss mice, (20-30 g), previously fasted for 24 h, were pre-treated by gavage with saline, nitrosyl-ruthenium (1 nitroprussiate (10 mg/kg, 33.5 lmol/kg). After 30 min., ethanol 50% (0.5 ml/25 g, by gavage) was administrated. At the end of1 h, the mice were sacriced and the stomachs removed. Mucosallesion area was measured by planimetry. Gastric corpus fragments were removed and stored until assayed for malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentration. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test. All animal procedures were approved by the local ethics committee (No. 33/10). Ethanol induced gastric damage (103.5 \u00b114.4 mm 14.0 mm2) the gastric damage induced by ethanol. In addition, either nitrosyl-ruthenium or sodium nitroprussiate reversed the induced by ethanol. Our results suggest that the nitrosyl-ruthenium complex prevents ethanol-induced gastropathy, in part by decreased the ethanol-induced free radicals production. Fur-thermore, nitrosyl-ruthenium complex increase the ability of the gastric mucosa to resist injury at doses up to 22-fold lower than the sodium nitroprussiate.Support: CNPq, CAPES, FUNCAP.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

There is a paucity of data on the positive effect of vitamin A on intestinal mucosal immunity. Weaimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin A supplementation on pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 12 (IL12) and assessment was done in 43 outpatients withulcerative colitis participating in a before and after interventional survey in Sheikh al rais, a public clinic of Tabriz .All participants were at clinical remission stages. The severity of disease activity wasassessed by Truelove-Witt Index. Vitamin A supplement was injectedtwice (50000 IU) with 2 weeks interval. Study period was considered 45 days. Serum interleukins and hs-CRP levels were measured by ELISA and turbidimetric methods, respectively.Results: Vitamin A supplementation had signicant effect on decrease of IL12 (P =0.003) and clinical symptoms severity (P =0.001). IL4 increased considerably(P =0.001). While hs-CRP and IL10 not signicant.Conclusion: Vitamin A supplementation could suppress serum pro- inflammatory cytokines and be benecial in reduction of clinical symptoms severity of disease in ulcerative colitis in remission andshould be explored in a larger study.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-485 DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF INDOLESAND SEROTONIN ON INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN HT-29 COLON EPITHELIAL Engineering and Technology, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Korea, Republic Of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease of chronic intestinal inflammation, which causes severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding and nally development of colon cancer. Serotonin is aneurotransmitter and gastrointestinal hormone, which regulates intestinal movements in the gut. In human IBD patients, serotonin level is increased in inflamed gut. In a previous study, we found thatserotonin induces adhesion of monocytes to HT-29 colon epithelialcells, similar to the action of TNF- a. Since the presence of high levels of bacteria creates a biolm on the surface of the gut mucosa in patients with IBD, we evaluated whether serotonin and its pre-cursor indole inhibit biolm formation serotonin terms of adhesion of monocytes to HT-29 cells,indole and MBI signicantly as serotonin- induced adhesion of monocytes to HT-29 cells. In addition, indoles were more potent at inhibiting serotonin-induced than TNF- a- induced adhesion. Taken together, serotonin acts as proinflammatoryfactor in IBD by inducing inflammatory response without affecting bacterial biolm formation. In contrast, indoles inhibited serotonin and TNF- a-induced interest: None declared.S244 Inflamm. KIRILOWII AND POGOSTEMON CABLIN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS VIVO S.-Y. Park1,*, B. C.

Ostadrahimi1, & Nutrition Faculty,2Digestive Disease Research Center, Tabriz Of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran Republicof Islamic Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease of unknown etiology caused by an inappropriate mucosal immune response to antigensfrom the intestinal flora. Its etiology has not yet been resolved, but immunological and genetic factors are known to play a very important role. Active UC is often associated with elevated peripheral bloodgranulocytes and imbalanced inflammatory cells (CD4, CD8 Thcells). As these cells are major sources of inflammatory cytokines, selective changes of these cells in patients with UC should alleviate inflammation. According to the anti inflammatory role's of vitamin A,we decided to evaluate the effect of vitamin A supplementation oncirculatory white blood cell (WBC) subtypes and inflammatory cells in this study. Methods: Forty-three patients with ulcerative colitis were includedin a before and after, interventional survey in Sheikh al rais, a public health clinic of Tabriz. All participants were at clinical remission stages. The severity of disease activity was assessed bycolitis activity index (CAI).Vitamin A supplement was injectedtwice (50,000 IU) with 2 weeks interval. Study period was con- sidered 45 days. Total WBC count was performed by using an automatic blood cell counter. The serum levels of hs-CRP wereevaluated by immunoturbidimetry. lymphocyte ratio and hs-CRP levels positively correlated with CAI (P \\0.05). There was a negative correlation between CD4 T cell and CAI (P =0.01).We found no signicant effect of vitamin A supplementation on CD4 and CD8 cell count after supplementation. NLR and hs-CRP not considerably, while plateletcount decreased signicantly (P =0.004). Conclusion: Vitamin A supplementation does not seem to have a strong effect on inflammatory cells.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm. Res. S245 123P-489 CONVERSION OF TOLEROGENIC RESIDENT CELLS OF THE HUMAN INTESTINAL MUCOSA INTO COLITOGENIC CELLS UPON IL-10BLOCKADE : POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CROHN'S DISEASE is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with a Th1 inflammation of unknown etiopathogenesis. Accumulating evidencepoints to breakdown of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and/or TGFbproduction/signaling in subpopulations of Crohn's disease. However, as to whether these defects can be the driving force of theinflammatory process remains to be dened. To address the issue ofthe consequences of depleting a normal human intestinal mucosa from IL-10 or TGF b, we have recently setup an ex vivo model system of explant cultures of human normal colonic mucosa, microdissectedfrom surgical resections, in combination with immunoneutralization of IL-10 or TGF b. This model maintains cellular interactions between mucosa resident cells and is amenable to a multiparametric method-ological approach (QPCR, ELISA, in situ immunofluorescence, flowcytometry after digestion). We previously demonstrated that immunoneutralization of IL-10, endogenously produced by res- ident mucosa cells including epithelial cells, leads to a Th1 response,mainly IFN c, triggered by LPS from the microflora, and responsible for epithelial barrier damage. In this work, aimed at elucidating how resident mucosa cells are converted into ''colitogenic'' pro-inflam- matory cells, we demonstrate that the IFN cresponse elicited by IL-10 breakdown in explant cultures is preceded by active caspase-1 pro-duction and early secretion of mature IL-18 by and lamina propria macrophages. Furthermore, the IFN cresponse is caspase-1 inhibitor and by IL-18-binding protein. Theseresults show that the Th1 response upon IL-10 breakdown depends on IL-18/caspase-1, part of the inflammasome pathway. In addition, we also show that immunoneutralization of another anti-inflammatorycytokine, TGF b, also elicits a Th1 (IFN c) response, but via a distinct, non redundant pathway. These distinct signalling pathways we identied can therefore represent targets in some forms of IBD. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Lymphatic vessel abnormalities reported in IBD include vessel dilation, hypocon-tractility and flow obstruction. These may lead to inefcient removaland transport of excess interstitial fluid, antigens, and immune cells. Inflammatory mediators, particularly prostaglandins can potently modulate lymphatic vessel contractile function. Our hypothesis isthat key mediators released during the inflammatory process cansignal through the lymphatic vessels to modulate lymphatic function and phenotype. Inflammation was assessed in the rat ileum 24 h after surgical instillation of the hapten TNBS using a macroscopicdamage scoring system and a myeloperoxidase activity assay.Mesenteric lymphatic vessels were assessed for diameter and col- lected for quantitative real time PCR analysis of the mRNAs: Cyclooxygenase 1 and 1- higher Inflamm.

These changes could lead to the dilated lymphatic phenotype we observed in thisstudy. Lymphatic dilation could have potential implications inmodulating the course of intestinal inflammation.

Hashemzadeh2, A. Ghorbani3, S. Seghatoleslami2 Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research center,2Microbiology, 3Internal Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Islamic Republic of Iran Background: While renal tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon in devel- oped countries, as many as 15-20% of TB patients in developingcountries are found with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in the urine. The diagnostic criterion for genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) is the isolation of MTB from urine. Due to the difculties associated with laboratory diagnosis of GUTB, there has been considerableinterest in applying PCR methods for the detection of the disease.Objectives: investigation of the diagnostic value of PCR in GUTB compared with acid fast staining and culture method. Methods: In total 200 urine samples from suspected cases of GUTBwere collected. Urine pellets were used for smear preparation, culture and DNA extraction by ether-chloroform method. Nested PCR was performed according to standard protocol using primers based onIS6110 gene fragment. The results obtained by PCR were comparedwith those obtained by standard acid-fast bacilli stain and culture method. Results: The positivity rate of urine samples in this study was 5.0% byusing culture and PCR methods and 2.5% for acid fast staining. Fourout of total samples showed positive results in all three methods (2%). The sensitivity of PCR in this study was estimated as high as culture equal to 100%, while the sensitivity for direct smear staining was41.6%.Conclusions: The obtained rate of GUTB in our study was 5.0%. Since the detection rate of culture and nested PCR was identical, we could suggest PCR as a rapid alternative to culture especially forconrmed cases of GUTB. Disclosure of interest: A. D.

Delgado1,2 1Arup Institute for Clinical And Experimental Patho,2Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States TGF-b1 is the important mediator of immune and anti-inflammatory responses; it is involved in normal renal function and in the developmentof different nephropathies. Present research was dedicated to the vali- dation of urine TGF- b1 measurement by Quantikine Human TGF- b1 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Humanrecombinant TGF- b1 was spiked into normal urine at different concen- trations, and frozen in aliquots. Collection of 100 frozen urine samples from healthy donors were used to investigate distribution of urine TGF- b1 in normal population. Creatinine concentration in urine was deter- mined at ARUP Laboratory. After the thawing, considerable amount ofprecipitate was found in some samples. Such samples were centrifuged, and supernatants or un-spun specimens were run with TGF- b1a s s a yi n duplicates. TGF- b1 activation procedure (which precedes ELISA steps) claried all samples no matter how much precipitation they contained. It was shown that supernatants contained only fraction of the whole sample TGF-b1 activity (77-29%, even less for the normal low concentration samples). Validation involving un-centrifuged urine samples demon-strated following TGF- \\17%; - analytical pg/mL;- to 39 pg/mg creatinine - freeze-thaw stability: after rst thawing, urine samples could loose from 5 to 40% of TGF- b1 activity on each following freeze-thaw circle. Conclusion: Quantikine Human TGF- b1 ELISA assay provides accurate quantitation of human TGF- b1 in urine; urine sample preparation should not include centrifugation step; repeating freeze-thawing should be avoided.

Ceri1,2 1Biological Sciences,2Inflammation Research Network,3Physiology and Pharmacology, University Of Calgary, Calgary, Canada The prostate is an accessory reproductive gland that is found in all male mammals. This gland is prone to infection, inflammation, and cancer, making it one of the most diseased tissues in the body. Spe-cically, the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) has notbeen addressed in the context of prostatitis. Therefore, we have developed a murine model of prostatitis to investigate the inflam- matory effects of PAR1. We hypothesized that administration of and dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) into theInflamm. Res. S247 123mouse prostate would incite an inflammatory response, and that treatment with the PAR1 activating peptide TFLLR-NH 2would modulate this reaction. EtOH + DNBS were administered alone or in conjunction with TFLLR-NH 2via catheter and mice were sacriced 48 h following treatment. Prostates treated with EtOH + DNBSalone showed a 4-fold increase in weight and myeloperoxidase(MPO) specic activity and a respective 3-fold and 16-fold increase in CXCL-1 and IL-10 production over controls (p \\0.05). Further- analyses of these prostates of DNBS treatment alone, DNBS in conjunction with TFLLR-NH 2showed a 4-fold decrease in weight and MPO specic activity, a 3-fold decrease inCXCL-1, and a 3-fold increase in IL-10 production (p \\0.05). His- tological analyses of these prostates revealed minor edema, minimal leukocyte recruitment, and minor tissue damage. In conclusion, acute inflammation of the prostate can be induced in mice using a combi-nation of EtOH and DNBS. Furthermore, activation of PAR1 modulates this inflammatory reaction by increasing IL-10 production, decreasing MPO and CXCL-1 production, and reducing tissue dam-age. These ndings support an anti-inflammatory role for PAR1 in prostate. of interest: None declared.

We previously showed that CYP-induced bladder pain was reversed by ibuprofen and aspirin, 2 non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and differentinflammatory mediators by these pharmacological treatments in CYP- induced bladder inflammation. Female rats were dosed with aspirin, ibuprofen, morphine or vehicle prior a single injection of CYP. Urineswere then collected over 4 h and rats sacriced. Bladders were assessedfor weight, wall thickness and macroscopic damage. Inflammatory mediators were quantied in bladders and urines Multiplex technology. After CYP injection, anincrease in bladder weight and wall thickness was observed associated with strong edema and erythema. were signicantlyincreased as well as urinary levels for prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2), lipoxin A4(LXA 4) and 15-epi lipoxin. After NSAID treatment, macroscopic parameters were not affected except for a decreased wall thickness.Urinary PGE 2levels were strongly reduced by both treatments, while IL-1band IL-6 tissue levels were decreased by ibuprofen treatment only. In contrast, morphine-treated rats presented a strong increase in wall thickness and macroscopic scores, associated with increasedbladder levels for IL-6 and MCP-1, and like LXA 4were not signicantly affected by these drugs. In summary, antinociceptive effects of NSAIDs are asso-ciated with a decrease in key inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 b, IL-6 and PGE 2, known to promote the sensitization of bladder nociceptors. In contrast, reversal of bladder pain by morphine may not be linked to adirect modulation of bladder inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Camara1 1Immunology, University Of Sao Paulo,2Nephrology, Federal University Of Sao Paulo,3Nephrology, University Of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a primary injury to renal tissue, resulting in decreased renal function, extensive tubular dilation, inflammation and brosis. Excessive adenine intake leads to TIN, as this purine is converted by xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) that precipitates Toll-likereceptor (TLR) 2, 4 and adaptor molecule Myd88 have pivotal role in activating the immune response and inflammation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of TLR 2/4 and Myd88 in an experi-mental model of TIN. Besides, we also evaluate the capacity ofallopurinol, a XD inhibitor, in reducing inflammation. Methods: C57/Bl6 (WT) mice and TLR2, TLR4 and Myd88 KO mice were fed with adenine enriched food and were sacriced after 10 days.Control mice were fed with standard food. Another group received adenine chow and allopurinol diluted in drinking water. At sacrice time, blood and renal tissue were collected for analysis. Serum creati-nine was measured and histopathologic changes were evaluated. Also,RT-PCR performed for were mea- sured renal tissue and immunoblotting was done for IKK.Results: WT animals presented higher levels of serum creatinine andenhanced cellular inltration and collagen deposition. They also showed higher gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, KO mice showed renoprotection, with serum creatininelevels, histology evaluation, and inflammatory molecules expression comparable to control. This protection was also observed on allopu- rinol group, which also presented decreased levels of uric acid, ox-LDL, TGFb and IKK expression.Conclusions: TLR2/4 and Myd88 to participate on the devel- opment of TIN. Inhibition of XD also seems to be a promising therapeutic target to combat the developing inflammatory process.Financial support: FAPESP/INCT Complex Fluids/CNPq.Disclosure of TLR-4 EXHIBIT DISTINCT ROLEIN CISPLATIN-INDUCED ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY M.

Thus, this study was designed to evaluatethe influence of TLR-2 and TLR-4 receptors on prevention of cis-platin-induced AKI. So, we used wild type (WT), TLR-2 -/-and TLR-4-/-mice to evaluate the morphological and functional renal parameters, besides cytokines prole and gene expression analysis.Firstly, it was observed that both KO animals showed a signicantreduction of TNF- a(3.6- and 2.2-fold IL-1 bmRNAs (13.6- decreased) TLR-2 -/-and TLR- 4-/-mice. Although, only TLR-4-/-mice have a trend anti-inflammatory molecules as Th1- and Th17-relatedcytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17). Likewise, the absence of TLR-4 but not TLR-2 receptor protects mice from severe weight loss, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and high levels of serum creatinine (SC)at 96 hs of injury ( C4t o\\1 mg/dL, respectively). In order to evaluate the mechanisms behind of TLRs activation, we also investigated the cytoprotective effect of Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Surprisingly, the TLR-4 -/-mice, but not in TLR-2-/-animals. All together, these results suggest that TLR-2 and -4 responded to injury signals of kidney milieu, intensifying the renal failure. However, TLR-4 have a fundamental role as pro-inflamma-tory agent and their cross-talking with HO-1 and TNF- acan help in better understanding of process that govern the AKI.

High frequency andseverity of CMV disease are associated with the use of anti-lym- phocyte. Therefore, some have suggested the prophylactic use of ganciclovir in these patients, but a strategy is the use of early treat-ment based on antigenemia as a marker of infection.Objective: To evaluate the severity of CMV infection in kidney transplant patients with graft dysfunction. Methods: The antigenemia technique was used to follow-up. Bloodsamples to perform the technique of antigenemia. Blood samples fordetection of antigenemia were obtained when there was clinical suspicion of cytomegalovirus infection. We evaluated 133 patients divided into 3 groups: (1) 50 patients who made use of anti-lym-phocyte to treatment of rejection, (2) 12 patients who did not use anti- lymphocyte, (3) 60 patients who use anti-lymphocyte in the time of transplant (induction).Results: Of 50 patients who had acute allograft rejection, nine patients had combined treatment of more than one anti-lymphocyte. In group 1had more syndrome and invasive disease and lower incidence of asymptomatic. The viral load of these patients, showed that patients with invasive disease had high viral load in compared with others groups.When analysed viral load inside groups, the group with used in inductionof anti-lymphocyte had increased of viral load. Patients that used anti- lymphocyte had more disease (syndrome and invasive disease).

Since NKT cells are a unique T lymphocyte sub- lineage that has been implicated in either up- or downregulating immune responses, the aim of our work was to study the role of NKTcells in an adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis. Materials wild-type and J a18 and CD1d KO mice were used in this experiment. They were allowed food andwater ad libitum. A 0.25% adenine-containing diet was used in alladenine groups during 10 days. Control group received standard diet. Mice were sacriced at day 10, after the start of adenine diet, for collecting blood and kidney. Serum urea and creatinine were mea-sured and kidney samples were used to isolate RNA. RT-PCR assayand Western Blotting was performed as described in standard protocols. Results: Serum urea and creatinine values were signicant higher inadenine-fed WT mice compared with the control group. Although urea and creatinine were higher in adenine-fed WT than in KO groups, there was no signicant difference between then. There was asignicant increase in gene expression of IL-6, adenine-fed WT mice compared with the control group. IKK protein expression was increased in adenine-fed WT mice than in control group. Our ndingssuggest that NKT cells may play a role on tubulointerstitial nephritis.DHA accumulation seems to be involved in the inflammation process in kidney injury since there was an increase in genes and protein expression that implicate it.Disclosure of interest: None declared.Inflamm.

Despite the HCprevention with Mesna, a complete protection is not always achieved. The participation of cytokines on HC provided potential targets for treating this disease. This study investigated the protective effect ofIL-1Ra upon inflammatory and hemorrhage response in a mice model of IFO-induced HC. Swiss male mice (25-30 g) were given saline (0.5 mL, ip) or IL-1Ra (25, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg ip) 1 h before salineor IFO (400 mg/kg) injection. Visceral nociception was performed,11 h after IFO injection. The animals were killed 12 h after IFO injection and bladder wet weight (BWW), vascular permeability (VP), macroscopic and microscopic parameters, myeloperoxidaseassay (MPO), in vitro bladder contractility to Carbachol, and cysto-metrography were performed. The study was approved by Ethics Committee (Protocol 09/06). IFO increased nociceptive threshold (6.76 \u00b11.10 g) when compared to saline group (1.01 \u00b10.73), and IL- 1Ra inhibited (3.21 \u00b11.05) bladder contractility (165.90 \u00b123.16), micturition interval (0.94 \u00b10.10), and absence in 13.78 \u00b11.47, respectively). This study shows for the rst time the efcacy of IL-1Ra in con-trolling the hemorrhage and inflammatory parameters of HC(including abdominal hypernociception and bladder dysfunction), providing perspective to clinical management of HC.

P-502 GENETIC OR PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITIONOF TNF-ALPHA REDUCES THE RENAL INJURY, DYSFUNCTION AND INFLAMMATION CAUSED BY ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION E. Esposito1,*, E. Mazzon2, R. Di Paola2, ain the pathophysiol- ogy of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. Here weinvestigate the effects of on the degree of renal injury induced by I/R, dysfunction and inflammation in (1) tumour necrosis factor-R1 knock out (TNF- aR1KO) mice and in (2) wild-type mice administered with infliximab, a chimeric antibody which neutralise the biological activityof TNF. All mice were subjected to bilateral renal artery occlusion (45 min) and reperfusion (6 h). In addition, wild-type mice were pre- treated (30 min before ischemia) with a TNF- asoluble receptor construct, infliximab, to mimic the effects that would be seen in TNF-aR1KO mice. At the end of experiments, indicators and markers of renal dysfunction, injury and inflammation were measured. Kidneys were used for histological evaluation of renal injury, for the localization ofthe intercellular adhesion molecules and selectins, as Bcl-2 and Fas-L expression) by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. TNF- aR1KO mice and wild-type mice administered with infliximab demonstrated signicantly reducedplasma urea and creatinine levels in comparison I/R-mice, indi- cating reduction of renal dysfunction. Neutrophil inltration signicantly reduced in TNF- aR1KO mice and wild-type mice administered with infliximab subjected to renal I/R. TNF- aR1KO mice demonstrated reduced histological tubular injury and markedly reduced immunohistochemical evidence of ICAM-1, P-selectin, and apoptosis when subjected to renal I/R. Our results clearly demonstrate that TNF- a play an important role in the renal ischemia and reperfusion injury andput forward the hypothesis that modulation of TNF- aexpression may represent a novel and possible therapeutic option to attenuate the ischemia-reperfusion injury process that leads to acute kidney injury, afrequent complication with renal transplantation, also associated with graft function.

P-503 USING TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING TO INVESTIGATE PROXIMAL TUBULAR DYSFUNCTION IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTPATIENTS WITH HIGHER RISK FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION P. G. Renesto1,*, N. O. Saraiva Ca mara2, P. L. Ramos3, R. A. Nephrology, Paulista School of Medicine, UNIFESP,2Department of Immunology,3University of Sa o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Retinol binding protein (RBP) is a small tubular protein, freely ltered by the glomeruli barrier and totally reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells. High levels of uRBP indicate proximal tubular dysfunction (PTD) and closely correlate with long term renal and heart transplant outcomes.However, at this stage of PTD, histology or renal function are not goodscreening tests. Therefore, we were interested in identify the gene prole of those patients, with PTD assessed by uRBP, in order to discover new biomarkers. Renal transplanted patients with good (serum creati-nine\\1.5 mg/dL) and stable (for at least 3 months) were screened for PTD. Sixteen patients with high levels ( [1.000 mg/L) and 11 patients with normal uRBP levels were consecutive selected a graft biopsied ofperformed after uRBP measurement. Agilent (GE) platform of 44,000genes were used. Each slide quality was assessed and those con- sidered good and discovered were selected for plotting the spots. WeS250 Inflamm. Res. 123calculated gene fold difference between groups and those above and below 2 were selected. 135 genes were differentially expressed; 123down regulated and 12 up regulated in patients with higher uRBP levels. Among those genes, we observed difference in cell adhesion molecules, cell communication, cytosolic calcium ion concentrationand ribosome pathways. PTD is associated with disturbance in cellphysiology reflecting the impairment in the endocytic machinery. uRBP can identify the patients with higher risk for the development of chronic allograft dysfunction that have no abnormalities in renalfunction or no outstanding changes in histology but a modication inrenal gene prole. Our data demonstrated that although PTD is associated with normal renal function and no specic histological abnormalities, it is characterized by a set of genes that might unveilits link with development of chronic allograft dysfunction.Financial support: CNPq and FAPESP.

Camara1 1Immunology, University Of Sao Paulo,2Nephrology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo,3Pathology, Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba,4Cellular Biology, University Of Sao Paulo, Ribeira o Preto, Brazil Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) constitutes important clinical problem, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. The mostimportant etiology of AKI involves ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI),an inflammatory response related to IL1- bparticipation. These data prompted us to evaluate the participation of the inflammasome complex, which is responsible for secretion of active IL-1 b, in the development of IRI. Methods: C57BL6 WT animals and KO for caspase-1, ASC and MyD88 were subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfu-sion. Blood samples and kidney tissues were collected for analysis.Results: Serum creatinine and histological data showed that KO animals for caspase-1, ASC and mainly MyD88 had a signicant protection of the renal function compared to WT animals 24 h afterIRI. The protected animals showed lower areas of hypoxia and geneexpression of HIF-1 a. In addition, protected animals had higher expression of anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. Regarding gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we found that WT animalshad higher expression of these inflammatory factors. Some in the inflam- matory response of AKI related to IRI. The mechanism related to thisresponse seems to involve caspase-1 and the adapter molecule ASC,which are capable to trigger the inflammatory response. This mech- anism represents important therapeutic target for clinical practice.

Starting from the hypothesis that endothelial cells themselves trigger such com- plement activation, we investigated conditions which could transformquiescent cells into AP activators, and the effect of a poorly regulated complement on these cells. Human quiescent umbilical vein HUVEC and glomerular GEnC endothelial cells were treated with hemolysis-derived or inflammation stimuli (free heme, neuraminidase, E. coli LPS, TNF a/IFNc/IL1b). Cells were, then, incubated with human serum and analyzed for complement membrane deposition, by flow cytometry after cells detachment. Blocking anti-MCP mAb, factor Hdepleted serum or aHUS sera with genetic complement abnormalitieswere used as models for poorly regulated complement. With normal human serum, minimal C3 deposits were detected on quiescent adherent cells. Among tested stimuli, maximal levels of cell-boundC3 were observed on cells pre-incubated with heme or TNF a/IFNc/ IL1b, but these levels remained limited. In vitro functional inhibition of MCP or aHUS sera resulted in a modest increase of C3 on qui- escent adherent cells. This C3 deposition was, however, furtherenhanced on cells pre-treated with heme or pro-inflammatory cyto- kines and became signicantly higher than that observed with normal serum, emphasizing the amplifying effect of defective complementcontrol. In conclusion, quiescent endothelial cells are well protectedagainst autologous complement activation on their surface. Common agonists released during inflammation or hemolysis trigger low level complement activation on endothelial cell membrane. This is ampli-ed by uncontrolled or over-reactive AP components and could resultin the release of C5a and C5b-9, with known pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant effects.

Buscariollo1, P. o Paulo, Sa o Paulo,7Micro-Immuno- Parasitology, Universidade Federal De Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Adriamycin (ADM) nephropathy (AN) is a disease characterized by glomerular sclerosis, proteinuria and up regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Many works pointed for a possible role of kinin receptors in inflammatory studies. On renal diseases models theblockage of B1 receptor (B1RBK) seems to diminish the inflamma-tory markers on the other hand the role of B2 receptor (B2RBK) has not been unveiled yet. In this way we studied the role of these kinin receptors in the inflammatory reaction induced by ADM injectionusing specic antagonists for these receptors. Material and methods: The AN was induced by a single injection of ADM in the tail vein of Balb/c mice. The mice were treated with thekinin antagonists DALBK (B1RBK antagonist) in for 3 days, for 3 days and with HOE-140 B2RBK (antagonist) for 3 or 10 days. The renal function parameters were analyzed by levels of albuminuria, Western Blot and PCR real time expression ofpodocyte proteins. The levels of cytokines like TGF b1w e r ee v a l u a t e d by ELISA, the macrophage inltration by Flow cytometry and the levels of proinflammatory were analyzed by a mouse cytokine Bioplex assay kit.Results: The use of DALBK protected and revert the signs of mice albuminuria and podocyte dysfunction. This result was associated with the downregulation of proinflammatory markers such as TNF- a, TGF-b, IL-1b, MCP-1 and microphage inltration, a mirrored was observed with the Treatment with DABK (B1RBK antagonist) showing a positive effect of B1RBK blockage in AN. Differently the treatment with HOE-140 (B2RBK antagonist) did not protected ani-mals from AN signs at the beginning of the AN on the other hand inan established disease downregulated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the role of this receptor depends of the stage of AN progression. Differently the B1RBK blockade that at allphases of the disease was showed to be an important target to AN.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-507 THE ROLE OF DENDRITIC IN CD4+ TCELLS MODULATION KIDNEY e Silva Filho1, N. Camara1 1University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is an acute inflammatory response considered to be the main cause of acute renal injury in kid-neys. Dendritic cells (DC) have been recently associated to have a role in IRI, although a few is known about their functionality and their possible role in T cell activation in this model. In this way, we inves-tigated whether DC are involved in IRI and their participation in T cell modulation in this model. We used C57Bl/6 and C57Bl/6-CD11c-DTR mice to perform the ischemia and sham group as control. We observedthat after 24 h of reperfusion, urea ( [250 creatinine increased in ischemic group, indicating thelesion. No difference of DC numbers were observed in the kidney and draining lymph nodes, however, DC from ischemic group were moreactivated, presenting more pronounced expression of CD86. We then used two models of depletion of dendritic cells: clodronate depletion of phagocytes and C57B/l6-CD11c-DTR mice with diphtheric toxin(4 ng/g of mice). Both protocols resulted in of urea([300 mg/dl) and creatinine ( [2 mg/dl) in the serum of DC depleted mice. In order to investigate the influence of DC in CD4+ T cell modulation in IRI, we analysed the phenotype of CD4+ T cells in DCdepleted mice after ischemia and reperfusion induction and weobserved that the population of CD4+ CD69+ (activated) T cells was increased, while no differences were observed in CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T cells (Tregs), indicating that DC might be important for theregulation of T cell response in IRI. We conclude that DC are involvedin IRI and they modulate CD4+ T cells in order to control the injury. Support: FAPESP. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-508 EVALUATION DURING Toulouse, France Introduction: The objective of this study was to highlight the effects of aspirin, ibuprofen and morphine on the production of pro-resolvinglipid mediators during a cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced bladderinflammation. Methods: rats were dosed with aspirin, ibuprofen, morphine or vehicle prior to a single injection of CYP. Urines werethen collected over 4 h and mediators analyzed using a liquid chro- matography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology to quantitatively evaluate bioactive lipids production in urine.Results: During these experiments, we showed that CYP inducedthe production of lipid mediators derived from and lipoxygenases (LOX) pathways. Moreover, CYP treat- ment induced bladder pain, which was inhibited by aspirin,ibuprofen and morphine treatments. The use of aspirin and ibu-profen completely abrogated the mediators depending on COX pathways while morphine had no effects on those. On the other hand, aspirin boosted the LOX pathways and the production of theprecursors of resolvins, protectins. In contrast, the useof ibuprofen and morphine inhibited the production of these same precursors. Conclusions: Taking together the results suggest that aspirin may acton bladder pain through the induction of key pro-resolving mediators, while ibuprofen and morphine may promote the desensitization nociceptors other pathways.Disclosure of interest: None declared.S252 Inflamm.

Silva2, L. H. Guimara es2, A. Background: Leishmania braziliensis results in cutaneous and leishmaniasis. In between spec- trum, disseminated leishmaniasis (DL) aside primary ulcer andulcerated secondary lesions differs from others by clinical manifes-tation of multiple papules and non ulcerated lesions. In this study, we describe the histopathology of DL papular lesions, correlating them with CD20, (vW) amount characterizing immune inflammatoryaspects. Methods: Eighteen biopsies from patients diagnosed by clinical cri- teria, positive skin test and ne needle aspiration in vitro cultivationwere analyzed. Histopathological aspects were obtained by analysisof Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides. To and cells positivity for CD4, CD20, CD 68, CD31 and vW was used.Results: Diffuse lymphoplasmocytic perivascular inltrate and granulomas well organized were found in dermal skin. Histopa- thological patterns were graded from I to III [39% (I), 11% (II) and50% (III)]. Inflammation extent varied from 3 to 73%, presenting asignicant linear correlation with vW+ vessels and with graded pat- terns. The most frequent inflammatory cells were macrophages (CD68+) followed by B cells (CD20+) and T cells (CD4+). Signi-cant linear correlation between CD4+ and CD20+ cells and inflamedarea was also found. In more inflamed lesions we found grater amount of CD31+ cells. Amastigotes were visualized or immunostained in 8 biopsies.Conclusions: Our ndings suggest that chronic inflammation was present in all papules predominantly formed by macrophages plas- mocytes, T and B cells. As inflammation area expands, granulomasand vessel framework increases proportionally. Thus, the presentstudy highlights the possible role small vessels may have in clinical evolution and spectrum from acneiform papules to larger nodular skin lesions.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Mahgoub1, N. Ezzat2, D. El-Deeb31Dermatology, Faculty Of Medicine, Cairo University,2Chemical & Clinical Pathology,3Dermatology, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt Background: Studies have shown the association between psoriasis and celiac disease (CD), an immune-mediated gluten-dependententeropathy due to inappropriate T cell mediated response againstingested gluten, and also improvement of psoriasis after gluten-free diet. However, the exact relationship between psoriasis and CD remains controversial.Aim: We aimed to assess the prevalence of IgA anti gliadin (AGA)antibodies and other celiac disease associated antibodies as IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and IgA antiendomysium antibodies (EMA) in psoriatic patients, and their possible role in the pathogenesisof psoriasis. Patients and methods: Forty-one psoriasis patients and 41 healthy controls were included in this study. Blood samples were taken fromall subjects and screened for AGA, tTG, measured by ELISA, andEMA assessed by standard immunofluorescence with cryo section to monkey oesophagus. Results: There was a signicant difference between patients andcontrols as regards AGA but no signicant difference between the 2groups as regards tTG and EMA was detected. Conclusion: Finally, the signicant increase in the level of some CD antibodies detected in this study indicates that their serologicalevaluation should be considered in psoriasis patients. Also, gluten- free diet could lead to better management and decreased morbidity of psoriasis.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-511 IL-33, MAST CELLS AND KERATINOCYTES: A TRAIT D'UNION IN IMMUNITYMECHANISMS OF PSORIASIS A. S. Balato1, F. Ayala1 1Dermatology,2Clinical Immunology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy IL-33 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine recently identied as a the orphan receptor ST2. IL-33 constitutive nuclear expressionhas been found in cells of tissues exposed to the environment. Moreover, endothelial cells have been shown to abundantly express IL-33. Many of the inflammatory effects of IL-33 dene its abilityto induce Th2-type mediated responses but recently IL-33 was foundto have a pro-inflammatory role in arthritis, which is Th1 and/or Th17 mediated. It can be hypothesized that IL-33 has a pro- inflammatory role in psoriasis too. In the present study we aimed toassess the role of IL-33 in psoriasis, investigating its property topromote inflammation via mast cell (MC) and keratinocyte (KC) activation. Here we report that IL-33 is elevated in the skin of psoriasis patients. Furthermore, IL-33 upregulates IL-4 and IL-13and is able to induce a higher increase of MCP-1 and VEGF respect to TNF- ain MCs. In presence of TNF- a, IL-33 induces MCP-1 and IL-6, whereas in association with IL-17, is able to induce IL-20 inKCs. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that IL-33 isinvolved in psoriasis biology. Furthermore, our results reinforce the IL-33 activity in driving Th1 response too, contributing to the maintenance of psoriasis pathogenesis.Disclosure interest: None declared.Inflamm.

A. Cabrini1,*, D. A. Mendes1, C. D. Horinouchi1, A. S. Prudente1, S. Soley1, authors reported a signicant involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the process of keratinocytes proliferation with many divergences.In order to determine the involvement of NO in hyperproliferativeprocess of epidermis in vivo, chronic inflammatory process was induced by multiple applications of croton oil (0.4 mg/ear) for 9 days on alternate days. Mice were topically treated with the NG-nitro- mg/ear), starting on the 5th day. Oedema was measured daily as increase in earthickness and on the last day 6 mm sample of ear tissue was collected, weighed and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry(PCNA). Procedures were approved by Institutional Ethics Commit- tee (130). L-NAME, 7-NI, and dexamethasone treatments were able to decrease, while SNP increased ear oedema during treatment. How-ever, the weight of ears at the end of experiment was reduced inthe groups that received L-NAME (16.9%) and 7-NI (44.3%), while the AG (24.9%) and SNP (22.0%) groups presented an increment in the ear weight compared to control (24.3 \u00b11.4 mg). The evaluation of epidermis thickness show that L-NAME (28.2%), AG (20.7%) and 7-NI (42.0%) reduce, while SNP application contributed to enlarge in 35.6% when compared with control group (133.8 \u00b18.1lm). Similar results were observed in the PCNA immunohistochemical staining,where treatments with L-NAME, AG and 7-NI caused reduction of 34.2, 15.9 and 70.2%, respectively, while SNP enhanced in 15.6% when compared with control group (87.2 \u00b16.9 cell/eld). Therefore, in the skin NO must be produced by iNOS and nNOS, and is probablyinvolved in the control of keratinocytes hyperproliferation in the epidermis, also with a contribution oedema formation. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY IN ANIMAL MODELS M. F. Otuki1, A. S. Prudente2,*, M. Adami2, D. A. Mendes2, Statins represent a class of drugs that effectively lowers cholesterol, but have shown to possess also pleiotropic effects, like promotion ofvasculogenesis, prevention of bone loss, immunomodulating and anti- inflammatory effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the activity of simvastatin in acute and chronic inflammatory modelsthrough topical treatment. Skin inflammation was induced in theear of female Swiss mice (25-30 g) by topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). In the acute model, ear oedema was measured by the increase of ear thickness 6 h after TPA(2.5lg/ear). The chronic inflammatory process was induced by multiple applications of TPA (2 lg/ear) for 9 days on alternate days and the oedema was measured daily as the increase in ear thickness. Topical treatment with simvastatin (0.24-2.40 lmol) or dexamethasone (0.13 lmol) started on the 5th day of experiment. Samples of ear tissue (6 mm) from acute and chronic model were collected, weighed and analyzed: ear weigh, histology, and myelo-peroxidase (MPO) enzymatic activity. Procedures were approved byInstitutional Ethics Committee (390). Simvastatin application was able to reduce the ear oedema induced by a single TPA treatment in a [ID lmol). The activity of MPO was reduced by simvastatin with maximum inhibition of 53 \u00b14%. In the chronic model, simvastatin (1%) was able to reduce ear oedema in 16\u00b13% and ear weight in 11 \u00b12%, at the end of experiment. Histological analysis showed a reduction of swelling and decrease in leukocyte inltration.

It is developed by the Institute of Chinese Medicine of The ChineseUniversity of Hong Kong to promote healing of foot ulcer in diabeticpatients. In this study, we have investigated the anti-arthritic and anti- diabetic potentials of NF3 in arthritic Neonatal streptozotocin (70 mg/kg) (STZ)-induced diabeticrats were randomized into three groups. The rst group receiveddaily oral administration of human equivalent dose (HED) of NF3, i.e., 0.98 g/kg/day for 2 weeks (standard dose). The second group received daily oral administration of 5 9HED of NF3, i.e., 4.91 g/kg/ day for 2 weeks (high dose). The third group received parallel vehicle(water) administration. After 1 week of oral treatment, all rats were injected with 125 ll Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) into one knee to induce monoarthritis (noted as day 0). Symptoms of arthritis wereassessed daily until termination of the experiment one day after the last oral administration. A parallel study was performed in age-mat- ched normal rats.Results: FCA treatment produced similar arthritis symptoms in nor-mal and diabetic rats. Compared to the vehicle treated group, neither standard dose (HED) nor high dose NF3 (5 9HED) affected body weight or joint hyperaemia in normal rats, but high dose NF3slightly attenuated joint swelling, allodynia, and plasma glucoselevel. Symptoms of arthritis and diabetes in diabetic rats were not affected by treatment with either standard or high dose NF3. Conclusions: Diabetes does not affect the development of arthritis.High-dose NF3 may have minor hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in normal rats, but not in diabetic rats. The active components in NF3 may have to be identied and extracted toyield more anti-arthritic and anti-diabetic actions.Disclosure interest: None P-516 D PRODUCTION BY OCULARBARRIERS J. A.

The eye is an immune privileged sitemaintained by blood-aqueous (ciliary body and iris) and blood-retinalbarriers. Corneal endothelium contributes to barrier function between corneal stroma and aqueous humor. This research aims to study the role of 1,25(OH) 2D3in ocular barrier function. To investigate this, human adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19), non-pigmented ciliary body epi-thelium (ODM2), and human corneal endothelial (HCEC-12) cell lines were cultured, and gene expression was examined by conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) both in the absence andpresence of TLR ligands and vitamin D substrate (25(OH)D 3). Protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Production epithelium and corneal responded to TLR ligand stim- ulation but this did not influence elements of vitamin D gene expression.Conversely, the addition of 25(OH)D 3did not affect cytokine production by these cells. This novel research has identied that ocular barrier cells can convert inactive 25(OH)D 3into 1,25(OH) 2D3and this is not TLR ligand stimulation. Vitamin D 3produced by ocular barrier cells may possibly play a role in ocular immune privilege. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-517 IMMUNE SIGNALING MOLECULES AS A TARGET AGAINST OBESITY-INDUCED INFLAMMATION AND METABOLIC of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea, Republic Of,3Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,4Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea Chronic inflammation is an important factor in the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and fatty liver disease.Recent progress has led to the identication of several adipose tissue inflammatory components such as immune cells (e.g. mac- rophages, T cells) and cytokines/chemokines that account forobesity-induced inflammatory responses and insulin resistance.However, the intrinsic factors that trigger adipose tissue inflam- mation are not yet completely understood. 4-1BB/CD137 (TNFRSF9), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptorsuperfamily expressed on immune cells, provides a bidirectionalinflammatory signal through binding to its ligand 4-1BBL. 4-1BB and 4-1BBL have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. However, the roleof 4-1BB/4-1BBL in obesity-induced inflammation has not been established. Here we demonstrate that 4-1BB deciency protects against high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, glucose intoleranceand fatty liver disease. 4-1BB-decient mice fed an HFD for9 showed less body weight gain, adiposity, adipose inl- tration of macrophages/T cells, and (e.g., TNF resistance attenuated in the 4-1BB-decient mice.These ndings suggest that 4-1BB and 4-1BBL may be useful therapeutic targets for combating obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic disorders.Disclosure of interest: Kim1, C.

Cilostazol stimulation time- and concentration-dependently increased the HO-1 mRNA and protein expression associated with increased HO-1 activity, as didcobalt protoporphyrin IX (LPS)- macro- did CoPP. In parallel with IkBa degradation and NF- jB nuclear translocation were signicantly decreased after treatment with cilostazol as well as with CoPP. Theseeffects of cilostazol and CoPP were signicantly reversed protoporphyrin IX. The effects of cilostazol on IkBa expression and nitrite production were not manifested in the cells transfected withHO-1 small interfering RNA. In the J774 macrophages, cilostazoltime- and concentration-dependently increased the nuclear expression of NF-E2 related factor (Nrf2) and antioxidant response element (ARE) activity. PI3-kinase and Akt play a role in the major signalpathways with cilostazol-induced HO-1 expression. In summary, cilostazol suppressed production anti-inflammatory cytokines and molecules via inhibition of NF- jB activation, of interest: None declared. P-519 RELEASE OF INFLAMMATORY FACTORS BY HUMAN ADIPOSE TISSUE EXPLANTSAND RELATION WITH MACROPHAGES: IMPACT OF DRASTIC WEIGHT LOSS E. Dalmas1,*, C. Poitou1,2, Hospital, Paris, FranceIn obesity, white adipose tissue (WAT) is considered a site of produc- tion of inflammatory factors and is characterized by macrophageinltration. The contribution of WAT secretion and macrophages to weight loss-induced amelioration of systemic inflammation in obese subjects is not clear. Subcutaneous WAT was obtained from 20 mor-bidly obese patients before, 3 and 6 months after gastric bypass (GP).Luminex technology was used to measure the release of 27 factors in WAT explants over 24 h incubation. Adipocyte diameters and CD68+ macrophages content were determined in WAT slides obtained at thesame time points. Following GP, BMI and adipocyte diameters regu-larly decreased, accompanied by an overall amelioration of patients' systemic inflammation. In WAT explants, leptin release steadily dropped while adiponectin remained roughly secretion rateof the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 increased up to2-fold the initial values after 3 months and remained stable thereafter. Unexpectedly, a similar kinetic prole was observed for pro-inflam- matory factors, including TNF a, IL-12 and RANTES. WAT of three major angiogenic factors, bFGF, PDGF-BB and VEGF, increased regularly, reaching 5-fold the pre-surgical values at month 6. Different patient's kinetic proles were found for WAT CD68+ macrophages,with increased, stable or decreased counts. Early variations in WATmacrophage content were positively correlated with changes in the release of pro-inflammatory factors in paired explants. These variable secretion proles in WAT do not directly account for amelioration ofsystemic inflammation but might be related to variations in macrophagecontent. Secretion of angiogenic factors suggests a local vascular response to sustained weight reduction. Change in WAT macrophage phenotype is under study to further explore their contribution to thedynamics of WAT secretion, tissue remodeling and bioclinical phe- notypes during GP-induced weight loss.

Acedo1, T. Rocha1 Sao Francisco University, Braganc \u00b8a Paulista, Brazil Obesity is associated to a systemic inflammatory process character- ized by proinflammatory cytokine production and (AT). Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-TNF-adrug and it could be a role in inflammation associated to obesity. The aim of this project was to evaluate MTX effects in inflammatory alterations induced by obesity. Swiss mice were feedwith high-fat diet (HFD) during 12 weeks and received MTX 2(MTX2) or 4 (MTX4) mg/kg/week during the last 2 weeks. Body weight, food intake, glucose blood levels and insulin tolerance were evaluated. Visceral AT depots were quantied and biopsies wereobtained for protein expression analysis, immunohistochemistry,adipokines production and basal lipolysis measurement. MTX actions were evaluated adipocytes or Raw 264.7 macrophage/3T3-L1 adipocytes co-cultures. There was reductionin body weight, food intake or adiposity in obese mice after MTX treatment. However, glucose blood levels were reduced and insulin sensitivity was increased in MTX2 and MTX4. Ex vivo, and IL-10 were increased in AT from MTX4 mice. vitro, MTX inhibited lipolysis through adenosine activation in IL-6 in LPS-stimulated co-cultureswas also inhibited by results demonstrate that MTXimproves glucose homeostasis in obese mice. This improvement seems to be associated with a reduced production of proinflamma- tory and increased production of anti-inflammatory adipokines byadipose tissue. The effect anti-lipolysis could also contribute to glu-cose homeostasis, suggesting that drugs with anti-inflammatory associated to anti-lipolytic action could be a tool for controlling inflammatory alterations associated to obesity.Financial support: FAPESP.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-522 OXYGEN RELEASE AND EXPRESSION DEPENDENTOF INTRACELLULAR IN NEUTROPHILS M. acid fatty acid (NEFA) released during lipomobilization around calving in cows or following traumatic bone injury in humans. OA induces well known effects on pancreatic cellsvia binding to GPR40 receptor, however, recent evidence suggests a possible role on innate immune response. In this study, we assessed the effect of oleic acid on bovine neutrophils activation and the role ofcalcium on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, degranulation,CD11b expression and MAPK phosphorylation. Neutrophils isolated from blood healthy heifers were incubated with 100-500 lM OA, in presence or absence of calcium chelating agents. Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured by spectrofluorimetryusing Fura-2AM. Superoxide production and CD11b expression, using hydroethidine and antibody, respectively, were assessed by flow cytometry. (MMP-9) manner, raised intracellular calcium, superoxide release and CD11b expression. The intracellular calcium mobilization was partially reduced by EGTA, an extracellular calciumchelating, and inhibited by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular release and CD11b reduced by BAPTA-AM. OA induced degranulation of neutrophils, as was demonstrated by MMP-9 release. A dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 activity was observed. OA also induced, in a dose-dependent manner, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation between 2 and 5 min of stimulation. In conclusion, we show that oleic acidinduces CD11b expression, superoxide production, degranulation andERK1/2 phosphorylation, dependent of intracellular calcium release. Thus, these results provide evidence about the role of OA in blood neutrophils activation that could affect the innate immune response.Supported by grant from IFS (B/4720-1) and Fondecyt 11100413 and DID-UACH.

Curi2 1Medical School,2Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil Background: The obese state is characterized by inflammation of low intensity and this increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules by adipose tissue has been associated with the accumulation of macrophages in this tissue. The molecular signals that initiate mac-rophages activation in obese adipose tissue are not yet known, butthere are several candidates. Objective: In order to determine the role of adipocyte released from IL-6 in this activation process, we used a model of co-cultivationbetween adipocytes and monocytes.Procedure: J774 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. We extract the adipocytes of epididymal adipose tissue of mice C57 black using collagenase type II and incubated withJ774 cells for different periods of time (1 and 3 h) in the presence or not of IL-6 neutralizing antibody. We then evaluated J774 cells gene TNF- a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, MRS-1 and MIP-1 by RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. Theexpression of genes was compared with that of the constitutive Hprt1 gene whose expression was not modulated by treatment. Results: The co-culture with adipocytes cells by periods of incubation. The expression of TNF- aincreased about 4 times after 1 h of incubation. All other genes had their expression increased after longer periods of co-cultivation besides MIP-1. Incells incubated with adipocytes and anti-IL-6 antibody we noticed a further increase in mRNA expression of these inflammatory mediators.Conclusion: The results suggest that, at least locally, IL-6 has an anti-inflammatory effect in monocytes exposed to adipocytes.

Ohura1 1Pharmacology, Osaka Dental University, Hirakata, Japan When periodontal disease develops, many inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes, can be observed inltrating the lesion. It is believed that chemokines like MCP-1 and IL-8, which are pro- duced by gingival epithelial cells undergoing stimulation bybacterial cell components from plaque bacteria through toll-likereceptor-2, are involved in the migration of these immunocompe- tent cells to the lesion site. It has been conrmed that the expression of these inflammatory cytokines is elevated in thegingival tissue and gingival sulcus exudates of periodontal diseasepatients. When we investigated the dynamics of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b, IL-6, TNF- in rats with spontaneous periodontaldisease (ODUS/Odu), we identied them to be an animal model ofInflamm. Res. S257 123periodontal disease, and maintained them in our laboratory. In this study, we measured the plasma levels of the PGE 2and Cytokine- Induced Neutrophil IL-4 in ODUS/Odu. Plasma cytokine levels were measured in these and control rats (Res) at 0 (5 weeks old),1,3,6,9, and 12 months after the start of the experiment using anenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The plasma levels of the PGE 2and CINC-1 were greater in ODUS/Odu than in Res throughout the experimental period. However, the plasma levelof the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 was lower in ODUS/Oduthan in Res. These results, similar to those obtained in patients with periodontal disease, suggest that ODUS/Odu is a useful ani- mal model of human periodontal disease.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-525 HYPOXIA INCREASES THE EXPRESSIONOF SAA IN DIFFERENTIATED 3T3-L1 AND HUMAN ADIPOCYTES E. M. Oliveira1,*, F. B. F. Monteiro1, S. Sandri1, F. H. Knebel1, C. G. I. Contesini1, F. Kamamoto2, A. Campa1 1Department of Clinical Chemistry,2University Hospital, University Of Sa o Paulo, Sa o Paulo, Brazil In obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia might generate hypoxic areas within the tissue. In a close relationship with hypoxia, the adipose tissue produces inflammatory molecules involved in obesity-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease andmetabolic disorders. Besides the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a(HIF- 1a), several proteins have their stability or expression modulated by hypoxia. It was also recognized that adipocyte size was correlatedwith the expression and production of the serum amyloid A (SAA).This protein acts as a potent stimulus for the production of cytokines in immune cells. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of hypoxia on the expression of adipocyte-derived proteinSAA isoforms, and investigate, in normoxia, the effect on theproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human blotting was used to measure HIF-1 aand SAA; for the last RT-PCR analyses was also The pro-duction of the cytokines TNF- a, IL-6, IL-1 band IL-8 in cell was determined by ELISA assays. Ambient hypoxia (1% O 2) caused a two and threefold increase in SAA3 mRNA expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes under 12 and 24 h of induction,respectively. For mature human adipocytes, the low oxygen pressure caused an approximately twofold increase in SAA1, SAA2 and SAA4 mRNA expression on 12, 6 and 24 h, respectively. During the dif-ferentiation of 3T3-L1, the presence of SAA markedly increased therelease of TNF- aand IL-6. The same effect was observed only for TNF-awhen human adipocytes were stimulated with SAA. At 24 h, it was observed a sevenfold increase in the TNF- aproduction. Our data show that the SAA gene is responsive to hypoxia, and that SAA possibly favors the improvement of the inflammatory prole of the adipose tissue that may contribute to the overall health complications related to obesity.Financing: FAPESP; CAPES; CNPq.

Hidalgo1 1Pharmacology and Morphophysiology,2Veterinary Clinical Science Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile During acute ruminal acidosis, the animals show a clinical pattern similar to septic shock. The ingestion of excessive amounts of highly fermentable concentrates is followed by an increase in propionic acidproduction, in this environment, cellulolytic and lactate-using bacteriaand protozoa are destroyed, while the growth of lactobacilli is pro- moted, increasing D-lactic acid production. During overload of oligofructose, we observed an increase of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release and L-selectin shedding in bovine neutrophils. We assessedif neutrophil response increase during ruminal acidosis by of propionate or D-lactic acid. Neutrophils isolated from venous blood incubated 0.3-30 mM propionate or0.2-10 mM D-lactic acid. The calcium release was measured by spectrofluorimetry with Fluo-4AM. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by chemiluminescence.CD11b and L-selectin expression was detected by flow cytometry.Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release was assessed by zymography and the myeloperoxidase enzyme activity with a microplate reader. The presence of GPR41 and GPR43 was evaluated using RT-PCR,western blot and confocal microscopy. 0.3 mM propionate inducedMMP-9 secretion, meanwhile 30 mM increased the myeloperoxidase release. Also we demonstrated that bovine neutrophils expressed the putative receptors of propionate GPR41 and GPR43. On the otherhand, D-lactic acid induced MMP-9 release, and increased the CD11b expression and L-selectin shedding. Additionally, we observed that D- lactic acid interfered with the ROS production, CD11b expression, L- selectin shedding and MMP-9 release induced by platelet activatingfactor. We concluded that propionic and D-lactic acid active the blood neutrophils and could contribute with the septic shock signs observed during acute ruminal acidosis.Supported by FONDECYT oil, hexanoic acid (DHA) and polyphenols like procyanidins have beenfound to inhibit the inflammatory process. Our study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of pure DHA, B 1,B2,C1procyanidins and the combination between procyanidins-DHA, on interleukin-6 (IL-6)and prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2) secretion, cyclooxygenase activity and the nuclear C 1procyanidins with or without 25 lMo f DHA for 48 h, signicantly decreased proinflammatory IL-6 secre-tion, nevertheless any of the PGE C 1, decreased cyclooxygenases inducible (COX 2) and housekeeping (COX 1) in vitro activity. The pretreatment with B 2were signicantly more selective in inhibition of COX 2than COX 1activity. The nuclear factor NF- jB activation was signicantly reduced by DHA, B and the combination procyanidins-DHA pretreatments. The IkB kinase activity was decreased through the block of the qIjB-aphosphory- lation by the combination of DHA-procyanidin pretreatments. B 1,B2, or without DHA pretreatments blocks, both p65 and p50, nuclear translocation and the retention of both subunits in the cyto- plasm. The nuclear factor NF- jB binding activity was dramatically decreased as a response of the pretreatments with DHA with orwithout B 1,B2and C 1procyanidins. The results indicate that the anti- inflammatory effects of DHA polyunsaturated fatty acid and B 1,B2, C1procyanidins, alone or together are due to inhibition of IL-6 secretion and cyclooxygenase activity, as well as NF-jB activation by blocking NF- jB p65 translocation nuclear Disclosure of Mart \u00b4nez-Micaelo Grant/Research Support from: Supported by AGL2008-01310/ALI IL-18-DEPENDENT MECHANISM A. Mortellaro1,* 1Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore In the last years, studies have clearly demonstrated that non-microbial molecules released upon cellular damage have the ability to alertimmune system through activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). Among these signals, monosodium urate (MSU), the etiological agent of gout, has been found to trigger inflammation through theactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, IL-1 band IL-18. Although the inflammasome is currently under investigation for itsrole in the activation of innate cells, less is known about its ability toprogram DC to prime a specic T cell response. In the present study, we investigated the response elicited by MSU in DC and how this could promote adaptive immune response. Bone marrow-derived DC(BMDC) stimulated with MSU combined with CD4 +T cells in the presence of MDP/MSU revealed a specic T cell polarization. We show that MDP/MSU stimulation induced the maturation of DC into stablycommitted Th17-promoting effector DC, as assessed by the presenceof IL-17-secreting T-cells both in vitro and in vivo. Similar effects were seen using MSU-activated BMDCs primed with non-microbial stimuli, such as CD40L, GM-CSF a. In vitro, the MSU-driven skewing of CD4 +T cell polarization towards the Th17 IL-1, IL-18 and NLRP3. In vivo antigen-specic Th17 polarization was similarly dependent on IL-1 and IL-18 signaling, but not on NLRP3 activation. Collectively these data show for the rsttime that a sterile danger signal, acting in synergy with pro-inflam-matory priming signals, induces Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo through an IL-1- and IL-18-dependent mechanism.

Donma2,* 1Suleymaniye Education and Research Hospital, Ministry of Health, 2Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey Obesity is often described as low-grade systemic inflammation and several proinflammatory cytokines are involved in this complexprocess. Due to the limited studies performed on children, the rela- tionships between obesity and some inflammatory parameters as well as acute phase reactants were investigated in children with normalblood count and iron status parameters. 153 children aged6.0-17.9 years were recruited for this study. They were divided into two groups; 63 constituted the control group (BMI 16.1 \u00b11.6 kg/ m 2). Based on WHO criteria, those dened as having a BMI above the gender-specic 95th included in (BMI 25.6 \u00b13.9 kg/m2). Complete blood count, serum binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), brino-gen analyses were performed. Data were analyzed by SPSS. p B0.05 was accepted as the degree of statistical signicance. There was not any statistically signicant difference between the groups in terms of mean age, male to female ratio, serum iron, TIBC, white blood cell(WBC), red blood cell, platelet counts as well as hemoglobin,hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume values. No gender difference was noted for these parameters, either. In comparison with those of the control group, CRP values were signicantly higher (p B0.001) in obese children with normal WBC count. Furthermore, in obesegroup, the concentrations of the other acute phase proteins such as brinogen and ferritin were also higher (p B0.01) than those obtained for non-obese children, which conrms the hypothesis oflow-grade systemic inflammation in childhood obesity. Even in the absence of elevated WBC count as well as anemia indicators, inflammatory parameters are elevated in obesity during childhood.These may be the pre-indicators of the development of atherosclerosisin the future.

Wouters1,*, Macrophage recruitment into adipose tissue (AT) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. Human adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) display an alternatively activatedM2 phenotype but capable of producing inflammatory mediators.However, the processes driving macrophage polarization and phe- notype in AT are not fully understood. Recently, wide-association studies have associated a single-nucleotide polymorphism on chro-mosome 9p, in the vicinity of locus encoding also the tumour suppressor p16 INK4a, with the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D).Here, we determined the expression levels of p16 INK4ain human ATMs and in monocyte-differentiated macrophages (MDMs) from obese patients and we further assessed its role in the macrophage response to inflammation. Our results show that primary ATMs fromobese patients express lower levels of p16 INK4athan MDMs from the same donors. In line, monocytes from healthy donors in vitro dif- ferentiated to M2-polarized macrophages, do differenti- ated also from healthy monocytes, simultaneously increased theexpression of M2 related genes and enhanced LPS-induced gene expression. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p16 INK4ain phenotype. Thus, decreasingp16 INK4aexpression in MDMs from healthy donors results in a phe- notype similar to ATMs from obese patients, identifying a role for p16INK4ain determining the ''M2 like - ATM inflammatory'' phenotype.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-531 THE EFFECTS OF METFORMIN AND INSULINON MANAGEMENT OF INFLAMMATORY STATE OF DIABETIC PATIENTS Faculty of Pharmacy, Eskisehir, Turkey Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized with lipid, carbohydrate and metabolism disorders which caused by lack or resistance of insulin. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic drug used to treat non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular diseases, obesity andtype 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with endothelial activation andelevated vascular inflammation. This study aimed to determine whether the serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were influenced by metforminand insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.Material and methods: The study included 59 patients (35 female and 24 male; mean age 59 \u00b114 years) who were diagnosed as type 2 diabetes mellitus and used either metformin or insulin. Control group was composed of healthy individuals (n =30). Blood samples were collected after overnight fast. hsCRP levels were determined inimmunoturbidimetric methods. The plasma concentrations of mye-loperoxidase levels were measured by spectrophotometric method. Results: Plasma concentrations of MPO for control group, metformin group and insulin group were respectively (mean \u00b1SD) 0.85 \u00b10.13, 1.43 \u00b10.16, 1.37 \u00b10.21 U/L. signicantly different from insulin and metformin groups (p \\0.05).

Control group hsCRP levels were signicantly lower than metforminand insulin groups (p \\0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that both insulin and metformin treatment have similar effects on inflammatorymarkers of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Disclosure of interest: I.

INCREASED LEPTIN ACTIVITY MATERNAL PROTEIN DEPRIVATIONDURING LACTATION INHIBITS APOPTOSIS OF THYMIC CELLS OF YOUNG OFFSPRING S. V. D. Silva1,*, C. Salama1, M. R. Martins1, E. Barja-Fidalgo1 1Pharmacology,2Cell Biology, Universidade Do Estado Do Rio De Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The consequences of maternal malnutrition in early life on thymocyte responses and the role of leptin were investigated in rats. The young progeny (PD) of dams submitted to protein deprivation during lac- tation showed at 30 days of age lower body and thymus weights, withno alteration in the thymocyte number or any difference in the prole of T cell subsets, or in their proliferative response. Similar circulating levels of corticosterone and of GR nuclear contents were detected inthymic cells of PD or control groups. In contrast, despite the rats fromPD group did not present alterations in leptin circulating levels, the expression of leptin receptor ObRb was enhanced in their thymocytes. This change was accompanied by amplication in leptin signalingresponse of thymocytes from PD rats, which showed an increase inJAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation after stimulation with leptin. Moreover, the thymic cells from PD rats presented a decreased rate of spontaneous apoptosis when compared to controls. Accordingly,higher expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and lower of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, with no change of pro-apoptotic Bad, and higher pro-caspase 3 content were detected in PD thymocytes. Moreover, thymocytes from PD group exhibited a constitutive content of p65 NF-kB associated to a lower IkB content in the cytoplasm. Finally, although there was no change in ObR genic expression in PD thymocytes, a higher expression of mRNA for Obgene was observed in the thymic microenvironment from PD animals.Taken together, the results show that maternal protein deprivation during lactation affects thymic homeostasis, inducing leptin activity, which protect thymocytes from apoptosis in young progeny and,perhaps, may prone these animals for alterations in immune responsein adult life.

Pini1, T. Montero-Melendez2, M. Perretti2, G. Fantuzzi1 1Kinesiology and Nutrition, University Of Illinois At Chicago, Chicago, United States,2William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation that increases the risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accumulation of vis- ceral adipose tissue (VSAT) is more proinflammatory and carries a higher risk for disease compared with an increase in subcutaneousadipose tissue (SCAT). Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is an antiinflammatoryproresolving mediator whose regulation has not been investigated in obesity. Expression of AnxA1 was evaluated by RT-PCR in VSAT and SCAT of male C57BL6 mice fed either a 60% kcal/fat diet (HFD)or chow diet. A signicant upregulation was observed inVSAT (p \\0.006), but not SCAT, of mice fed a HFD for 5 weeks compared with chow groups. Upregulation of AnxA1 by HFD was an early event that preceded both signicant weight gain and macro-phage inltration in VSAT, as measured by expression of CD68. When HFD was prolonged for 13 weeks, mice developed obesity and insulin resistance. At this time point, a signicant induction of AnxA1was observed in both VSAT and SCAT (p \\0.0001) compared with chow groups. Despite equivalent induction of AnxA1 in VSAT and SCAT, expression of CD68 was signicantly lower in SCAT (2-fold increase compared to chow) vs VSAT (100-fold increase) obesemice, indicating a dissociation between upregulation of AnxA1 anddegree of adipose tissue inflammation. Comparable results were obtained in ob/ob mice, a model of genetic obesity. A signicant induction of AnxA1 was observed in both VSAT (p \\0.001) and SCAT (p \\0.007) of ob/ob mice compared to their lean littermates, even though upregulation of CD68 was signicantly higher in VSAT vsSCAT. These results indicate that modulation of AnxA1 in adipose tissue is an early event and is dissociated from the process of mac-rophage inltration. Upregulation of AnxA1 likely represents a frustrated attempt at controlling adipose tissue inflammation, a response that might be exploited therapeutically to reduce the risk ofobesity-associated pathologies.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

A. 1Basic Science,2Child and Social Sa o Paulo State University, Arac \u00b8atuba, Brazil The periodontal disease (PD) during pregnancy has been referred as one of the causal factors for preterm birth and low weight at birth. And several other studies have shown that low body weight at birthbabies are more likely to develop insulin resistance (IR) in adult life. Studies have shown that both PD as the increase in adipose tissueraises the level of plasmatic cytokines. And cytokines such as TNF- a cause IR. Several studies have shown that both the decrease in''tyrosine phosphorylation status of insulin receptor substrates'' (TyP- IRS) and the increase in ''serine phosphorylation insulin receptor substrate'' (SP-IRS) status are present in experimental models of IR.This study aimed to evaluate in adult offspring of female rats withPD: (1) glycemia (G) and insulinemia (I), cholesterolemia (CH); (2) Ty-IRS and SP-IRS status, in white adipose tissue (WAT). Therefore, 20 female Wistar rats (210 g bw) were divided into two groups: (1)with PD, that was induced by a suture ligature placed around teeth;(2) control rats (CN). After 7 days of the placement of the ligature in the PD group, the rats of both groups were placed for mating. After the offspring birth, male offspring were divided into two groups: (1)PDO group, offspring from female rats with PD; (2) CNO group,offspring of CN female rats. When these rats completed 75 days of age, the evaluation of G, I, CH, and Ty-IRS and SP-IRS status in WAT was performed.

The study wasdesigned to evaluate the impact of epigallocatechin-3-gallate aloneand in combination with insulin on neuropathic pain and neuroin- flammatory cascade in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After 4 weeks, streptozotocin induced diabetic rats developed neuropathywhich was evident from decreased tail-flick latency in tail-immersiontest (thermal hyperalgesia) and decreased paw withdrawal threshold both in Randall sellitto (mechanical hyperalgesia) and von-Frey hair test (mechanical allodynia). Decrease in nociceptive threshold wasaccompanied by signicant increase in lipid peroxidation and nitritelevels in sciatic nerve of diabetic rats along with marked decrease in reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activities. Decrease in pain threshold was coupled with marked increase in TNF- a, IL-1b, caspase-3 activities subunit sciatic nerves of diabetic rats. Administration catechin-3-gallate (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) signicantly and dose-dependently attenuated the behavioral and biochemical alterations.Insulin alone corrected the hyperglycemia and partially reversed the pain response in diabetic rats. However, combination with epigallo- catechin-3-gallate not only attenuated the diabetic condition but alsoreversed neuropathic pain through modulation of functional, bio-chemical and molecular decits associated with diabetic neuropathy. Collectively, the data reveal that activation of nitrodative stress andInflamm. Res.

P-536 EXPRESSION OF TH17 AND RELATED CYTOKINES ACCORDING TO of The etiology and pathogenesis of Behc \u00b8et's disease (BD) have remained unclear, however, it has been assumed that genetic factors, infectious, and immune mechanisms are involved in the onset of this disease. A recent study has shown elevated production of IL-17, IL-23, and IFN- cby peripheral blood mononuclear increased frequencies of IL-17 and IFN- cproducing T cells in BD patients with active uveitis. It was also reported that increased expression of IL-23 p19 mRNA in erythema nodosum-like lesions inpatients with active BD. In this study, we investigated the expressionTh17 and related cytokines according to clinical activity of BD. A total of 22 patients with active and inactive BD were enrolled in this study. The disease control and healthy control (HC) group consistedof age- and sex-matched 10 recurrent aphthous ulcer (RAU) patientswithout any other evident disease and 10 healthy volunteers, respectively. PBMCs of subjects were cultured and stained with the appropriate fluorescent antibody for analysis by flow cytometry. Tomeasure the IL-17, and IFN- cconcentrations in serum and in culture supernatants, ELISA was performed. To investigate the mRNA expression level of IL-12p35, IL-12/23p40 and IL-23p19 inPBMCs, real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was per-formed. In the active BD group, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients expressed signicantly higher level of IL-17 and IFN- c, compared with the cells from the control group. High serum andsupernatant concentration of IL-17 and IFN- cwas in active BD group compared with HC and RAU groups. In addition, mRNA expression of IL-23p19, IL-12p35 and IL-12/23p40 in PBMCs was also up- regulated in BD group. Expression of IL-23p19 mRNA was signi-cantly higher in the active BD group compared with HC group. Increased expression of the IL-17 and IFN- cwas observed in this study and these results suggest that Th17 cells have an importantimplication in immune modulation of BD.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Al-Hashmi1, Karolinska Stockholm, Sweden Objectives: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication that limits the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the present study we investigated the gene expression patterns amongdifferent organs (target and non target organs) in GVHD mouse modelbased on chemotherapy conditioning regimen. Methods: Female BALB/c (H-2K d) mice were conditioned with busulfan (80 mg/kg) for 4 days followed by cyclophosphamide(200 mg/kg) for 2 days. Allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrowtransplantation (BMT) were carried out at day 0 by infusing bone marrow and spleen cells from C57BL/6 (H-2K b) or BALB/c (H-2Kd) mice, respectively. Snap frozen samples of liver, intestine, kidney andmuscle were collected from control (day -7), conditioned (day 0), allogeneic and syngeneic (day +7) transplanted mice. After extraction of total RNA, samples were analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome430 2.0 GeneChip micro array, data analyzed by Gene Spring TMsoft- ware version GX 10. Results: Gene expression pattern after conditioning (day 0) compared to control mice (day -7) showed down regulation of gene expression in all tissues. After BMT gene expression pattern were extremelydifferent in allogeneic transplanted mice compared to syngeneic. Moreover, we found a unique pattern of CD274 or programmed cell death ligand-1 that is known to be a negative regulator of T cellactivation in GVHD mice. The expression of CD274 was signicantly up regulated in the muscle and kidney by 66 and 52-fold, respectively, while much lower increment was observed in the liver (15-fold) andintestine (threefold). This could be a potential protective mechanismthat renders muscle and kidney less affected organs by acute GVHD . Conclusions: Chemotherapy conditioning influences the gene expression pattern in all the tissues. Expression of CD274 might haveprotective effects on tissue injury in muscle and kidney of GVHDpathophysiology. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Starobinas1, O. G. Ribeiro1, O. Ibanez1, M. De Franco1,* 1Laboratorio de Imunogenetica, Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil Two mouse lines were phenotype-selected for maximum (AIRmax) or minimum (AIRmin) acute inflammation responses to polyacrylamide bead (Biogel) subcutaneous injection. These lines differ in terms of bone marrow granulopoiesis, neutrophil resistance to apoptosis, andinflammatory cytokine production. Genome SNPmarkers detected two signicant quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 5 and 7 (p \\10 -6), as well as suggestive ones on chromosomes 2, 4, 6 11, 12 and 17 (p \\10-3). We compared gene expression proles of epidermal tissues of AIRmax and AIRmin micesubmitted to acute inflammatory reactions, in order to correlate with QTL found. Epidermal tissues were recovered 48 h after Biogel subcutaneous injections. Global gene expression analysis was per-formed on Affymetrix bioarrays (27 k genes) using individual RNA from both control and Biogel-treated AIRmax and AIRmin mice.S262 Inflamm. Res. 123Differentially expressed genes were statistically established and the over-represented gene ontology biological process categories wereidentied. Up-regulations of about 479 and 121 genes were observed in Biogel-treated AIRmax and AIRmin mice, respectively, but only 1 gene were found to be down-regulated in AIRmin, as compared to167 genes in AIRmax mice. The over-represented biological themesof the differently expressed genes among AIRmax and AIRmin mice represent inflammatory response, signal transduction and cell adhe- sion. We were able to demonstrate a distinct gene usage between bothlines during acute inflammation, and signicant differentiallyexpressed genes co-localized with mapped regions on chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 17.

Cytokines are signaling molecules, modulating cellular cooperation during inflammation process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of cytokinegenes and their association with cardiovascular disease, and to studypossible interactions between genes involved in the blood pressure maintenance. Study group consisted of 355 EH patients and was divided into three subgroups: rst included 219 patients with non-complicated EH, second\u201495 with myocardial infarction, third\u201441 hypertensive patients with ischemic stroke. Control group included 273 unrelated healthy subjects. In theexperiment, we used SNPs in 5 cytokine genes and 5 genes encodingfor renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and endothelial relaxation factor synthesis components, and performed an association study between EH and control subjects. 84 cytokines and cytokine receptor geneswere screened for their expression prole with the RT 2ProlerTM PCR Array (SuperArray Bioscience were found to be associated with cardiovascular com-plications of EH.

Buyanovskaya1, W. L. Olszewski1,2 1Department of Surgical Research & Transplantology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy Of Sciences,2Department of Transplantation Surgery, Central Clinical Hospital, Ministryof Internal Affairs, Warsaw, Poland Background: Passenger cells, normal constituents of whole organs, migrate from the graft create microchimerism which is suggested to beessential for sustained survival of allografts. The process of DNA transfer between mammalian cells remains not well understood. In our previous study we found donor Sry-PCR product in recipient tissues. This productwas detected in splenic macrophages and DC's, but was absent from hepatocytes and parenchymal cells. It has been suggested that donor DNA may play a role in rejection having influence on tolerance.Aim: In our study we tried to assess the amount of Srygene in different recipient tissues after allogeneic heart transplantation with and without immunosuppression (FK506). Material/methods: In allogeneic combination male rats BN served asdonors and female rats LEW as recipients. Genomic DNA wasextracted from the recipient blood and tissues at different times after grafting. Srywas detected using Real-time PCR. Relative amount levels in the different samples were calculated by using the com-parative C Tmethod with Gapdh as internal control. Results: The relative amount of Srygene was high in all female tissues 30 days after heart transplantation with immunosuppression, withhighest values in blood, liver, spleen and lymph node. Thirty days afterheart transplantation without immunosuppression the relative amount ofSrygene was in all tissues lower than with immunosuppression. Conclusion: Detection of donor male DNA isolated from femaleblood and tissues suggests its spontaneous transport into recipients. Itshigher levels in immunosuppressed recipients point to cytotoxicity of anti-rejection drugs. The question remains open whether long-lasting presence of donor DNA may have any relevance to the rejection ortolerance process.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

The sources of donor DNA areInflamm. Res. S263 123the passenger cells and debris of damaged organ endothelial and parenchymal cells. Immunosuppression may cause additional releaseof genetic material due to its cytotoxic effects. Aim: The question arises whether the level of released donor DNA may be helpful in assessment of the intensity of the rejection process. In ourprevious studies, we looked for the blood. Material/methods: In this study we have examined the plasma andblood mononuclear cells of recipients to assess the amount of SRY gene in sex- mismatched combinations and phospholipase A2- HUMPLA2A1(AAT) nin the same sex recipients after kidney trans- plantation, in relation to the patients probes before grafting by the useof the Real-time PCR method. Recipient's blood and donors spleensamples were collected before kidney transplantation and at different times after grafting. Genomic DNA was isolated from plasma and mononuclear cells. The amount of DNA in different samples after txwas calculated by using the comparative Ct method with GAPDH as internal control. Results: We observed increase in donor DNA level in recipient'sblood mononuclear cells already on day 1 after grafting. The relativeamount of SRY gene was much higher in female's lymphocytes 21 days after transplantation than in plasma. The amount of HUM- PLA gene was also higher in blood lymphocytes than in plasma 14 days after kidney transplantation.Conclusions: Donor DNA is present either in ''passenger cells'' or recipient's phagocytes. An open question remains whether it may be incorporated into recipient cell genome.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

This may suggest impaired path- ogen recognition and/or elimination at the genetic level.Aim: To validate hypothesis that patients with delayed fracturehealing express the higher frequency of TLR4 mutations. Methods: Observations were performed in 151 patients with delayed (Group A) and 144 with uneventfully healing fractures of lowerextremities (Group B). 125 healthy blood donors served as controls.Blood leukocyte DNA was used for analysis of mutations of TLR4 gene at Asp299Gly (1/W) and Thr399Ile microbiological studies.Results: Microbiological studies revealed positive isolates in 31.5% gaps in group A and 16.4% in B (p \\0.05). The most enterococci. 16S rRNA was detected in 56.8 and 65.2%, respectively. The frequency of 1/W mutation was signicantly higher (p \\0.05) in groups of patients with non-healing infected versus sterile fractures. In subgroup withisolated pathogens frequency of 1/W allele was higher compared withthose with sterile fracture gaps. Conclusion: The obtained data suggest predisposal to infection in subjects with single TLR4 mutation. This coincided with delayedbone fracture union.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Res. 123Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is a rare disease but the most common form of uveitis with proposed autoinflammatory rather than autoim-mune background. At the moment, dened genetic component responsible for this sight threatening disease manifestation is unknown. There is, however, growing number of evidence that singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes can influence thedevelopment of ocular inflammation through their effect on cytokine level production. The gene encoding IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was broadly investigated and several SNPs were proved tobe implicated in various forms of uveitis and outcome (Stanford et al.2005; Mizuki et al. 2010; Remmers et al. 2010; Atan et al. 2010). Data obtained with idiopathic intermediate uveitis patients revealed that homozygotes for rs1800896A ( -1082) in the IL10 promoter region were strongly associated with bad outcome. Functional studiesalso reported that the -1082A, -819T and -592A haplotype is associated with low IL-10 production whereas GCC haplotype formed by the same set of SNPs is linked with IL-10 upregulation and isprotective against disease recurrence. For this study, DNA from 137 patients with AAU and 92 healthy controls recruited through Oregon Health and Science University were analyzed for polymorphisms inthe promoter region of the IL10 gene at the established -1082A/G, - 819C/T and -592A/C positions by SSP-PCR. Data analysis revealed no signicant association of haplotypes with AAU. Four additional markers of were genotypingassays: rs1518111, haplotypes based on SSP-PCR and TaqMan results. Joint analysis released six haplotypes. None reached the signicance level for the association with the AAUhowever, the addition of subsequent markers to the established ATA haplotype showed a trend towards association. Therefore further haplotype extending will be of interest.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-547 AN IN VITRO MODEL TO STUDY GENDER DIFFERENCES IN INFLAMMATION N. Lefevre1,*, F. Corazza2, J. of Pediatrics, Hospital Brugmann, Brussels, Belgium Gender influences the severity and evolution of various inflammatory conditions. Recent clinical studies showed signicant gender differ- ences in inflammatory markers of prepubertal children with very lowsex steroid levels, suggesting a genetic contribution. We studied in 24 healthy adults of both sexes some main leukocyte functions of the innate immunity depending on X-linked genes. The respiratory burstmeasured by chemiluminescence of puried neutrophils stimulatedwith fMLP was not different in males and (p [0.05) although the main NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox is linked to the X chromosome. Percentage of monocytes expressing CD99 washigher in men than in women in the basal state and after stimulationwith LPS and fMLP in whole blood (p \\0.05). This conrms the higher CD99 protein expression reported in males using RT-PCR and probably due to the partial silencing of the CD99 gene in the inac-tivated X chromosome of female cells. But using flow cytometry, we were unable to observe any difference in the level of CD99 expression(p[0.05). Using Cytometric Bead Array, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF- a) produced in whole blood after a 24 h incubation with and without LPS at 1 ng/ml and 1 lg/ml.

Normand5, auto-inflammatory syndromes called NLRP12-asso- ciated disorders (NLRP12AD) has been associated with mutations in NLRP12. Conflicting data have been generated in vitro on the puta- tive role of NLRP12 on IL-1B signaling. This prospective secretion PBMC response to IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra), a major drug in the treatment of auto-inflammatory dis-orders.

However, a pro-gressive clinical relapse occurred secondarily, associated with anincrease in TNFa secretion, a persistence of elevated levels of and and a reincrease in IL-1B secretion. Anakinra was with- drawn after 14 months of therapy. This study, which provides in vivoevidence for the crucial role of IL-1B in the pathophysiology of NLRP12AD, reports the rst use of anakinra in this disorder and one of the few examples of resistance to anti-IL1 therapy in auto-inflammatory syndromes. Our data also point to the potential interestof cytokine ex vivo measurements in predicting response to treatment and provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying resistance to anti-IL1 therapy.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-551 EFFECT OF RETINOIC ACID RECEPTOR BETA ABLATION ON CELLS INVOLVED IN INFLAMMATION IN A CONDITIONAL MOUSE LINE N. Seran1,*, E. Albino1, R. Oca INSERM, Strasbourg, France Vitamin A and its active derivatives (referred to as retinoids) play critical roles in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Ret-inoids are ligands that bind and activate retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) each consisting of three isotypes ( a,bandc) and these, in turn, function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes. Several studieshave shown that vitamin A and their receptors have crucial effects on cells involved in the inflammatory response. However, RAR beffect in these cells has not been studied. On the other hand, RAR bact as aS266 Inflamm. Res. 123tumor suppressor and is required for the anti-proliferative effect exerted by retinoids and its expression is frequently lost in manyneoplastic tissues like cervical cancer. Conditional mice generated by floxing RAR bgene and expressing Cre recombinase (RAR b L-/L-) represent a useful model to analyze the function of this receptor. Thiswork examined the role of RAR bon DCs and macrophages in spleen as well as the effect of RAR bablation in cervix of RAR b L-/L- conditional mice. Our results showed that RAR bis expressed mainly in the splenic white pulp zone of wild type mice. In addition, lowlevels of RAR bexpression were detected in the spleen of RAR b L-/L- mice, as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. These results are consistent with a decrease in the popula- tion of splenic CD11c+MHC-II+ white cells. Histopathology analysesof conditional mice spleen showed a reduction of macrophage-likecells and defects in cell organization and structure. These results correlated with RAR bablation, histological alterations and a neu- trophil-morphology-cell inflammatory inltrate in cervix of RAR b L-/ L-mice as detected by Western Blot and histopathology analyses. Our results suggest that RAR bis involved in splenic and cervical cell organization as well as the homeostatic maintenance of cells impli-cated in inflammation like macrophages and DCs.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-552 THE RELATION BETWEEN THE SEVEREINFLAMMATORY BURN PROCESS AND HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN M. Assiut Hospitals, 2Oncological Clinical patholoy, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut, Egypt Introduction: Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is signicantly var- iable in the inflammatory process of the burn trauma. HLA-Dr antigens expressed several days after stimulation by burn injury andremains expressed for several weeks. This work aims to detect if thereis a relation between the inflammatory process of burned patients and HLA as an important immunological marker, and HLA-Dr expression on peripheral T lymphocytes.Patients and Methods: Twenty six patients suffering from major burn versus 100 apparently healthy controls were included. Five milliliters of whole blood were collected from control and patient groups at 24 h,1 week and 2 weeks after burn injury. HLA-DRB1 was tested usingsequence specic oligonucleotide (SSO) technique. HLA-Dr was also tested using flowcytometry. Results: Comparisons between patients and controls in the frequencyof HLA-DRB1 different alleles were performed revealing that HLA-DR4, DR11 and DR13 were signicantly decreased in patients group with the P values of ( \\0.046, \\0.04 and \\0.04, respectively). In addition, DR13 frequency was signicantly increased in patients withgram negative bacilli infection (p absolute number of HLA -Dr +T lymphocyte subsets all over the time of the study are lower than controls except that of HLA -Dr+T lymphocytes after 2 weeks (p =0.009) in patient compared to control groups. No cor- relations were found between the HLA-DRB1 different alleles and the expression level of HLA-Dr. Conclusions: Signicant associations of the polymorphism of HLA-DR13 with gram negative bacilli occurring in severe burn inflam-mation must be considered. Therefore, it seems possible that DR13 may influence the occurrence of severe infection in burned patientsand explained that as an evidence of natural selection by microor- ganisms.

Resolution of inflammation and tissue repair P-553 THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF LOW LEVEL LASER THERAPY ON REPAIR OF RADIUS FRACTURE IN RABBIT F. K. Sarvestani1,*, S. Dehghan2, M. H. Bagheri3, 2Veterinary Shiraz University,3Radiologic Department, Shiraz University Of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Islamic Republicof Iran Introduction: Studies on the effects of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on fracture bone repair have shown different results: some of them have reported positive effects of LLLT on bone healing, whereas others did not obtain any signicant results. The aim of this study wasevaluation of therapeutic effect of LLLT on the rate of callus for-mation and bone healing time in the radius of rabbit. Methods: 30 white male rabbits of Dutch race (2 \u00b10.2 kg weight) were used. After applying anesthesia, 3 mm in diameter lesion wasinduced in the craniomedial aspect of radius bone by orthopedic saw.Then rabbits were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. In the experimental group a laser ( k=830 nm, F = 1500 Hz, P =50 mW, D =4) was applied transcutaneously on 3 points at 9 sessions during 21 days. The rst irradiation was per- formed 24 h after surgery. The control defects were allowed to heal spontaneously. To assess the callus formed, 4 series of radiographicimages from 2 views (lat and AP) with 1 week interval were taken.Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test and repeated measurement.

Pereira3, \u00b8atuba, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista, SP, Brazil,3Department of Surgery of Dentistry of Arac \u00b8atuba, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista, SP, Brazil, Arac \u00b8atuba, Brazil Hypertension is an unfavorable condition for dental treatments that require bone healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate thealveolar wound healing in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and atenolol effect on this process. Wistar rats and SHR treated with atenolol (100 mg/kg/day) were submitted to the extraction of theupper right incisive tooth and sacriced at different days after surgery.The hemi-jaws were extracted and the radiographic images were obtained and analysed. Histological, histomorphometric and immu- nohistochemical reactions were done in sections, 5 lm thick, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or subjected to immu- nolabeling to RANK, RANKL, OPG and MMP-9 proteins. The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. In immunohistochemicalanalysis, scores were assigned to the images and the results wereanalyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney statistical tests (p\\0.05). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD), lower bone per- centage and less thickness of trabecular bone was observed in the nalperiods of alveolar bone healing in SHR. Increased RANKL, RANKand MMP-9 immunolabeling were observed at 28 after surgery in SHR alveolus. Atenolol increased the BMD observed in most of the periods analyzed and increased trabecular bone thickness at 28 and42 days in SHR alveolus. Increased OPG immunolabeling at 7 and 42 days of alveolar healing were observed in treated SHR. Increased expression of RANKL and MMP-9 at 21 and 42 days, and increasedRANK expression at 21 day was also observed in alveolus of SHRtreated with atenolol. Our results suggested that the delay in alveolar healing observed in SHR was associated with increased peripheral sympathetic tone described in these animals. Changes in alveolarbone formation and remodeling would be associated with differentialexpression of proteins in bone metabolism OPG, RANKL, RANK and MMP-9, which is modulated by the effect of atenolol.

Solbach1 1Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene,2Institute of Anatomy, University Of Lu \u00a8beck, Lu \u00a8beck, Germany Neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) are rapidly recruited from the bloodstream to the site of acute inflammation where they die in largenumbers. Since release of toxic substances from dead neutrophils can propagate the inflammatory response leading to tissue destruction, clearance of dying inflammatory neutrophils has a critical function inthe resolution of the inflammatory response. Apoptotic neutrophils are phagocytosed primarily by macrophages, provided these cells are present in adequate numbers. However, macrophages are rare at sitesof acute inflammation while the number of neutrophils can beextremely high. In the present study in vitro experiments with humanneutrophils were carried out to investigate whether neutrophils can ingest apoptotic neutrophils. We show that ''na \u00a8ve'' granulocytes isolated from venous blood have a limited capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells. However, exposure to activating stimuli such as LPS, GM-CSF and/or IFN-gamma results in enhanced phagocytosis ofapoptotic cells. The efcient uptake of apoptotic cells by PMN wasfound to depend on the presence of heat labile serum factors. Importantly, the contact to or uptake of apoptotic cells inhibited neutrophil functions such as respiratory burst and the release of thepro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IP-10. The data suggest thatactivated neutrophils participate in the clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, since apoptotic cells inhibit pro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils, uptake of apoptotic cells by PMN contributes to theresolution of inflammation.Disclosure of None TACE(TUMOR FACTOR-ALPHA CONVERTING ENZYME) BY FOOD-DERIVED PEPTIDES OCCURRING IN HUMANPERIPHERAL BLOOD E.

Hoshi1 1Department of Cartilage & Bone Regeneration (Fujisoft),2Division of Tissue Engineering, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo,Japan Tissue reaction after transplantation of engineered tissues could hamper their regeneration. The understanding of those biologicalevents provides valuable information to inhibit severe inflammation and could improve the clinical results of tissue engineering. This study was conducted to elucidate the interaction between tissue-engineered cartilage using biodegradable polymer scaffolds and hostcells. Tissue-engineered cartilage acid (PLLA) scaffolds were trans- planted in EGFP transgenic mice of the same genetic background.Host-derived EGFP-positive cells were mostly F4/80-positive mac-rophages, which were drastically decreased and excluded to non- cartilage areas after transplantation. Meanwhile, IL-1 bwas signi- cantly (FasL) was immunolocalized on the chondrocytes in tissue-engineered cartilage, indicating that immune privilege was formed in tissue-engineered cartilage, suppressing tissue reactions.We then used FasL-hypomorphic mice (gld) to prove the function ofFasL in the formation of immune privilege. Chondrocytes of wild- type induced apoptosis of macrophage with higher incidence, than those of gld. In the transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage, theconstructs of wild-type underwent more accumulation of cartilagematrix than those of gld. To examine the trigger of FasL expression on chondrocytes interacted with macrophages, the co-culture medium of both cells were exhaustively analyzed, which detected G-CSF. TheG-CSF-treated constructs underwent less inltration of macrophageswith increased formation of cartilage after transplantation. The G-CSF secreted from macrophages could increase the expression of FasL on chondrocytes and render immune privilege, which may inturn suppress the viability and localization of macrophages, promot- ing the maturation of tissue-engineered cartilage.

Research Barts and The London SMD, QMUL, London, United Kingdom,2Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen,3Action Pharma AS, Copenhagen, Denmark Inflammation is a defensive response of the body against pathogens and injury, which is tightly controlled by endogenous pro-resolvingfactors (such as lipids, e.g. lipoxins and resolvins, and peptides, e.g. Annexin A1) operative in restoring homeostasis after tissue injury. Melanocortin (MC) peptides are emerging as another group of anti-inflammatory mediators, though their ability to activate resolving circuits is yet not investigated. Here we studied an analogue of aMSH, compound AP214, currently in clinical development for of 4 vitro, inhibited by AP214 (1-100 nM). At these concentrations, a potent pro-resolving action of the phagocytosis of human apoptotic neutrophils (process of effero-cytosis) was observed: this occurred in vitro as well as in vivo. Toidentify the receptor target for the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties of AP214, cells and mice lacking the MC 3receptor were employed observing that inhibitory effects of the compound on neu-trophil inltration, IL-1 brelease and efferocytosis were no longer measured. Similar observations were obtained with another com- pound, AP1189: when AP1189 was given at the peak of inflammation (12 h after injection with zymosan) in the peritonitis model, it was ableto increase resolution compared to vehicle treated mice, an effect independent on increased leukocyte apoptosis. In summary, MC- related drugs are anti-inflammatory therapeutics endowed with genu-ine pro-resolving properties, thus adding this family of compounds(peptides or small molecules) to the successful exploitation of the resolution of inflammation paradigm for innovative drug discovery programmes.Disclosure of interest: T.

We have previously shown that macrophages exert dual and benecial role during skeletal muscle repair. Soon after injury, inltrating monocytes/macrophages are classically activated andphagocyte tissue debris while preventing early myogenic dif- ferentiation. Then macrophages switch their phenotype to resolve inflammation: the second phase of muscle repair is characterizedby the presence of so called M2 macrophages that, while damp-ening environmental inflammatory signals, directly support myogenesis and myobre growth. We aimed at exploring the effects of these different types of macrophages at the cellular levelon the sequential steps of in vitro human myogenesis, namelyexpression of the differentiation (myogenic) programme, prefu- sional migration of the cells, and eventually fusion of the cells to form myotubes. We found that pro-inflammatory (M1), alterna-tively activated (M2a) and anti-inflammatory (M2c) macrophagesexert distinct, sometimes opposite effects on the steps of in vitro myogenesis, essentially through secreted factors. As a whole, M1 macrophages inhibit myogenesis while M2 macrophages stimulateeach step of myogenesis. Secretome of human polarized macro- phages was performed to identify putative candidates involved in these trophic functions.

P-560 EVALUATION OF THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF FATTY ACIDS FROM VEGETABLES OILSON WOUND HEALING A. R. Brogliato1,*, J. B. Figueiredo1, P. A. Borges2, A. Monte-Alto-Costa3, C. F.

Despite of its clinical relevance, in Brazilthere are not statistical data yet. Researchers have been showingthat fatty acid from vegetal origin improves the wound healing. Vegetables oils for wound treatment have been used in Brazil currently, but do not have scientic endorsement. Therefore, ouraim was to describe the mechanism of action of Curatec AGE /C210 (commercial product rich with oleic acid, linoleic acid and medium chain triglycerides) in skin wound healing in mice. Methods: The wound was surgically induced and treated daily withCuratec AGE /C210. Mineral oil was used as control. Results: The Curatec AGE/C210induced an increase of neutrophil accumulation in the wound at days 1, 4, 7 and 14, which has a peak atday 4. A high level of IL-13 in wound homogenate was observed atday 7 but no difference was found in IL-10, IL-6, TNF aand TGF b levels. Curatec AGE /C210showed increase of new blood vessels and predominance of broblasts in newly formed tissue at day 7 afterwound. However the wound closure in treated and control groups wassimilar throughout the 14 days of evaluation. Conclusions: Taken together, Curatec AGE /C210promoted pro-inflam- matory effects only in early days after injury. The presence of newblood vessels and broblasts indicate granulation tissue formation, which was not evident in control group. Data also suggest that fatty acids from Curatec AGE /C210affect the wound microenvironments leading to an improvement of new tissue formation after injury. Weintend to evaluated the Curatec AGE /C210influence on the total collagen production at the wound, as well as parameters of oxidative stress and deposit of matrix proteins in the wound bed.

Kirsch1,*, S. Endesfelder1, Pharma of Medical of Dermatology, University Hospital Charite \u00b4, Berlin, Germany Cutaneous wound healing is a complex regenerative and immunolog- ical process. Its disturbance leads to chronic wounds and represents agreat medical problem. In the past, we demonstrated that the novel IL- 10 cytokine family members IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24 play a major role in inflammatory skin diseases like psoriasis. Here, we studied the sig-nicance of these cytokines in cutaneous tissue repair. Surprisingly, using an in vivo mouse model, IL-20 was almost constantly expressed upon wounding and following healing process, whereas IL-22 was notexpressed at all. In contrast, IL-24 was highly upregulated in theinflammatory phase of wound repair. The major sources of IL-24 appeared to be T cells and keratinocytes. IL-24 acts through a transmembrane receptor complex, which is composed of IL-22R1 andIL-20R2. Importantly, mice lacking IL-22R1 (IL-22R1 -/-) compared to corresponding wild-type mice (WT) showed a delayed wound clo- sure starting in the early phase of the healing process. Further studies identied keratinocytes, but not dermal broblasts, being IL-24 action. The IL-24 treatment of human keratinocytes regulates the expression of antimicrobial proteins, chemokines and keratinocytedifferentiation-associated genes. This study suggests that the IL-24/IL-22R1 system plays a key role in the inflammatory phase of cutaneous wound healing. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) has been shown to such as, apoptosis, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatoryS270 Inflamm. Res. 123activities. In this study, we investigated the role of GILZ on the spontaneous and pharmacologically-induced resolution of neutro-philic inflammation in the pleural cavity of LPS-challenged mice. The injection of LPS induced a time-dependent influx of neutrophils into the pleural cavity of mice which was maximal at 8-24 h, diminishedat 48 h, with complete resolution occurring at 72 h. The spontaneousresolution of neutrophilic inflammation was accompanied by an increase of mononuclear cells at the pleural cavity and was associated with an increase in the number of apoptotic cells at 8-48 h, interval oftime that precedes complete resolution, as demonstrated by mor-phological and biochemical criteria (increase of Bax and caspase-3 cleavage). The expression of GILZ was detected in PBS challenged mice and its levels decreased markedly at the peak of inflammationand increased during the resolution phase of the response. Pharma-cological treatment of mice with drugs that cause resolution of inflammation, including rolipram, wortmannin and dexamethasone, reduced the number of neutrophil in the pleural cavity and increasedexpression of GILZ, which was associated with activation of a pro- apoptotic program (increase of Bax and caspase-3 cleavage and decrease of Bcl-xL). In conclusion, our results showed a positivecorrelation between expression of GILZ, increased expression of pro-apoptotic pathway and resolution of inflammation, suggesting GILZ plays an important role in the signaling events leading to resolution of neutrophilic inflammation.

In other inflammatory models, similar roles were documented for heparanase that degrades ECMheparan sulphate proteoglycans. We report here that synthesis of heparanase is, surprisingly, increased only during the late phase of zymosan peritonitis (at 24 h). An anti-inflammatory role of hepa-ranase is revealed by nding that specic inhibition of heparanasedoes not decrease neutrophil influx, and in contrast, neutrophil numbers are increased but without affecting neutrophil apoptosis. For MMP-9, we showed maximal neutrophil influx (6 h) than in wild-type mice. However, during the late stages of peritonitis (24 h) an extended accumulation of neutrophils was observed in MMP-9-/-mice. Recently, we reported that this was due to increased release of COX-1-derived PGE 2that inhibited apoptosis of inflam- matory neutrophils. The aim of the current study was to investigatethe production of mediators/enzymes in the resolution ofinflammation and evaluate whether these are altered in mice lacking MMP-9. mRNA expression and release of IL-10 and TGF- bwere signicantly decreased at 6 h in MMP-9 -/-mice, whereas in late inflammation (24 h) they were signicantly augmented. Moreover, we detected that intracellular and extracellular This phenom- enon was also observed in the early stage of peritonitis. Overall, we reveal that the resolution of zymosan peritonitis is enhanced in MMP- 9-/-mice as the production of IL-10, TGF- band heparanase is increased. This suggests that MMP-9 has unexpected impacts on thetermination of inflammation. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Laskin3 1Department of Orthodontics, University Of Milan, Milano, Italy, 2Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Semmelweis University of Medicine, Budapest, Hungary,3Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States Aim: The aim of this study was to show the destructive effects of abnormal occlusal forces on implant supported prostheses in patients with bruxism, abnormal habits and other parafunctions, and to focus on concepts and the clinical procedures to reduce the potential riskfactors for implant failure. Material and methods: 40 TMD patients were compared to 40 no- TMD patients in which were inserted 430 implants with the samefeatures as number, size, position, design. Another experimentalgroup of 50 TMD patients treated by prevention protocol was assessed. Besides, were considered type of restoration, cemented or screwed, malocclusion type, smoking, load timing. The heavy forceof compression, clenching and grinding, as in bruxism, simulta-neously applied strong pressures to the implants, crestal bone, restorations and temporomandibular joints. This was a potential risk factor for crestal bone loss, loss of integration before and after res-toration, abutment screw loosening and fracture, implant fracture, decementation of restorations and fracture of the porcelain. Results: The 5 years follow-up showed a 58% of soft tissues, boneand prosthetic complications in TMD patients versus a 11% in nonTMD patients ( P\\0.01). When TMD patients were undergone to occlusal overload prevention protocol, the complications were diminished to 13% ( P\\0.01). Increasing the number of implants and reducing cantilevers decreases the stress; using the longest and widestimplant possible increases implant/bone surface area and reduces also strain. Also implant design, occlusal table size, the direction, duration and magnication of the forces influences the stress at the crestalbone/implant surface.Conclusion: Developing treatment plan that control the chronic bruxism through night-guards and an occlusal adjustment protocol to modify the occlusal forces on implants and their restorations, patientswith temporomandibular disorders and bruxism can be candidates for implants.

The aim ofthis study was to determine whether donor site morbidity could beavoided by using pure-phase Beta-TCP. Materials and methods: Bilateral sinus grafting was performed on 20 selected patients; Beta-tricalcium phosphate was used on the experi-mental side, and autogenous bone was used on the control side. In addition to routine panoramic radiographs, 2- and 3-dimensional computerized tomographic examinations were performed pre- andpostoperatively and after implantation. Eighty bone biopsy specimenswere taken at the time of implant placement. Results: Histologically and histomorphometrically, there was no signicant difference between the experimental and control grafts interms of the quantity and rate of ossication. For each histologicsample, the total surface area, the surface area that consisted of bone, and the surface area that consisted of graft material were measured in mm 2, and bone and graft material were analyzed as percentages of the total. The mean percentage bone areas were 36.47 \u00b16.9 and 38.34 \u00b17.4%, respectively; the difference was not signicant (P=.25). The autogenous bone was initially less visible than the Beta-TCP, but new bone formation was clearly observed for bothmaterials. The rate of graft resorption was lower on the experimental side than on the control side. The mean graft area percentages were 13.95 \u00b15.38 and 8.47 \u00b13.17%, respectively, and the difference was highly signicant ( P\\.001). The mean areas of the biopsy samples taken from the 2 sides were quite similar: 9.18 \u00b12.42 mm 2on the experimental side and 8.98 \u00b11.76 on the control side. Conclusion: Comparisons with other studies reveal that Beta-TCP is asatisfactory graft material for maxillary sinus floor augmentation,even without autogeneous bone.

Three layered cell sheetsof each cell source supported with woven polyglycolic acid weretransplanted to the denuded root surface autologously. One-wall trabony were lled with the mixture of b-tricalcium phosphate (b-TCP)/collagen. Eight weeks after the transplantation, periodontal regeneration was signicantly observed with both newly formedcementum and well-oriented PDL bers in the PDLCs group com- pared to other groups. In addition, nerve lament was observed in the regenerated PDL tissue only in the PDLCs group. Alveolar boneregeneration was observed in all groups.

P-568 IDENTIFICATION OF PEPTIDE RESPONSIBLE FOR MODERATION OF HEPATITIS IN WHEATGLUTEN HYDROLYSATE BY IN VIVO ACTIVITY- Sanada2, S. Ono3 1Div. Applied Life Sciences, Kyoto Prefectural University, Kyoto, 2Graduate School of Science and Technology, Chiba University, Chiba,3Toyama National College of Technology, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan Glutamine is an non-essential amino acid, but it becomes essential under surgical trauma and some pathological conditions. Gln has beensupplemented to patients suffering from hepatitis and other illness. However, Gln is easily degraded into pyroglutamic acid in solution and lost its benecial nutritional value. Wheat gluten is rich in glu-taminyl residue. Then, the enzymatic hydrolysate of wheat gluten hasbeen considered as good glutamine source. There is an episode sug- gesting that ingestion of wheat gluten hydrolysate (WHG) could moderate symptom of hepatitis (Horiguchi et al. 2004). The objectiveof the present study was to identify the active compound in WHG.Ingestion of WHG can moderate galactosamin-induced acute hepatitis in rat model. To identify the active component in WHG, in vivo activity-guided fractionation was carried out. Peptides in WHG werefractionated on the basis of amphoteric nature of sample peptide bythe method of Hashimoto et al. (2005). The acidic peptide fractions showed signicant moderation of the hepatitis. Peptides in active fraction predominantly consisted of free pyroglutamic acid (pyroGlu),pyroGlu-Leu, pyroGlu-Ile, pyroGlu-Gln, and pyroGlu-Gln-Gln. Among them, pyroGlu-Leu signicantly suppressed the hepatitis. On the basis of the present results, pyroGlu-Leu can at least partially beresponsible for the benecial effects of WHG. The pyroGlu-Leu isabsorbed into portal blood of rat after oral ingestion and suppress induction of proinflammatory cytokines and NO. Then it could be concluded that pyroGlu-Leu moderates acute hepatitis by suppressinginflammatory response.Disclosure Patel1, M.

In summary,applying a novel predictive protocol using C-28/I2 chondrocyte cellline cultured in MM, we report the chondroprotective properties of AP214.

P-570 EXPRESSION OF WNT RELATED GENES IN HUMAN PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT CELLSDURING OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION A. Yamada1,2,*, T. Iwata3, Y. 1Section of Periodontology, Department of Hard Tissue Engineering, 2Global Center of Excellence Program, International Research Center for Molecular Science in Tooth and Bone diseases, Tokyo Medical and Dental University,3Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University(TWIns), Tokyo, Japan Background: Periodontitis is a bacterial infection and can lead to tooth loss. Periodontal ligament (PDL) is a connective tissue thatexists between tooth and alveolar bone, and considered to contain mesenchymal stromal cells. So PDL is suggested to be useful for periodontal regeneration. When PDL cells are cultured with osteo-inductive medium (OIM), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity andosteogenic gene expressions are enhanced and PDL cells formmineralized nodules after the long-term cultivation. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of Wnt signaling duringosteogenic differentiation in human PDL cells. Methods: To investigate the multipotency of hPDL cells, colony forming assay (CFA) and differentiation assay were performed.hPDL cells were cultured in OIM, and ALP activity was measuredwith various reagents. To analyze the Wnt-related genes during osteoblastic differentiation, mRNAs were quantitatively analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. About interested genes, loss and gain offunction experiments were performed.Results: hPDL cells in this study showed mesenchymal stromal cell-like properties. hPDL cells grown in OIM showed high ALP activity, however it was decreased by Wnt inhibitor, XAV939.From the analysis of PCR array, secreted Frizzled-related protein 3(SFRP3) was up-regulated, on the other hand, SFRP4 down-regulated during the osteoinduction. TaqMan PCR assay also conrm the gene expressions, and time course studies revealed theexpression of SFRP3 was gradually increased, whereas that of SFRP4 was decreased. SFRP3 siRNA and recombinant human SFRP4 decreased ALP activity.Conclusions: These results suggest that Wnt signaling, especiallySFRPs, involves in the osteogenic differentiation of hPDL cells. SFRPs, which are extracellular antagonists of Wnt signaling, may be differentially regulated during osteoinduction and can be a newtherapeutic reagent for preventing inflammatory periodontal boneloss.

The aim of our study was to investigate cyto- protective effects of low and high molecular weight hyaluronans(19,000 Da, 1,270,000 Da) against LPS, known as a P2X7/inflam-masome activator. Methods: We used macrophages derived from U937 cell line using Phorbol-myristate-ace \u00b4tate 16 nM for 48 h to study cell viability (Alamar blue test), oxidative stress (DCF-DA test), P2X7 cell deathreceptor activation (YO-PRO-1 test) and cytokines release (ELISA). Cells were preincubated with hyaluronan for 2 h then stimulated and incubated with LPS for 24 h.Results and discussion: We observed that high molecular weight hyaluronan protected macrophages against LPS cytotoxicity (cell viability, oxidative stress) whereas low molecular weight hyaluronanincreased LPS cytotoxicity. Low molecular weight hyaluronan(\\20,000 Da) was already known to be proinflammatory but we demonstrated here that high molecular weight hyaluronan has pro- tective effects against LPS which is known to induce P2X7/inflammasome.Disclosure interest: None declared.Inflamm.

Fantuzzi1 1Kinesiology and Nutrition,2Pathology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, United States Obesity exacerbates severity in acute pancreatitis (AP) and is asso- ciated with elevated levels of IL-6 in both humans and experimentalanimals, including the murine model of AP induced by co-adminis- tration of IL-12 + IL-18. To study the role of IL-6 in AP exacerbation by obesity, WT and IL-6 KO C57BL6 male mice were fed either ahigh-fat diet (HFD) or chow diet (lean) for 13 weeks. IL-6 deciencydid not affect the degree of obesity or insulin resistance induced by HFD. Lean and HFD WT and IL-6 KO mice received two injections of IL-12 + IL-18 and were euthanized at 1, 3, 7 or 15 days. Acinarcell and fat necrosis were both signicantly more severe and pro-longed in HFD compared with lean groups, irrespective of genotype. The degree of inflammatory inltrate was comparable in each group at day 1. However, a signicant delay in the resolution of inflam-mation was observed in the pancreas of HFD WT mice compared with both HFD IL-6 KO and lean mice. Specically, resolution of the and lymphocyte inltrate followed a comparable kineticsin HFD IL-6 KO and lean mice, whereas a signicant delayed reso-lution was observed in HFD WT mice. In contrast, no effect of genotype was observed for resolution of macrophage inltration, which was delayed in both HFD groups compared with lean mice.The pattern of chemokine production was in agreement with histo-logic data, with signicantly higher levels of CXCL1 and CXL2 in HFD WT compared with HFD IL-6 KO mice, whereas levels of CCL1 were not signicantly different between the two groups.Despite the important role of IL-6 in augmenting the inflammatoryinltrate, overall the exacerbated pathological response associ- lethality was not affected by IL-6 deciency in HFD mice. Therefore, elevated production of IL-6 cannot by itself explain theincreased AP severity of obese mice receiving IL-12 + RESOLVES NEUTROPHILIC INFLAMMATION IN A MODELOF ANTIGEN-INDUCED IN Lopes1, F. Coelho1, L. pathogenesis of rheuma- toid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine the ability ofhydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to influence neutrophilic inflammation in a model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice. AIA was induced by administration of antigen into the knee joint of previouslyimmunized mice. Neutrophil accumulation was measured by counting neutrophils in the synovial cavity and assaying myeloperoxidaseactivity in tissues surrounding the knee joint. Apoptosis was deter- mined by morphological and molecular techniques. The role of H 2O2 was studied by using mice that do not produce reactive oxygen spe- cies (gp91phox -/-mice) and drugs which enhance or its degradation (catalase). Antigen chal- lenge of immunized mice induced neutrophil accumulation that peaked at 12-24 h after challenge. H 2O2production peaked at 24 h, concomitant with the resolution of the joint inflammatory process.Neutrophil recruitment was similar in WT and gp91 phox -/-mice; however we observed a delayed resolution in gp91phox -/-mice or after administration of catalase. In contrast, administration of H 2O2or SOD accelerated the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Reso-lution of inflammation induced by SOD or H 2O2was accompanied by increase in number of apoptotic neutrophils. Apoptosis caspase- 3- and PI3K/AKT acti-vation. Levels of H 2O2increase during neutrophil influx and are necessary for natural resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Mech- anistically, enhanced levels of H 2O2(endogenous or exogenous) decreased p-AKT and induced apoptosis of migrated neutrophils.Modulation of H 2O2production may represent a novel strategy to control neutrophilic inflammation in the joints.

Silva1,2,N .O .S .C a mara1,2 1Nephrology, Federal University of Sao Paulo,2Immunology, Biomedical Sciences, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction and aims: The tubule-interstitial brosis is a major event of chronic kidney disease and is also an important predictor of renaldysfunction. The brous tissue is caused by the accumulation ofbroblasts, myobroblasts and extracellular matrix. Recently it has been demonstrated that broblasts can also be derived from endo- thelial cells by the process of endothelial to mesenchymal transition(EndMT). Transforming growth factor-beta protein (TGF- b1), a master cytokine acts as a stimulator of EndMT. Our aim was to demonstrate EndMT in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelialcells (HUVECs) stimulated with TGF- b1 and verify the expression of inflammatory mediators. Methods: The HUVECS were stimulated TGF- b1 (10 ng/mL) at 72 h. The phenotypical changes of HUVECs were analyzed by confocalimaging, protein expression (western blot) and gene expression (realtime PCR) of endothelial cells related molecules such as Von Wille- brand factor (VWF) and VE-cadherin, and mesenchymal cells HUVECs showed expression ofa-SMA and vimentin protein, decrease in the expression of VE- cadherin, VWF and TGF- b1 protein by western blot. It was dem- onstrated that mesenchymal cells markers appear after 72 h whenHUVECs are stimulated with TGF- b1 (10 ng/mL). It was also positive to antibodies specics from mesenchymal cells, capture confocal imaging indicate that the cells were undergo to EndMT.S274 Inflamm. Res. 123Conclusions: TGF- b1 was able to induce EndMT in HUVECs being a suitable model to study in vitro and these new ndings suggest thattargeting EndMT may be a novel therapeutic strategy, which is broadly applicable not only to chronic kidney disease but also to various other disease states.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-575 CORTICOSTEROID ENHANCEMENT OF MACROPHAGE CLEARANCE OF APOPTOTICCELLS VARIES WITH MACROPHAGE PHENOTYPE AND THE INFLAMMATORY MEDIATOR MILIEU A. Gibson1,*, E. M. Foster1, S. Kingdom Macrophage phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic inflammatory cells is a key mechanism in resolution of inflammation. The inter- action of macrophages with apoptotic cells has also been demonstrated to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine release bymacrophages. In disease states such as severe asthma and COPD resolution is defective, resulting in chronic inflammation. It has been demonstrated that macrophage phagocytosis is impaired in thesediseases. Glucocorticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugsused in the treatment of these respiratory diseases and have been shown to augment phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Here, different phenotypes of human macrophage were characterisedand the effects of corticosteroids on phagocytosis of apoptotic neu-trophils examined. Human blood monocyte derived macrophages were cultured by differentiating with GM-CSF or M-CSF. Responses were contrasted with those of macrophages from human lung. Con-ditions were identied that mimic the phagocytic defects observed in chronic inflammation and the effect of corticosteroids examined. GM- CSF differentiated macrophages demonstrated poor phagocytosiswhich was greatly enhanced by corticosteroids. In contrast, M-CSFdifferentiated macrophages were found to be efcient at phagocytosis and corticosteroids showed little enhancement. Lung macrophages showed similar phagocytic levels to the M-CSF differentiatedphenotype, with good basal phagocytosis little with TNFaor LPS/IFN cwas found to induce a phagocytic-defective state. Under these conditions, the enhancing effect of corticosteroid treat-ment was also impaired. The efcacy of corticosteroids in apoptotic cells by lung macrophages under inflammatory condi- tions was found to be suppressed, thus providing an opportunity for alternative therapeutic intervention in the resolution of respiratoryinflammation.

Jensen1, W. H. Cabrera1, O. G. Ribeiro1, Brazil,2Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, United States Introduction: The biological response to skin injury can be subdivided into two distinct categories, regenerative and non-regenerative typesof wound S alleles, produced by genotype-assisted breeding, differ in ability to completely repair ear holes. AIRmax SSmice showed fast ear tissue regeneration while AIRminSSmice did not show regeneration after ear punch. Objectives: Our aim in this work was to evaluate the influence of the early inflammatory response in the determination of those distinctphenotypes. Methods: Two-millimeter ear holes were punches in mice of each subline and the inflammatory reaction was characterized by histo-morphometric analysis and MPO activity. Global gene expressionanalysis was used to identify sets of differentially expressed genes during the inflammatory stage of regeneration and quantitative PCR experiments were performed to validate microarray results.Results: The local inflammatory response was slightly more intense inAIRmin SSthan AIRmaxSSmice 24 and 48 h after ear punch, which was demonstrated by histomorphometric analysis and MPO levels. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated over-represented dis-tinct biological themes between AIRmax SSand AIRminSScontrol mice. Inflammatory response biological theme was observed only in AIRminSS. At 24 h after punch, both AIRmaxSSand AIRminSSmice showed signicant (P \\0.001) up-regulated genes related to inflammation. However, angiogenesis, regulation of myeloid cell differentiation and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling path- way related genes were expressed only in AIRmaxSS. Microarray results were validated by quantitative PCR.Conclusions: These results suggest that distinct group of genes related to inflammatory response in the early events after injury modulates the quality of regeneration or wound healing.Supported by: CNPq.

In this work, we aimed to study the effect of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)administration in mice with nephrotoxic AKI induced by high dosesof folic acid (FA). Methods: MSC were obtained from bone marrow of male C57Bl/6 mice (6 weeks) and cell population was expanded in Mesencult cellmedia/C210(Stem Cell Technologies). Before administration of these cells, MSC were characterized by immunophenotyping assays for CD34, differentiation assays foradipocyte and osteocyte. The experimental model was achieved byadministration of FA (200 mg/kg body mass) and animals were sac- riced after 48 h. After 24 h of FA administration, 5.105. MSC were administered for each animal intraperitoneally. Serum and kidneytissue samples were collected 48 h after FA treatment for kidneyfunction evaluation, morphologic study and PCR analysis (TNF-a, vs. untreated \u00b10.35 mg/dL, urea levels (MSC mg/dL, p\\0.05). In addition, pathologist evaluated kidney tissue necrosis is reduced in MSC treated animals.

W. Gilroy1 1Division of Medicine, Centre For Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Previous work by our group has investigated the mechanisms of resolution of innate inflammation. Recently, weidentied a unique phenotype of macrophage during resolution. Termed resolution phase macrophage (rM), they possess a phenotype that is a hybrid of both classically activated M1 and alternativelyactivated M2 macrophages, expressing both iNOS and COX-2. Thisunique controlled the repopu- lation of protective lymphocytes (rL\u00d8) post inflammation and the restoration of tissue homeostasis. Having identied the unexpectedexpression of iNOS in rM, we sought to further investigate its roleduring resolution using iNOS knockout (iNOS -/-) intra- peritoneally with 0.1 mg zymosan. At various time points throughoutinflammation cells were analysed and sorted by FACS, as well as protein expression of iNOS, and cytospins of sorted samples. Cell free inflammatory exudates were analysed for NOx, cytokines and lipids.Results: In iNOS -/-mice we identied a population of cells, which occupied a discreet region on size versus granularity plot. These were identied as ring cells by their characteristic nuclear morphology following sorting and rapid Romanowsky staining of cytospins. Wehave further characterised the phenotype and potential function ofring cells during resolution. FACS analysis showed that ring cells can be subdivided into ring neutrophils (RPMN) and ring monocytes (RMon). RPMNs are have a morphological phenotype similar tomyeloid suppressor cells. There is a higher occurrence of ring cells in iNOS -/-compared to WT. This coincides with a decrease of 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) protein expression, as well as 12-LOXderived lipids -/-inflammatory exudates. Conclusions: We propose that these 12-LOX derived lipid mediators are produced by rM, at least in part under the control of iNOS, mayhave a role to play in the appearance of ring cells.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Gilroy1 1Division of Medicine, Centre For Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, London,2Respiratory Centre of Excellence in Drug Discovery, GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, United Kingdom Introduction: Depending on the activating stimuli, macrophages (M u) can develop into different subsets, broadly referred as either M1 or M2. So far, however, most of the characterisation of subsets has been carried out using m uin vitro. As the environment in which m u develop in vivo is complex, it is likely that m uphenotype is tissue-, stimuli- and inflammatory phase-specic. Therefore it was the aim of this work to catalogue the inflammatory status of m uisolated from the resolution-phase of a isolated from the peri- toneum 72 h after intra-peritoneal injection of a very mild dose of zymosan (0.1 mg). Its transcriptome was analysed using Affymetrixmicroarray technology and genes that were found to be exclusively upregulated in the rM ucompared to 'inflammatory' and/or naive resident peritoneal m uwere validated at the transcriptional level by quantitative RT-PCR.Results: We have found that the transcriptome of rM uhas a distinct molecular signature to that of both 'inflammatory' and na \u00a8ve resident mu. Some of the genes exclusively upregulated have been previously shown to be important for resolution functions such as efferocytosis(Alox15, Tgfb2 and Timd4), and in initiating the adaptive response, i.e. antigen presentation (5 subunits of the class II, major histocom- patibility complex) and mole-cules and signatures associated with murine rM ubut has also helped to determine their role post-inflammation.

However, these drugs are known to produce various adverse effects including gas-trointestinal disorders, immunodeciency and humoral disturbances.On the natural end of the treatment spectrum, our group has shown that cardamonin (2 0,40-dihydroxy-60-methoxychalcone) isolated from Alpinia rafflesiana exert promising anti-inflammatory activities in activated macrophage cells. Therefore, we further explored the anti-arthritic effects of cardamonin as well as investigated its underlying mechanism action on PMA-stimulated synovial broblast (SF) in vitro. Zymography results reveal that cardamoin treatment signi-cantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of gelatinase B (MMP-9) in PMA-stimulated SF. In addition, cardamonin suppressed collagenase activities of PMA-stimulated SF which mediated ofMMP-1. Beside, cardamonin strongly suppressed MMP -3and IL-6 gene expression as well as inhibited COX -2gene expression albeit in moderate level. We also demonstrated that the cardamonin abolished the p65 subunit of NF- jB translocation from to NF- jB in dose-dependent manner. action on MMP produc- tion/activity and pro-inflammatory genes at least partly via NF- jB pathway in PMA-stimulated SF.

The purpose of this study is to clarify the role of luteolin as anti-inflammatory agent in V. negundo . Anti-inflammatory actions were assessed using 4 different in vitro bioassays techniques. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is increased in inflammatory diseases and leads to cellular injury.Luteolin concentration-dependently (1.95-125 lg/ml) inhibited NO production upon stimulation (IFN- g) in RAW 264.7, a murine macrophage cell line. 5-LOX is the initial key enzyme for the production of leukotrienes (LTs) from arachidonicacid, inhibitors of LTs biosynthesis are potential candidates for fur- ther development into novel therapies for inflammation, in particular for asthma and allergic diseases. Luteolin also concentration-depen-dently (1.56-100 lg/ml) inhibited activity of soybean lipoxygenase (LOX) and the IC 50value is lower than standard control for LOX inhibitor Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). It was also shown to contain anti-gout activity by reducing the activity of xanthine oxidase,the key enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of hypoxanthine toxanthine and then uric acid, which plays a crucial role in gout. This study also showed that luteolin are relatively strong platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor binding inhibitor. PAF is known to be a bio-logically active phospolipid, involved in many pathological conditions such as allergy, inflammation, asthma, cardiac anaphy- laxis, gastrointestinal ulceration, endotoxin shock, transplanted summary, we demonstrated that luteolinpossesses anti-inflammatory properties in various mechanism of action. It is crucial to study one of mechanism in deep in order to further validate the actual mechanism of action.Keywords: None declared.

Currently there are no NSAIDs approved for the control of inflammation in swine due to a lack of validated animalmodels and suitable biomarkers to assess efcacy. A swine model basedon inflammation biomarkers could prove very useful in the drug approval process. The study was designed to accomplish the following objectives: to verify expression patterns of in vitro candidate markers inan in vivo model and to determine the utility of the biomarkers throughsimultaneous administration of LPS and flunixin meglumine in swine. A previous in vitro study investigated the differential expression of genes altered in response to endotoxin-induced inflammation. Based onthat study ve of the genes previously identied were chosen for in vivoverication. Two groups of healthy swine were tested: group one was stimulated with only LPS while group two received both flunixin meglumine and LPS. Five genes (MCP-1, Serum Amyloid A2 (SAA2),CD4, CD1, and Caspase 1) were investigated in this system. After LPS stimulation, blood was retrieved at four time points (0, 3, 24, and 48 h). Total RNA was extracted from the blood and analyzed via quantitativeRT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Following the analysis, two genes (SAA2 andCD1) were found to have statistically signicant (p-value \\0.05) temporal differences in gene expression. In addition to these ndings, the animals that received both flunixin meglumine and LPS demon-strated reduced mRNA expression relative to the group stimulated withLPS alone. These results demonstrate that two out of ve genes (SAA2 and CD1) may serve as biomarkers of inflammation as well as indicators of NSAID efcacy. As swine are also used for human drug develop-ment, the results of this study represent the development of an alternative model for NSAID drug development.

AN6414 inhibits PDE4 with an IC 50of 5.2 nM, and inhibits TNFasecretion from human leukocytes with an IC 50of 2.5 nM. AN6414 binds to the active site of PDE4 in a different mode fromcatechol PDE4 inhibitors making contact with the activated water inthe bimetal center. In an in vivo mouse model measuring inhibition of LPS-induced TNFa levels in mouse plasma, AN6414 demonstrates an ED 50of 0.15 mg/kg, Roflumilast exhibits an ED 50of 7.5 mg/kg. In a mouse collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model AN6414 reduces dis-ease burden by 90% when dosed orally BID for 21 days at 10 mg/kg. At the same dose and duration reduction by Roflumilast is 80%. Once a day dosing of AN6414 also demonstrates activity in the mouse CIAmodel, with doses as low as 5 mg/kg showing signicant arthritis suppressive activity. Histologic examination of the feet and ankles of AN6414 and Roflumilast treated animals show a strong suppressionof inflammation, bone erosion, cartilage erosion and extra pannusformation. In a mouse 5-day toxicity study, AN6414 demonstrates lesser GI toxicity compared to Roflumilast, (NOAEL of 20 mg/kg/day compared to 10 mg/kg/day). In the monkey AN6414 is less emeticthan Roflumilast, since it requires a higher plasma concentration ofAN6414 to cause emesis. The in vivo pharmacological effect in both a 4 h monkey LPS-induced TNFa secretion test and a 21 day mouse CIA joint damage test can be well explained for both AN6414 andRoflumilast by free plasma drug level and enzyme afnity. AN6414shows good in vivo efcacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics, and thus provides a new candidate therapeutic for autoimmune diseases. Disclosure of interest: K. Jarnagin: None declared, T.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of SPRC in an in vivo model of acute pancreatitis (AP) inmice. AP was induced in mice by hourly caerulein injections (50 lg/ kg) for 10 h. Mice were treated with SPRC (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (distilled water). SPRC was administered 3 h before the induction ofpancreatitis. Mice were sacriced 1 h after the last caerulein injection.Blood, pancreas and lung tissues were collected and processed to measure the plasma amylase, plasma H 2S, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and cytokine levels in pancreas and lung. The resultsrevealed that signicant reduction of inflammation, both in pancreasand lung was associated with SPRC treatment. Furthermore, the anti- inflammatory effects of SPRC were associated with reduction of pancreatic and pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase ofanti-inflammatory cytokine. Plasma H 2S concentration showed sig- nicant difference in H 2S levels between control, vehicle and SPRC treatment groups. In conclusion, these data provide evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of SPRC by modulating endogenous H 2S production. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-587 DISCOVERY OF CC-930, AN K.

Casulli2, (PMN) play a key role in host defenses against invading microorganisms but also potentiateinflammatory reactions in case of excessive or misdirected responses. Release of the alarmin HMGB1 by cells that die at an inflammatory site may act as an alert signal for the immune system. We studied theeffect of HMGB1 on human PMN migration, using whole-bloodsamples to avoid cell activation associated with isolation procedures. HMGB1 50-100 ng/ml reduced baseline PMN migration IL-8-induced PMN chemotaxis. This inhibitory effect wasmediated by RAGE receptor and was reversed by preincubationwith ERK1/2 inhibitor. It was also associated with a decrease in PMN phospho-p38MAPK content and a concomitant increase in phospho- ERK1/2. In contrast, a higher HMGB1 concentration (5,000 ng/ml)had a chemoattractant effect on PMN, through IL-8 production. Thiseffect required the engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 in addition to the RAGE receptor. Finally, the A Box component of HMGB1, which antagonizes the endogenous protein, reduced chemotaxis and alsostrongly inhibited the enhancement of PMN migration observed with the highest HMGB1 concentration. These results strongly point to a key regulatory role of HMGB1 in PMN recruitment to inflammatorytissues. The A Box component could potentially serve to inhibitinappropriate PMN recruitment during chronic inflammatory disor- ders associated with excessive HMGB1 release.

P-590 MIMETIC PEPTIDES OF THE SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING (SOCS)1 INHIBITORY REGION (KIR) INHIBITSIFN-GAMMA-DEPENDENT IMMUNE FUNCTIONS OF EPIDERMAL KERATINOCYTES IN VITRO AND IN A MOUSE MODEL OF SKININFLAMMATION S. Madonna1,*, C. Scarponi1, R. Sestito1, II'', Naples, Italy Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)1 negatively regulates the molecular cascades triggered by IFN- cby disabling Jak2 and STAT1 phosphorylation and, thus, impeding the activation of IFN- c-dependent genes. In human keratinocytes, the inhibitory activity of SOCS1 inhibits the IFN- csignalling by binding Jak2 through its kinase inhibitory region (KIR) and, thus, inhibiting the IFN- creceptor (IFN- cR) and STAT1 over- expressing SOCS1 cannot longer express ICAM1 and MHC class II as well as CXCL10, CXCL9, and CCL2 molecules. Aimed SOCS1 in IFN- c-activated keratinocytes, we developed a sets of peptides mimicking the SOCS1 KIR domain. The effects of two cell-permeable mimetic peptides, termed TAT-KIR andTAT-P5, were evaluated on cultured keratinocytes and in a mousemodel of allergic contact dermatitis. We found that IFN- c-acti- vated keratinocytes treated with TAT-KIR and, to a exhibited a reduced Jak2, IFN- cRaand STAT1 phosphory- lation, peptide. The expressionof IRF-1, a late IFN- c-inducible transcription factor, of dependent genes, such as ICAM-1, HLA-DR, CXCL10 and CCL2, were quite totally abrogated. Also, the reduced expression of ICAM-1determined by treatment with peptides, resulted in an impaired adhe- siveness of keratinocytes to autologous T lymphocytes. Consistently, the responses of T helper (Th)1 lymphocytes towardssupernatants from keratinocytes treated with peptides were drasticallyreduced due to their impaired release of the CXCL10 and CCL2. Finally, we found that the topical administration of peptides on mouse ears during skin challenge with the hapten TNCB led to a signicantreduction of the contact hypersensitivity responses. Our data suggestthat TAT-KIR and TAT-P5 could be effective for the treatment of Th1- dependent inflammatory skin diseases in humans. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-591 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF MICRORNAS UPREGULATED IN A CELL CULTURE MODELOF SEPSIS D. Schwanzer-Pfeiffer*, E. Ro\u00dfmanith and D. Falkenhagen. Center of Biomedical Technology, Danube University Krems, AustriaObjectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are under intensive research in the last years. Nevertheless we are still at a very early stage in understandingregulation mechanisms and functions of miRNAs in sepsis. Methods: In a rst step a conditioned medium was produced by the stimulation of THP-1 monocytes with 10 ng/ml LSP [4 h]. This condi-tioned medium was used in a second step for the stimulation of HUVECsor HPMEC [16 h] and changes in miRNA expression by miRNA array analysis. MiR-146a, miR-146b, and miR-155 were selected for further analysis due to their different expression pattern afterstimulation. Altered expression of proinflammatory with The expression of up to 1,900 microRNAs was investigated after stimulation of HUVECs and HPMECs by a conditioned med-ium. MiRNA array analysis inhibi- tors for the selected miRNAs were used in order to investigate the functional properties of miR-146a, miR-146b, and miR-155. Inhibi-tion of miR-146a resulted in a 68% diminished expression of Interleukin (IL)6 and a 64% reduced expression of IL8. Further, expression of IL6 and IL8 was reduced by inhibition of miRNA-146bat 49 and 26%, respectively. Additionally, inhibition of miR-155resulted in a reduced expression of IL6 of 31% after stimulation of HUVEC miR-155 In conclusion, miR-146a, miR-146b, and miR-155 aswell, seem to be highly involved in the regulation of inflammatorycytokines, especially IL6 and IL8.

Dujardin,S. Delahaye, N. Hughes, D. Bregeon, Blery, PHARMA, Marseille, France Toll like receptors (TLRs) have emerged as key players in the detection of pathogens and the induction of anti-microbial and anti-viral immune response, shaping both innate and adaptive immune response. To date, 10 TLRs have been identied in humans. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have attracted a lot of attention from thepharmaceutical industry. Two TLR agonist are approved either fortreatment of cancer or as vaccine adjuvant, while numerous clinical trials are currently evaluating the efcacy of TLR agonists in vaccine, cancer and viral infection, as well as in allergy/asthma.An emerging eld in TLR targeting drug development is the use ofTLR antagonists for use in inflammation, including nucleic acid, phospholipids but few monoclonal antibodies. Indeed, there is accumulating evidences that while TLR activate the immune sys-tems to ght infections or cancer, TLR may also respond toendogenous ligands and maintain unwanted inflammation, leading to tissue damage and inflammatory pathologies. TLR3, a receptor for dsRNA, is widely expressed by immune cells but also epithe-lial, endothelial and broblast, and TLR3 stimulation induces IFN type I and inflammatory cytokines. TLR3 over-expression has been demonstrated in several inflammatory pathologies, and TLR3ligands can mimic inflammatory diseases in vivo in mice.

In order to assess the therapeutic potential ofMCP-1 inhibition in murine models we generated (Spiegelmer afnity to ThemNOX-E36 was characterized in the LPS induced neutrophilia ratmodel and the sub chronic (11 days) tobacco smoke induced inflammation mouse model. Anti-inflammatory effects were deter- mined based on differential cell counts of the broncheo-alveolarlavage fluid (BALF). In the acute rat model intravenous administration of mNOX-E36 prior to LPS challenge signicantly reduced the number of inltrating neutrophils in the BALF at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (bw). In thesub-chronic tobacco smoke mouse model mNOX-E36 (0.2 mg/kg bw), given subcutaneously every other day, starting just prior to rst smoke exposure, resulted in a signicant decrease of the BALF compared to vehicle treated control animals. The effects were comparable to those obtained in the positive control arm with the reference compound roflumilast. These preliminary results demon-strate potent effects of MCP-1 inhibition in an animal model of COPD.Spiegelmer mNOX-E36 administration signicantly prevented the recruitment of different inflammatory cells, involved in both the innate and the adaptive immune response, into the broncheo-alveolar space.Preventing the recruitment of these inflammatory cells with the humanMCP-1 specic NOX-E36 into the lung might translate into a benet for patients with COPD.

P-594 EFFECTS OF THE HEPCIDIN BINDING SPIEGELMER NOX-H94 IN A IL-6 Pharmacology,2NOXXON PHARMA AG, Berlin, Germany Hepcidin is a central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Increased expression results in functional iron deciency and is a potential reason for the genesis of anemia of inflammation. With the objective to neu-tralise the biological activity of hepcidin, the Spiegelmer NOX-H94was developed. This compound has a high afnity and specicity for human and cynomolgus hepcidin. The aim of this study was to further characterize NOX-H94 in in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro theexpression of the iron exporter and hepcidin receptor ferroportin wasassessed in the cell line J774A.1 after stimulation with hepcidin. Western blot analysis was used to analyse ferroportin expression. After binding to its receptor the ferroportin-hepcidin complex is degradedand intracellular iron cannot be exported. Acute models of serum iron reduction induced by human hepcidin (mouse) and interleukin-6 (cynomolgus monkey) were established to characterize the efcacy ofNOX-H94 in in vivo models. NOX-H94 inhibited hepcidin-inducedferroportin degradation in J774A.1 cells and also a decrease of the serum iron concentration in two in vivo models. These results demon- strate the efcacy of NOX-H94 in in vitro and in acute in vivo models.This ferroportin protecting and iron liberating strategy may supplysufcient iron for erythropoiesis and avoid treatment with intravenous iron preparations. The potential harmful increase of intracellular iron is prevented. Based on these preliminary data, NOX-H94 may be used inpatients to influence one reason for the genesis of anemia of inflammation.

The present study investigated the involvement of ETs in arthritis using the most reasonable experimentalmodel of this disease, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA wasinduced in DBA/1 mice, and on the day that CIA became clinically detectable, the mice were treated with a dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist (Bosentan). Disease progression was assessed by measure-ments of visual clinic score, paw swelling and hypernociception. Gene expression in lymph nodes was evaluated by microarray technology. Validation of microarray genes and ET1-prepro expression in sham andimmunized mice and in control and AR human patients treated withMethotrexate or anti-TNF, were evaluated by real time PCR. We observed that the oral administration of Bosentan markedly ameliorated CIA. Gene expression in the lymph nodes of ill mice showed a char-acteristic prole during Bosentan administration that allowed us todistinguish the treatment from disease state. Prepro-ETs mRNA expression was increased in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice compared with that of sham mice. From a clinical perspective, prepro-ETs mRNAexpression was also increased in the PBMCs of RA patients duringInflamm. Res.

We tested here the C-28/I2 chondro- cytic cell line developing its culture in micromasses (MM). MM usingC-28/I2 cells were obtained by pipetting 20 ll droplets of a cell suspension (density of 2.5 910 7cells/ml) into 48-well plates. Med- ium was changed after 24 h and stimuli [IL-1 ng/ml), TGF b1 (10 ng/ml) 24 h later for fur- ther 48 h culture. Human broblasts were used as negative control. MM were harvested for staining with Alcian blue analyzed by qRT-PCR.Data are from 3 to 4 independent experiments in triplicate. IL-1 b promoted a catabolic response characterized by *40% MMP1 and ADAMTS5 mRNA associated with reduction ( -55%) in the production of matrix glycosaminoglycan (GAG) measured by ABstaining. TGF b1 (10 ng/mL) had an important anabolic effect on gene expression complemented by +47% in GAG production. As a proof of concept for therapeutic development, we tested Naproxen; thiscompound abolished the catabolic effect of IL-1 b. Such pharmaco- logical actions were paralleled by inhibition of PGE 2release in the MM supernatant. We describe a novel medium-throughput protocolfor studying inflammatory processes, candidate compounds and geneexpression in chondrocytes. The system is also amenable to different levels of analysis, from simple and rapid quantitative measurement of matrix GAG, to more complex investigations including multiple geneexpression analysis at the mRNA level.

INVOLVEMENT OF FORMYL PEPTIDERECEPTORS S. C. Sampaio1,*, E. S. Sa o Paulo, Brazil Crotoxin (CTX) inhibits tumor growth and modulates the function of macrophages. Despite these evidence, the contribution of macrophage inhibition to the decrease in tumor growth, caused by CTX, was notdetermined yet. Macrophages provide a defense mechanism againsttumor cells and two distinct polarization states, M1 and M2, have been described for these cells. In the beginning of tumor progression, M1 macrophages release IL-6. contrast, during tumor development, the release of these mediators by tumor-associated macrophages (M2 cells) is inhibited, contributing to tumor develop-ment. In the present study the effect of CTX on the activity (nitricInflamm. Res. S283 123oxide-NO) of macrophages co-cultivated with LLC WRC 256 tumor cells was evaluated. Macrophages were obtained from peritonealcavity and cells (2 910 5) were incubated with CTX (0.3 lg/mL) for 2 h at 37 /C176C. After this time, the macrophages were co-cultivated in presence of LLC WRC 256 tumor cells (2 9104), previously plated in 96-well culture dishes. The results showed that macrophages previ-ously incubated in the presence of CTX and co-cultivated with tumor cells generated a greater quantity of NO (35%) than control cells. Tumor cells co-cultivated with macrophages pre-incubated with CTXshowed reduction (25%) of reversed stimula-tory effect of CTX on secretory activity of macrophages and the inhibitory effect these macrophages on tumor cells proliferation. Taken together, the results indicate that CTX modies the secretory activity ofM2 cells, which may contribute to the inhibitory action of the toxin ontumor growth and activation of formyl peptide receptors seems to play a major role in this effect. These data reinforce the actions of CTX on defence mechanisms and bring new perspectives for the developmentof a new substance with therapeutic properties.

Kanazawa11Department of Immunology and Parasitology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan Prostate cancer is one of most prevalent cancers among men in western world. Despite several hundred clinical studies of both experimental and approved anti-tumor agent, chemotherapy has limited activity dueto chemo-resistance and up-regulated anti-apoptotic mechanisms.Therefore, development of new drugs for prostate cancer is urgently needed. It was reported that PI3K/AKT signaling plays an important role in the maintenance and viability of prostate cancer progenitors,suggesting that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways inprostate cancer cells together with conventional chemotherapy may provide improved therapeutic outcomes. Cucurbitacins are a group of triterpenoids plant families such as cucurbitaceae and cruciferae, whichhave been shown to have anti-inflammatory activities and anti-cancer effects on various tumor types. Recently, we reported that cucurbitacin D, which is isolated from Trichosanthes kirilowii, has anti-tumoractivity through suppression of proteasome activity. Here, we demon-strate that cucurbitacin D leads to inhibit cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells with inhibition of mTOR activation. Western blotting showed that cucurbitacin D induced suppression of p62/SQSTM1protein level and mTOR phosphorylation which are known as markersfor autophagy in PC3 cells, DU145 cells and LNCaP cells. However, cucurbitacin D did not induced typical autophagic event such as LC-3II fragment. In addition, apoptosis inhibitor, z-VAD did not affect cu-curbitacin D-induced cell death. These indicate cucurbitacin D induced new type cell death but neither typical apoptotic nor autophagic cell death in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results provide a newinsight of cell death induced by cucurbitacin D, which was targeted tomTOR. It emerged as a promising candidate for cancer therapy.

Horrigan1, P. S. Gulko2, C. Beeton1,* 1Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Baylor College Of Medicine, Houston,2Laboratory of Experimental Rheumatology, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, United States Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with unclear etiology that affects approximately 1% of the world popula- tion. It is a systemic disease but mainly targets freely moveable joints, such as the wrists or the knees, and can cause severe disability.Resident synovial cells, such as broblast-like synoviocytes (FLS),acquire an altered phenotype during RA and present characteristic of transformed cells. They play an important role in the disease by directly destroying the cartilage, but also by inducing angiogenesis,inflammation, bone damage, and by transferring disease from affected to healthy joints. We have found that FLS from patients with RA (RA-FLS) express large numbers of functional KCa1.1 (BK, Maxi-K,Slo1) channels at their plasma membrane. Blocking KCa1.1 channelsinhibited the proliferation, the motility, and the invasive properties of RA-FLS, and may therefore prevent disease progression. Blockers of KCa1.1 channels also inhibited the production of vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-2by RA-FLS, without affecting the production of interleukin-6 or inducing cell toxicity. These blockers therefore have the potential of reducing angiogenesis, inflammation, and joint destruction. KCa1.1channels expressed by RA-FLS are attractive targets for the treatment of RA, and possibly other arthritic diseases. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Wesa1,* 1CELSENSE, Inc,2Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, United States Non-invasive imaging of inflammation to measure the progression of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to monitor responses to therapy is critically needed. V-Sense, a perfluorocarbon tracer agent that preferentially labels inflammatory cells, which arethen recruited out of systemic circulation to sites of inflammation, enables detection by 19F MRI. With no 19F background in the host, detection is highly specic, yielding a quantitative marker of thedegree of inflammation present. Collagen-induced arthritis in rats, amodel with many similarities to human RA, was used to study the ability of V-Sense to measure the accumulation of inflammation over time. Disease progression in the rat hind limbs was monitored bycaliper measurements and 19F MRI on days 14, 21 and 28, includingthe height of clinically symptomatic disease. Na \u00a8ve rats served as controls. The capacity of V-Sense to assess the effectiveness of ther- apy was studied in a cohort of rats administered oral prednisolone ondays 14-28.

In 2001 we dened SI as ''Typical multi syndrome phase-specic pathological process caused by systemic alteration and is character-ized by total inflammatory responsiveness of endotheliocytes, plasma and cell factors, and connective tissue as well as microcirculation disorders in essential organs and tissues''. The main methodologicalapproaches to study SI were assay Siemens Medical SolutionsDiagnostics, USA). Methods of calculation of Reactivity Level (RL)to estimate intensity of SIR as well as SI scale score have been created. Integral SI scale registers the values of RL (maximum is 5 points) and occurrence of other phenomena of SI: systemic alteration,MODS, micro clottage, distress of neuroendocrine system [Patent No. 233577/Rus.]. Conclusion: SI scale intends to describe pathogenesis of shock andother critical states both of septic and aseptic origin. This scale makesit possible to dene the SI phase, which could be applicable for monitoring and prognosis sever complications. Advantages of this way of estimation SIR and SI are the following: replaceability ofparameters and the calculation has been based on overshooting ofnormal level by cytokines and CRP that makes it applicable in dif- ferent method assay.

Cells (50,000 cells/cm 2) were plated in 24-well plates and incubated in a humidied incubator at 37 /C176C with 5% CO 2and 95% air for 24 h. The materials employed were: Group 1 (G1)\u2014Single Bond same volume and unpolymerized into transwell membranes for resin composite or added to the culturemedium for adhesive systems. G9\u2014control group (medium alone) was also evaluated. Cell metabolic activity was evaluated by succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, which is a measure of the mitochon-drial respiration of the cells. For such purpose, the methyltetrazolium(MTT) assay was used at times of 6 and 24 h. The data were com- pared by Two-way ANOVA (p \\0.05) and Bonferroni post-test (p\\0.05). Results: were given h, the decrease in cell metabolism was statistically signicant for G1, G3, G6, G7 and G8 when compared with the samegroups in 6 h. Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-610 BIOFABRICATION OF THREE DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL STRUCTURES USING INKJET TECHNOLOGY FOR THREEDIMENSIONAL TISSUE MODELS K. Arai1,*, S. Iwanaga1, H. Toda1, G. Capi1, M. Nakamura1 1University Of Toyama, Toyama City Gohuku, Japan The behaviors of individual cells are thought to be influenced with many integrated factors, such as the humoral factors from adjacent and even distant cells, the attached extracellular matrix and themechanical stimulation. Because the environment of the cells is nottwo dimensional (2D) but 3D in vivo, the cells receive those stimuli not from 2D but from 3D. Therefore, the engineered 3D tissue models in vitro have great possibilities in the study of such 3D complexitiesof physiology and 3D pathological processes of diseases in vivo. In addition, the use of such 3D tissue models with human cells is expected much more efcient in the screening and discovery of newtherapies and new drugs, more than 2D culture cells and animalexperiments. Then, we have addressed to develop some effective technologies to fabricate such 3D tissue models efciently and accurately using living cells and biological materials. Then, we havedeveloped 3D bioprinter applying inkjet and gelation technique,which enables to position living cells at the designed 3D position arbitrary. We have succeeded to fabricate simple 3D gel structures containing living cells. Next, we have improved our 3D bioprinterwith a new printing mode based on the bitmap images to fabricatemore complex 2D and 3D structures. We have succeeded to fabricate some 3D structures by laminating the 2D structures based on bitmap images, however, we could not fabricate them with sufcient preci-sion. In this study, we developed our printer by adding with Z-axis control system. Using the new version system, we successfully improved its performance, and could fabricate more complex 3Dstructures, such as branched tubes and the multi-layered 3D pyramidstructures. In addition, we also recognized that the living broblasts were extended in the fabricated 3D tube with brin gel. We conrmed that the approach of 3D biofabrication with our 3D bioprinter has agreat potential to fabricate complex 3D tissue models in vitro.Disclosure of interest: None declared.S286 Inflamm. Res. 123P-611 SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AS A RISK FACTOR OF CHRONIC RENAL ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION E. Gusev1, L. Solomatina1,*, J. Zhuravleva1 1Institute Immunology Physiology, RAS, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation Objective: Chronic renal allograft dysfunction is a progressive nephrosclerosis which arises under immune and nonimmune mecha- nisms. There is a supposition today that one of the reasons of chronic renal allograft dysfunction may be process of chronic systemicinflammation in recipients.Study Goal: To analyze signs of the systemic inflammation as a risk factor of chronic renal allograft dysfunction in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.Patients and methods: There were studied three groups of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis: the group 1 is a ''patients with end- stage renal disease which receive renal replacement therapy in theform of programmed hemodialysis'' (n =22); the group 2 is a ''patients with chronic renal allograft dysfunction'' (n =23); the group 3 is a ''patients with normal functions of allograft'' (n =24). The control group was a cohort of healthy persons, age18-55 (n =50, mean age 34.1 \u00b110.4 years). There were measured levels of systemic inflammation markers in blood plasma such as interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), myoglobin, troponin I, D-dimer.On the basis of these markers we calculated integrated criterion\u2014 scale of chronic systemic inflammation, ranging 0-8. Point C3 proves chronic systemic inflammation.Results: Chronic systemic inflammation was detected in 82% he-modialysis-dependent patients, in 39% patients with chronic renal allograft dysfunction. Patients with normal functions of allograft had not chronic systemic inflammation. According to the results of theROC-analysis the diagnostic accuracy of the scale of chronic systemicinflammation was quite good (AUC =0.81). Conclusion: Renal transplantation arrests systemic inflammation partially, but there is a strong possibility of chronic renal allograftdysfunction in recipients who have some criteria of chronic systemicinflammation.

P-612 INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE STUDY ON A NEW COCULTURE MODEL OF ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY BARRIER TREATED BY TIO2 AND SIO2NANOPARTICLES France One of the vital barriers in the human body is the air-blood interface in the lung. With an area of approximately 100-140 m2the alveoli of the human lung are functionally the most important element of the lung. Therefore, we developed an in vitro model that mimics thealveolo-capillary barrier in order to assess the toxicity ofnanoparticles (NP). The aim of the model is to explore the toxicity, the passage and the inflammatory response of the air-blood barrierafter a treatment by SiO 2(20 and 100 nm) and TiO 2(20 nm) NP. In order to better mimic the reality, the model of cell coculture is composed of 3 cell types which are, respectively: THP-1 macro-phages, A549 or NCI-H441 epithelial cells and HUVEC-CSendothelial cells. Epithelial cells and macrophages are cultivated on the apical membrane of an insert, and endothelial cells on the basal side. Therefore, we studied toxicity, cellular inflammation andintercellular communication between the cells of the model. After24 h of treatment with NP, IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF awere mea- a multiplex technology. SiO 2and TiO 2 nanoparticles do not induce the same inflammatory response and the smallest nanoparticles (20 nm SiO 2and TiO 2NP) seem to induce more cytotoxic effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that a treatment of epithelial cells by NP-exposed-macrophage's conditioned medium does not trigger the same inflammatory response compared to directtreatment of epithelial cells by NP. Therefore, a model of air-blood barrier including macrophages is essential to assess inflammatory process close to reality. Otherwise, contrary to A549 epithelial cells,the inflammatory process in NCI-441 cells may link to the activationof the P2X 7cell death receptor, functional, and known for his involvement in the inflammasome activation. Therefore, NCI-H441 cells better mimic the reality and is a better cellular model than A549to assess the inflammatory process and damages caused by NP in theair-blood barrier.

Orthodontics, University Of Milan, Milano, Italy Aim: The aim of this study is to show the importance of Cone Beam Computerized Tomography to volumetrically quantify TMJ damage in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), measuring con- dylar and mandibular real volumes. Material and methods: 30 children with temporomandibular involvement by JIA were observed by Cone Beam Computerized Tomography. The mandible was isolated from others craniofacialstructures; the its components' vol-umes (condyle, ramus, emibody, emisymphysis on right side and on left side) has been calculated by a 3D volume rendering technique. Results: The results show a highly signicant statistical differencebetween affected side volumetric values versus normal side volu-metric values above all on condyle region (P \\0.01), while they does not show any statistical differences between right side versus left side. Conclusion: The Cone Beam Computerized Tomography representsa huge improvement in understanding of the condyle and man-dibular morphological changes, even in the early stages of the Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Early initiation and optimal adjust- ment of aggressive therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumaticdrugs have been extremely successful in preventing irreversible joint damage. Therefore, the accurate and early diagnosis of JIA and the sensitive monitoring of the disease process are essential.Advanced imaging technology capable of identifying even theslightest trace of erosive joint damage may enable the prediction of future structural and functional deterioration.

To overcome this, here we constructed an in vitrodisease model for a NLRP3-drived hereditary autoinflammatory syn- drome Cutaneous and Articular (CINCA) syndrome is a severeautoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations of NLRP3 gene. Mutant NLPR3 protein in macrophages causes over- production of IL-1 beta, which leads to systemic inflammation.Results: We obtained broblasts from two male patients of CINCAsyndrome with somatic mosaicism. were transduced KLF4 and cMYC. Compactembryonic stem (ES)-cell like colonies emerged after 2 weeks and weobtained more than 20 iPSC lines. We obtained both wild-type and mutant clones from each patient's broblasts. After evaluating transgene silencing by quantitative RT-PCR, we selected 3 mutantand wild type iPSC clones, respectively, for further analysis. All the clones expressed human ES-cell markers. iPSCs are differentiated amountof IL-1 beta when stimulated with lipopolysaccharides or infected with Listeria monocytogenes, while wild-type clones not. Future directions: We have succeeded to recapitulate in vitro phe-notypes of macrophages with NLRP3 mutations. In vitro diseasemodeling provides us a platform for drug screening. Now we are planning to look for novel NLRP3 inhibitors that can modulate in- flammasome signaling more precisely.Disclosure of interest: None declared. P-615 MICROCAPILLARY IMMUNOSENSORPLATFORM FOR DETECTING INFLAMMATORY MARKERS S. S. Babu1, L. Zubkov1, E. Papazoglou1, S. Murthy2,* 1School of Biomedical Engineering, Science & Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia,2College of Medicine, Drexel University, Philadelphia, United States The unique properties of Quantum Dots (QDs) such as broad exci- tation spectra, narrow emission spectra, high resistance to photobleaching, higher photo-stability and stronger fluorescence makes them one of the most attractive fluorescent reporter moleculesfor a wide range of biological applications including biosensing and assay development applications. However, the high cost of QDs has limited their application in assay development where at least50-100 lL reagents are required for performing an assay. This research capitalizes on the superior properties of QDs by utilizingjust 1-2 lL of sample and antibodies conjugated to QDs for detection of biomarkers. In this work we developed a simple and inexpensive microcapillary immunosensor based on quantum dotassay for detecting myeloperoxidase (MPO) in an animal model ofintestinal inflammatory disease. The biomarker MPO was detected in the stool samples collected from animal at various stages of inflammatory disease. The method utilizes commercially availablepolymethylmethaacrylate (PMMA) micro-capillaries (ID 250 lm, OD 500 lm) as substrates for performing a sandwich assay. The results obtained indicate that the limit of detection (LOD) of the device and the assay is 100 picomolar of MPO ( *15 ng/mL) in 1-2 lL of sample. Furthermore, the assay and device robustness were tested by detecting MPO in 1-2 ml of animal stool sample and comparing the results obtained with a commercially available MPO ELISA kit that uses 100 lL of sample. In conclusion, we are reporting here a low cost microcapillary immunosensor platform for detecting inflammatory markers. Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Venous blood samples and samples from the apheresis lines (before and after the apheresis device) were analyzedin the same manner as we done previously in our LCAP study (ACD-A)by commercial ELISA. There was no increase of LL-37 in the lines in difference to our LCAP-study. Some slight increase of LL-37 con- centration was observed over the apheresis device. We report herebythat heparin used as anticoagulant inhibits generation of LL-37. Thus, the anticoagulants have different impact on immunoregulatory mole- cules as LL-37 and choice prole of respective apheresis treatment.Disclosure of interest: None declared.

Res. S289 123Fig. 1 Heart failure in WT AngII mice, as quantied by percentage fractional shortening (FS, a) was accompanied by signicantly increased cardiac weight ( b), wall thickness ( c) and larger cardiac myocytes ( d), while these parameters were signicantly lower in protected KO AngIImice. Levels of cardiac stress markers atrial natriuretic factor (ANF,e) and alpha skeletal actin (aska, f) remained low in miR-155 KO AngII as compared to WT AngII. Using antagomiR-155, cardiac knockdown of 81.1 \u00b13.8% in miR-155 antagomiR-treated mice as compared to mice treated with scrambled control ( g).

These data point towards a crucial role of miR-155 in cardiac leukocyte mobilizationand inltration during pressure overload. Fig. 2 In situ hybridization shows preferential miR-155 expression in cardiac inflammatory foci ( a). AngII mobilizes CD11b+/Ly6G - monocytes in WT but not in KO mice ( b) but does not affect CD3+ T cells (not shown). In hearts of AngII-treated WTs, there is an influx ofCD68+ macrophages ( c) and CD3+ T cells ( d), while these cell populations remain low in KO mice. AntagomiR-155 treatment similarly cardiac abrogated leukocyte whether leukocyte miR-155 drives the cardiac hypertrophic response. Indeed, adoptive transfer of WT leukocytes inmiR-155 KO hearts completely restored the cardiac hypertrophicresponse (Fig. 3a). Vice versa, the removal of leukocyte miR-155 from WT hearts compromised hypertrophic growth following AngII. Cardiac myocytes cultured in miR-155 KO media also displayed alimited hypertrophic response (Fig. 3b, c).

Heart weights are determinedby genotype (WT or KO) of the bone marrow, and not by mouse origin (WT or KO). b,cnRCMs cultured in the presence of WT + LPS or KO + LPS media and stimulated with pro-hypertrophic endothelin-1(ET-1) show abrogated hypertrophic response in the presence ofKO + LPS media, as demonstrated by decreased myocyte areas ( b) and blunted aska-expression ( c).d,eAAV9-mediated has-miR-155 introduces human miR-155 in all mice ( d), but does not influence the cardiac hypertrophic response ( e).fEt-1 treatment increases miR-155 expression 1.6 fold in nRCMs (P \\0.05 versus control). However, inhibition of miR-155 in nRCMs does not influence the cardiac myocyte hypertrophic response, as shown by in the heart. In the pres- ence of AAV9-miR-155 or -scrambled expression (Fig. 3d), hearts weighed equal at baseline and had similar degrees of hypertrophy and hypertrophic gene expression following AngII (Fig. 3e and notshown). Similarly, in vitro, cardiomyocyte-knockdown of miR-155had no effect on hypertrophic markers (Fig. 3f). Taken together, these data show that leukocytes impose hypertrophic growth on cardiac myocytes cardiac myocytes, evoking hypertrophy and pro-inflamma-tory signaling, respectively. We found that AngII increased cardiacIL-6 levels in WT but not in KO mice (Fig. 4a), and LPS had similar effects in BMMs (not shown). Following-up on this, we measured STAT3 activation in miR-155 KO and WT BMMs, innRCMs cultured in miR-155 KO and WT BMM-media, and in hearts, and conrmed the cardiac IL-6/STAT3 axis to be regulated by miR-155 (Fig. 4b-d). The miR-155 target Suppressor of Cyto-kine Signaling 1, SOCS1, which is expressed by leukocytes but notcardiac myocytes, may mediate this effect. Indeed, we found that in the absence of miR-155, SOCS1 protein expression is elevated in unstimulated BMMs as well as in LPS-activated BMMs as com-pared to WT (Fig. 4e). levels a) and P-STAT3/total STAT3 levels ( b) in WT but not in KO mice. BMMs also show blunted STAT3 activation upon LPS-stimulation in the absence of miR-155 ( c). Finally, nRCMs cultured in the presence of KO + LPS media fail to activate STAT3 ( d). On the other hand, the miR-155 target SOCS1 is strongly increased in theabsence of miR-155, at baseline and following LPS-treatment ( e) Discussion: We show for the rst time that leukocytes mediate car- diac hypertrophy and failure, and propose a novel pathway involvingmiR-155/SOCS1/IL6/STAT3 to mediate this effect. Restoration of cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of miR-155 by inhibition of SOCS1 will yield nal proof of this mechanism. MiR-155 provides anideal therapeutic candidate, offering a pure leukocyte target to inhibitdetrimental cardiac inflammation and failure. References 1. Mann DL.

Mini 2 OC-043 A NOVEL CROSS-TALK IN RESOLUTION: H2S ACTIVATES THE PATHWAY G. Cirino2, R. J. Flower1, M. Perretti1 1William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and United Kingdom, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a gaseous mediator synthesized in several mammalian tissues by two main enzymes CBS and CSE, increases under inflammatory conditions or sepsis. Since H2S and H2S-releasing molecules afford potent inhibitory properties on the leukocyte trafcking, we tested whether endogenous Annexin A1 (AnxA1) could display intermediary functions. Treatment of human PMNs the H2S donor NaHS (10-100 mM) provoked ( [50%) of AnxA1 from the cytosolic pool to the cell surface, supporting the inhibitory effects of the gas in the flow chamber assay. Such in vitro actions could be translated in analyses ofthe inflamed microcirculation, where NaHS and emi- gration in the mesenteric vessels of wild type, but not AnxA1 -/-, mice. Next, we investigated whether endogenous AnxA1 couldmodulate H2S synthesis, indicating existence of a positive circuit. Tothis end, a marked increase in CBS and/or CSE expression in a variety of tissues (aorta, kidney, spleen) tested from AnxA1 -/-mice, as compared to wild type animals, was quantied by qPCR. Moreover,NaHS was able to counteract the increase in expression in iNOS and COX2 (four- and sevenfold reduction, respectively) upon LPS-stim- ulation of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), though TakenInflamm. exis- a positive interlink between AnxA1 and the H2S pathway,providing a novel mechanistic explanation for the exquisite properties of H2S in the control of experimental inflammation. These nding may be relevant to innovative discovery programmes aiming at har-nessing the biological properties of H2S. Supported by the WellcomeTrust (programme grant 086867/Z/08/Z). Introduction: H2S is a gaseous mediator synthesized by two pyr- idoxal-5-phosphatedependent enzymes, such as CBS and CSE. L- Cysteine represents the physiological precursor, which is metabolizedleading to the H2S production. Recent literature has supported the involvement of H2S in cardiovascular homoeostasis (Zhong et al. 2003; Qu et al. 2006). In particular, it has been demonstrated that H2S(a) exhibits vasodilator activity in vitro and in vivo (Ali et al. 2006),(b) is pro-apoptotic on vascular smooth muscle cells (Zhao et al. 2001; Yang et al. 2004) and (c) is involved in leukocyte-endothelium interaction (Zanardo et al. 2006). Furthermore, there is emergingevidence for a key role for H2S in cell trafcking and inflammation (Zhang et al., J Leukoc Biol, 2007). AnxA1 is also a key mediator in the inflammation and it shows prominent features in activation of theresolution process, exerting anti-inflammatory activity. Since H2Sand H2S-releasing molecules potently inhibit the process of leukocyte trafcking, we tested whether endogenous AnxA1 could display intermediary functions.Materials and methods: Human PMN isolation and membrane andcytosolic fractions preparation. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers and PMNs isolated. All healthy volunteers gave oral and written consent and cell separation was covered by ethicalapproval 05/Q0603/34 (East London and The City Research Ethics Committee 1). After treatment, cells (4 9106) were re-suspended in lysis buffer and processed in order to get cytosolic and membranefraction.Animals and treatment: C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River, UK) were treated with LPS (10 mg/kg) and then sacriced after 6 h. Blood, liver, aorta, kidney, lymph nodes and spleen were collected for furtheranalysis.Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDM) from AnxA1 -/-and wild type BMDM were obtained from femurs and tibias of 4-6 week old. The marrow was flushed from the bone, washed,resuspended (2-3 9106 cells/ml) in culture medium (30% L929 conditioned and incubated at 37 /C176C for 5 days. BMDM were then treated with LPS (100 ng/ml, 6 h) alone or in presence of NaHS (100 mM, -1 h). Quantitative real-time PCR: Quantization of the expression level of selected genes (CBS, CSE, COX2 and iNOS) was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzolreagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For realtime PCR, 10 ngtemplate was used in combination with each primer solution (Qiagen, UK) and Fast SYBR Green Master Mix solution (Applied Biosystem, UK). All reactions were performed in a_ 7900HT Fast Real-TimePCR System instrument (Applied Biosystem). Relative expression (vsGAPDH) \u00b1SEM was then expressed in the graphs and showed as fold-increase or decrease (n =3). Intravital microscopy Followingtreatment with IL1b (10 i.p., 2 h) or in combination with NaHS (100 mmol/kg s.c., -1 h) or PAG (10 mg/kg -30 min) AnxA1 -/-or wild type mice were mesenteries were exposed and one to three randomly selected postcapillary venules(diameter between 20 and 40 mm) were observed for each mouse (n=5). Adherent and emigrated leukocytes were then quantied by counting the number of cells (100 950 mm 2). All of the animal studies were conducted in accordance with current UK. Home Ofceregulations and complied with local ethical and operational guidelines. Results: Resting human PMNs retain the majority of AnxA1 in the cytosol as granular or free stores. NaHS treatment (10-100 mM,30 min) induces mobilization of intracellular AnxA1 from cytosoltowards the membrane and its further release in the culture medium (Fig. 1). As LPS stimulation has bee reported to increase circulating H2Slevels, we treated AnxA1 -/-and wild type mice with LPS and monitored plasma levels for H2S. As shown in Fig. 2a, H2S levels areincreased in LPS treated mice; furthermore, the gaseous mediator levels are higher in AnxA1 -/-mice vs wild type even in non-treated mice. We then focused on the clear difference in H2S amountbetween the two animal genotypes and real time PCR data conrmedthat in AnxA1 -/-mice we have an increase in expression for CSE and/or CBS in all tissues analyzed (Fig. 2b-f). On the basis of these results we decided to investigate on possible antiinflammatory effect for H2S in a different setting such as BMDM. Preincubation with NaHS for 1 h before LPS administration could signicantly prevent the increase in expression of COX2 and iNOSassociated to LPS treatment. Surprisingly, this effect was occurring only in BMDM from wild type but not from AnxA1 -/-mice (Fig. 3). In order to better establish the physiological relevance for AnxA1mobilization in human PMN we performed intravital of mice Inflamm. Res. 123NaHS was able to reduce the number of adherent and emigrated cells and, once again, this effect was only evident in wild type but not inwild type mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with CSE inhibitor PAG signicantly exacerbated the inflammatory pattern (Fig. 4). Discussion: The evidence that H2S is a new gaseous physiologicalmodulator rather that a toxic and pollutant gas is now widely accepted, as many studies have shown that impairment in its production couldlead to or are involved in many different pathological conditions(Brancaleone et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2008; Szabo C, Nat Rev Drug Discov 2007). The data here reported represent an interesting novelty and clearly demonstrate, for the rst time, the existence of a crosslinkbetween H2S and AnxA1 pathways, where it appears to be an evident''one-need-the other'' system. However, the data this study showed are preliminary and the aspects highlighted need to be conrmed and further investigated with more targeted experiments in order to getbetter understanding of the mechanisms behind this circuit. Mini Paper 3 OC-046 CATHEPSIN G HAS AN ANTI-NOCICEPTIVE EFFECT IN NORMAL RAT KNEE JOINTS F. A. Russell1,*, N. Schuelert1, V. E. Veldhoen1, J. J. McDougall1 1Physiology and Pharmacology, University Of Calgary, Calgary, Canada In addition to its enzymatic properties, the serine proteinase, Cathepsin G is known to activate proteinase-activated receptor 4 (PAR4). In joints,PAR4 activation leads to inflammation and pain. Since cathepsin G is found in high concentration in arthritic joints, we hypothesised that Cathepsin G would have a pro-nociceptive effect in the joint by cleavingand activating PAR4. Electrophysiological recordings were made from knee joint afferent bres in male Wistar rats during normal and noxious joint rotations. Fibre ring rate was recorded in naive rats during 10 srotations before and over 15 min after local administration of CathepsinG (1 ng/100 ll-10lg/100 ll). Responses were compared with animals antagonist, pepducin P4pal-10 (100 lg i.p.). G dose-dependently decreased the ring rate of joint bresduring rotation of the knee. At doses of 1 and 10 ng, where Cathepsin Galone had no effect, PAR4 antagonism caused a signicant decrease in ring rate. Thus, Cathepsin G has an anti-nociceptive effect on joint bres in normal rats that is enhanced when PAR4 is inhibited. This suggests thatCathepsin G can activate PAR4 but the anti-nociceptive effect of Cathepsin G is via an unknown mechanism. Introduction: Cathepsin G is a pro-inflammatory serine proteinasereleased from activated neutrophils that occurs in inrheumatoid arthritic joints [1, 2]. This proteolytic enzyme is thought toplay an important role in inflammation as evidenced by the reduced leukocyte accumulation and cytokine release observed in arthriticjoints of Cathepsin G knockout mice [3]. As yet, a role for Cathepsin G in joint pain has not been examined. The intracellular signalling effects of Cathepsin G are thought to be mediated in part by the ability of thisenzyme to cleave and activate members of the proteinase-activatedreceptor (PAR) family [2]. The PAR family currently consists of four G-protein coupled receptors. Cleavage of these receptors by serine proteinases at a specic site within the extracellular N terminus,reveals a tethered ligand sequence which can then bind to the activesite and cause receptor activation [4]. PARs can also be selectively activated, without proteolytic cleavage, by synthetic activating pep- tides that mimic the tethered ligand sequence. PAR4 was the 4thmember of the family to be discovered and we have previously shownthat a PAR4 activating peptide had both pro-inflammatory and pro- nociceptive effects in the joint [5-7]. In addition, treatment with the selective PAR4 antagonist, pepducin P4pal-10 signicantly reduceddisease severity in a model of acute joint inflammation [5]. It is not yet known which particular serine proteinase activates PAR4 in vivo in the joint but Cathepsin G can activate PAR4 in platelets [2]. In this studywe examined the effect of Cathepsin G on neuronal activity in kneejoints of normal rats and determined whether this effect is mediated via PAR4. Methods: Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats(250-400 g; Charles River Laboratories, Quebec, Canada) in accor-dance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Single unit extracellular recordings were made from knee joint primary afferents as previouslydescribed [6, 7]. Briefly, small nerve bre bundles from the saphenous nerve were placed over a platinum electrode to permit extracellular recordings. Afferent nerve bres originating from the knee joint wereidentied by the elicitation of a ring response to probing of the jointwith a glass rod. Conduction velocities, electrical and mechanical thresholds of bres were determined. Four movement cycles, each consisting of 10 s of normal rotation and 10 s of noxious rotation of theknee to discrete torque levels, were performed at the beginning of theexperiment. The mean afferent nerve bre ring rate associated with these movements was the control baseline level, which was set at 100%. Then, either Cathepsin G (1 ng-10 lg in 100 ll) or boiled denatured Cathepsin G (inactive control) were administered locally to the knee viaa saphenous arterial cannulation. Movement cycles were repeated 1 min post-drug administration and then every 2 min until 15 min post- drug. Rats were either naive or pre-treated with the selective PAR4antagonist, pepducin P4pal-10 (100 lg i.p.) 30 min prior to recordings. Neuronal activity was digitized using a data acquisition system (CED1401; Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) and storedon a microcomputer for offline analysis. The number of action poten-tials per movement was determined using Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design), and the % change in afferent nerve bre activity from baseline was calculated.Results: One afferent joint bre was recorded from each rat with atotal of 34 bres examined overall in this study. Table 1 summarises the electrophysiological characteristics of each bre. All bres tested responded to close intra-arterial administration of potassium chloride(KCl; 0.4 mM, 0.1 ml) at the conclusion of the experiment. Cathepsin G dose-dependently decreased the ring rate of joint afferent bres during both normal and noxious rotations of the joint (Figs. 1,2; p\\0.05 enzyme using two-way ANOVA). Boiled inactive Cathepsin G had no effect on ring rate at any time point and at any dose (Figs. 1, 2). At doses of 1 and 10 ng where Cathepsin G alone had no effect, pre-treatment with the PAR4antagonist, pepducin, caused Cathepsin G to signicantly joint rotation (Fig. 3; p \\0.05 pepducin treated group compared to Cathepsin G alone, using two-way ANOVA.). Pepducin alone had no effect on ring rate (data notshown).Inflamm. Res.

This is in contrast to the pro-nociceptive effect of synthetic PAR4 activating peptide in the joint [6, 7], suggesting that Cathepsin G acts via a PAR4-independent pathway. Interestingly, inhibition of PAR4 enhances this antinociceptive effect of Cathepsn G, i.e. when PAR4 activation is blocked, low doses of Cathepsin G that do not normally have an effect,now cause a decreased ring rate. Therefore, PAR4 activation byCathepsin G may be causing a pro-nociceptive effect but this is normally masked by a stronger anti-nociceptive effect through a PAR4-indepen- dent pathway. Cathepsin G can act on other PAR members includingPAR1, which has previously been shown to be anti-nociceptive [8]. Thus,further work is required to investigate the mechanisms behind this anti- nociceptive effect of Cathepsin G so perhaps this effect can be enhanced in arthritic joints where high levels of this enzyme are observed [1].1.

Interruption of blood supply to the gut results in an ischemic injury, characterized by an acute and massiveinflammatory reaction [1]. Proteases represent 2% of the human gen- ome and a number of in vitro evidences have indicated that their releaseis rapidly mobilized in damaged or hypo-oxygenized cells. Indeed, proteases participate to several inflammatory states [2]. In particular, activation of members of the proteinase-activated receptors (PARs)family, which are G protein-coupled receptors activated by the cleavageat an Arginin-site of their N-terminus extracellular domain, has been implicated in leukocyte recruitment at inflammatory sites [3]. Other proteases belonging to the matrix metalloprotease (MMPs) inflamed gut [4]. Despitethe strong rationale for a potential role of proteases in inflammatory response to ischemia, the prole and functions of proteases in intestinal ischemic tissues has never been investigated, nor their relationship withinflammation. The aim of our study was to investigate the proteolyticprole associated with intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, measur- ing Arginine-cleavage and MMP proteolytic activities, and to study their possible correlation with inflammatory parameters.Methods: C57Bl6 male mice (8-week-old) were subjected to 90 min of intestinal ischemia by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery followed by 0 or 2 h reperfusion (I/R).

This inflammatory response is associated with the release of proteases both in tissues affected byischemia and reperfusion (intestinal tissues), and systemically inplasma. The nature of those proteases appears to be diverse, with some proteases clearly identied as MMP-2 and MMP-9 and having a gelatinic activity, and others cleaving at an arginin site, similar to theproteases that are capable of activating PARs. The release of Arginin- cleaving proteases in intestinal tissues correlates with inflammatory parameters, but the systemic release of Arginin-cleaving proteases inthe plasma does not correlate with inflammation. Considering wellknown pro-inflammatory effects of a number of proteases [2], this could suggest that the proteases released in the intestinal tissues, but not the ones released in the plasma, could participate to the generationof the massive inflammatory response associated with ischemia-S296 Inflamm. Res. 123reperfusion. The role of those different proteases in ischemia-reper- fusion associated injury still has to be demonstrated. Contrasting rolescan be suggested for MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMP-2 is constitutively expressed in almost all tissues, where it seems to play a protective role, particularly in gut diseases like colitis [5]. MMP-2 over-expression and over-activity in this model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion could serve to limit the deleterious effects of this massive inflammatory reaction. In contrast, MMP-9 is absent from most adult tissues and was found to be mostly neutrophil-associated [4, 6].Therefore, in our study, the increased expression of MMP-9 could bedue to the recruitment of neutrophils to ischemic tissues. As for the Arginin-cleaving proteases, it is tempting to suggest that they might exert a pro-inflammatory role through the activation of PARs in theintestine, since the activation of 3 of those receptors is considered as amajor pro-inflammatory signal in acute models of colitis [3]. How- ever, those Arginin-cleaving proteases could also exert pro- inflammatory effects through other mechanisms. One of them couldbe the activation of MMP-9, which proform is known to be trans- formed into an active form by cleavage at an Arginin site [7]. The correlation between Arginin-cleavage proteolytic activity in intestinaltissues and parameters of inflammation suggests that those proteasesare active players of the tissue inflammation. This increased activity could be due to the massive recruitment of inflammatory cells, which express in their granules, a number of proteases, including elastase,proteinase-3 and cathepsins. However, the lack of correlation betweenMPO activity and proteolytic activity in plasma demonstrates that those plasmatic proteases do not influence and are not influenced by inflammatory cell recruitment. Taken together, these results showedthe massive release of different proteases upon intestinal ischemia- reperfusion and suggest that those proteases could actively participate to the associated inflammatory response.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of IL-1 bby EHEC are unknown. Inflam- masomes are the cytosol that process proIL-1bto bioactive IL-1 b. To identify the inflammasomes involved in IL-1 b induction by EHEC, we infected macrophages derived from wild type and mice decient in inflammasome components with EHEC and analyzed the processing and release of mature IL-1 b. EHEC-induced IL-1bproduction was dependent on caspase-1 and the adaptor ASC. Notably, both NLRP3, a cytosolic sensor for microbial and endogenous products, and AIM2, a sensor were EHEC is a non- cytosolic pathogen, bacterial products such as DNA were observed in the cytosol of infected cells, providing a potential means by which cytosolic inflammasomes might be activated. This also indicated thatphagosomal degradation of bacteria is a prerequisite for inflammasomeactivation by EHEC. Supporting this hypothesis, blocking lysosomal acidication and type I interferon signaling that are essential for bac- terial lysis in phagosome, led to a marked decrease in EHEC-inducedIL-1bsecretion. Thus, our results demonstrate that EHEC potently activates multiple inflammasomes as a result of release of bacterial products from phagosomes into the cytosol.Introduction: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food- borne pathogen linked to hemorrhagic colitis and a fatal renal com- plication, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [1]. An important marker for IL-1 b[2], a potent proinflammatory of IL-1 bpro- duction is linked to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but pathways regulating its production are only recently becoming understood. The synthesis of pro-IL-1 bis triggered by the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; signal 1), and its activation ismediated by cytosolic multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes (signal 2). Inflammasomes formed PRRs, sense specic dangersignals, of adaptor. and procaspase-1. The autocatalytic activation converts proIL-1 bto IL-1 b[3]. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which EHEC induces IL-1 bsecretion and found, in were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblotting as described [4]. Statistical analysis was conducted by its cleavage into IL-1 bby caspase-1, indicating that EHEC provides both signal 1 and signal 2 required for the production of bioactive IL-1 b. EHEC-induced secretion Release of IL-1 band caspase-1 was completely abolished in EHEC-infectedNLRP3 -/-macrophages. AIM2 was recently shown to recognize DNA in the cytosolic compartment and activate inflammasome [4, AIM2 -/-cells relative to infected WT cells. These data collectively indicate that NLRP3 and AIM2 each have an essential role in inflammasome activation by EHEC (Fig. 1a,b). We and others have previously shown that AIM2 inflammasomedetects the cytosolic pathogens [4]. Here, we provide evidence for the rst time that AIM2 also plays an essential role in innate sensing of infection with a non-cytosolic bacterium. The role of AIM2 in sensingEHEC was unexpected because EHEC is an extracellular bacterium thatis thought to be excluded from the cytosol [7]. To investigate the cellular localization of EHEC, we visualized the fate microscopy. EHEC was found inlysosomes within 15 min of infection. By 1 h post-infection we observed bacterial DNA but not whole bacteria in the cytosol (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that bacterial degradation products such asDNA can become localized in the cytosol, where they may trigger theactivation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes.

EHEC DNA DAPI(blue) and lysosomes with fluorescent dextran ( red) Next, we tested whether bacterial degradation in lysosomes is essentialfor inflammasome activation by EHEC. Following phagocytosis,acidication of lysosomal compartments leads to activation of prote- olytic enzymes in the lysosomes and subsequent bacterial degradation. Prior to infection with EHEC, we treated BMDMs with the vacuolarH + ATPase system blocker, balomycin A, which inhibits lysosomalacidication and thus bacterial degradation. Treatment with balo- mycin completely blocked the release of EHEC DNA into the cytosol of macrophages (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, treatment alsomarkedly IL-1 bsecretion elicited by EHEC in a dose- dependent manner, similar to its effect on inflammasome activation by silica, which depends on lysosomal acidication (Fig. 3b). Anotherfactor that has been implicated to contribute to bacterial lysis in lyso-somes is type I interferon (IFN) signaling [8]. To test whether type I IFNs have a role in EHEC lysis in the lysosomes and thereby in in- flammasome activation by EHEC, we infected WT and type were markedly decreased in IFNR -/-cells (Fig. 4a, b). Interestingly, regulation of inflammasome activation by type I IFNs isconsidered to be a phenomenon restricted to cytosolic pathogens [8].Our data demonstrates that inflammasome activation by extracellular pathogens such as EHEC is also regulated by type I IFNs.

Notably, we demonstrate a role for a novelinflammasome pathway mediated by AIM2 in the detection of a non-cytosolic bacterium. We also show that bacterial lysis in the lyso- somes is essential for the activation of inflammasomes by EHEC. These insights raise the prospect of potential therapeutic interventionof EHEC-induced disease by modulation of IL-1 bproduction. Finlay coli Rev Microbiol. 2010;8:26-38.2. Taneike of FEBS 4.

Flower1 1Biochemical Pharmacology, Queen Mary University of London, London,2University College London, London, UKMast cells, basophils and eosinophils represent the rst line of host defence in allergic inflammation reaction. We investigated themechanism by which the anti-allergic drugs di-sodium cromoglycate and sodium nedocromil inhibit histamine and eicosanoid release from human mast cells (HMCs) as well as peripheral blood baso-phils (PBBs) using biochemical techniques. Cord derived HMCswere cultured in vitro and PBBs obtained from human donors or cardiac puncture in mice. Subsequent antigen challenged led to a prompt release of histamine and prostaglandin D 2(PGD 2), which was inhibited by nedocromil, nedocromil induced a rapid phosphorylation on the Ser 27residue of Anx-A1, hence its secretion, secondary to inhibition of phosphatase activity and activation of or with a specic (but not irrelevant) monoclonal antibodies reversed the inhibitory effect of these drugs on histamine and PGD 2-released. To highlight the crucial importance of Anx-A1 in this rapid effect of these drugs we tested the effect of nedocromil in Anx-A1 null mice. Cromones did not inhibit the release of histamine nor prostaglandin D2 frombasophils from Anx-A1 null mice.To translate these new ndingsclinically, we have analyzed Anx-A1 pattern of expression in tears from patients with Vernal KeratoConjuntivitis (VKC). While this seasonal disease is associated with an increased amount of theclipped- or inactive-form of Anx-A1, VKC patients treated with show augmentation of the total-or active-form of the protein. Al-together, the use of in vitro, in vivo investigations and the translational outcome of VKCallergic disease, suggest strongly the anti-inflammatory Anx-A1 protein to be a component of rapid cromone actions on mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.Introduction: While the cromoglycate-like drugs can inhibit both theearly and the late phase of the asthmatic reaction, their anti-asthmatic activity is attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties by most authorities [1]. Although cromoglycate, the prototype drug wasdeveloped in the 1960s the exact mechanism of action of this group ofdrugs has proved elusive. Early experiments [2] led to the concept that these drugs acted mainly on mast cells to suppress mediator release, but they also exert other therapeutically signicant actionsand mast cells are not their sole target. They are also effective in othermodels of inflammation and influence many facets of the inflamma- tory process unrelated to mast cell activation in vivo [3] or in vitro, e.g.eicosanoid generation [4]. We have recently reported that the ability of these drugs to inhibit leukocyte activation [5] and eicosa- noid release by U937 cells [6] depends upon their ability to release the anti-inflammatory protein Anx-A1 secondary to an inhibitory actionon the phosphatase PP2A. We demonstrate that this process is alsorequired for the acute effect of the cromones to inhibit histamine and eicosanoid secretion by human mast cells and basophils thus sup- plying an important mechanistic explanation for the pharmacologicalaction of these 50-year old drugs.Methods: Cord derived human mast cell culture Commercial puri- ed CD34 +stem cells were cultured for the rst 2 weeks in StemSpan (StemCell technologies) serum-free medium supple-mented with 50 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml IL- 3, and 100 lg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. After the 8 week, cells were cultured in StemSpan with 10% FCS. Assessment of Ser 27- Anx-A1-P and PKC activation The total cellular protein was determined and supernatants analysed by conventional western blotting techniques. Immunodetection was accomplished using dif- ferent antibodies 2or histamine-released the manufacturer's protocols.Results: Phosphorylation and secretion of Anx -A1 by HMCs. In Fig. 1a, all treatments on HMCs resulted in a signicant increase (*2.5- to 3.5-fold) in the amounts of an (Fig. 1b). Okadaic acid, a known inhibitor of PP2A was included here as a positive control. Effect of human recom- binant Anx -A1 protein on histamine and PGD 2released from HMCs We next wanted to relate the increment of Anx-A1 protein secreted after treatment with nedocromil or dexamethasone (shown in Fig. 1) with the ability of these drugs to inhibit histamine and PGD 2release. Figure 2a shows that human recombinant Anx-A1 protein at 1 and 10 nM is able to inhibit to the same extent asnedocromil (10 nM) and dexamethasone (2 nM) PGD from IgE-activated HMCs. To ascertain the role of Anx-A1 in the mechanism of action of nedocromilsodium, the effect of a specic neutralizing anti-Anx-A1 antibody was tested. Figure 2b shows the effect of the co-incubation of HMCs with neutralising anti-Anx-A1 (and irrelevant mabs) of action Under control conditionsthe drug inhibited histamine and PGD 2release by approximately 50%. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of the neutralising anti Anx-A1 mab ( \\6% Effect of cromones on mediators released from human peripheral blood basophils and in Anx -A1 null mice Nedocromil suppressed Anx-A1 released by IgE challenged PBBs by approximately 45% and this effect is evident at 10 min. Therewas a concomitant increase in the amount of Anx-A1 released which rose by four- to vefold with a maximum seen at 20 min by which time approximately 90% of the intracellular store wasreleased. To extend this concept we turned to the use of transgenicmice lacking the Anx-A1 gene. Figure 3b shows that subsequentchallenge on blood with anti-IgE for 30 min releases histamine (approximately 1.5- to 3.0-fold increase above basal levels). Thiswas strongly ( *50%) inhibited in the presence of nedocromil in blood taken from wild type animals but not that taken from Anx- A1 null mice. Anx-A1 content in tears from vernal keratoconjun- tivitis patients The seasonal allergic disease is associated with 50% increase of Anx-A1 biologically inactive clipped form measured by ELISA in tears. This is reversed following treatment with the cromoglycate-like drug Alomide, which increases both the totalamount and the relative proportion of intact Anx-A1 (Fig. 4). Fig. 1 Cromones promote externalisation of Anx-A1 from HMC cells. HMC phosphorylation were assessed by Western Blotting ( a).

At various time points (10, 20 30 min), the cell culture supernatant was sampled and the histamine concentration(expressed as nM) and the Anx-A1 concentration (expressed as ng/ml),was assessed by ELISA.

PBBs were incubated with 10 nM nedocromil for 5 min prior to challenge with anti-lgE. Histamine release from cell suspensions was assessed by ELISA and expressed as nM. PBBs from both wild typeand Anx-A1 cells released histamine in response to IgE challenge.Nedocromil totally inhibited the release from the wild type but not the Anx-A1 decient cells (data from Yazid et 123Fig. 4 Cromoglycate-like Alomide (Lodoxamide) increases Anx- from patients with VKC.

Yazid et al., unpub- lished data, 2011 Discussion: Our data here clearly indicates that cromone drugs pro- mote the phosphorylation, externalisation and release of Anx-A1 and that this process is mandatory for these drugs to bring about theirinhibition of histamine and eicosanoid release in HMCs as well asblood basophils. That this mechanism is common to several cell types is shown by our previous observations using U937 cells and PMN, where a similar Anx-A1 dependent inhibition of cell function wasobserved. I propose that this mechanism underlies the acute inhibitoryeffect of these drugs on mast cell mediator release and accounts for the aspect of their pharmacology.References 1. Barnes PJ.
