Immunity is the capability of the body to resist harmful microorganisms. It is the body's ability to fight infections and diseases. Our immune system can recognize and accept what belongs to the self and recognize and deny whatever is foreign. Generally, adults have stronger Immunity than children. Moreover, every individual's immune system may be different. Today, Immunity-Boosting Homeopathic Medicines are easily available that can help you lead a normal and disease-free life. Types of Immunity and Homeopathic Immunity Booster Medicines Human beings have three types of Immunity. - Innate Immunity: This is the natural immunity which human beings are born with. Our body has the Immunity to act against foreign antigens from the date of our birth. This type of immunity is formed by external barriers like the skin and mucous membranes of the gut and the throat. This immunity is the body's general response system. However, when the body cannot act with innate immunity, the second form of immunity comes into the picture. - Acquired Immunity: This is the adaptive Immunity that kicks in when the body's innate Immunity fails to act. We develop this immunity as we go through life. We build immunity against various pathogens as we are exposed to diseases or get vaccinated. The basis for this immunity is immunological memory, i.e., our immune system's capability to remember past enemies (pathogens). It gives a specific immune response to a particular pathogen. - Passive Immunity: Passive Immunity is the borrowed immunity. Its best example is the antibodies a baby receives from its mother before birth. This Immunity protects the baby from infections. However, this Immunity doesn't last long. Homeopathic Immunity Booster Medicines help protect our body from diseases. Immunization is another way that enables the body to produce antibodies, even when the body is not sick. Vaccinating children is also a type of immunization. What Happens When the Immune System gets Weak? A weak or disturbed immune system makes us susceptible to disease-causing microbes & prone to infections and illnesses. People with low immunity often fall ill. Moreover, they are also likely to be affected by the pandemic outbreak. So, what can you do to stay healthy and protected? Strengthen your immunity using Homeopathy along with a healthy diet. Nevertheless, if you want a long-term solution with no side effects, Homeopathy medicine for immunity boosters remains a safe treatment option. Many health care experts recommend it.
