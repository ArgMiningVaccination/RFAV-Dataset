He did lots of research and came away with one goal in mind: to promote better health and quality of life through preventative nutrition, results-based research, and quality education. Dr. Howard studied phytochemicals and found that these powerful nutrients were what gave fruits and vegetables their color, smell, and taste. He also found that phytonutrients are what make fruits and vegetables good for us and that if we regularly consume them we could become a healthier world. It is recommended to consume 10 or more servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Most people do not get this amount.
