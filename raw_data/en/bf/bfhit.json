With roots in India, Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world's oldest forms of holistic (mind-body-spirit) medicines. Considered a form of Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), Ayurveda teaches that when our mind, body, and spirit are in harmony, we have good health. When something disrupts this balance - injuries, environment, climate and seasonal changes, age, emotional/mental concerns, poor lifestyle habits, etc - we get sick. How Does Ayurvedic Medicine Work? Ayurveda medicine explores how the five fundamental elements of nature (earth, water, fire, air, space) show up in every living thing - ourselves included. We each have a unique combination of these elements that makes up our inherent constitution and it is this delicate balance of the elements within our body, mind, and spirit that we strive to maintain. Ayurvedic medicine is not a one-size-fits-all program. We understand that everyone is unique and your treatment should be as distinct as you are. Together, we'll use Ayurveda medicine as the key to unlocking the unique qualities of your body and mind that will establish the foundation for healthier habits, a stronger body, a sharper mind, and a resilient spirit. Recognizing food as the mother of all medicine, we will assess not simply what you eat, but how you eat. In addition to creating a personalized food program, we will also explore herbal medicines (if necessary) and lifestyle modifications such as daily and seasonal routines and rituals, proper sleep hygiene, [exercise habits](https://tulsaspineandrehab.com/treatments/yoga-therapy-tulsa/), and stress-reduction practices including but not limited to breathing (pranayama) and meditation. This is a great complement to any work you may be doing with one of our [Tulsa chiropractors](https://tulsaspineandrehab.com).
