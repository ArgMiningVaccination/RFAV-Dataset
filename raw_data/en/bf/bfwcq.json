The tropical disease was unknown in the United States until scientists identified the mosquito-borne infection in 1999. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD), Connecticut had 11 serious cases last year and an untold number of asymptomatic cases. The virus survives in birds during winter when mosquitoes are inactive. When the virus strikes the central nervous system, patients are admit - ted to the hospital for supportive care. \"The vast majority of people are asymptomatic or have a mild, flu-like illness,\" says Jack Ross, M.D., director of the Division of Infectious Disease at Hartford Hospital. \"Those most at risk for complications are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.\" Mosquitoes thrive when wet weather is followed by severe heat, the pattern in Connecticut this year. Prevent WNV by wearing long sleeves and pants, using mosquito repellent (with DEET) and eliminating standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. A growing number of brands of artificial energy drinks claim to \"boost energy\" and improve performance. The global market for stimulating beverages is estimated to exceed $12 billion annually. Although the label may boast that a beverage vitalizes body and mind, it's often short on details about exactly how much caffeine, sugar and stimulants the product contains. Energy drink manu - facturers pepper the drinks with added caffeine, vitamins, herbs like Ginseng and Gingko biloba, trendy amino acids and energy-boosting Brazilian guarana. Sugar-free varieties contain aspartame and other artificial sweeteners. Under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), en - ergy drinks containing alcohol were reformulated to remove caffeine and other stimulants, but there's nothing to keep college students from lacing energy drinks with vodka. Such a risky combination can make drinkers wide awake and highly impulsive, leading to accidents or injuries. \"Energy drinks contain large amounts of caffeine and sugar,\" says Hartford Hospital dietitian Mary Noon, M.S., R.D., CD-N. \"These drinks are not intended for athletes because they are not 'sports drinks' or electro - lyte-replacement drinks. Although they supply calories and carbohy - drates, energy drinks are not a substitute for food.\" Although most people assume that artificial energy drinks are tested before being sold, the FDA does not require manufacturers to substanti - ate the safety or effectiveness of dietary supplements. Most energy drinks are loaded with dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals and amino acids. \"Energy drinks are high in carbohydrates and low in protein,\" says Ms. Noon. \"If you want an energy boost, have a small snack of peanut butter on a slice of whole wheat bread.\" 2Even if you only drink a couple of glasses of wine at dinner or a few beers at a sporting event, you may be surprised by how little alco - hol it takes to reach the legal limit of 0.08%. If you're a petite woman, you won't be able to handle as much alcohol as a husky guy. The liver of a woman has to work harder to eliminate alcohol, too. You may think you have a high tolerance for alcohol, but it probably just takes longer for you to feel drunk. Isn't Alcohol Good for My Heart? \"People drink more than they think,\" says cardi - ologist Donna M. Polk, M.D., director of Preventive Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"Women shouldn't drink more than four to five ounces of wine daily (or one beer or an ounce of alcohol), while men can drink slightly more, equivalent to an ounce and a half of liquor.\" Despite its well-publicized cardiovascular benefits, too much alcohol boosts blood levels of artery-dam - aging triglycerides. \"Although a daily drink may help prevent heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption raises your blood pressure and greatly increases the risk for stroke, especially in women,\" warns Dr. Polk. Different beers and wines contain different mea - sures of alcohol by volume (ABV). While beer generally has an ABV of 5% (and Amstel Light has only 3.5%), Samuel Adams Triple Bock tops 17%. Most wines fall into the 12-14% range. When it comes to mixed drinks, it all depends on the bartender. \"I never tell people to go out and drink alcohol to prevent heart disease,\" says Dr. Polk. \"But if they're consuming alcohol on a regular basis, they should know that there's some evidence that alcohol in mod - eration can help protect the heart. Studies show that it's not the type of alcohol, but the fact that a daily drink is a component of a Mediterranean diet.\"Perils of the Pour Along the Mediterranean coast, people gather every evening for an aperitif, a glass of wine or spirits before din - ner. But in an American res - taurant, that tiny glass you'd be served on the Riviera is likely to be \"super-sized\" into a goblet that can hold up to 28 ounces of wine. Even if it's not filled to the rim, you're probably getting a far more generous pour than the recommended five ounces. Try eating a meal before going out because the less food in your stomach, the faster alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream. Quick shots of liquor hit the bloodstream faster than slow sips of wine. Fizzy bever - ages raise the alcohol absorption rate, which is why champagne can make you tipsy after only one glass. Older people tend to reach the legal limit faster than younger drinkers. Fatigue, stress, depression, illness and even over-the-counter drugs like Benadryl can intensify alcohol's effects. Contrary to popular myth, caffeine won't make you sober\u2014it just makes you a wide-awake drunk. Driving Dangerously The legal limit, once as high as 1.5% in some states, is now 0.08% nationwide. Studies show that alcohol-re - lated traffic deaths have fallen by nearly half since 1980, but nearly 11,000 people die each year in the United States in car crashes fueled by drinking and driving. The number of women arrested for driving while in - toxicated (DWI) jumped more than 30% between 2000 and 2009. Just ask Susie (not her real name), a petite woman of 60 who hit a telephone pole in West Hartford one afternoon after a couple of gin-and-tonics. \"I felt perfectly in control,\" she recalls. \"To my horror, I blew a 1.5 on the breathalzyer and totaled my car. I was glad no one was hurt. Now, after attending court-ordered alcohol education classes, I never drink before I drive.\" Life of the PartyDo you know how much alcohol you can safely drink before you're legally drunk? 3New Treatments for Epilepsy Dr. Brendan Killory, director of Epilepsy and Functional Neurosurgery at Hartford HospitalThe brain contains an estimated 100 billion nerve cells that flash ideas through the cerebral cortex at lightning speed. Nerve cells, or neurons, release electrical pulses that zip around the brain delivering messages to the spinal cord, muscles and nerves. The neuron's powerhouse is the axon, whose radiating branch - es unleash tiny jolts that shoot electrical signals from one nerve cell to the next. Neuro transmitters smooth the biochemical path - way as axons fire and impulses jump the gaps between nerve cells. The brain's electrical system effortlessly directs every thought and action. Sudden surges Seizures strike the brain like an electrical storm. When all the neurons start erupting at once, disjointed bursts of energy jam the signals and overwhelm the brain. Neurons fire wildly and the seizure can disrupt \"eloquent\" regions of the brain involv - ing important functions such as speech, movement and even consciousness. Epilepsy most often strikes the temporal lobe of the brain. A chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, epilepsy afflicts about one percent of the population, or three million Americans. Up to 30 percent of all kids diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder develop epilepsy. An estimat - ed 60 million people worldwide suffer from the condition, with approximately 70,000 new cases of epilepsy diagnosed each year in the United States. \"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder,\" says Hartford Hospital neurologist Erica A. Schuyler, M.D., whose clinical train - ing and expertise in interpreting brain wave activity help her to see subtle clues that can find the origin of a patient's seizures even when the patient is not having a seizure. \"In addition to ton - ic-clonic (grand mal) seizures or convulsions, seizures can pres - ent with a wide variety of clinical symptoms such as sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, twitching on one side of the body, acting confused, or having difficulty speaking.\" Rather than dramatic episodes, many people who develop epilepsy in childhood experience \"absence\" seizures, short attention blackouts that look to an observer like nothing more than daydreaming. \"People with poorly controlled epilepsy are embarrassed when they have a seizure in front of their coworkers,\" adds Brendan D. Killory, M.D., director of Epilepsy and Functional Neurosurgery at Hartford Hospital. \"About a third of epilepsy sufferers are ac - cidentally injured each year. Epilepsy is associated with reduced quality of life, psychiatric problems, decreased likelihood of mar - rying and having children, lower education status, lower employ - ment rates and inability to drive.\" Why a disease that is so common continues to be stigmatized is a puzzling dilemma. For decades, epilepsy was a secret, almost shameful affliction. In the popular imagination, the disease has often been linked with the mystical visions of tyrants and saints. Epilepsy famously afflicted Julius Caesar and the novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky.Hartford Hospital already has a renowned Stroke Center with advanced technologies, so a state-of-the-art epilepsy center was the next logical step. Epilepsy Facts Epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects the nerve cells (neurons). When all the neurons erupt at once, disjointed bursts of energy overwhelm the brain. An estimated 18,000 people in cen - tral and northern Connecticut\u2014plus another 11,000 around the state\u2014 have been diagnosed with epilepsy. Nearly 9,700 north-central Connecticut residents have \"medically refractory epilepsy\" and aren't despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Surgery could help 2,000-3,000 people in the Hartford region with medically refractory (treatment resistant) temporal lobe epilepsy. \"Tonic-clonic\" seizures (formerly called grand mal seizures) are a type of generalized seizure that affects the entire brain. \"Absence\" seizures (formerly called petit mal seizures) look like someone is staring off into space. One-third of people with epilepsy suffer accidental injury each year. Recurrent seizures lead to \"kindling\" (an increased probability of having more seizures). More than three million Americans have been diagnosed with epilepsy. 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Erica Schuyler, M.D. dramatically reduce or even cure their seizures altogether.\" The percentage of people with refractory epilepsy has not de - creased despite the introduction of nine new FDA-approved anti - epileptic medications since 1993. Recurrent seizures are believed to cause progressive brain injury, resulting in loss of cognitive ability and \"kindling\" new seizures in the affected region of the brain. EEG (brain wave) tests show whether abnormal electrical activ - ity is generalized across the brain\u2014 common in people whose seizures begin in childhood\u2014or localized to a single spot in the brain. Brain waves are typically recorded for a half hour, although some patients must be monitored over the course of several days to determine exactly where their seizures arise. \"Sometimes people have a single spot in the brain\u2014caused by a stroke, traumatic injury, brain tumor or developmental malforma - tion\u2014that makes them prone to having seizures,\" says Dr. Schuyler. \"We already have a renowned Stroke Center with advanced technologies, so a state-of-the-art epilepsy center was the next logical step.\" Nerve stimulation Some patients with refractory epilepsy who aren't candidates for surgery can benefit from a surgi - cally implanted device called a vagus nerve stimulator. \"The device is placed just below the collarbone like a pacemaker,\" says Dr. Schuyler. \"Stimulating the vagus nerve with low-level current is not a cure for epilepsy, although it has been shown to reduce seizure frequency.\" New treatments are on the horizon. \"Researchers are study - ing a 'neuropacemaker' implanted permanently in the brain that can sense seizure activity before it Erica A. Schuyler, M.D., a Hartford Hospital neurologist, is board-certified in Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology. Her clinical experience and special - ized training in electroencepha - lography (EEG) provide special expertise in the treatment of epilepsy. She earned her undergraduate degree at Wesleyan University and her medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 2003. She completed her residency in Neurology at the University of Michigan Health System in 2007, followed by fellowship training at the University of Michigan Health System in Clinical Neurophysiology (epilepsy) in 2008 and an additional year of advanced training in epilepsy/ EEG in 2009. A native of Massachusetts, she was excited to settle in New England with her husband, origi - nally from New Jersey, when she joined Hartford Hospital in 2009. They are the parents of two boys, age four and nine months.Center of excellence Hartford Hospital is creating a multidisciplinary Neuroscience Center to treat the estimated 18,000 central and northern Connecticut residents\u2014plus another 11,000 from the southern and northwest regions of the state\u2014who have been diagnosed with epilepsy. Nearly 9,700 of them have \"medi - cally refractory epilepsy,\" which means they don't have complete seizure control despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Hartford Hospital physicians pinpoint regions of abnormal brain activity with functional MRI (fMRI) and highly sophisticated PET imag - ing, brain scans, angiograms to map the blood vessels, speech and language evaluation and neuro - psychological testing. The Institute of Living's Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center provides a state-of- the-art fMRI scanner and electro - physiology equipment to create col - orful images that reveal where the brain \"lights up\" during a seizure. \"Our neurosurgical team is dedicated to collaborating with other specialists to provide high- quality medical and surgical care for complex or severe epilepsy,\" says Inam Kureshi, M.D., chief of the Department of Neurosurgery. \"Hartford Hospital has committed resources to developing a multidis - ciplinary program to treat even the most difficult cases right here in Hartford.\" Sharp and spiking waves \"When anti-seizure medications don't work, we do a detailed work - up with specific tests to confirm the diagnosis,\" says Dr. Schuyler. \"About 30 percent of people with epilepsy still continue to have sei - zures with even the best available medications. These are patients for whom we will now be able to offer alternative treatments which could 6Although innovative brain surgery can 'cure' the disorder when a lesion or brain tumor can be pinpointed, most people rely on medications to control symptoms. The availability of new treatments means that all patients with medically refractory seizures should be referred to a specialized epilepsy center for evaluation.begins,\" says Dr. Killory. \"Neurons are electrical nodes in the brain that respond to either excitatory or inhibitory signals.\" Although innovative brain surgery can \"cure\" the disorder when a lesion or brain tumor can be pinpointed, most people rely on medications to control symptoms. The availability of new treatments means that all patients with medi - cally refractory seizures should be referred to a specialized epilepsy center for evaluation. Life-altering surgery People with epilepsy have two to three times greater mortality risk and an even greater chance of dying if the disease is poorly controlled. What's known as \"sud - den unexplained death in epilepsy\" accounts for half of the increased mortality rate. Scientists don't fully understand why seizures can be deadly, but believe that epilepsy somehow disrupts brain function, breathing and heart rhythms. Surgery is most effective for epi - lepsy patients with partial (focal) seizures that occur in a limited area of the brain. \"We have the best out - comes and an 80 percent seizure-free rate when the seizures can be localized to a focal area of the brain,\" says Dr. Killory. \"Epilepsy surgery can be curative when the part of the brain where the ab - normal activity originates can be surgically removed to achieve total control of the disease.\" Deep within the temporal lobe of the brain lies the hippocampus, a structure central to the forma - tion of new memories. Just above are regions exquisitely specialized for language, visual-spatial tasks and verbal memory, nestled within intricate webs of delicate blood ves - sels. Dr. Killory thoroughly maps the brain before navigating within these \"eloquent\" areas to avoid disrupting vital motor, sensory or cognitive functions. \"Surgery can decrease or even eliminate seizures in people with a common type of epilepsy that affects the temporal lobe,\" says Dr. Killory, \"but fewer than one percent of patients with medically refrac - tory epilepsy are referred to an epilepsy center.\" Pictured right is an electroen - cephalogram (EEG) showing brain waves in a 17-year-old patient with epilepsy, superimposed on a three-dimensional MRI image of the brain (side view). 7Dr. Andrew Caputo (left) and Dr. Daniel MastellaGet a Grip on Arthritis of the Hand Gnarled, arthritic hands reveal the ravages of time. Painfully deformed finger joints unmask the de - structive effects of wear and tear on the joints. More than 27 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis, the most common type of degenerative joint dis - ease, making it a leading cause of disability in adults. Chronic joint pain and arthritis afflict nearly 70 million people in the United States. Arthritis results from loss of cartilage that acts as a cushion for the bones of the hand. As the disease pro - gresses, sufferers lose more and more of the cartilage layer that provides a smooth gliding surface for the joints. The body leaks fluid into the lining of the joints as it tries to compensate for lost cartilage. Swollen fin - gers and knuckles signal the effects of joint-damaging deterioration. \"Patients often report sore fingers or sharp pain dur - ing activity, followed by a dull ache afterward,\" says Daniel J. Mastella, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon at The Hand Center. \"We tell mechanics to use tools and to wear gloves to protect their hands and keep them lim - ber. Work gloves don't have to be big and bulky.\" Not all patients with arthritis have the degenerative form of the disease. Rheumatoid arthritis\u2014the autoim - mune form of the disease\u2014results from a body-wide inflammatory over-reaction that occurs when the body's normally protective defense system goes awry. Specialists called rheumatologists can begin early, ag - gressive treatment with \"disease-modifying\" drugs to prevent potentially crippling joint damage in patients with the autoimmune form of the disease. \"Thanks to new medications, the incidence of sur - gery has significantly decreased among rheumatoid arthritis patients,\" says Andrew E. Caputo, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon with Orthopedic Associates of Hartford who specializes in problems of the hand and wrist. \"Drugs given by injection or infusion\u2014Enbrel, Humira and Remicade\u2014can reduce inflammation, re - lieve pain and slow the progression of the disease.\" \"Disease-modifying drugs mean that fewer people can expect to develop the hand deformities that were once typical of rheumatoid arthritis patients,\" adds Dr. Mastella. While the newer drugs help an estimated 1.5 million people with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoar - thritis is up to 20 times more likely to strike an aging individual. Deep, aching pain and stiffness, especially in the morning, along with a feeling of warmth in the joints, often indicate the onset of osteoarthritis. As the disease progresses, sufferers develop reddened bumps, or cysts, on the joints at the ends of the fingers and an agonizing feeling that joint bones are grinding against each other . Eventually, arthritic hands become crooked and disfigured. \"Arthritis is especially common at the base of the thumb where it joins the wrist,\" says Dr. Caputo. \"Pain and weakness often worsen with activities that in - volve pinching, such as opening jars, grasping a coffee cup or turning a key in a door.\" The large joints in the hand at the base of each fin - ger act as complex hinge joints and are important for both power-grip and grasping. \"The middle knuckles have to deal with angular tensile loads,\" explains Dr. Mastella. \"Just think about picking up a 100-pound weight with your hand.\" Hand specialists initially treat osteoarthritis with pain-killing medications and physical therapy. \"We consider treatment with oral medications like acet - aminophen (Tylenol) or non-steroidal anti-inflam - Caputo. \"Splints, topical gels and cortisone shots\u2014 lasting up to three months\u2014can provide temporary relief. Surgery is generally considered a last resort to relieve pain, stiffness and swelling and restore func - tion to the affected joint.\" Hand surgery is often performed using minimally invasive arthroscopic techniques. \"Surgical repair helps manage pain and restore joint function,\" says Dr. Mastella. \"We operate to remove a painful bone spur or fuse the joints closest to the fingertips. We can also reconstruct joints with the patient's own tissues or use artificial materials for joint replacement.\" In a procedure called tendon arthroplasty, the sur - geon transplants a tendon from the forearm. Unlike simply fusing the joint together, the technique relieves pain while allowing the thumb joint to retain some movement. \"While some people have no symp - toms despite visible signs of arthritis on X-rays,\" says Dr. Caputo, \"about 70 percent of people over 65 suffer pain as their joints begin to wear out.\" Today at Hartford Hospital, arthroplasty (joint replacement) is widely used to treat arthritis and severe joint problems that affect the hand. Innovative implants made from cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethyl - ene have revolutionized joint replacement surgery. Surgery involves replacing the damaged joint with an artificial one held in place with bone cement for lasting durability. 9When I was in the hospital, I vowed I would get out,\" recalls Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., who spent more than two years as a patient at the Institute of Living (IOL) during the early 1960s. \"But I also vowed I would come back and get everybody else out too.\" Today, at age 68, Dr. Linehan has fulfilled her life's purpose over a long career as an acclaimed psychologist, research scientist, author and profes - sor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Washington. In 1993, she developed dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), the only evidence-based treatment shown to be effective in treating the emotional dysfunction called \"borderline personality disorder.\" But it was her own experience as a suicidal 17-year-old\u2014diagnosed with schizophrenia and kept in seclusion to keep her from harming herself\u2014 that inspired her search for a better way to help others suffering emotional storms. In June, she made a triumphant return to the IOL, where she admit - ted publicly for the first time that she had been a patient there. In 1961, when she was 17, she suffered such debilitating headaches that her family sent her to a psychiatrist, who suggested an evaluation at the IOL. She left her home in Tulsa, Okla., expecting to stay only a couple of weeks. \"When I arrived at the Institute of Living, no one knew what to do with me,\" she says. \"I com pletely fell apart. I lost control and they lost control of me.\" She had never been away from home before. \"They gave me a young resident psychiatrist, Dr. John O'Brien, who had no idea how to help me,\" she recalls. \"Behavioral therapy didn't exist. They gave me drugs, cold packs to calm me down and electro convulsive therapy, which in those days meant full seizures from electrodes attached to both sides of my brain.\" To this day, she has amnesia about her hospital stay, but she says Dr. O'Brien saved her life by keeping her safe from herself. \"He saw the good in me,\" she says. \"He was the first person who I experienced as loving me. It was not a love affair, but I had the experience of being loved. He loved me in the same way I love my patients.\" When she finally left the hospital, she began to study psychology, re - searching ways to help others struggling with suicidal behaviors. The groundbreaking treatment she ultimately developed came from her own suf - fering and a transformative spiritual experience. As she struggled to master her wild urges, she practiced \"radical acceptance\" of her life each day. While praying one day at Chicago's Cenacle Retreat Center, she suddenly felt divine love wash over her. \"I went in as one person and walked out as another,\" she recalls. \"I believe it was the experience of being loved by God.\" Paradoxically, that wonderful feeling disappeared when she tried to hold onto it. \"Once you have a spiritual experience, you can't recapture the feel - ing,\" she says. \"Just as you can't change your life by yelling, screaming and demanding change.\" Decades passed. She published widely, studied in a postdoctoral program in behavioral therapy and combined day-to-day skills with Zen medita - tion to create a new kind of cognitive behavioral therapy to help desperate people learn to love and accept themselves. Today, Dr. Linehan's methods are used for borderline personality disorder, suicidal thinking, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress and eating disorders. \"I never promise my patients they'll have a miracle,\" she says. \"I had to learn how to accept my own emotional instability. If you practice radical ac - ceptance of yourself, your life and the world as it is, you will be transformed.\"Coming Home \" Mind and Memory Drug-Free ADHD Treatment for Teenagers Teenagers with attention-deficit hyperactivity dis - order (ADHD) struggle to concentrate or even sit still. School becomes a battleground of distractibility and defiance as kids labeled \"lazy\" or \"disruptive\" try to overcome serious learning and memory difficulties. ADHD causes a stunning lack of focus, learning and behavioral problems, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Ten years ago, people argued over whether ADHD was \"real\" or not. Today, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) calls ADHD the most common behavioral disorder among children. Although ADHD afflicts both boys and girls, more boys are diagnosed with ADHD. Since 2001, researchers at the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center at the Institute of Living (IOL) have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the regions of the brain and measure activ - ity in the frontal lobes, the seat of many higher-order cognitive functions. Neuroimaging reveals significant anatomical and structural differences in the brains of people with ADHD. In laboratories worldwide, researchers have begun to identify how stimulant medications work to change brain function and reduce ADHD symptoms. But many important questions remain. Particularly important is the need to find non-drug treatments, given concerns among parents about side-effects and unknown long- term effects on their children's health from years of daily medication use. With new NIH funding, Olin Center researchers are investigating changes in brain function when teenag - ers with ADHD engage in computer-based training\u2014 a treatment that does not involve medications. The effectiveness of this promising new therapy has been supported in some clinical trials, but little is known about how or why it works. \"We're looking for kids between the age of 13 and 18 with ADHD to validate this recently developed non-drug treatment,\" says Michael C. Stevens, Ph.D., director of the Clinical Neuroscience and Development Laboratory at the Olin Center and director of Child and Adolescent Research at the IOL. \"Our goal is to study teenagers with significant hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive behavior to determine how the treatment is changing brain function.\" The treatment is based upon exercises designed to strengthen \"working memory.\" Many people with ADHD have moderate to serious weaknesses in working memory that can be documented with clinical testing. One example of working memory is the ability to keep something like a phone number in the mind for a short period of time (from several seconds to a few minutes) before using the information to make a call. \"The treatment consists of drills that help kids prac - tice holding information in the mind and manipulating it to solve problems,\" says Dr. Stevens. \"It's actually just a video game, designed with therapeutic exercises. The 'game' helps to keep them plugging away for an half an hour a day, five days a week until the recommended dose of 'treatment' has been reached after five weeks.\" The IOL research team is combining neuropsycho- logical testing and state-of-the-art, non-invasive, clinical neuroscience tools (fMRI) to examine and correlate brain activity changes with working memory training. The study will compare brain activity before and after treatment to see how at-home, computer-based, intensive drills alter brain function to strengthen cognitive abilities and re - duce ADHD symptoms. For the first time ever, the NIH is funding ADHD non-drug treatment research backed up by fMRI imaging. Researchers are now recruiting teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 to participate in ADHD research. Results should be available in late 2012.

Cancers of the colon and rectum togeth - er are the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Yet more than a million colorectal cancer survivors are alive today in the United States, thanks to preventive screening and lifesaving surgery. Although colorectal cancer can be deadly once it invades deeper tissues or spreads to distant organs, it often begins with a tiny polyp that can easily be snipped off during a routine procedure called a colonoscopy. A colonoscope\u2014 a long, flexible instrument with a lighted fiberoptic cam - era at its tip\u2014allows physi - cians to scrutinize the entire length of the large intestine for abnormal growths. Most colorectal cancers develop from benign polyps that only have the poten - tial to become cancerous over time. In its early stages, colorectal cancer has no symptoms. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recom - mends that individuals at normal risk for colon cancer be screened for the disease with colonoscopy or other methods beginning at age 50. Those with a family his - tory of the disease should be screened earlier. \"Research has shown the life-saving benefits of routine screening for both men and women,\" says Jeffry Nestler, M.D., of Connecticut GI, chief of Hartford Hospital's Division of Gastroenterology, \"but there are disparities in screening rates among different states and ethnic groups. In Connecticut, about 75 percent of people over age 50 are routinely screened, which is higher than the national average. Lower socioeconomic groups and minorities have lower screening rates and higher mor - tality rates.\" Hartford Hospital's gastrointestinal specialists offer experience and expertise in diagnosing and treating a wide range of colorectal cancers. Screening techniques include colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy (to look at the lower third of the colon), digital rectal exam, radio - logic imaging and a noninvasive fecal occult blood test to detect bleeding that can't be seen with the naked eye. \"The risk of develop - ing colorectal cancer increases with age,\" adds Dr. Nestler. \"Routine screening, beginning at age 50 and continu - ing at regular intervals at least until age 75, has been proven to save lives. Research suggests that African Americans should start screening at an even earlier age.\" The good news is that between 2003 and 2007, the number of Americans between the ages of 50 and 75 who had ever had a colonoscopy or other screening test jumped from 52 percent to 65 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In regions with the highest rates of screen - ing, the chances of dying from colorectal cancer are markedly reduced. The death rate from colorectal cancer has dropped by 33 percent in the Northeast over the past decade. For every one percent increase in the rate of complete colonoscopy, the chance of death has been shown to decrease by three percent. Before a routine colo - noscopy, patients typical - ly drink only clear liquids for one day and then take laxatives to cleanse the bowel. If your physician finds a polyp or other lesion, it can be removed during the procedure. The colonoscopy itself is safe and easy. \"Over the past four years at Hartford Hospital, we have seen the introduction of newer anesthetics that are safe and effective,\" says Dr. Nestler. \"These anesthetics have swift onset and allow patients to wake up feeling fine.\" More than 15,000 colonoscopies are performed each year at Hartford Hospital by gastroenterolo - gists, endoscopists and colorectal surgeons. Ask your primary care physician if you should have a routine colonoscopy. To learn more about colonoscopy, visit www.harthosp. org/Gastroenterology/GastroenterologyServices/Colonoscopy. Routine Cancer Screening Can Save Your LifeDon't be afraid to find out 12 WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE Why does your primary care physician order blood tests? What is your doctor looking for in those lavender-topped vials of blood? A complete blood count (CBC) is used as a broad screening test to check for anemia (iron deficiency), infection and other diseases, says internal medicine specialist Peter Sereny, M.D., of Hartford Medical Group, South Main Street, West Hartford. Your doctor will typically order a CBC for a routine physical exam or if you're suffering from unexplained fa - tigue, weakness, bruising or bleeding. Anemia (iron deficiency) is caused by blood loss from heavy periods, ulcers, certain medica - tions, inherited disorders and chronic or acute kidney failure. \"Anemia has many causes,\" says Dr. Sereny. \"The CBC alone can give your physician a very good indication of the cause of your anemia.\" Listed below is a sampling of common tests used for a routine physical or to diagnose several diseases, but it's not a comprehensive list of all the tests your doctor may order. TEST CBC The CBC measures both white and red blood counts, as well as how the various cells are distributed (the differen - tial). Anemia is a low red blood cell count. Indicators in the CBC help your doctor diagnose the cause of anemia. High or low white blood cell counts and differentials can signal infection, inflammation, allergic reactions or cancer. The CBC also may include a measurement of your platelets, vi- tal for blood clotting. Your hemoglobin and hematocrit tests are specific measures of red blood cell quantity in the sample.TEST Creatinine Creatinine evaluates kidney function. Creatinine levels are abnormally high in people with impaired kidney function (acute or chronic kidney failure), severe muscle injury, dehydration, heart attack or conges - tive heart failure. TEST eGFR Although creatinine used to be the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing kidney disease, Dr. Sereny says physicians now rely more on the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) to measure the functional capacity of the kidney. TEST BUN The blood urea nitrogen test is used to evaluate kidney function and help diagnose kidney disease. It also helps to differenti - ate dehydration from true kidney failure. The test is often ordered as part of a basic metabolic panel. TEST Glucose Blood glucose (blood sugar) levels are part of a metabolic panel that helps your doctor screen for diabetes or pre- diabetes. The A1C test is now used to assess the efficacy of diabetes treatment. TEST Cholesterol The lipid profile (\"good\" HDL cholesterol and \"bad\" LDL cho - lesterol) helps estimate a healthy person's risk of develop - ing heart disease. Healthy total cholesterol: < 200 mg/dL Risky total cholesterol: > 240 HDL: > 40 mg/dL (men); > 50 mg/dL (women) Risky LDL (bad) cholesterol: > 100 mg/dL TEST Triglycerides Blood tests for triglycerides are part of the lipid profile used to identify the risk of developing heart disease. Healthy: < 150 mg/dL Risky: > 200 mg/dLWhat's that test for? Garlic's Good New research confirms the healthful benefits of allium vegetables such as onions, garlic and scallions. Preliminary studies sug - gest that eating garlic may reduce the risk of develop - ing several types of cancer. A study from the National Cancer Institute found that eating approximately two teaspoons or more of garlic, onions or scallions a day was associated with a significantly lower risk of prostate cancer.Sad Stroke Link Women who suffer from depression may also be at increased risk for a stroke, reports the journal Stroke. The Nurses' Health Study, which has followed 80,000 American women since the mid-1970s, showed that those with a his - tory of depression had a 29 percent higher risk of stroke. Depressed women were more likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.Get Moving! Researchers at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Med- icine found that most osteoarthritis sufferers do not engage in any mean - ingful physical activity in a typical week, contra - dicting what many arthri - tis patients themselves report. Although activity has been shown to help ease joint pain and stiff - ness, only 13 percent of men and eight percent of women met federal exer - cise guidelines.Tanning Addiction? People who regularly use tanning beds ex - perience brain-activity changes during tanning sessions that mimic patterns of drug addic - tion, say researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The addictive potential of exposure to ultraviolet rays may help explain why many people disregard warnings about skin cancer. Nearly 30 million Americans tan indoors every year. 13We welcome some of the newest members of our Hartford Hospital Medical Staff.

Rich in anti-oxidants and fragrant with rosemary, the attractive appe - tizer can be prepared a day ahead. The unique fusion of sweet and sharp flavors is a quick and easy dish to make. Even in winter, citrus fruits are readily avail - able and rich in vitamin C, folate, potassium and dietary fiber. Plant-based oils, especially heart-healthy olive oil, have been shown to benefit the cardiovascular system. Although the olive tree originated in Asia, it has been cultivated for more than 3,000 years in Mediterranean countries. Native to China, kumquats are smooth-skinned, citrus-like fruits. Needlelike sprigs of rosemary, an evergreen herb, add an aromatic accent to the mix and contain phytochemicals, compounds shown to help prevent disease and promote health. Good food choices don't have to be boring or tasteless, says Hartford Hospital dietitian Mary Noon, M.S., RD, CD-N, who recently began analyzing the recipes featured in our quarterly magazine, Rounds .Ingredients 3-4 long, fresh rosemary sprigs 1 c. green olives (in water) 1 c. black olives (in water) 3 honeybell (tangelo) oranges, 5 clementines or 4 tangerines Handful of kumquats (optional) 6 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil Place rosemary in a bowl with the olives. Mix with 3 Tbs. olive oil. With a potato peeler, peel one Clementine or similar citrus fruit. Peel just the orange layer. Remove any pith and add the peel to the olive mix. Cut the peeled fruit in halves or quarters; squeeze juice into olive mix. Cover and marinate for at least one hour (or marinate up to one day ahead). When ready to serve, preheat oven to 475\u00b0 F. Cut the remaining citrus into slices and place into an ovenproof dish along with the olive mix - ture. Drizzle with 3 Tbs. olive oil. Roast for 15-20 minutes and cool slightly before serving. Squeeze juice from roasted citrus over the top and serve with crusty bread.Roasted Olives and Citrus Fruit with Rosemary 1 serving (approximately 1/8 of recipe) Calories: 163 14.5 grams (total) fat 2 grams saturated 1.5 grams polyunsaturated 11 grams monounsaturated Recipe analyzed by Mary Noon, MS, RD, CD-N.1 gram protein 7 grams carbohydrate 2 grams fiber "}
