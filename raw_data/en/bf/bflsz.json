{"title": "Exemption or Declination from UC's Immunization Requirements", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Overview Students seeking an Exemption or Declination must submit a request via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) no later than the published compliance deadline dates that were included in the Provost's [campus message](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/messages/210716-uc-covid19-vaccine-policy.php) announcing the policy. Exemption requests are unnecessary for the flu and COVID vaccines as students may submit a declination letter. A student who meets the definition of a \"Non-Covered Individual\" as defined by the policy may submit a form to the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/) on which they self-attest that they are not subject to the policy. If you believe that the UC Vaccination Policy does not apply to you, then you must submit a self-attestation that under no circumstances will you be physically present, even for a moment, on the UCI campus or at any other UC location or event for the duration of the applicable term. The attestation form is available below under the \"Forms\" section of this webpage. A student who self-attests by completing, signing and uploading the form will no longer be considered \"non-compliant\" with the policy. However, attestations are subject to audit and a new attestation form must be submitted for each term in which you meet the definition as a \"non-covered individual\". Below is a summary of current UC mandatory Immunization Requirements: - New, incoming students must obtain four (4) required vaccines (aka \"4-Vax\" requirement) or demonstrate compliance through upload of vaccination records online via the [Student Health Patient Portal](https://osh.chs.uci.edu/). - Incoming students must complete a TB Risk Screening Form on the portal.
