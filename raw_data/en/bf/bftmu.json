Place yourself in a comfortable position sitting upright or laying down with a straight back. Hold the crystal in your left hand and place the palm of your right hand outwards. You may also place the crystal on your body or have it laying nearby during meditation. Visualize your intentions and let all energy and thought flow for 5 -10 minutes. Focus on your breathing. If you prefer guided meditation you can always look for a fitting video on YouTube for guided meditation or to follow pranayama (breathwork exercise). Focus on cleansing your chakra's. Place yourself in a comfortable position and start with your root chakra by visualizing the color red. Preferably by placing the right crystals for each chakra on each portal on your body to enhance your ritual. Envision your chakra's being small pools of water that you cleanse by brightening the color of each chakra. Never forget that you need to do a regular cleanse to keep your chakra's powerful. But next to your chakra's, keep your aura clean as well with help of this purifying video of [Sadghuru.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinFZ9VQOFw) Energy protection is building a sacred shield around your physical and ethereal body. This is not just about avoiding \"bad\" energy at all costs and seeking out only \"good\" energy. It's about shielding yourself from energetic depletion. Think of yourself as sphere of light. Close your eyes and with every breath you take, you breath more light into your sphere, making it bigger and more vibrant untill it becomes blinding for the eyes. When you feel like your being drained by your environment, build an additional black circle of protection around your light sphere. Protective crystal in your pockets, bra or when wearing them as jewelry may strengthen these layers of protection. Make sure to clean your environment frequently with a smudge of either white sage or Palo Santo, while opening all doors & windows. To crown your work place a protective crystal in every corner of your home to protect yourself from unwanted negative energy or to purify negative entities. One of the most underestimated healing baths is sleep. When we sleep our mind enters the Theta brain waves. This is where the actual magic happens. This is the state where the body self heals, but also the state of intuition and shamanism. When your physical body is in need of healing, the brain triggers a rush of hormones that promote tissue growth that repairs the blood vessels when you sleep. This process helps ease muscle soreness, rebuild damaged muscles, and encourage wounds to heal properly. Place a crystal with the your manifestation properties under your pillow or next to your bed to promote restful sleep. We recommend programming your subconscious mind 5 minutes before you go to sleep with help of this amazing sleep meditation of Dr. Wayne Dyer. Anxiety is a normal emotion. It's your brain's way of reacting to stress and alerting you of potential danger ahead. Everyone feels anxious now and then. But severe & regular anxiety is something entirely different. They're a group of mental illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear. Excessive anxiety can make you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or worsen your symptoms. Beating anxiety is choosing wholeness over perfection. To help manifest calmness and selflove, hold a calming, grouding or specific stress relief crystal in your hand , focus on your breathing. Repeat this mantra and visualize: \"Within me there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which i can retrieve at any time to be myself.\" To change your ritual you can use a guided Pranayama (breathwork meditation). And last but not least we would love to share this inspiring video with [Sadghuru.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTqGU31H2P8) Hope it helps, we believe in you gorgeous! ElectroSmog refers to all man-made electromagnetic radiation created and present in our surrounding environment. Electrosmog has become a major public health concern. If our goal is to create a healthy and safe living or work environment, then we cannot achieve that without preventive measures against Electrosmog. Place a protective environment crystal or Himalayan salt crystal between you and your mobile device or source of radiation. Now visualize all negative & unhealthy energy being absorbed and transmuted by this crystal. Make sure this particular crystal is cleansed regularly as well in order for it to remain its natural power. Communication brings people together, closer to each other. It is when we feel acknowledged and understood, heard and safe. We are talking about verbal, visual and energetic communication, the most sacred law to our connection. Good communication skills are essential to allow others and yourself to connect and bloom. In contrast, poor communication skills lead to frequent misunderstandings and frustration. To work on your communication skills is to treat yourself on a bigger dose of mental peace. Place a crystal with expressive properties in areas of your home where you would like to encourage communication, for example, an office area or even the bedroom. Complimentary you will heal and awaken your 5th chakra (Throat Chakra) by mediation and visualization of the color blue, guided by crystals empowering your throat chakra. Repeat mantra: \"I am aligned with my highest truth, and communicate this with love and honour. My words echo softly within the Universe.\" E voila the queen of communication has risen! Use your new moon & full moon rituals to enhance manifestation on for example; creativity, abundance, health, love and prosperity. Before every ritual you cleanse your spirit & body with smoke of white sage smudge or Palo Santo. Using the full moon to cleanse yourself of that what no longer serves you by writing down the things you want to cleanse yourself from. Burn these affirmations in a white candle during your full moon ritual. Enforce these affirmations with crystals that enhance your intentions. For example: I cleanse my body, mind and soul from all negative energy and blockages that no longer serve me and my higher self. As with the new moon you set your intentions for new energies and focus on the things you want to attract. Stare at the dark moon and magnetize your intentions. You write down where you want to focus your energy on for this coming period and pick your crystals accordingly. You may either burn these affirmations during the ritual or keep them in a book on a sacred altar to program your subconscious. For example: I call forth abundance and true happiness for me and my loved ones. A crystal grid to us is a direct line to your higher self, magnifying any intention you set into the Universe. Place crystals, herbs flower pedals and seeds in patterns and use combinations of crystals to amplify their strength. Lay them ou connecting with your deepest intuition, embracing the creative flow. Use the crystal grid to set intentions and manifestations for a certain goal and place the grid in a central point in your home for one month. The crystal placed in the center, will be the focus stone. Embraced by the first inner circle will be her way stones. (How we make the intention happen/strengths), Then the outer circle contains desire stones. Here you focus on your desires, on every little detail of your master intention. Our thoughts are electric and our feelings are magnetic. When you align both desire and thought for your intention, you are already a crystal grid master! Above all, enjoy & believe with "}
