Mao, MD, MSCE The COVID-19 coronavirus is causing dramatic increases in anxiety and stress around the world, disrupting daily life. Healthcare professionals, including oncology nurses, are confronting enormous challenges as they struggle to deliver optimal patient care. In addition to managing occupational stress-associated [depression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.00927.x), [compassion fatigue](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10615-007-0091-7), and [burnout](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0969733011398092), oncology nurses are overwhelmed by the sudden, unprecedented surge in workload or [new staffing assignments](https://www.ons.org/oncology-staff-assignments-covid-19). Compounding factors are the growing frustration over the inability to provide needed care to patients, fear of health consequences from the acute shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), and caring for their own families. All of these issues can severely deplete nurses' psychological reserve, but a self-care routine can help nurses manage stress and anxiety so they can continue to be effective in their roles as caregivers. What the Evidence Says Meditation, exercise, and tai chi are gentle, nonpharmacologic, mind-body options that share common goals of stress reduction, physical relaxation, psychological well-being, and improved vitality and coping. Research shows that they alleviate stress and anxiety in [oncology](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21397) and [nononcology populations](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02907/full). Preliminary data support the therapies' effect in improving psychological outcomes in [physicians](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/184621) and [healthcare providers](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2697210).
