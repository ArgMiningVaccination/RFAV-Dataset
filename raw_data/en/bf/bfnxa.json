What is Naturopathic Medicine? Do No Harm (Primum Non-Nocere) Naturopathic medicine uses informed techniques and therapies that provide the patient with the least harmful and most [functional approaches](https://karenthrelkelnd.com/blog/functional-medicine/) to treat the body and restore the patient's ability to maintain optimal health. Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) Naturopathic medicine acknowledges that the body can heal itself based on its own building blocks. Each cell in the body is a living unit, which is continually working to regenerate and repair itself. Our bodies have an amazing capacity to heal. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) Doctor as a Teacher (Docere) The naturopathic physician not only wants to diagnose a patient's underlying cause of disease but also educate them about their illness and prevention ideas they should adapt to their daily lives. They empower their patients with a wealth of knowledge and transform their perception of health care.

The therapeutic order is a set of guidelines that naturopathic physicians use when deciding their patients' treatment plans. The order is divided into seven stages, with each stage providing the doctor with a different way to solve the patient's problem and reduce their symptoms while using the least amount of invasive intervention possible. Seven Stages of the Therapeutic Order Remove Health Obstacles The first stage focuses on removing anything that causes the patient any health disturbance. This can often involve addressing some common culprits (poor diet, digestive problems, excessive stress, toxic exposures, trauma, [inadequate sleep](https://karenthrelkelnd.com/blog/five-solutions-five-causes-insomnia/), etc.) and devising a plan to get rid of them.
