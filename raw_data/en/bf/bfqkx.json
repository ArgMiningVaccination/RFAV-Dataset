He joined the institute in 2018 as an ARC Postdoctoral Research Fellow. Dr Bhuyan's research focuses on the development of novel antimicrobial and anticancer agents from natural sources and deciphering their molecular mechanisms of action. His current research is aimed at understanding the complex synergistic interactions among various phytochemicals and standard drugs on specific biological targets and how this can be utilised as therapeutic strategies against infectious/metabolic diseases and cancer. Dr Bhuyan is also interested in understanding the role of gut microbiota in the occurrence, treatment and prognosis of cancer and metabolic diseases to define gut-microbiota focused therapeutic strategies. He has a strong research background investigating the anticancer and antimicrobial properties of plant extracts and bioactive compounds. Dr Bhuyan's PhD research established the anticancer (pancreatic adenocarcinoma) and antimicrobial properties of phenolic compounds and antioxidants present in Australian Eucalyptus species and produced nine first-authored and four co-authored publications. His current research is supported by several government and industry grants including Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources and Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia. Before coming to Australia, Dr Bhuyan worked as a Senior Research Fellow in probiotic food development at the Assam Agricultural University on a National Agricultural Innovation Project funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Since the completion of his MSc in Applied Microbiology in 2010, he has pursued many academic and industry-funded research projects in food chemistry, microbiology and pharmacology in India and Australia. He has published several Q1 journal articles, invited book chapters with national and international collaborators, presented his research at different national and international conferences and appeared in television interviews and media coverage in India and Australia. He is also actively involved in supervising and mentoring PhD and Master's students, and promoting science communication and STEM education.
