Learn the facts about the COVID-19 vaccine from Loyola's experts. COVID-19 is a new or novel, coronavirus and is highly contagious. COVID-19 is transmitted person-to-person, with illnesses ranging from mild to severe. Person-to-person spread means being in close contact with an infected person or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. We are learning new information about this virus every day, including what is effective in stopping the spread and potential treatments. Older people, especially those with a history of underlying health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, seem to be at the greatest risk of complications if exposed to the coronavirus. Variants of COVID-19 are expected to occur, including the Omicron variant of COVID-19. It is important to stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines and booster vaccines to reduce your risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. These possible symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure*: This list does not include all possible symptoms an individual may experience. *According to the CDC Loyola is committed to using the best available clinical evidence to care for COVID-19 patients.
