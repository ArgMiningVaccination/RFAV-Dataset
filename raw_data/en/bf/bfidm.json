Once you spend some time with these magical little creatures you will understand! We are hobby breeders of healthy and beautiful crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus) and love to create enchanted natural habitats and bioactive vivariums that provide joy and soothe the spirit. We also have a growing selection of isopods, currently available are powder orange, orange dalmation, dairy cow, and zebras. Also available in the near future are powder blue, dwarf white, yellow zebra, gypsy gems, rubber ducky! The studio also has a small selection of potted plants ready for bioactive vivariums, they vary depending on availability. Pangea diet is out of stock currently. I do have sample size food bags to offer with a gecko purchase in the shop. For more information or to make an appointment to see or purchase a crested gecko contact us at 610-451-9577 or healingarts42@gmail.com. I get asked quite often if I have \"ready to move in\" enclosures available, and I do occasionally but the cost of enclosures has risen dramatically in the last few years making it harder for me to create affordable set-ups to re-sell. If I do not have any in the store I will happily tell you how to create an age appropriate enclosure for any gecko that you buy here. Younger crested geckos can live quite happily in plastic totes (crafted with ventilation) until they are big enough for larger more elaborate enclosures. My advice when buying a young gecko (under 15 grams) is to save your money for the more elaborate adult size enclosure (18x18x24 is my recommended enclosure size choice for an adult) and up size their habitat as they grow. Hefty makes a nice, sturdy, tall plastic tote that is almost perfect for my geckos under 15 grams and even a bit larger. Ventilation holes can easily be crafted into them and they hold the proper humidity well. They are tall enough to add branches, vines, feeding ledges, and the cute hanging coconuts that everybody loves! All crested geckos are 20% off through July! ***I currently have babies/juveniles available prices starting at $65 and up. Call the studio to set up a time to stop in to see or adopt a gecko (make sure to leave a message so I can call you back). Not all geckos are at the shop so calling ahead ensures I can bring in a few different kinds in your price range that may interest you! Discounts may be available for multiple geckos if over 5 purchased*** Available are harlequins, extreme harlequins, patterned dalmations in creams and yellows, and phantoms. So many holdbacks...I have so many really neat projects I'm working on and not quite ready to let go of yet. As they become available I will list here. Some of the kids currently available are: lavender and cream harlequins from Nymph x Chau (some with spots), dark with cream extreme harlequins, some with tiger markings from Citrine x Chong, extreme harlequins from Azure x Pan, yellow cream harlequin and possible brindle from Nala x Pan, and phantoms from Roxy x Sol and Mookie x Red Jasper. I do have some small females/males pricing at $150 and up. Our next show is 8/19/23- The Mid-Atlantic Reptile Expo is held at the Carlisle Expo Center, in Carlisle, PA Ball Pythons, custom painted snake racks, tee-shirts and artwork are available here through [Wicked Oak Pythons](https://www.morphmarket.com/stores/jangaul/) contact us for more information if you are interested. We are growing our audience, please show some love on facebook and instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/blessedcresteds/](https://www.instagram.com/blessedcresteds/) [https://www.facebook.com/blessedcresteds](https://www.facebook.com/blessedcresteds) Crested geckos, also known as eyelash geckos, were thought to be extinct until 1994 until some thriving populations were found on the islands of New Caledonia. Destruction of their natural habitat and predators were reducing the numbers of crested geckos in the wild but luckily crested geckos can thrive and be bred easily in captivity. Their magical endearing qualities and easy to meet requirements of care make them a favorite. Most tolerate being handled quite well do not bite. Crested geckos are primarily tree dwellers and are perfect for naturalistic vivariums as they fit right in to that environment. They come in so many different colors and patterns it will be hard to keep just one!

All purchases and deposits are final and non-refundable. We reserve the right to refuse sale of our geckos for any reason. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase. There is no sex guarantee unless stated they are proven. If making a purchase here at the shop, during the travel time home you must ensure the gecko does not get overheated or chilled. (Do not leave in a hot or cold car if running errands after purchase.) All sales are final. I will provide a care sheet and gladly answer any questions for caretaking but It is your responsibility to research the proper care of these animals and be ready to introduce them into the proper environment upon arrival. I am meticulous in my care of them and know that my geckos are completely healthy and eating well before selling. If for some reason a refund would need to be given it would be determined on a case by case basis and issued as store credit only. Caring for a crested gecko is a long commitment as these creatures can live well over 15 years but often things happen in life that are beyond our control. If you can no longer care for your gecko and can't find a proper caretaker I will re-home the gecko however there are no credits or refunds given in this scenario. Shipping Terms (Weather Permitting): Please read the following shipping terms, if you have any questions or concerns please let me know before making a purchase. By making a deposit or payment on an animal you are accepting these terms. Shipping prices have risen and fluctuate constantly, quoted prices are subject to change before final payment is made. Full payment is required to ship your animal. All sales and deposits are final and non-refundable. Only store credit will be given on a case by case basis if an animal is DOA and I must be notified within 30 minutes with photo proof. Shipping is done with Fed Ex overnight and I only ship from hub to hub. I will only ship when the temperatures are appropriate at both your and my areas (I will hold your paid in full animal free of charge till appropriate shipping weather) I currently ship on a Tuesday and Wednesday. Arrival time will be shown on the tracking information from FedEx, plan to be there when the hub opens or at the time of arrival stated. Unfortunately tail drops can occur during shipping and are not part of guarantee nor can I be held responsible for shipping delays or loss of package. You can browse some photos here of some enclosures I've created and our breeder geckos. I hope to add some holdback offspring pictures soon but I also post many of their pictures on Instagram and Facebook. There are some current breeders that are not pictured yet, when I list their babies I will add more photos. "}
