Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences' Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee, USU's professional schools, and the university's Complementary and Integrative Health Interest Group have all come together, along with the USU Wellness and Integrative Medicine Program, recognizing this important concept. Together, they sponsor activities that promote and incorporate wellness, health, and well-being not only for the caregiver, but the entire university community. |Acupuncture is used to relieve back pain (Image credit: Fort Campbell Public Affairs Office photo by Leejay Lockhart)| And what exactly is integrative health? USU's Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management explains that an \"integrative\" approach to care promotes an individual's needs by addressing all aspects of their well-being - biologically, psychologically, and socially - or as they refer to it, as a biopsychosocial approach, and then integrating various forms of care to address those needs, i.e. yoga, or acupuncture. |Wellness techniques empower soldiers. | (Image credit: U.S. Army photo by Sgt.

These activities aren't the kinds of things you would have seen at the university 10 years ago. People are becoming much more aware and interested now,\" said Scherr. USU continuously strives to help its entire community develop positive, healthy habits and lifestyles that will endure, offering diverse wellness activities and encouraging the entire community to participate. Some of the activities offered include: Midweek Midday Meditation Lunch & Learn Monthly Series Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Course Civilian Human Resources' Personal and Work Performance Enhancement Training Brown Bag Discussion Series Lean-In Circles In the future, Zumba classes and organized lunchtime walking will be offered to the USU community. For students who face a number of stressors, and can be prone to burnout, Scherr said that USU also offers a mindfulness-based stress reduction course, which can be scheduled as needed around their busy schedules. |USU's Bench to Bedside and Beyond (B3) battlefield acupuncture course teaches medical students to properly administer acupuncture by testing it out on their classmates and ear simulators.

It's difficult to learn how to simply take a breath and reboot,\" Scherr said. USU's wellness program is also providing formal courses and activities in integrative health and medicine for all students. Dr. Laura A. Taylor, professor and director of Clinical Education at the Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing (GSN), explained that the nursing faculty have also designed an innovative course, Integrated Medical Modalities, to introduce military nursing students to integrative medicine. \"Topics include battlefield auricular acupuncture, nutrition, mental and muscle relaxation, physical movement, and guided imagery,\" Taylor said. \"In addition, an annual GSN Health and Wellness Day offers sessions on yoga, meditation, nutrition, and stress management.\" |USU's Bench to Bedside and Beyond (B3) battlefield acupuncture course teaches medical students to properly administer acupuncture by testing it out on their classmates and ear simulators.
