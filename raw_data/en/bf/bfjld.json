This is the goal and approach of a discipline known as integrative medicine. Here at Shaver Chiropractic & Natural Medicine, our team can create a personalized treatment plan that helps you feel and function better in every aspect of your life. Understanding Integrated Medicine Integrated medicine, also known as functional medicine, differs from traditional medical strategies in some significant ways. The standard approach to modern medicine tends to focus on alleviating the outward or surface symptoms of a disease or injury. If one particular health issue seems to produce those symptoms, the doctor might focus on fixing that issue without looking at any underlying circumstances that might have brought it about. Integrated medicine views you as a whole person -- not just as an injury, illness, or symptom to be treated. This approach factors your physical, psychological, and emotional wellness into account, identifying the various triggers that might work together to undermine your health. Integrated medicine practitioners then address each of those trouble points by administering several complementary therapies as part of a holistic healing program. This strategy not only alleviates the symptoms of your health challenges; it also corrects the underlying factors that produced those symptoms, improving your overall health, and enabling you to preserve that newfound wellness. How Our Chiropractic Team Administers Integrative Medicine Techniques Chiropractic care naturally has a major role to play in integrative medicine. The adjustments performed by Dr. Shaver and Dr. Gullo ease joint pain and inflammation while also relieving nerve compression. This effect lets your internal communications system work more effectively, from your hormonal balances and organ functions to your balance and posture. Chiropractic treatment can improve your whole-body health, remove your pain, and ease the emotional stresses that accompanied that pain. When Dr. Shaver and Dr. Gullo evaluate your condition, they may also identify other forms of treatment that synergize beautifully with chiropractic care. You may benefit from massage therapy to treat soft tissue problems, physical therapy to help you optimize your mobility, and lifestyle recommendations that support a more functional, comfortable life.
