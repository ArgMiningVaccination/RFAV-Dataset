newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 1 Abstract Background Seasonal influenza is an infectious respiratory disease which circulates annually and is associated with a considerable health and economic burden globally. The most effective means of preventing seasonal influenza is through strain- specific vaccination. For many decades, only trivalent influenza vaccines (that include two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain) have been available. In recent years, quadrivalent (two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains) have been authorised and are increasingly available. Traditional influenza vaccines have limitations in terms of immune response and the substrate used in their manufacturing which can reduce overall effectiveness. Newer and enhanced influenza vaccines have been develo ped, both in trivalent and quadrivalent forms, in an attempt to counteract these limitations. Objective The objective of this systematic review i s to assess and synthesise the literature on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced ina ctivated seasonal influenza vaccines for the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza in individuals aged 18 years or older, namely: MF59\u00ae adjuvanted, cell -based, high -dose, and recombinant haemagglutinin (HA) influenza vaccines . Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library) and grey literature sources up to 7 February 2020. No restrictions were placed on date or language. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non -rando mised studies of interventions (NRSIs) were eligible for inclusion. Returned records were screened for relevance and the full -text of potentially relevant articles assessed, applying predefined eligibility criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted d ata, and pooling was considered where two or more studies reported an outcome. Study results were pooled using both fixed and random effects meta -analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies using standardised tools. Certainty of evidence for key outcomes was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Main results The collective search returned 28 846 records. Removal of duplicates and screening resulted in 868 full -texts being assessed for relevance with 110 studies bein g included. Of these 110 studies, 48 possessed results relevant to adjuvanted influenza vaccines, 36 to high -dose influenza vaccines, 19 to cell- based influenza vaccines, and 10 to recombinant HA influenza vaccines. The primary outcomes of interest to this review are presented below, with consideration towards the hierarchy of evidence whereby only the highest available level is presented. No studies were identified which compared any, or all, of these newer and enhanced vaccines to each other. No efficacy data were identified for adjuvanted influenza vaccines for any comparator (another vaccine, placebo or 'no vaccination'). In terms of relative vaccine effectiveness, there was no significant difference in vaccine effectiveness reported by included studies that compared adj uvanted trivalent vaccine with either non- adjuvanted trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines in adult or older adult (aged 65 years) populations. Adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines displayed a significant effect in preventing laboratory -confirmed influenz a in older adults (aged 65 years) when compared with no vaccination for any influenza subtype (vaccine effectiveness (VE) = 45%, 95% CI 23 to 61, five NRSIs across three influenza seasons, random effects model (REM), I2=63%, low -certainty evidence), influ enza A(H1N1) (VE=61%, 95% CI 44 to 73, four NRSIs across two influenza seasons, REM, I2=14.5%, low -certainty evidence) and influenza B (VE=29%, 95% CI 5 to 46, five NRSIs across three influenza seasons, REM, I2=0%, low -certainty evidence), not for infl 95% CI -25 to 36, across five influenza seasons, REM, I2=49%, very -low certainty evidence). Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 2 Pooled analyses of effectiveness data comparing adjuvanted with non -adjuvanted vaccines was restricted by limited study numbers and statistical and clinical heterogeneity. Compared with traditional trivalent influenza vaccines, adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines were associated with a greater number of combined local adverse events (risk ratio (RR)= 1.90, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.39, four RCTs, REM, I2=0%, moderate- certainty evidence), pain at site 1.53 to 2.67, 12 RCTs, certainty evidence), combined systemic reactions (RR=1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, five RCTs, REM, I2=8%, moderate- certainty evidence), myalgia (RR=1.71, to RCTs, REM, I2=31%, moderate- certainty evidence), fever (RR=1.97, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.61, nine RCTs, REM, I2=31%, low -certainty evidence) and chills (RR=1.70, 95% 1.20 RCTs, REM, I2=0%, mod erate-certainty evidence). High-dose trivalent influenza vaccination was shown to have higher relative vaccine efficacy in preventing influenza compared with standard- dose trivalent influenza vaccines in older adults aged 65 years and over (VE=24%, 95% CI 10 to 37, one RCT, moderate -certainty evidence). One NRSI demonstrated significant effect for high -dose trivalent vaccine against influenza B (VE=89%, 95% CI 47 to 100), but not for influenza A(H3N2) (VE=22%, 95% CI -82 to 66) when compared with no vaccin ation in older adults (aged 65 years). Based on pooled estimates, high dose trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were associated with significantly higher rates of a range of local and systemic adverse events compared with their standard dose trivalent and quadrivalent equivalents. Specifically, they were associated with significantly higher rates of combined local reactions (RR=1.40, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.64, three RCTs, FEM, I 2=25%, low -certainty evidence), pain at injection site (RR=1.56, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.93, seven RCTs, REM, I2=57%, moderate- certainty evidence), swelling -certainty evidence), headache (RR=1.35, CI 1. 02 to 1.77, REM, I2=0%, seven RCTs, moderate -certainty evidence), chills (RR=1.73, 95% to 2.81, REM, four RCTs, low -certainty evidence), and malaise 1.08 1.51, certainty evidence) . No rela tive efficacy data were identified for the direct comparison of cell -based vaccines compared with traditional vaccines. Efficacy data were available comparing cell -based trivalent influenza vaccines with placebo in adults (aged 18 -49 years), against any in fluenza (VE=70%, 95% CI 68%, two RCTs, FEM I2=0%, moderate -certainty evidence). Limited and heterogeneous data were presented for effectiveness when compared with no vaccination. One NRSI co mpared cell -based trivalent and quadrivalent vaccination with traditional trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines which highlighted no significant difference in effect for any influenza or specific strains in older adults. The safety profile of cell -based trivalent vaccines was comparable to traditional trivalent influenza vaccines with higher rates of ecchymosis in cell -based vaccine recipients being the only significant difference (RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.56, three RCTs, FEM, I2=47%, low -certainty evidence). One study found that the quadrivalent recombinant HA influenza vaccine had higher relative vaccine efficacy in preventing influenza compared with traditional quadrivalent influenza vaccination in adults aged 50 years (VE=30%, 95% CI 10 to 47, one RCT, moderate- certainty evidence). Another study found that the trivalent recombinant HA vaccine had higher efficacy compared with placebo (VE=45%, 95% CI 19 to 63, one RCT) in adults aged 18 -55 years. No effectiveness data were identified for comparison with no vaccination or traditional influenza vaccines. Pooled estimates indicate that, with the exception of a higher rate of chills (RR=1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72, three RCTs, FEM, I2=46%, low -certainty evidence), the safety profile of the recombinant H A trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines was comparable to that of their traditional trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine equivalents. Conclusions The evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of newer and enhanced influenza vaccines is limite d at present. Based on reviewed evidence, it is probable that these vaccines provide greater protection than no vaccination. Evidence regarding the comparability of these vaccines with traditional seasonal influenza vaccines is uncertain due to a dearth of available literature, clinical and statistical heterogeneity. A large body of evidence was presented for the safety of these influenza vaccines, with the safety profiles found to be largely in keeping with that expected when considering their individual c ompositions. Reporting within individual studies limited the data coverage of this review. Recommendations are provided to enhance research conduct and reporting regarding these newer and enhanced influenza vaccines which are anticipated to improve data co verage overall. A large number of potentially relevant studies were identified as ongoing, highlighting a need for this review to be updated in the near future.

Introduction Seasonal influenza is an infectious respirat ory disease which circulates in annual epidemics worldwide, with the period of circulation typically occurring from November to April in the Northern hemisphere and from June to October in the Southern hemisphere [1]. Seasonal influenza is largely transmit ted between humans through droplet transmission, indirect contact and aerosol transmission [2]. Influenza viruses are from the Orthomyxoviridae family of ribonucleic acid viruses and are classified as four specific types: A, B, C and D. Influenza A, B and C are known to cause human infection, with D predominantly found in cattle [3,4]. Influenza C is responsible for very few human infections and hence influenza A and influenza B provide the primary focus when discussing seasonal influenza [1,3]. Influenza A is further categorised into subtypes based on the presence of specific haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase proteins on the surface of the virus, with A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) commonly circulating [3]. Influenza B comprises two specific lineages, Victoria an d Yamagata. Relative to influenza A, it typically exhibits a much lower mutation rate and generally results in a lower severity of infection [1,3]. In adults, influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B generally co -circulate each year in varying proportions depending on the season [1]. The highest burden of influenza in adults has tended to be in seasons with a predominance of influenza A(H3N2) circulation [5]. Annual estimates of influenza infection are inconsistent due to variation in the circulating virus strains. However, one study from England provides estimates across five influenza seasons with 18% of all unvaccinated individuals being infected based on serological findings, and the majority of these cases being asymptomatic [6]. The clinic al presentation of symptomatic infection with seasonal influenza is characterised by pyrexia, myalgia, malaise, cough and other respiratory symptoms [5]. The s everity of such symptoms can range from mild to severe, with otherwise healthy individuals typica lly recovering in relatively short timeframes, whereas higher morbidity and mortality is predominantly seen in those deemed to be higher risk groups, such as those with chronic diseases, immunosuppressive conditions, and the elderly [7]. The scale of the effect of seasonal influenza is dependent on a number of factors including the predominantly circulating strains, vaccination coverage and the mutation of the virus relative to previous seasons [5]. Collectively, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimat es that annual seasonal influenza epidemics result in three to five million severe cases and 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths worldwide [7]. All-cause influenza -attributable mortality was estimated to be 25.4 (95% CI 25.0 to 25.8) per 100 000 populati on and 118.2 (95%CI 116.4 to 119.9) per 100 000 for adults aged 65 in the 2017- 2018 influenza season in Europe [8]. Influenza is reported to have the highest burden of all infectious diseases in Europe in terms of disease- adjusted life years (DALYs), with 81.1 DALYs per population (95% UI 76.9 to 86.5) representing 30% of the total burden of all included diseases [9]. The economic burden of seasonal influenza is substantial with regard to both direct healthcare costs and indirect societal costs, ste mming largely from the associated morbidity and mortality in more severe cases combined with estimated productivity losses for less severe infections [1]. The most effective means to prevent influenza infection is through strain- specific vaccination [7]. To facilitate strain -specific vaccination, WHO issues recommendations to vaccine manufacturers regarding vaccine strain inclusion. These recommendations are based on predictions of the likely circulating strains, which have been informed by analysis and in terpretation of global surveillance data [7, 10] . Recommendations are issued for the composition of both trivalent (two A strains and one B strain) and quadrivalent (two A strains and two B strains) vaccines and include specific viral subtyping for influenza A [7, 11] . However, due to antigenic drift, whereby genetic changes arise from ongoing evolution of the virus, antigenic mismatch between the virus strains contained in the vaccine and those in circulation in the seasonal epidemic can occur . Accurate pr edictive matching of vaccine strains to those that circulate is a key determinant of vaccine effectiveness [7, 10, 11] . Seasons in which a mismatch occur are typically associated with higher overall morbidity and mortality, such as the 2014 -2015 influenza season [10, 12] . Beyond strain -specific matching, additional considerations for vaccine effectiveness are: the generation of a sufficient immune response the substrate used during vaccine production. The immune response to traditional influenza vaccines can be suboptimal [11]. Newer and enhanced influenza vaccines have been developed in an attempt to improve vaccine effectiveness, particularly in the elderly for whom there is evidence of immunosenescence. Strategies to enhance the immune response include the use of adjuvants and higher doses of HA per vaccine strain. The addition of an adjuvant, such as the oil -in-water emulsion MF59\u00ae, aims to increase immunogenicity, resulting in comparatively higher levels of HA inhibition antibodies and an enhanced immu nological response [11]. High -dose influenza vaccines contain a fourfold increase of HA per strain, that is, 60g of HA per strain instead of 15g of HA typically included in standard dose vaccines [13]. As with the MF59\u00ae adjuvant, the increase in HA dose is intended to induce a larger overall immune response, thereby improving vaccine effectiveness [14]. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 7 In terms of the substrate utilised for influenza vaccine production, traditional injectable influenza vaccines are typically manufactured through egg -derived processes, with virus propagation in embryonated hen eggs and subsequent recovery and inactivation in whole, split or subunit forms [10, 11] . Mutations to HA proteins during vaccine production can occur with the use of egg substrates which can reduc e overall vaccine effectiveness [10]. Vaccines manufactured through new substrates have been created and include the use of mammalian cell -culture and recombinant HA proteins produced in insect cells using baculovirus- expression [5, 10] . These new processes remove the possibility of strain mutation associated with egg -based propagation [5, 10] . Such substrates may offer further benefits, such as higher production speed for greater overall yield [10], and negate the potential risk to those individuals with sev ere ovalbumin allergies [15, 16] . There is a need to assess the clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of such newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines, to inform decision -making regarding future vaccination strategies. 1.1 Objective The objective of this report is to review, assess and synthesise the literature on newer and enhanced inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines for the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza in individuals aged 18 years or older. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 8 2. Methodology The proposed met hodology for this systematic review was agreed upon with the EU/EEA National Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) collaboration working group and subsequently registered on PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020156800 ). This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) criteria [17]. 2.1 Research questions This systemati c review aimed to answer the following research questions: What is the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trivalent (aIIV3) and quadrivalent (aIIV4) egg- based MF59\u00ae adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine by influenza type, subtype (clade if available), age and risk group? What is the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trivalent (HD -IIV3) and quadrivalent (HD -IIV4) egg- based high-dose seasonal influenza vaccine by influenza type, subtype (clade if available), age and risk group? What is the efficacy, e ffectiveness and safety of trivalent (ccIIV3) and quadrivalent (ccIIV4) cell -based seasonal influenza vaccine by influenza type, subtype (clade if available), age and risk group? What is the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trivalent (RIV3) and quadri valent (RIV4) recombinant HA seasonal influenza vaccine by influenza type, subtype (clade if available), age and risk group? What is the relative efficacy/effectiveness between respective newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines when compared to stan dard seasonal influenza vaccines? What is the duration of protection within- season of the four newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines against any type of influenza and by subtype (clade if available)? 2.2 Eligibility criteria The population, interv ention, comparison, outcomes and study design (PICOS) criteria for inclusion of studies in this systematic review are provided in Table 2.1. No restrictions were placed on language or date of publication. Table 2. 1 PICOS criteria f or review questions Population Subjects aged 18 years irrespective of health status or setting Intervention One of the following newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines: MF59\u00ae aIIV3 ccIIV4 RIV3 or RIV 4 Comparator One of the following comparators^: Any seasonal influenza vaccine Placebo No vaccination Other type of vaccine Outcomes Efficacy or effectiveness - main outcomes Laboratory -confirmed influenza** Influenza- Influenza- associated pneumonia or lower respiratory tract disease* Efficacy or effectiveness - additional outcomes Influenza- like illness (symptoms of influenza only) by international case definitions Any International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) - 9 or - 10 coded respiratory disease or cardiovascular mortality Exacerbation of primary disease where there was pre- existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease Safety - main outcomes Systemic adverse events Local adverse events Safety - additional outcomes in pregnant women Spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, preterm birth (less than 37 weeks), pre- eclampsia and eclampsia Congenital mal formations (minor and major), neonatal death. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 9 Study design The following study designs were deemed relevant^: Randomised controlled trials Non-randomised controlled trials Quasi -experimental studies Prospective and retrospective cohort studies Case control studies Analytical cross sectional studies ^study designs which did not include comparators were included for safety outcomes *laboratory -confirmed by PCR, virus culture or antigen detection **symptoms of influenza with a positive laboratory diagnosis by PCR, virus culture or antigen detection . 2.2.1 Exclusion criteria The following study and vaccine types were excluded: Animal studies Case studies Immunogenicity studies Studies conducted during pandemic periods Pandemic vaccines Pre-pandemic vac cines Zoonotic vaccines. High-dose intradermal influenza vaccines were excluded, unless they were compared with an intramuscular enhanced influenza vaccine of interest to this review. This decision reflects the position that no high -dose intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine is licensed and available for use for the 2019/2020 season in the EU/EEA. However, such vaccines may be relevant in future iterations of this review should they be authorised and available for use [15]. 2.3 Search strategy Electroni c searches were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and The Cochrane Library. The search terms and detailed search strategy for each database are provided in Appendix 1. Searches were originally conducted on the 26 September 2019, with the searches updated on the 7 February 2020 prior to analyses. The reference lists of included studies were further examined and a forward searching methodology used to identify any other potentially relevant studi es. A search of grey literature sources (Appendix 2) was conducted in an attempt to source any unpublished or ongoing studies which may be relevant to future iterations of this systematic review. 2.4 Data collection and analysis 2.4.1 Selection of eligib le studies All citations identified from the collective searches were exported to EndNote\u00ae (Version X8) for reference management, where duplicates were identified and removed. Using Covidence\u00ae, three reviewers independently reviewed the titles and availabl e summaries of the remaining citations to identify those which warranted full -text review. The full texts were obtained and independently evaluated by two reviewers applying the defined eligibility criteria outlined in Table 2.1. Where disagreements occurr ed, discussions were held to reach consensus and where necessary, a third reviewer was involved. Citations excluded during the full -text review stage were documented, alongside the reasoning for their exclusion and included in a study flow diagram. 2.4.2 Data extraction and management Data extraction was conducted in Microsoft Excel. A data extraction form was developed and piloted by the reviewers, with necessary modifications made. Two reviewers then independently extracted data using the agreed data extr action form which was compared upon completion. Where disagreements occurred, discussions were held to reach consensus and where necessary, a third reviewer was involved. Extracted information included the following: Author, year, country, location and set ting Participants' characteristics (age, sex, co -morbid conditions) Type of vaccine Type of comparator Method of vaccination status establishment Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 10 Diagnostic or confirmatory method for outcomes of interest Influenza season and circulating influenza virus strains (and clades where available) The degree of matching of circulating influenza strains to vaccine -strains Reported outcomes and results. Where additional data were required, authors were contacted by email to request this information. For safety outcomes, data relating to the influenza season, vaccine strains and circulating strains were not deemed to be relevant and therefore were not extracted. 2.4.3 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two reviewers independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias, using validated critical appraisal tools. Where disagreements occurred, discussions were held to reach consensus and where necessary, a third reviewer was involved. For the assessment of risk of bias in randomised controlled tri als (RCTs), the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used [18]. Certain domains within the risk of bias tool were designated as key domains to enable a summary assessment of risk of bias within and between studies [19]. For efficacy studies, the designated key domains were; funding sources (other bias), random sequence generation, and incomplete outcome data. For safety studies, the designated key domains were; funding sources (other bias), blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, a nd incomplete outcome data. Risk of bias graphs were generated using the Cochrane Review Manager software (Version 5.3). Non-randomised studies of interventions were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non -randomised Studies -of Interventio ns (ROBINS -I) tool [20]. The tool was piloted by the reviewers for each study type included within this review with specifications and alterations made as required. Results were presented in tabular form , with the agreed consensus of risk of bias for each of the seven included domains and the overall risk of bias for each study denoted by the highest risk of bias score in any singular domain, as per the ROBINS -I methodology [20]. Where adjusted and unadjusted estimates were extracted from a study the risk o f bias was assessed for each outcome. Studies which did not possess a comparator were not assessed for risk of bias as no suitable tool was identified. 2.4.4 Measures of treatment effect For test -negative design [case- control] studies, the outcome was defined as vaccine effectiveness which was uniformly defined as (1 - Odds Ratio)*100%, where a value of 100% indicates prevention of all cases of influenza and 0% indicates prevention of no cases of influenza. The odds ratio was the odds of being vaccinated among cases (laboratory -confirmed influenza) divided by the odds of being vaccinated among controls. For cohort studies, the outcome was also defined as vaccine effectiveness. However, rather than using an odds ratio, the studies used either the risk rat io, incidence risk ratio, or hazard ratio. For both test -negative design case- control and cohort studies, the vaccine effectiveness was, in almost all cases, adjusted for a number of patient characteristics. The choice of covariates was not uniform across studies, although age and sex were almost uniformly included. Some studies only included covariates that demonstrated some level of association with outcomes in a univariate analysis. Where studies reported both unadjusted and adjusted vaccine effectiveness, the adjusted figure was used in the results as it was considered the less biased estimate of treatment effect. For safety studies, numbers of events were extracted and the risk ratio was used as the preferred measure of treatment effect. 2.4.5 Data synt hesis Where two or more studies reported an outcome, pooling was considered. Study results were pooled using both fixed and random effects meta -analysis. Fixed effect meta -analysis was conducted using the Mantel -Haenszel method. Random effects meta -analys is was conducted using the Sidik -Jonkman estimator combined with the Hartung and Knapp adjustment [21, 22] . Given the differences in studies, the preference was to use a random effects analysis. However, the estimate of between study variance is considered to be unreliable when there are few studies available for pooling [23, 24] . As such, the fixed effect estimate is used when only two or three studies are available for pooling. For vaccine effectiveness, pooling was only carried out for studies with match ing intervention and comparator groups. For example, studies of adjuvanted vaccines with a comparator of IIV3 were not combined with studies where the comparator was a mix of IIV3 and IIV4. The specific lineage of influenza B was not consistently and clearly reported across studies. Therefore, consistent with similar reviews [25, 26] , data were pooled across lineage to provide a summary estimate of effect. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 11 As outcomes for the test -negative design and cohort studies were generally reported as adjusted vacci ne effectiveness, it was not possible to use the two by two table for pooling. As such, pooling was on the basis of the log odds ratio and variance, with the exponential of the pooled result re -expressed as vaccine effectiveness. 2.4.6 Dealing with missing data Where issues with missing data were encountered, the study authors were contacted. No imputation of missing data was used. 2.4.7 Assessment of heterogeneity Heterogeneity across studies could arise for a variety of reasons, most typically because of clinical diversity, differences in study design and risk of bias. Consideration was given to study characteristics such as patient population and influenza season when investigating potential clinical heterogeneity. In this review, potential statistical heterogeneity was assessed on the basis of the I 2 statistic, with an I2 of between 30% and 60% interpreted as moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% as substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity, in line with the Cochrane methodology [19]. The I2 value was interpreted based on the magnitude and direction of effects, and on the strength of evidence for heterogeneity based on the chi-squared statistic. 2.4.8 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Where multiple studies were available for a given outcome and there was evidence of heterogeneity, consideration was given to subgroup analysis and meta -regression to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Given the small numbers of studies available for most comparisons, th ere was limited power to explore sources of heterogeneity and a risk of identifying spurious associations. Subgroup analysis was considered where studies could be meaningfully grouped based on consistently provided data. Meta -regression was only considered if there were ten or more studies available reporting a given outcome. 2.5 GRADE and 'summary of findings' table The certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest within this review was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develo pment, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology [27]. Primary outcomes are presented separately for each of the newer and enhanced influenza vaccines within this review (see main summary of findings tables). For each vaccine type of interest, the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) were interpreted by two reviewers to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. New guidance regarding the assessment of non -randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) was incorporated, whereby these types of studies are not penalised for their design and begin the assessment as a high certainty of evidence like their RCT counterparts [28]. Given the nature of the uniform variable of vac cine effectiveness for influenza and influenza -related outcomes within NRSIs, results are presented without raw counts. As a broad range of safety outcomes were assessed by the included studies, a number were chosen which were thought to best reflect this outcome as a whole and which were relatively consistent across the vaccines of interest within this review: combined local reactions, pain, combined systemic reactions, and fever. For completeness, where sufficient data were presented for additional outcom es the certainty of evidence was assessed and presented as supplementary material within the appendices of this report (Appendix 9.1 to 9.4). Summary of findings tables were generated using the GRADEpro \u00ae software. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 12 3. Results As shown in the PRISMA flow diagram in Figure 3.1, the collective searches up until 7 February 2020 returned 26 844 records, with two further records being identified from additional sources. The removal of duplicates resulted in 19 822 records being screened for relevance, with 868 meri ting full- text review. Of these records, 758 were subsequently excluded, based on the predefined eligibility criteria. A list of excluded studies and detailed overview of the reasons for exclusion is provided in Appendix 3. This resulted in 110 studies bei ng included in this systematic review [29-139]. Of these 110 studies, 48 possessed results relevant to adjuvanted influenza vaccines, 19 to cell -based influenza vaccines, 36 to high -dose influenza vaccines, and 10 to recombinant HA influenza vaccines. For the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed influenza, five efficacy RCTs and 15 test -negative case -control designs were included. In terms of additional influenza -related outcomes which were not laboratory -confirmed, data were presented by four case- control studies and 14 cohort studies. Sixty -one RCTs presented results relating to the safety of the vaccines of interest to this review, with further data from five cohort studies and ten single -arm studies. These results are presented in terms of the effica cy, effectiveness and safety of each of the four influenza vaccine types of interest to this review. Efficacy/effectiveness data by influenza clade were not identified. Twenty studies were identified which were classified as ongoing or completed without pu blished results. The titles, status and identifiers for these studies are provided in Appendix 4.

A minority of studies reported only unadjusted effectiveness. The difference between adjusted and unadjusted estimates can be substantial ( Figure 3.2), and is not clearly influenced by the sample size of the study (Figure 3.3). While unadjusted effectiveness was used where adjusted was not reported, there is clearly a risk of bias associated with the unadjusted estimate.

Seventeen were case- control studies [34, 35, 68, 70, 85, 86, 97, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112- 114, 123, 132, 133] comprising 15 unique dataset s, and five were cohort studies [ 36, 76, 78, 94, 110] . 3.2.2.1 Effectiveness against laboratory -confirmed influenza Eleven studies provided data relevant to the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed influenza [34, 35, 70, 85, 97, 104, 105, 113, 114, 132, 133]. All were related to aIIV3 vaccines and were of test -negative case- control design in older adult populati ons (aged 65 years), with the exception of one study which also presented data for adults over the age of 18 years [105] . Table 3.1 outlines for each relevant comparison, the type of influenza, comparator, vaccine effectiveness, and degree of matching to circ ulating strains, as interpreted from the narrative within each individual study, subcategorised by the influenza season. 3.2.2.1.1 E ffectiveness against any influenza type/subtype Six studies presented data regarding the effectiveness of aIIV3 vaccines against any influenza type [ 34, 35, 97, 104, 105, 133]. In older adults (aged 65 years) across all influenza seasons, aIIV3 was significantly more effective than no vaccination (VE=44.9%, 95% CI 22.7 to 60.8, REM, I2=62.7%, low -certainty evidence) (Figure 3.4). Crude estimates from a single study which presen ted data for an adult population (aged 18 years) did not show a significant difference between aIIV3 and no vaccination [105] . As summarised in Table 3.1 , there was no significant difference in vaccine effectiveness reported by included studies which compared aIIV3 with IIV3 or IIV4 in adult or older adult populations. Figure 3.4 Vaccine effectiveness of aIIV3 versus no vaccination against any influenza, adults aged 65 years and older Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 16 3.2.2.1.2 Effectiveness against Influenza A(H1N1) Four studies present ed data regarding the effectiveness of aIIV3 against influenza A(H1N1) [ 34, 85, 97, 104]. As shown in Figure 3.5, aIIV3 was significantly more effective than no vaccination in preventing influenza A(H1N1) (VE=61.2% , 95% CI evidence). As summarised in Table 3.1 , there was no significant difference reported by included studies which compared aIIV3 with IIV3 or IIV4 in terms of vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1). Figure 3.5 Vaccine effectiveness of aIIV3 versus no vaccina tion against Influenza A(H1N1), adults aged 65 years and older 3.2.2.1.3 Effectiveness against Influenza A(H3N2) Seven studies presented data regarding the effectiveness of aIIV3 against influenza A(H3N2) [70, 85, 97, 104, 113, 114, 132]. As shown in Figure 3.6, there was no significant difference found between aIIV3 and no vaccination (VE=10.6%, 95% CI -24.5 to 35.7, REM, I 2=48.5%, very low -certainty evi dence) across all influenza seasons. However, as highlighted in Table 3.1, there was considerable heterogeneity in terms of the matching of vaccine strains to circulating strains across the influenza seasons included in the analyses. As presented in Table 3.1, four studies compared aIIV3 with IIV3 or IIV4, with three showing no significant difference between these comparisons for effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2). Figure 3.6 Vaccine effectiveness of aIIV3 versus no vaccination ag ainst Influenza A(H3N 2), adults aged 65 years and older TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 17 3.2.2.1.4 Effectiveness against Influenza B Five studies investigated the effectiveness of aIIV3 against influenza B [34, 85, 97, 114, 132] . As shown in Figure 3.7, across all influenza seasons there was significant effect in favour of aIIV3 compared with no vaccination (VE=28.5%, 95% CI 5.4 to 46.0, REM, I2=0%, low -certainty evidence). Two studies compared aIIV3 to IIV3 with conflicting results shown and both studies providing crude estimates (Table 3.1). Figure 3.7 Vaccine effectiveness of aIIV3 versus no vaccination against Influenza B, adults aged 65 years and older 3.2.3 Additional outcomes As presented in Table 3.2, nine studies presented data related to additional outc omes relevant to this review; influenza -related hospitali sation, pneumonia - related hospitalisation, influenza - or pneumonia - related hospitalisation, influenza -related hospital encounters, influenza -like illness and influenza -related office visits [ 36, 68, 76, 78, 94, 108- 110, 123]. Of these, four were case- control studies, [68, 108, 109, 123 ] five were cohort studies, [36, 68, 76, 78, 110] and all investigated aIIV3 in older (aged 65 years) adult populations. 3.2.3.1 Influenza -related hospitalisation Three studies presented data related to the effectiveness of aIIV3 in preventing inf luenza -related hospitalisations [36, 78, 110]. One study found aIIV3 to be significantly more effective than no vaccination across three influenza seasons (Table 3.2) [36]. Two studies compared the effectiveness of aIIV3 to IIV3 for this outcome with no signific ant difference shown [78, 110] . 3.2.3.2 Influenza - or pneumonia -related hospitalisations Three studies presented data related to the effectiveness of aIIV3 in preventing influenza - or pneumonia - related hospitalisations compared with no vaccination (one study) or IIV3 (two studies) [68, 94, 123]. Regardless of the comparator, all included studies displayed a significant effect in favour of aIIV3 (Table 3.2) [ 68, 94, 108, 109, 123]. 3.2.3.3 Pneumonia -related hospitalisations Two studies presented data specifically concerning the effectiveness of aIIV3 in preventing pneumonia -related hospitalisations compared with no vaccination. As shown in Table 3.2 a significant effect in favour of aIIV3 was shown for both studies [108, 109] . 3.2.3.4 Influenza -related hospital encounters or office visits As shown in Table 3.2, one study presented data relating to the effectiveness of aIIV3 compared with IIV3 for the prevention of influenza -related hospital encounters or office visits with a small, but statistically significant difference highlighted for hospital encounters in favour of aIIV3 and no significant difference shown for office visits [78]. 3.2.3.5 Influenza -like illness As shown in Table 3.2, one study presented data that related to the effectiveness of aIIV3 for the prevention of influenza -like illness compared with no vaccination and with IIV3 for long -term care facility residents [76]. The results show a significant effect in favour of aIIV3 for both comparisons. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as they are crude estimates and the unvaccinated population represent a small portion of residents who refused vaccination.

Of these, 21 were RCTs [30, 48- 50, 59, 62, 64, 66, 67, 69, 87, 88, 93, 96, 99, 107, 115, 118, 119, 121, 134] and five possessed results from non -randomised studies. [89, 102, 103, 130, 135]. 3.2.4.1 Serious adverse Three non- randomised reported vaccine- related serious adverse events (SAEs), with all comparing aIIV3 w ith IIV3. Frey et al [66]. reported four SAEs; one in the aIIV3 group (bronchitis) and three in the IIV3 group (asthmatic crisis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (unspecified issue) and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome). One death attributable to respiratory depression secondary to Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in the aIIV3 group was considered possibly vaccine- related. Li et al [88]. reported a SAE of high fever in a recipient of an aIIV3. A third study reported a case of facial herpes zoster that was deemed by the investigator to be possibly vaccine- related [134] . Tsai et al. [130] reported no cases of narcolepsy in either vaccine group, and further found no increase in adverse sleep- related events in the aIIV3 recipients. Villa et al. [135] highlight no difference in the rate of hospitalisation for adverse events related to vaccination between aIIV3 and IIV3 groups. 3.2.4.2 Local reactions Twelve studies possessed sufficient data to enable a quantitative synthesis of local reactions, all of which compared aIIV3 with IIV3 in adult populations [ 48, 49, 59, 64, 66, 69, 88, 96, 115, 118, 119, 121] . Sub-group analyses are presented in Appendix 8.1. Pooled estimates for combined local reactions, pain, redness, swelling, and indu ration are presented in Figures 3.8 to 3.12. As shown, aIIV3 was associated with a greater number of combined local reactions (RR=1.90, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.39, four RCTs, REM, I2=0%, moderate -certainty evidence), with pain in particular being more frequently reported in recipients of aIIV3 vaccines (RR=2.02, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.67, 12 RCTs, I2=75%, certainty evidence). No significant difference between aIIV3 and IIV3 was noted for redness, swelling or induration based on the remaining pooled analyses (low -moderate certainty of evidence, see Appendix 9.1). As shown in Appendix 8.1, similar results were displayed for older adults within sub- group analyses. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 20 In terms of studies that were excluded from pooled analyses, in agreement with the results of th e pooled analyses, local injection site reactions were typically more frequent with adjuvanted compared with non -adjuv anted vaccines in older adults [ 48, 50, 89, 119, 134]. One study set out to assess if the inclusion of an additional B- strain in an aIIV4 influenced the safety profile of the vaccine compared with an aIIV3. Overall, no clinically relevant difference in the frequencies of individual local solicited adverse events was identified. Rates of local events were reported to be in line with expected for aIIV3 vaccination in a single -arm study by Otten et al. [102] report and a surveillance study conducted by Panatto et al. [103] .

Pooled estimates for the reported outcomes (combined systemic reactions, myalgia, fever, headache, shivers and chills, arthralgia, malaise, nausea and fatigue) are presented in Figures 3.13 to 3.21. The relative risk of combined systemic reactions (RR=1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, five RCTs, REM, I2=8%, moderate- certainty evidence), myalgia (RR=1.71, to RCTs REM, I2=31%, moderate- certainty evidence), fever (RR=1.97, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.61, nine RCTs, REM, I2=31%, low -certainty evidence) and chills (RR=1.70, 95% 1.20 2.40, seven RCTs, REM, I2=0%, moderate -certainty evidence (Appendix 9.1)) were significantly higher compared with aIIV3, however no significant difference were noted for arthralgia, malaise, headache, nausea or fatigue (low -moderate certainty evidence, see Appendix 9.1). As shown in Appendix 8.1, similar results were displayed for older adults within su b-group analyses. In terms of studies which were excluded from the pooled analyses, in general , the frequency of systemic adverse events was similar for recipients of adjuvan ted and non -adjuvanted vaccines [48, 50, 89, 119, 134] . Essink et al. [62] reported no clinically relevant difference in the frequency of systemic adverse events between aIIV4 and aIIV3 groups. Panatto et al. [103] highlighted chills and fatigue as most frequently experienced systemic adverse ev ents in a surveillance study of aIIV3 vaccine recipients. 3.2.4.4 Safety of adjuvanted influenza vaccines in at -risk populations Six studies included in this review were deemed to include at -risk populations including: a diagnosis of HIV, [59. 67] , and those receiving regular medical care [30]. For local reactions, only one study reports a significant difference between adjuvanted and non -adjuvanted influenza vaccines; in individuals who receive regular medical care, local reactions were more common in those receiving adjuvanted compared with non -adjuvanted vaccines [30] . For systemic reactions, there was no significant difference in rates between adjuvanted and non -adjuvanted vaccines f or individuals who receive regular medical care [30], institutionalised older adults [107] or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients [99]. Shivers and fever were more commonly reported among HIV-seropositive patients vaccinated with aIIV3 comp ared with IIV3 [59, 67] . Among heart -transplant recipients, there was no difference in the frequency of acute myocardial rejection or early side effects for recipients of adjuvanted vaccines compared with non -adjuvanted [93].

Fifteen (71.4%) of the included RCTs were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias due to lack of clarity in one or more of the key domains assessed, with the remaining six (28.6%) studies deemed to be at a high risk of bias due to a high risk of bias in one or more of the key domains. Of note, the influence of industry funding, as captured under the doma in of other bias, resulted in the majority of studies being deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. The risk of bias of NRSIs providing data on the effectiveness and safety of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines is summarised in Table 3.3. Of 14 test -negative design case- control studies investigating the prevention of influenza, four (28.6%) were assessed to be at a low risk of bias, four (28.6%) at moderate risk and six (42.8%) at a high risk of bias. As shown, areas of poor reporting included ad equate control of confounding variables and selection bias. Of note, a number of studies provided adjusted and unadjusted outcomes depending on the comparator investigated and have been assessed separately in these instances. Four (44.4%) NRSIs investigati ng additional outcomes were deemed to be at a low risk of bias, one (11.1%) at a moderate risk, three (33.3%) at a serious risk and, one (11.1%) at a critical risk of bias. Areas of poor reporting included confounding variables, selection bias and missing data. Two studies presented data relating to safety with both deemed to be at a serious risk of bias.

Of these studies, two related to efficacy [53, 71] (with two additional analysis papers of Diaz Granados et al. contributing to overall results) [52, 55] , nine related to effectiveness [41, 78, 79, 92, 111, 120, 137- 140] and 23 related to safety (with additional safety data from the efficac y study by DiazGran ados et al.) [ 29, 38, 43, 45- 48, 53, 54, 56, 63, 73, 80- 83, 95, 98, 100, 101, 106, 117, 124, 131]. The characteristics of studies relating to efficacy or effectiveness of high - dose influenza vaccines are provided i n Appendix 5.2. The vaccine and circulating strains' characteristics associated with these studies are provided in Appendix 6.2. The characteristics of studies relating to the safety of high -dose influenza vaccines are provided in Appendix 7.2. 3.3.1 Efficacy - high-dose influenza vaccines One study met the eligibility criteria for this systematic review which investigated the efficacy of high -dose influenza vaccines [53], examining the relative efficacy of HD -IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3 in older adults (a ged 65 years) for laboratory -confirmed influenza, culture -confirmed influenza, and respiratory illness across protocol - defined influenza -like illness and modified CDC -defined influenza -like illness for all strains and vaccine specific strains. This paper was associated with two additional analyses papers [52, 55] . The authors reported vaccine efficacy against influenza -like illness and respiratory illness based on both laboratory - and culture -confirmed diagnosis. The high -dose vaccine had higher efficacy r elative to standard -dose vaccine for laboratory -confirmed protocol -defined -like illness (VE=24.2%, 95% CI 9.7 to 36.5, moderate- certainty evidence), but not for a modified CDC -defined influenza -like illness (VE=20.6%, 95% CI - 4.6 to 39.9). The hi gh-dose vaccine had higher efficacy against respiratory illness (VE=18.3%, 95% CI 5.0 to 29.8). There was limited evidence regarding efficacy in relation to influenza subtypes due to the small number of cases other than influenza A(H3N2). High-dose vaccina tion further associated with reduced all -cause hospitalisation (VE=6.9%, 95% CI 0.5 to 12.8), serious cardio -respiratory events (VE=17.7%, 95% CI 6.6 to 27.4), and pneumonia events (VE=39.8%, 95% CI 19.3 to 55.1). There was no statistically significant effect on asthma/ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD )/bronchial events, influenza events, or other respiratory events. The second study identified reported data for an additional outcome (not laboratory -confirmed) [71]. The study investigated th e relative efficacy of HD -IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3 in ol der adults (aged 65 years) for the prevention of respiratory -related hospital admissions. The primary outcome was hospital admissions related to pulmonary and influenza -like conditions on the basis of ICD -9 coded Medicare claims. The authors reported high er vaccine efficacy for HD -IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3 against respiratory -related hospital admissions (VE=12.7%, 95% CI 1.8 to 22.4%) and pneumonia -related hospital admissions (VE=20.9%, 95% CI 4.7 to 73.3%), based on a sample of 38 225 nursing home residents who had 'fee -for-service' Medicare data available. In intention -to-treat analyses (that included nursing home residents without 'fee- for-service' data), a reduction in all -cause hospitalisations was (VE=6.7%, 95% CI 1.5 to 11.6%). 3.3.2 Effect iveness - high-dose influenza vaccines Nine studies contained results relevant to the effectiveness of high- dose influenza vaccines [ 41, 78, 79, 92, 111, 120, 137- 139]. Of these, one was a test -negative case- control study [139] and eight were cohort studies [ 41, 78, 79, 92, 111, 120, 137, 138]. Only one study presented data relevant to the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza for high- dose influenza vaccines [139] . This study compared HD -IIV3 with no vaccination in older adults for the 2014 -2015 season and reported a vaccine effectiveness of 0.22 (95% CI - 0.82 to 0.66) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00) for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B, respectively. The authors no te a probable mismatch with the influenza A(H3N2) strain in circulation. 3.3.3 Additional outcomes Eight studies presented data related to additional outcomes relevant to this review; influenza -related hospitalisation, influenza - or pneumonia -related hospitalisation, influenza hospital encounters, influenza office visits and influenza -like illness (Table 3.4) [ 41, 77, 78, 92, 111, 120, 137, 138]. All of these studies were cohort design and compared HD -IIV3 with SD-IIV3 in older adult populations. 3.3.3.1 Influenza -related hospitalisations Two studies presented data for the prev ention of influenza -related hospitalisations across six influenza [78, 92]. As shown in Figure 3.24 , there was a significant differ ence in effect in favour of HD- IIV3 for this outcome across all influenza seasons (VE=11.8%, 95% CI 6.4 to 17.0, REM, I2=81.3%, low -certainty evidence (Appendix 9.2)).

As shown in Figure 3.25, relative to SD-IIV3, there was a significant difference in effect in favour of HD- IIV3 across all influenza seasons (VE=13.7%, 95% CI 17.7, REM, I2=15.0%, low -certainty evi dence (Appendix 9.2)). One study was excluded from pooled analyses as it was conducted in older adults undergoing maintenance haemodialysis, the authors noted no significant difference between the vaccines [41].

As shown in Figure 3.26, relative to SD -IIV3 there was a significant difference in effect in favour of HD-IIV3 across all influenza seasons (VE=13.1%, 95% CI 8.4 to 17.7, REM, I2=89%, low -certainty evidence (Appendi x 9.2)).

As shown in Figure 3.27, there was a significant difference in favour of HD- IIV3 for this outcome (VE=3.5%, 95% CI 1.5 to FEM, I2=94.5%, low -certainty evidence (Appendix 9.2)). Figure 3.27 Vaccine effectiveness of HD -IIV3 versus S D-IIV3 against any influenza -related hospital encounters 3.3.3.5 Influenza -like illness As shown in Table 3.4, one study presented data regarding influenza -like illness with a pooled estimate of vaccine effectiveness across five influenza seasons for ol der adults undergoing maintenance haemodialysis [41]. The authors note no significant difference in vaccine effectiveness between HD -IIV3 and SD -IIV3 for influenza -like illness.

Of these, 19 were RCTs [43, 46- 48, 53, 54, 56, 63, 73, 80, 82, 83, 95, 98, 100, 101, 106, 117, 131] and five were non -randomised studies [29, 38, 45, 81, 124]. 3.3.4.1 Serious adverse events Four studies reported SAEs which were deemed to be potentially related to receipt o f a high- dose influenza vaccine [43, 56, 63] . Chang et al. [43] reported small -fibre neuropathy in a subject 42 days after vaccination with HD -IIV3. DiazGranados et al. [56] reported one case of cranial -nerve VI palsy, one case of hypovolemic shock associated with diarrhoea and one case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. D uring the six-month follow -up period in the study conducted by Falsey et al. [63] one diagnosis of Crohn's disease and one of myasthenia gravis were noted. An active surveillance study for Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome conducted by Arya et al. [29] noted no excess risk after high - dose vaccination in the primary analysis. However, an elevated risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in the secondary analysis timeframe (8 -21 days) was reported. 3.3.4.2 Local reactions Seven studies possessed sufficiently comparable data to enable quantitative synthesis regarding local reactions f or high-dose influenza vaccines [ 47, 56, 63, 83, 101, 106, 131]. All compared HD -IIV3 with SD -IIV3 or SD -IIV4 for outcomes including combined local reaction s, pain, redness, swelling, induration and ecchymosis. The pooled estimates for these outcomes are shown in Figures 3.28 to Figure 3.33. As shown, HD -IIV were associated with a significantly higher frequency of combined local reactions (RR=1.40, 95% 1.20 t o 1.64, three RCTs, FEM, I2=25%, low-certainty evidence), pain (RR=1.56, 95% RCTs, REM, I2=57%, moderate -certainty evidence), swelling (RR=2.20, low -certainty evidence (appendix 9.2)). There was no significant difference between vaccines for the remaining outcomes (low - moderate certainty evidence, see Appendix 9.2). As shown in Appendix 8. 2, similar results were displayed for older adults within sub- group analyses. Among studies which were excluded from pooled analyses, Cowling et al. [48] reported a statistically higher frequency of tenderness and swelling in those who received HD -IIV3 compared with SD -IIV4. Similarly Kaka et al.[81] reported a significantly higher frequency of local reactions in HD -IIV3 versus SD - IIV3, with the difference largely related to injection site pain. Sanchez et al. [117] compared intramuscular lower reactogenicity than subcutaneous administrations. Chang et al. [43] noted comparable rates of adverse reactions when a HD -IIV4 was compared with a HD -IIV3.

[47, 56, 63, 83, 101, 106, 131] . All compared HD -IIV3 or HD -IIV4 with SD -IIV3 or SD-IIV4 for t he following outcomes: combined systemic reactions, fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, chills, diarrhoea and fatigue. The pooled analyses for these outcomes are presented in Figures 3.34 to Figure 3.41. As shown, HD- IIV were associated with a significantly higher frequency of headache (RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.77, REM, I2=0%, seven RCTs, moderate- certainty evidence (appendix 9.2)), chills 2.81, REM, I2=0%, four -certainty evidence (appendix 9.2)), malaise 1.08 1.51, REM, I2=0%, seven RCTs, moderate- certainty evidence (appendix 9.2)). No significant difference between vaccine groups was noted for the remaining outcomes (very -low to moderate certainty evidence, see main summary of findings and appendix 9.2). As shown in Appendix 8.2, similar results were displayed for older adults within sub - group analyses. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 36 Sanchez et al. [117] compared intramuscular HD -IIV4, subcutaneous HD -IIV4 and subcutaneous SD -IIV4; intramuscular administration was associated with a lower overall frequency of systemic reactions. Chang et al. [43] noted comparable rates of adverse reactions when a HD -IIV4 was compared with a HD -IIV3.

With regards to individuals with malignancy or undergoing oncological treatment, Chong et al. [45] reported no significant difference in the incidence of new onset immune- related adverse events following vaccination with HD - IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3 or SD -IIV4. Strowd et al., [124] and Branagan et al., [38] noted that high -dose vaccination was well -tolerated in their respective single -arm trials, and Jamshed et al. [80] noted that high dose vaccination was generally well -tolerated compared with SD -IIV. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received HD -IIV3 or SD -IIV4, Colmegna et al. [46] reported similar frequencies of local and systemic reactions in both groups. Similarly, no significant differences in local or systemic reactions were noted between H D-IIV3 and SD -IIV3 in solid -organ transplant recipients [100] . In HSCT recipients, Halasa et al. [73] noted a significantly higher frequency of combined local reactions in those receiving HD -IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3, with no difference noted between the groups in terms of systemic reactions. In individuals with HIV, McKittrick et al. [95] noted no significant difference in local or systemic reactions between recipients of HD-IIV3 compared with SD -IIV3. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 40 3.3.5 Risk of bias - high-dose influenza vaccines The risk of bias for efficacy and safety RCTs investigating high -dose influenza vaccines is summarised in Figures 3.42 and Figure 3.43. The two efficacy RCTs were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias due to lack of clarity in one key domain. Of the 1 9 RCTs assessing a safety outcome of high -dose influenza vaccines, one (5%) was judged to be at a low risk of bias, 16 (84%) were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias and two (11%) were deemed to be at a high risk of bias. Of note, the influence of industry funding as captured under the domain of other bias, resulted in the majority of studies being deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. The risk of bias of NRSIs providing data on the effectiveness and safety of high -dose influenza vaccines is summarised in Table 3.5. One test -negative design case- control study, which investigated the prevention of influenza, was deemed to be at a low risk of bias. One (12.5%) NRSI investigating additional outcomes was deemed to be at a low risk of bias, four ( 50.0%) at a moderate risk, and three (37.5%) at a serious risk. Areas of poor reporting included confounding variables, selection bias and missing data. Three studies presented data relating to safety with all deemed to be at a serious risk of bias.

Of these, two studies related to efficacy, [31, 65] four related to effectiveness [40, 42, 51, 78] and 15 related to safety [ 31, 32, 44, 60, 61, 65, 72, 74, 75, 90, 91, 122, 125, 126, 136]. The characteristics of studies relating to efficacy or effectiveness of cell -based influenza va ccines are provided in Appendix 5.3. The vaccine and circulating strains' characteristics associated with these studies are provided in Appendix 6.3. The characteristics of studies relating to the safety of cell -based influenza vaccines are provided in App endix 7.3. 3.4.1 Efficacy - cell-based influenza vaccines Two studies met the eligibility criteria for this systematic review which investigated the efficacy of ccIIV3 in adult populations (aged 18 -49 years) compared with placebo [31, 65] As shown in Fi gures 3.44 to Figure 3.47, the pooled estimate for the two studies shows a significant effect in favour of cell -based influenza vaccines for the prevention of any influenza (VE=70%, 95% CI 60% evidence).

Of these, three were case- control studies [40, 42, 51] and one was a cohort study [78]. 3.4.2.1 Primary o utcome - effectiveness against laboratory -confirmed influenza Three studies provided data relevant to the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed influenza [ 40, 42, 51] . All of the studies were of test -negative case -control design with two in adult populations and one specifically in an older adult 65 years population. The type of influenza, population, comparator, vaccine effecti veness, 95% confidence intervals and degree of matching to circulating strains, as interpreted from each individual study, for each relevant comparison is highlighted in Table 3.4, subcategorised by the influenza season. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 44 3.4.2.2 Effectiveness against any influenza subtype Three studies presented data regarding the effectiveness of cell -based vaccines aga inst any influenza type/subtype [40, 42, 51] . As presented in Table 3.4, one study reported no significant difference compared with traditional influenza vaccines and with no vaccination for older populations [40]. Two studies, reporting for different influenza seasons, reported conflicting findings for cell -based vaccines compared with no va ccination for adult popu lations 42, 51] . 3.4.2.3 Effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1) One study presented data for the effectiveness of a cell -based vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) in an adult population, with the comparator being no vaccination. A significant difference wa s shown in f avour of the cell - based vaccine [51]. 3.4.2.4 Effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) Three studies presented data regarding the effectiveness of cell -based vaccines against influenza A(H3N2) (Table 3.6) [40, 42, 51]. There was no significant difference in comparison to no vaccination or traditional influenza vaccines for older populations based on one study [40]. There were conflicting results based on two studies for cell-based vaccines, compared to n o vaccination for adult populations across two influenza seasons [42, 51] . 3.4.2.5 Effectiveness against influenza B Three studies presented data regarding the effectiveness of cell -based vaccines against a ny influenza type B (Table 3.4) [40, 42, 51]. One study of older adults reported no significant difference compared with no vaccination [40]. Two studies, reporting for different influenza seasons, reported conflicting findings for cell -based vaccines compared wi th no va ccination for adult populations [42, 51]. 3.4.3 Additional outcomes One study presented data relevant to additional outc omes of interest to this review [78]. The study compared a cell-based vaccine to IIV3 in an older adult population (aged 65 years). Results indicated a significant difference in favour of cell -based vaccines for all reported outcomes of interest; influenza -related hospitali sation, influenza - related hospital encounters and influenza -related office visits.

However, disaggregated effectiveness data for adults aged 18 -64 years were not presented. 3.4.4 Safety - cell-based influenza vaccines Fifteen studies inc luded in this systematic review related to the safety o f cell-based influenza vaccines [ 31, 32, 44, 60, 61, 65, 72, 74, 75, 90, 91, 122, 125, 126, 136]. Of these, 11 were RCTs [ 31, 32, 44, 60, 61, 65, 72, 75, 122, 125, 126] comprising 10 unique datasets, and f our were non -randomised studies [74, 90, 91, 136]. 3.4.4.1 Serious adverse events One study included within this review repor ted a serious adverse event associated with cell -based influenza vaccines, with one serious hypersensitivity reaction noted [60]. 3.4.4.2 Local reactions Six studies possessed sufficiently comparable data to enable quantitative synthesis related to local reactions fo r cell-based influenza vaccines [ 60, 65, 72, 75, 122, 125]. All of these studies compared ccIIV3 with IIV3. Pooled estimates for combined local reactions, pain, redness, swelling, induration, and ecchy mosis are presented in Figures 3.48 to Figure 3.53. As shown, cell -based vaccines were associated with significantly higher rates of ecchymosis (RR=1.27, 95 %CI 1.03 to 1.56, three RCTs, low -certainty evidence (Appendix 9.3)), with no signific ant differences noted for the remaining outcomes (low -moderate certainty evidence, see main summary of findings table and appendix 9.3). As shown in Appendix 8.3, similar results were displayed for older adults within sub -group analyses. With regards to st udies that were excluded from the pooled analyses, two studies compared ccIIV4 with ccIIV3 [32, 44], with both noting a significantly higher rate of injection site pain or tenderness events in those receiving ccIIV4 . Similarly, two studies compared ccIIV3 with placebo with a higher frequency of local reactions noted in the cell-based group, particularly in terms of injection site pain [31, 65]. An extension study of revaccination effect comparing ccIIV3 with IIV3 further noted injection site pain as the most c ommonly reported local reaction [126]. In line with other results, two non -randomised studies reported a higher frequency of local reactions with cell - based vaccines compared with non -cell-based vaccines, with injection site pain ag ain being the most co mmon event [90, 91]. An uncontrolled study by Vinnemeier et al. [136] noted similar rates of local reactions in those aged 18-61 years compared with those aged over 61 years.

All of these studies compared ccIIV3 with IIV3 for outcomes including combined systematic reactions, arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, headache, chills, fatigue vomiting and diarrhoea. The pooled estimates fo r these outcomes are presented in Figures 3.54 to Figure 3.63. As shown, no significant differences were shown between the two vaccines for any outcome (low -moderate certainty evidence, see Appendix 9.3). As shown in Appendix 8.3, similar results were displayed for older adults within sub-group analyses. With regards to studies that were too heterogeneous to be included in pooled analyses, a similar trend was noted. Two studies comparing ccIIV4 with ccIIV3 note similar rates of sy stemic reactions in both gr oups [32, 44], with similar results also shown in a study which compared ccIIV3 with IIV3 [126]. Two studies compared ccIIV3 with placebo, with one [65] noting comparable rates between groups and the other reporting significantly more systemic reactions in those receiving ccIIV3, albeit the majority of which were mild -moderate. An uncontro lled study by Vinnemeier et al. [136] noted similar rates of systemic reactions in those aged 18 -61 years compared with those aged over 61 years.

Both efficacy RCTs were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias, due to lack of clarity in one or more key domains. Of the 10 RCTs assessing a safety outcome of cell -based influenza vaccines, nine (90%) were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bi as and one (10%) at a high risk of bias. Of note, the influence of industry funding as captured under the domain of other bias resulted in the majority of studies being deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. The risk of bias of NRSIs providing da ta on the effectiveness of cell -based influenza vaccines is summarised in Table 3.7. Of three test -negative design case- control studies which investigated the prevention of influenza, one each were assessed to be at a low risk, moderate risk and serious ri sk of bias. One study investigating additional outcomes was deemed to be at a low risk of bias.

Of these studies, two related to efficacy/safety [57, 127] and 10 related to safety only [ 33, 48, 57, 58, 77, 84, 116, 127- 129]. The characteristics of studies relating to the efficacy of recombinant HA influenza vaccines are provided in Appendix 5.4. The vaccine and cir culating strains' characteristics associated with these studies are provided in Appendix 6.4. The characteristics of studies relating to the safety of recombinant HA influenza vaccines are provided in Appendix 7.4. 3.5.1 Efficacy - recombinant HA influenz a vaccines Two studies met the eligibility criteria for this systematic review which investigated the efficacy of recombinant HA influenza vaccines [57, 127]. The first study conducted by Dunkle et al., [57] compared a RIV4 with an IIV4 in adults aged 50 years during the 2014- 2015 influenza season for laboratory -confirmed and culture -confirmed influenza. The authors noted the RIV4 had higher efficacy for laboratory -confirmed protocol -defined influenza -like illness with a relative vaccine efficacy of 30% (95% CI 10% to 47%, moderate -certainty evidence). In a subgroup analysis by influenza type, RIV had higher efficacy for influenza A with a relative vaccine efficacy of 36% (95% CI 14% to 53%, moderate -certaint y evidence), not for B (VE= 4%, 95% CI -72% to 46%, moderate- certainty evidence). Additional subgroup analysis by age presents a significant effect for those aged 50 -64 years with a relative vaccine efficacy of 42% (95% CI 15% to 61%), but no t in those aged over 64 years (VE= 17%, 95% CI - 20% to 43%). Similar results were presented for culture- confirmed influenza like illness. Consistent findings are presented in a second study conducted by Treanor et al. [127] comparing a RIV3 with saline i n adults aged 18 -55 years during the 2007- 2008 influenza season. The authors present a significant vaccine efficacy for influenza positive CDC -defined influenza -like illness of 44.6% (95% CI 18.8% influenza and 54.4% (95% CI 26.1% to 72.5%) for influenza A, but not for influenza B (VE=23.1%, 95% CI - 49.0% to 60.9%). Similar findings are presented for influenza positive illness. 3.5.2 Effectiveness - recombinant HA influenza vaccines No studies met the eligibility criteria of this systema tic review which investigated the effectiveness of recombinant HA influenza vaccines. 3.5.3 Safety - recombinant HA influenza vaccines Ten studies included in this systematic review concerned the safety of recombinant HA influenza v accines, all of which w ere RCTs [33, 48, 57, 58, 77, 84, 116, 127- 129]. 3.5.3.1 Serious adverse events Two trials assessing the safety of recombinant HA influenza vaccines documented SAEs possibly related to vaccination. Baxter et al. [33] reported an incident of vasovagal syncope of moderate severity in a RIV3 recipient, possibly associated with the injection procedure rather than the vaccine composition. Treanor et al. [127] reported a possible association between a case of pericardial effusion and vaccination with a RIV3. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 53 3.5.3.2 Local reactions Seven studies within this systematic review possessed sufficiently comparable data to enable quantitative synthesis with regards to local reactions to recombinant HA influenza vaccines [ 33, 48, 57, 58, 77, 84, 128] . All studies compared a recombinant HA influenza vaccine with IIV3 or IIV4 for the following outcomes: combined local reactions, pain, erythema, swelling and tenderness. The pooled estimates for these analyses are presented in Figures 3.66 to Figure 3.70. As shown, for combined local reactions recombinant HA was shown to have significantly fewer local reactions compared with standard influenza vaccines (RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, three RCTs, FEM, I2=0%, low -certainty evidence). There was no significant difference between vaccines for the remaining outcomes (low -moderate certainty evidence, see main summary of findings table and Appendix 9.4). In terms of studies that could not be quantitati vely pooled, two studies compared a recombinant HA influenza vaccine with placebo , with both studies noting significantly more injection site pain in the recombinant HA vaccine recipients [127, 129].

All studies compared a recombinant HA influenza vaccine with IIV3 or IIV4 for the following outcomes: chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia and nausea. The pooled estimates for these outcomes are presented in Figures 3.71 to Figure 3.75. As shown, recombinant HA vaccines were associated with a significantly higher risk of chills compared with IIV (RR=1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72, three RCTs, FEM, low -certainty evidence (Appendix 9.4)), with no sign ificant difference noted for any other outcome (low -moderate certainty evidence, see Appendix 7.4). Two studies could not be included in the pooled analyses due to clinical heterogeneity, with both comparing recombinant HA vaccines with placebo and no diff erences noted between the groups in terms of systemic reactions [127, 128].

Twenty -seven patients with non -Hodgkin B cell lymphoma were randomised to receive IIV3 or a recombinant HA vaccine. Six patients reported redness, tenderness, malaise, or myalgia after va ccination with the recombinant HA vaccine with two patients reporting moderate malaise and myalgia. Due to the small sample size, it is not possible to comment on the clinical or statistical significance of these results. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 58 3.5.4 Risk of bias - recombinant H A influenza vaccines The risk of bias for efficacy and safety RCTs investigating recombinant HA influenza vaccines is summarised in Figure 3.76 and 3.77. The two efficacy RCTs was deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias due to lack of clarity in one key domain. Of the 10 RCTs assessing a safety outcome of recombinant HA influenza vaccines, all studies were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias due to lack of clarity in one or more key domains. Of note, the influence of industry funding as captured under the domain of other bias resulted in the majority of studies being deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias overall.

The issues precluding this analysis will be highlighted in the discussion section. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 60 4. Discussion This systematic review aimed to synthesise the existing evidence base for the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of a subset of influenza vaccines, which were deemed to be newer and enhanced in comparison with traditional influenza vaccines, namely: MF59\u00ae adjuvanted, cell -based, high -dose and recombinant HA. This review inc luded 110 studies, of which five related to efficacy and safety, 35 investigated effectiveness and 67 concerned safety only, with three studies contributing additional results to already included datasets. The distribution of studies across vaccine type wa s 48 for adjuvanted influenza vaccines, 19 for cell -based influenza vaccines, 36 for high -dose influenza vaccines, and 10 for recombinant HA influenza vaccines. The results of this review will be discussed for each vaccine of interest with consideration to wards the hierarchy of evidence available, followed by a collective narrative regarding challenges encountered during this review process and potential directives for research and reporting to mitigate such challenges in the future. 4.1 MF59\u00ae adjuvanted i nfluenza vaccines No relevant published study was identified which investigated the efficacy of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines. While efficacy data may be reported for completed studies [141], unless peer -reviewed, they were not considered eligible f or inclusion. Twenty -two effectiveness studies, including 11 test -negative design case- control studies, presented results which were relevant to the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed influenza. Compared with no vaccination, MF59\u00ae adjuvanted vaccines were found to be effective in preventing influenza in older adults (low -certainty evidence). The treatment effect in relation to influenza A(H3N2) was not statistically significant (very low -certainty evidence), although considerable heterogeneity existed across studies with regard to matching with the circulating strain. These findings appear largely in keeping with previous reviews of influenza vaccine effectiveness [142, 143]. The heterogeneity displayed when considering influenza A(H3N2) data specifical ly is not unexpected, given the known antigenic drift associated with this subtype in par ticular [1]. It appears to support previous directives regarding the cornerstone of influenza effectiveness being first and foremost the accuracy of prediction of circ ulating strains and the degree of within -season drift [144, 145]. Although adjuvanted influenza vaccines enhance immunogenicity, their vulnerability to mismatch may be similar to traditional influenza vaccines [11]. Limited evidence was presented with rega rds to the effectiveness of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines compared with their non - adjuvanted equivalents. There were only seven studies reporting relevant data, which included both crude and adjusted outcomes and could not be synthesised. A subjectiv e interpretation of these limited data suggests MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines do not appear to offer a benefit over non -adjuvanted influenza vaccines , with no statistical difference noted in any trial for all influenza strains, or by subtype, irrespective of the season. The remaining matched case- control and cohort studies reported outcomes which were not laboratory -confirmed and were categorised as additional outcomes. A similar pattern to the above was seen with regards to influenza - related hospita lisations, whereby MF59\u00ae adjuvanted vaccines appeared superior to no vaccination, but limited data suggested no difference in effect compared with non -adjuvanted vaccines. MF59\u00ae adjuvanted vaccines were more effective than no vaccination in reducing the ri sk of influenza - or pneumonia -related hospitalisations, with data from two studies suggesting they may also be more effective than non -adjuvanted vaccines in this regard. Data for the remaining outcomes were limited to single studies only, with effect show n in favour of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted vaccines for influenza -related hospital encounters compared with non -adjuvanted vaccines, and influenza -like illness compared with no vaccination and non- adjuvanted vaccines. Given the nature of the studies investigating the additional outcomes outlined within this review and the inherent risk of bias, significant caution is needed when interpreting these results. A reasonably large evidence base was presented in terms of the safety of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines compared with their non -adjuvanted equivalents, with data from 27 studies. In general, the included studies demonstrated that MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines were associated with a higher frequency of solicited local and systemic reactions (low -moderate c ertainty evidence). This finding is not surprising given the potency of inflammatory action associated with the use of adjuvants in vaccines; Herv\u00e9 et al. [146] discuss the reactogenicity and physical manifestations associated with adjuvants and highlight the inevitability of more solicited reactions. However, these adverse effects are noted to be largely mild to moderate, and transient in their presentation [146, 147]. Overall, there is an absence of high -quality evidence regarding the efficacy of MF59\u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines. While data show that they are generally more effective than no vaccination in reducing the risk of laboratory -confirmed influenza and additional proxy outcomes, their effectiveness compared with traditional vaccine comparators is uncertain and based on limited data. MF59 \u00ae adjuvanted influenza vaccines are associated with more local and systemic reactions when compared with traditional influenza vaccines, which is consistent with the known effects of other adjuvanted vaccine for mulations. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 61 4.2 High -dose influenza vaccines One efficacy study was included within this review which investigated a high- dose influenza vaccine compared with a standard -dose equivalent in older adults, for the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed infl uenza. The results highlighted better protection against laboratory -confirmed influenza with the use of the high- dose vaccine (moderate- certainty evidence). One study was identified that compared the effectiveness of a high -dose influenza vaccine with no vaccination for the primary outcome of laboratory -confirmed influenza in older adults. While the high- dose vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in laboratory -confirmed influenza B, no significant effect was seen for influenza A(H3N2), with a likely mismatch of the latter to circulating strains. The collective data for efficacy and effectiveness, albeit limited, appear to suggest that high -dose influenza vaccines provide greater protection than standard dose or no vaccination. However, the results highlight that irrespective of the vaccine type, the requirement for accurate matc hing is an important foundation [144, 145]. In terms of additional outcomes of interest to this review, the included studies highlight a larger effect with high - dose in fluenza vaccines compared with standard- dose equivalents for influenza -related hospitalisation, influenza - or pneumonia - related hospitalisation, influenza -related hospital encounters, influenza -related office visits and respiratory -related hospital admissions. Given the nature of the majority of the studies included, significant caution should be used when interpreting these results. Additionally, it is unclear how accurate these outcomes are as proxy measures given the lack of laboratory or culture- confir med methodologies. A reasonable evidence base was presented for the safety of high -dose influenza vaccines compared with their standard -dose counterparts. The findings of this review highlight that high -dose vaccines are likely associated with a higher frequency of local and systemic reactions (very low -moderate certainty evidence). The increase in reactions with high -dose influenza vaccines is likely attributed to the composition of these vaccines, which contain a fourfold increase in the antigens included compared to standard. Notably these symptoms are typically reported as mild and transient in nature [148]. Overall, high -dose influenza vaccines may provide better protection against laboratory - confirmed influenza and proxy outcome measures. However, th e evidence base is limited and largely restricted to cohort studies so caution should be taken when interpreting these results. The safety profile of high -dose vaccines highlights that they elicit more reactions overall compared with standard -dose equivalents, which is not unsurprising given dosage differences. 4.3 Cell-based influenza vaccines Two efficacy studies were included in this review and were in agreement with regards to cell -based vaccines being effective in the prevention of laboratory - confir med influenza when compared with placebo in adults (moderate - certainty evidence). While it may be possible to calculate efficacy compared with traditional influenza vaccine (IIV3) based on an indirect comparison [65], only direct comparisons were considered in this review. Indirect comparisons are, in this context, typically underpowered to detect differences in effect. Evidence for effectiveness was limited to three studies reporting data for laboratory -confirmed influenza: two in adult populations and one specifically in older adults (aged 65 years). Overall, results were conflicting when compared with no vaccination, with probable mismatching to circulating strains evident. One study compared cell - based vaccines with traditional influenza vaccines with n o evidence of a difference in effect shown. One study reported data for additional outcomes, with a small but significant increase in effectiveness observed for cell -based vaccines compared with traditional influenza vaccines for influenza -related hospital isation, influenza -related hospital encounters and influenza -related office visits. Taken collectively, the efficacy and effectiveness findings in favour of cell -based influenza vaccinations compared with no vaccination is c onsistent with previous reviews [142, 143], albeit the condition of str ain matching remains a constant [142, 144]. While it is proposed that cell -based vaccines may be more effective than traditional egg- based vaccines due to reduced antigenic mutation during vacci ne production [10], there were insufficient data to examine this effect. In general, compared with traditional influenza vaccines , no significant difference in the risk of systemic reactions was noted; however, there was evidence of a limited increased frequency of local react ions including ecchymosis and possibly pain (low -moderate certainty evidence). This is consistent with expectations given similarities in the profile of cell -based and traditional influenza vaccines [5]. Overall, the findings of this review suggest that c ell-based influenza vaccines are likely to be effective compared with no vaccination when the constant caveats of influenza vaccine strain matching are applied. There are limited data to assess the effectiveness of these vaccines compared with their egg- based counterparts. The safety profile of cell -derived influenza vaccines appears largely similar to traditional influenza vaccines. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 62 4.4 Recombinant HA influenza vaccines Data related to efficacy or effectiveness for recombinant HA influenza vaccines were limited to two efficacy RCTs within this review. Recombinant HA was found to provide a greater protective effect against overall influenza compared with no vaccination and with traditional influenza vaccination (moderate -certainty evidence). In the latter case, it is speculated that this effect may be attributable to either the restriction of mutations seen with egg- based vaccines or the higher dose of antigen seen in this type of influenza vaccine [10, 149]. Collectively, the results of these studies appea r to suggest that recombinant HA vaccines may offer better protection than no vaccination or standard influenza vaccines with some possible cross protection to drift variants. The safety of recombinant HA influenza vaccines was assessed by 10 studies incl uded within this review. Collectively, the findings of this review suggest that the safety profile of recombinant HA influenza vaccines is largely similar to that of traditional influenza vaccines in terms of local and systemic effects (low -moderate certai nty evidence). 4.5 Challenges encountered during review process In conducting this systematic review, numerous challenges were encountered at all stages of the process which were more impactful than anticipated. An overview of these challenges is provide d to assist future updates of the review or for the conduct of similar systematic reviews. Search and selection of studies This review included four different influenza vaccines. The comparators were defined as one or more of: any seasonal influenza vacci ne, placebo, no vaccination, or other type of vaccine. This constituted a wide range of allowed study types, and numerous potential outcomes of interest. To appropriately answer the review questions set out, the search needed to be broad to ensure it would capture all potentially relevant studies. However, this sensitivity resulted in a notable decrease in specificity, as demonstrated in the collective search strategy returning 19 822 citations, of which 110 were included in the review. The issue of balanci ng sensitivity with specificity, with regards to influenza vaccine reviews appears to be a common challenge with a Cochrane review seemingly encountering similar issues, identifying 16 278 citations at the end of 2016, of which only 120 were included [142] . It may be possible to refine search terms further, although extensive testing of alternate filters and search terms was conducted prior to the definitive search with little impact on the number of citations returned. However, improving specificity may b e at the expense of sensitivity. The limited evidence base presented by the studies included in this review was frequently extracted from within studies where the newer and enhanced influenza vaccines formed part of a large dataset rather than being the pr imary vaccine of interest. Therefore, their presence was not identifiable from titles or abstracts , resulting in a large number of full -text reviews. The challenges faced in determining the eligibility of studies even after full -text review suggests that a n improved search specificity may be difficult to achieve. The fact that many of the effectiveness outcomes were supported by only a single study indicates that reducing search sensitivity may further prove to be a high risk strategy given the low quantity of available evidence. Future work could use the outputs of the search presented in this review to explore refinements and their impact on search sensitivity and specificity, and text mining could further be considered to identify potentially useful searc h terms. Full-text review The process of reviewing full -text articles is a core element of any systematic review. In the context of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines, the lack of consistent terminology or clear reporting created significant challenges in this review. Many studies did not clearly report the valency of included vaccines or the adjuvant used in the case of adjuvanted vaccines. Critical information was often distributed across different sections of a paper rather than being clearly reported in the methods and results sections. In particular, reference to the degree of matching of vaccine strains to circulating strains was often reported narratively and somewhat ambiguously in the discussion section of studies rather than the results section. This resulted in a substantial degree of subjectivity in the authors' interpretation of these factors when interpreting the results of included studies. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 63 Data extraction The method used to present key outcomes of interest to this review were reported in a heterogeneous nature across the included studies with key results being in tables, graphs, described narratively or a combination of these methods. This is not unusual, but given the use of both adjusted and unadjusted values for a range of age groups, outcomes and comparison s, it created challenges for accurate data extraction. Some studies did not report the raw two- by two - table data used to calculate the unadjusted vaccine effectiveness. Where multiple vaccine comparisons were reported, the associated effectiveness data were sometimes either not reported or presented opaquely, presenting a missed opportunity to sufficiently answer the question of relative effectiveness in comparison to traditional influenza vaccines and potentially provide valuable data to support policy decisions overall. Analysis of results A number of adjuvant vaccine studies did not report whether the vaccine was trivalent or quadrivalent in either the intervention or comparator arms. These studies could then not be combined with studies that clearly stated valency, limiting the pooled analyses of such studies overall. Where multiple studies were available for a given combination of comparison, outcome and age group, there was the potential for pooling of outcomes. The la ck of consistent age groups for reporting further hampered the ability to pool data. The failure to disaggregate outcomes by vaccine type in some studies also limited the number of comparisons that could be extracted. From a comparison of adjusted and unadjusted outcomes, it was clear that the process of adjustment often had an important impact on effect estimates. For this review, it was assumed that the adjusted value was the least biased estimate of effectiveness as it accounted for differences in demogr aphy and other potentially important patient -level characteristics. Although almost all studies reported adjusted estimates, a small minority did not. While the results of those studies were included, it was with the acknowledgement that the estimates were likely to be biased. Studies that included multiple vaccine types often only reported adjusted vaccine effectiveness for the main or a restricted number of comparisons, thereby limiting the useful data that could be extracted. The covariates considered fo r adjustment were generally reported clearly, with age and sex used consistently in addition to a range of other covariates. What was less clear was which covariates were actually used for adjustment, as studies often reported that only those with a p-value of less than 0.1 were retained for adjustment, without stating which those were. Pooling studies across a mix of matched and mismatched seasons is likely to generate misleading results. The included studies may not give a fair representation of how often the vaccine matches the circulating strains in a given season. The pooled result will also reflect neither a matched or mismatched season, but some form of 'on average' that is also not a reflection of the 'on average' probability of matching. Interpretat ion of results While there were limited data for most comparisons, this was further reduced when considering only a particular influenza season. The extent of match or mismatch to circulating strains within a season was not consistently reported, and it w as unclear what constituted a 'good match' in terms of full, partial or poor matching overall. However, whether the level of matching could be converted into a dichotomous measure may not be very relevant given the limited number of studies available for subgroup analysis. As already stated, pooling across a mix of matched and mismatched seasons must be interpreted with caution as it may not reflect the true likelihood of matching. There were insufficient data to support a network meta -analysis. As the revi ew was of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines, only studies that included one of the four identified vaccines were included. However, those studies included a wide range of comparators - often non- adjuvanted vaccine or no vaccination. Ideally, a network meta -analysis would include the findings of studies that compared adjuvanted vaccines with no vaccination, as this would be an important component in determining the consistency of evidence across the network. This is particularly important, given that there was evidence to suggest a benefit over no vaccination, but limited evidence to suggest a benefit over traditional influenza vaccines. As such, it is recommended that a network meta-analysis should not be limited to newer and enhanced seasonal i nfluenza vaccines, but should be undertaken as part of a review of all relevant influenza vaccines which may produce more impactful results. There are unique regulatory and manufacturing requirements that pertain to vaccines; lot variation and/or major changes to the manufacturing process have the potential to impact vaccine performance and safety. Decisions on the requirement for comparative clinical immunogenicity trials following changes to the product composition or manufacturer (including changes to pr ocess, site or scale) are made on a case -by-case basi s by the regulatory authorities [150]. Such changes should routinely be considered when drawing conclusions around the generalisability of vaccine findings. Systematic review of efficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines TECHNICAL REPORT 64 In the context of this review, efficacy data for the cell -based vaccines are based on a product originally marketed by Novartis as Optaflu\u00ae in Europe and Flucelvax\u00ae in the US, with production of both products initially limited to a facility in Germany. Production has since b een moved exclusively to t he US [151, 152]. For the included cell -based vaccines, no additional immunogenicity trials were required by regulators following a review of the manufacturing sites, so it is assumed that the findings of this review were not impacted by the production cha nges [153]. Considerations to improve the quality of reporting On the basis of our experience of conducting this systematic review, a number of suggestions to improve reporting can be proposed which may facilitate future evidence synthesis when considerin g newer and enhanced influenza vaccines: Studies should clearly report the key features of the study in the title and abstract (for example, types of vaccines included, study design). In the absence of consistent use of key words and MeSH terms, this would greatly facilitate searching. There should be clearer reporting within papers in terms of how the patient population were selected, whether influenza was laboratory -confirmed, the type of adjuvant used, and the valency of the included vaccines. While ackn owledging that age groupings reported in effectiveness studies may reflect country -specific vaccine policy recommendations, data should also be reported according to the age groupings for the licensed indications of the included vaccines. Results should be reported disaggregated by vaccine type, while acknowledging that there can be issues with small numbers, for all included vaccines to enable a greater number of comparisons between the vaccines of interest to this review and traditional influenza vaccine s. The degree of matching between vaccine and circulating strains should be explicitly reported as part of the results section, preferably as a percentage rather than as a dichotomous outcome. Vaccine effectiveness should be presented as both an adjusted a nd unadjusted outcome with adjusted comparisons explicitly stating the variables included in the final model. 4.6 Strengths and limitations The findings of this systematic review should be interpreted with consideration of its strengths and limitations overall. A robust approach to the review process was employed with the publication of a defined protocol and adherence to guidelines to standardise conduct and reporting. To the evaluation team's knowledge, this is the first review to collectively assess the evidence base of a range of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines specifically. Immunogenicity measures were outside the scope of this systematic review, however inclusion of such factors may provide more insight to the potential benefits of these newer and enhanced influenza vaccines in future reviews. This is an active area of research, and a large number of ongoing studies (see Appendix 4 ) and systematic reviews [154] were identified. At least one study relevant to this review has been publishe d since the date of search [155]. These ongoing and completed studies highlight a need to update this systematic review in the near future. The data coverage regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of these influenza vaccines was limited in this review. Although a large body of RCT evidence was presented for safety of the newer and enhanced influenza vaccines which is likely reflective of regulatory requirements, the body of evidence for efficacy and effectiveness was extremely limited. In particular, this review was limited in its ability to answer questions regarding the relative vaccine effectiveness of these newer and enhanced influenza vaccines in comparison to their traditional counterparts, and similarly a number of primary outcomes identified in the protocol stage. It is anticipated that the implementation of the recommendations outlined above will greatly enhance future evidence synthesis in this area. Additionally, this review was unable to answer the research question regarding within -season protection duration associated with the newer and enhanced influenza vaccines due to a lack of data overall. This outcome consists of a complex interaction between a large number of factors including, age, previous vaccination history, previous infection histor y, circulating s train clade and research design [156]. However, it is anticipated that with the increased use of these newer and enhanced influenza vaccines, a larger data coverage will emerge. This should facilitate answers regarding this outcome, in part icular with comprehensive datasets such as those collected by the I-MOVE initiative in Europe [157]. This review did not consider stratification by level of care (primary and secondary). As per the agreed protocol, all levels of care were considered collec tively. However, future updates may warrant inclusion of this factor to further facilitate decision -making. TECHNICAL REPORT Systematic review of ef ficacy, effectiveness and safety of newer and enhanced seasonal influenza vaccines 65 A final important consideration is the potential risk of bias of industry funding and industry affiliation. For efficacy and safety trials, industry funding falls under 'other source of bias' within the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, as this potential source of bias is unclear. That is, while it may influence results, industry funding does not necessarily bias the results. The potential for this form of bias resulted in a large number of studies being deemed to be at an unclear risk overall. In contrast, few NRSI studies were industry -funded (17%). Such factors have been documented as potentially influencing the likelihood of publication of favourable results when considering influenza vaccines [158]. The conduct of sufficiently powered and publicly -funded trials to assess these vaccines in an effort to reduce the uncertainty regarding industry bias has been suggested as cruci al for future research [142]. 4.7 Conclusion Overall the evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of newer and enhanced influenza vaccines appears limited at present, with a number of potentially relevant studies identified as ongoing. It is likely that the use of such vaccin es provides greater protection than no vaccination at all, when the usual considerations of circulating strain matching are applied. Evidence regarding the comparability of these vaccines to traditional seasonal influenza vaccines is uncertain with a lack of available literature. The safety profiles of these vaccines are largely in keeping with that expected when considering their individual compositions and, for the most part, they appear to be well tolerated. Some suggestions are provided to enhance resea rch conduct and reporting regarding these newer and enhanced influenza vaccines which are anticipated to improve the data coverage overall and facilitate future decision -making regarding the use of such vaccines.
