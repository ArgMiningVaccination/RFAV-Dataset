Though it is quite obvious, having the proper balance is so difficult to do in practice. For instance, if you're working too much, you'll end up being stressed out or burnt out. Spending too much time with other people may result in a lack of identity. Playing too much will lead to no work getting finished. Spending most of your time alone may result in one way of thought or loneliness. Sleeping too much may lead to several health problems while too little sleep can negatively affect your focus and clarity. Another thing, performing too much exercise will result in overuse injuries while sitting on the couch the whole day may result in small muscles as well as droopy skin.

Little did they know cleansing will simply clean the energies that are no longer necessary so that the crystals will perform better. When it comes to cleansing crystals for balance, there are plenty of ways available. Depending on the crystals you're cleansing or working with and what feels accurate to you, you can actually experiment with various methods. Use Moonlight Using moonlight is a simple yet powerful technique you can use to cleanse any crystals for balance. You can cleanse your crystal with this method any time of the month but if you want to obtain better results, you can perform cleaning during the full moon. To use this cleansing method, simply place the crystal in a safe spot where the moonlight falls. For instance, you can place them on windowsills, garden tables, and even pathways. On the other hand, you shouldn't leave your crystals in a place that typically received lots of direct sunlight to avoid fading. Cleanse With Water Aside from moonlight, you can also use salt water to cleanse your crystals. But keep in mind that this method is quite different compared to using fresh water. Saltwater shouldn't be used with crystals with a low Mohs hardness score or delicate ones. The reason behind this is that salt's abrasive nature may be too harsh for the crystal and may lead to physical damage. If you're planning to use salt water, some of the crystals you need to avoid are calcite and labradorite as well as any crystals that shouldn't be used in water. In case the crystal you are working with can be safely cleaned using saltwater, start the cleansing process by dissolving a teaspoon of sea salt in one glass of clean water. Once the sea salt is totally dissolved, soaked the crystals in the salt solution for a couple of hours or overnight. Use A Singing Bowl Using singing bowls is also an effective way to cleanse your crystals for balance as the sound vibrations they give off can get rid of negativity. To perform this form of cleansing, simply hold or place your crystals next to a metal singing bowl. Then stroke the mallet either around the singing bowl's outer or inner edge and make sure to build up the speed little by little. As you perform this all the negative energies and vibrations from your crystals will be carried away and drawn out on the sound waves. This will make a way for positive energies to fill the crystals. In fact, you can also use a recording to cleanse your crystals. Simply position the crystals next to the speaker and then play the audio. Bury Crystals In A Bowl Of Dry Brown Rice Cleansing crystals for balance is also possible. This cleansing technique can draw out any negativity most especially in contained and safe settings. If you're using protective crystals, know that it is one of the most beneficial cleansing methods you can use. To use this method, fill your bowl with dry brown rice. Then bury the crystals you're working with beneath the rice grains. As soon as the cleansing process is done, dispose of the brown rice right away. It's because brown rice is believed to have accumulated the bad energies you are eradicating. Use Intentions In case you need to use your crystals for balance quickly or you can't perform any of the previously mentioned cleansing methods, cleanse your crystals using your intention or breath. Though it isn't as powerful as other techniques, it'll be alright until you can do a more thorough cleaning. Another great thing about this method is that it can be used with all crystals for balance. To do this, take deep breaths and then focus on getting rid of stale and negative energies from your crystals. Pick up the crystal, and breathe in and out over it in a single quick breath. Imagine that all bad energies are blown from your crystal, being accumulated by Mother Earth as well as becoming lively again. Final Thoughts Balance usually comes from feeling complete and whole and nothing is tilting the scale and tossing you into confusion. In fact, it is about having a solid foundation, knowing yourself deeply so that you will be able to sense when things are out of control, and having free space inside to flow and fluctuate. Fortunately, various crystals can help you attain all this, and with a great sense of balance comes the flair of life that is well-lived. But aside from using crystals, there are other ways you can do to achieve and maintain balance in your life. For example, you will need to accept and acknowledge the fact that you can't do everything at all times. You only have a lot of resources like money, time, and energy. While it's completely reasonable that you want to achieve much and please other people, you're just one person and can't manage to do it all at once. So, you will need to stop, take deep breaths, and then group. Stop holding onto perfection and solve the problems of everybody. Once you successfully do it, we can assure you that you will be able to your life back to balance. "}
