This Vitamin D drop was fantastic for myself though. The taste was subtle, and not overpowering. I usually take Vitamin D in the winter when I'm seeing a lot less sunshine, so super grateful for this. Thank you for making this easy to take form of vitamin D. I live in a northern climate so I need this megadose of vitamin D in the winter. I was surprised to find that it tastes faintly of pineapple, a good flavor, but is not sweet. Altogether, this product meets my needs although I wouldn't mind at all if it was sweet like some of the other products. Love this product!
