This is a review for a veterinarians business near Queens, NY: \"I took my dog in for an exam because his breath was horrible and I knew he needed a dental. My first visit I was given an estimate for a complete dental that although was reasonable, I couldn't afford. I explained that I was going to take my dog to my sisters vet out in Long Island for the dental and just have the bloodwork done at Steinway. Dr. Glasser was very kind and understanding about the situation. My dog needed a couple of vaccines before the dental so Dr. Glasser performed the bloodwork and vaccines. He even gave my dog 2 treats and offered to weigh my other dog (I had him with me too). I will definitely go back and bring my other dog for an exam "}
