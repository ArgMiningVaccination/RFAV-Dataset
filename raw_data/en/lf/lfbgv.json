How best to preserve confidentiality within a state health information \\softline infrastructure is an important discussion that is affected by recent regulations promulgated by the \\softline federal department of health and human services related to the electronic storage of health \\softline information. The purpose of this part 12 is to index the provisions that govern medical record \\softline confidentiality to facilitate locating the law concerning the confidentiality of medical records and \\softline health information.
