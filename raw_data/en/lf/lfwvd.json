SHORT TITLE. This chapter may be cited as the \"Natural Health 23 Care Act.\" 24 54-5002. PURPOSE. The legislature finds and declares that the public has 25 the right to choose various modalities of natural health care that are comple- 26 mentary to and distinct from the practice of medicine and which, in some 27 cases, may be nonstandard. The legislature further finds that it is appropri- 28 ate and in the public interest, to authorize and promote the provision of nat- 29 ural health care services of high quality statewide by providing for registra- 30 tion, certification and licensure of practitioners of natural health care at 31 various levels. The legislature further finds that the provision of such nat- 32 ural health care affects the health, safety and welfare of the public, making 33 regulation of such services appropriate. The legislature intends that this 34 chapter should be interpreted liberally to encourage innovation in the deliv- 35 ery of natural health care while concurrently promoting the safety of the pub- 36 lic. In enacting these provisions the legislature does not intend to negate 37 previous court decisions or repeal other provisions of Idaho Code. 38 54-5003. DEFINITIONS.

PENALTIES. (1) A person who violates any provision of this chap- 51 ter shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. 52 (2) The board may seek injunction against any person who practices natu- 53 ral health care in violation of this chapter and may, in the event a permanent 10 1 injunction is entered against such person or plea or verdict of guilty is 2 entered in any criminal matter, impose a civil penalty in the amount of all 3 costs and fees incurred by the board in prosecuting the matter. 4 (3) The representation to another person that a person is licensed, cer- 5 tified or registered or holds licensure, certification or registration pursu- 6 ant to this chapter, when such representation is untrue, constitutes the using 7 of a method, act, or practice which is declared to be unlawful under the pro- 8 visions of chapter 6, title 48, Idaho Code. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE RS 12971 Recognizes Natural Health Care as a modality of health care and provides for registration, certification and licensure of practitioners at various levels; establishes a board; provides for scope of practice and authorizes unconventional care under certain circumstances. Naturopaths and other natural health care providers are currently providing health care with no regulatory agency supervising the safety of such care, except the courts. The court system is an inefficient method for defining areas like scope of practice and standards for practice. FISCAL IMPACT There will be no impact to the general fund. The board will be funded by licensing fees which will be deposited in a dedicated fund and used for payment of expenses arising from implementation of the chapter. Contact Name: Rep.
