Two different extracts were made from Allium cepa (onion) using distilled water. The extracts include fresh onion extract and cold water extract. The antibacterial activity of the onion was tested on four bacteria isolates associated with various ocular infections. The bacterial isolates include: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumonia. Among the two extracts, fresh onion extracts exhibited antagonistic effects on the test organisms ranging from observed zone of inhibition (average value) of 15mm for Escherichia coli, 17mm for aqueous extracts was studied on Rattus novergicus (rats). The extract produced a dose dependent significant result in blood glucose level at the end of six weeks. [Enhancing immune function:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746674/) Researchers evaluated and compared the effect(s) of single and combined oral administration of fresh aqueous onion (Allium cepa) and garlic (Allium sativum) extracts at different concentrations on some immunological determinants in rats. CD4 cells of the rats were estimated using Partec flow cytometric technique, while total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts were estimated using the Sysmsex\u00ae automated hematology analyzing technique. Our findings revealed that, CD4 and total WBC counts were significantly increased (P?0.05) in a dose-dependent manner in both onion (250 when compared to the zero control (200\u00b111cells/\u00b5l and 1.55\u00b10.05X103cells/l, respectively) The antibacterial activity of fresh red and white Allium cepa (Onion) and Zingiber officinale (Ginger), were investigated using agar well diffusion and agar dilution methods. All the bacteria were susceptible to the fresh garlic and white onion juice with the diameter of zones of inhibition ranging from 1.3cm-5.5cm while the test bacteria were not sensitive to the fresh ginger juice.
