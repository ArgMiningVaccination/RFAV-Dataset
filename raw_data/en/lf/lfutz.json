Protect your heart from extra stressors. Studies have shown that cardiac deaths increase around the winter holidays\u2014likely because of less sleep, healthy eating, and exercise\u2014including strenuous activities such as shoveling. But the cold itself actually poses the biggest risk to your heart. Low temperatures [increase the risk of heart attacks](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/how-cold-weather-can-increase-the-risk-of-heart-attacks) by putting extra stress on the heart. In reaction to the cold, your blood vessels constrict to conserve body heat. This increases your blood pressure, which [adds stress to your heart](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/understand-the-risks-of-high-blood-pressure). Your blood platelets also start to clump, raising the risk of a blood clot. The extra strain can be too much for the heart to handle, especially for people who don't exercise regularly; are an advanced age; or have high blood pressure, heart disease, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, or a history of smoking. Here are some ways to lower the stress on your heart: - Dress warmly when you go outside. Boots, thick socks, multiple layers, hat, scarf, mittens\u2014wear it all. - Exercise safely. Maintain an exercise routine if you regularly work out. Avoid strenuous activities if you're mostly sedentary, but talk with your doctor about how to incorporate moderate exercise into your weekly routine. - Eat a [healthy diet](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/the-mediterranean-diet-the-best-choice-for-heart-health). People who eat a diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits and vegetables are less likely to develop heart disease. - Limit alcohol and don't use [tobacco](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/quit-smoking-tobacco). These substances increase the risk of high blood pressure. If you notice symptoms of a heart attack, call 9-1-1 immediately. These include pain in the chest, back, neck, jaw, or abdomen; shortness of breath; fatigue; dizziness; indigestion; heartburn; and nausea. 2. Avoid frostbite by limiting exposure to the elements. In cold weather below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, your body tissues can freeze\u2014including skin and bone. Known as frostbite, this condition can occur anytime. Your risk increases the colder the temperature is and the longer you're outside. Damage from frostbite usually begins before you can feel it, but symptoms to watch out for include: - Blistering - Hard or waxy skin - Numbness - Skin color changes The best way to [prevent frostbite](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/preventing-frostbite-in-bone-chilling-temperatures) is to stay indoors when it's extremely cold. If work or other commitments require you to go outside: - Wear several layers of loose, warm clothing. - Limit the amount of time you're outside. - Change out of wet or cold clothes immediately\u2014especially hats, gloves, and socks. If you think you might have a frostbite injury, [seek care right away](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/pay-attention-frostbite). It can be treated\u2014and the sooner the better to avoid surgery or amputation.

Common injuries include sprains, dislocations, and fractures. You can [avoid injury on snow and ice](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/sports-injuries-2) by: - Being honest with yourself about your fitness and skill level. Don't be embarrassed to ski on the beginner hill or skate slowly near the ice rink wall. - Renting equipment that fits properly. - Staying aware of your surroundings to avoid collisions. - Aiming to land on your rear when falling. It has more padding and is more likely to bruise than sprain. - Sledding feet-first, away from busy roads or parking lots, while wearing a helmet.

Low humidity, harsh winds, and dry indoor heat can strip your skin of its natural moisture. Dry skin isn't necessarily harmful. But it can be painful and lead to [skin conditions](https://www.medstarhealth.org/services/dermatology), such as eczema, which are often mistaken for dry skin because peeling or flaking are common symptoms. Skin redness or itching in addition to seasonal dryness and flaking might indicate a more serious skin condition. If you experience these symptoms, [see a dermatologist](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/winter-skin-care-tips) who can recommend an individualized treatment plan. Instead of waiting for symptoms, take a proactive approach to managing dry skin: - Avoid using antibacterial and detergent-based soap, as well as any personal product containing fragrance. These products often are made with skin-drying ingredients. - Skip lotion and apply fragrance-free creams or ointment to damp skin after bathing. Use products containing ceramide, an ingredient that helps protect your skin barrier. Don't forget to moisturize your palms and the bottoms of your feet; painful cracks often form in these areas when dry. - Routinely apply hand cream after washing or sanitizing your hands. [Good hand hygiene](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/hand-washing-and-dry-skin)is important, but it requires lots of moisturizing. - Wear sunscreen. The sun might not be shining as often, but UV rays are still able to dry out and burn your skin.

Often referred to as the \"winter blues,\" it is associated with a chemical imbalance in the brain that occurs when people are exposed to less daylight. Many people who experience symptoms, such as constant sadness, a loss of interest in hobbies and activities, appetite and sleep changes, and difficulty thinking, brush them off as \"normal\" for this time of year or try to convince themselves they feel fine. But [seasonal depression is not just in your head](https://www.medstarhealth.org/blog/seasonal-depression); it's a type of clinical depression that can and should be treated. If you stop feeling like yourself during the cold weather months, see your primary care provider.
