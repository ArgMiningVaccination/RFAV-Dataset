As a natural healthcare provider I am keen to promote self-awareness which is often the first step in helping people to claim their health back. I am very passionate about what I do and have a genuine drive to be of service in the world. I do my very best to support you in your healing journey and I also believe that it is essential to take responsibility for our own health, be it physical, mental or emotional. I provide a relaxed, safe and nurturing consultation space where confidentiality is of prime importance. I bring kindness and integrity to what I do. My experience as a meditation teacher allows me to stay fully present with you during the consultation. Many people find this very therapeutic in itself as they are not used to having someone's full attention for such an extended period of time. \"My personal and direct experience of homeopathy is that it provides a gentle and dynamic means to restore people back to health.\" Homeopathic Education - I completed a 4 Year Advanced Practitioner Diploma from The School of Homeopathy in Stroud, Gloucestershire. - I am registered with the largest professional Homeopathic governing body in the country: the Society of Homoeopaths and I abide their Code of Ethics. [https://homeopathy-soh.org/homeopath/simon-s-harding/](https://homeopathy-soh.org/homeopath/simon-s-harding/) - I acknowledge the importance of engaging in Continuing Professional Development and consistently further my education in Homeopathy. I take regular training classes in the various aspects of practice and have studied with some of the eminent names in the field such as Dr Rajan Sankaran, Dr Dinesh Chauhan and Jeremy Sherr. - I am also a member of the HomeoQuest International online community run by Dr Shilpa Bhouraskar and I am a regular participant in her training programs.
