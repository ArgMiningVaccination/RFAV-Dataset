I have an aromatherapy humidifier that I use at night, and this scent (#1) really relaxes me and helps me sleep. I just wish the scent was a little stronger. I wear the blend on my wrists and neck, and wish it lasted all day... because when I smell it, it instantly makes me happier. Definitely give this one a try, I haven't used the other blends but this one is great. [ Leave a "}
