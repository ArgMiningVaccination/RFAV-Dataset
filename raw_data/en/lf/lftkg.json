Always, when we are making a shift or a change, it is easier when we feel supported. During this cleanse, I will support you through 10 days of nutritional counseling, Ayurvedic recommendations for your constitution, as well as herbal supplements. You can schedule a free 15-minute call with me to find out more about the Ayurvedic Cleanse. I highly recommend doing our group cleanses in the fall and spring, but it's also possible to do the cleanse 1:1 with my support, and begin at a time that is convenient for you. First, you'll have an Ayurvedic consultation to determine what your needs are at this time. We will discuss your health health concerns and health goals. Based on your consultation, I will create your cleansing plan. This includes for everyone, eating a plant-based diet (with the exception of taking some ghee), as well as eating an Ayurvedic mono-diet for ten days. We will discuss how to incorporate preparing the foods for your reset into your lifestyle. We will check-in together daily via text or phone call to answer questions and offer support. In Ayurveda, healing begins with food. There is a saying in Ayurveda, \"Your pharmacy is in your kitchen.\" The Digestive Reset allows your body to recalibrate and heal, and also allows you to develop new habits around eating and self-care. So in this modern life we tend to take care of our families and our work before we take care of ourselves. But, to be their for our families and to give our most authentic selves at work, we must be nourished and balanced ourselves. Dedicating time to doing an Ayurvedic Cleanse is one way to nourish yourself and assess your health priorities. Costs: The cost of the 1:1 cleanse is $495. This includes: ~ Ayurvedic Consultation In-Person - 90 min ~ Recipe Booklet ~ Detailed and Individualized Cleanse Schedule ~ Daily check-in via text or brief phone call during the 10-days of your cleanse ~ Total Body Cleanse or Blood Cleanse Herbs* ~ Ashwagandha* ~ Triphala* ~ Castor Oil* *These herbs are suggestions because they are very supportive for most people during the cleanse.
