Currently, there is no cure for IBD [ [2](#b2-ir-2020-00035)], and available treatment approaches target to reduce inflammation and prevent clinical symptoms and complications [ [3](#b3-ir-2020-00035)]. In the United States, the disparity in treatment goals was observed between the clinicians and patients, where 25% of clinicians versus 2.5% of patients viewed the treatment is successful as reflected by endoscopic remission [ [4](#b4-ir-2020-00035)]. [5](#b5-ir-2020-00035)]. However, drug therapy leads to inconsistent health improvement and severe adverse effects [ [6](#b6-ir-2020-00035)]. Hence, manipulation of gut microbiota through diet change is a promising therapeutic strategy. This strategy can reduce inflammation by maintaining a healthy gut microbiota balance while optimizing good nutrition [ [7](#b7-ir-2020-00035)]. The most well-studied dietary therapy for IBD is the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) with elemental, semi-elemental, and defined formula diets [ [8](#b8-ir-2020-00035)]. The EEN is recommended as the first-line therapy for active CD patients as it can change the gut microbiota profile and promote mucosal healing through anti-inflammatory effects [ [8](#b8-ir-2020-00035), [9](#b9-ir-2020-00035)]. [10](#b10-ir-2020-00035)] and the liquid nutrition formula lacks palatability [ [11](#b11-ir-2020-00035)]. The limitations led to the introduction of various oral formulated diets for IBD treatment. Even though patients seek dietary consultation with clinicians, whole food diet-based therapies for CD and UC are poorly developed. As previous studies showed that alteration of gut microbiota composition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBD [ [12](#b12-ir-2020-00035), [13](#b13-ir-2020-00035)], formulated diet known as anti-inflammatory diet (AID) is of potential utilization. The IBD-AID was developed based on the relationship established between gut microbiota imbalance and intake of specific carbohydrates acting as substrates for pathogenic bacteria in the gut [ [14](#b14-ir-2020-00035)]. The AID diet was reported to limit carbohydrates such as refined sugar, glutenbased grains, and processed complex carbohydrates that can enhance the growth of inflammatory bacteria in the digestive tract [ [14](#b14-ir-2020-00035)]. [14](#b14-ir-2020-00035)]. [Table 1](#t1-ir-2020-00035)demonstrates the complexity of texture modification of foods depending on the severity of symptoms and patient's tolerance. At the initial stage, soft foods should be introduced followed by well-cooked foods and can gradually revert to whole foods as the symptoms improve. EFFECTIVENESS OF AID IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IBD [Table 2](#t2-ir-2020-00035). [14](#b14-ir-2020-00035)] demonstrated a promising retrospective case series of AID as a treatment for IBD patients who did not show any positive changes after pharmacological therapy and for patients where treatment (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery) was not as effective. In the case series, 40 patients were offered AID while 11 patients completed AID therapy and contributed to the data required. All the patients experienced an improvement in their symptoms and downscaled their current medication therapy after adopting the diet for > 4 weeks [ [14](#b14-ir-2020-00035)]. However, there is a limitation concerning small sample size and study design, Thus, randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of AID as adjunctive dietary therapy for IBD. 1. Probiotics [15](#b15-ir-2020-00035)]. The effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of UC and CD have been investigated in several interventional trials, however, the results are inconsistent. Kruis et al. [ [16](#b16-ir-2020-00035)] performed a double-blinded, double-dummy trial where UC patients were randomized to either receive probiotic capsules of Escherichia coli Nissle 200 mg once daily (n = 162) or mesalazine 500 mg medication three times daily (n = 165) for 12 months. At the end of the study, patients were assessed based on the histological, clinical and endoscopic activity indices. It was found that the efficacy and safety of E. coli Nissle were equivalent to the gold standard therapy (mesalazine) in maintaining the remission in UC patients. A meta-analysis conducted in 2014 which included 20 high-quality randomized control trials (RCTs) also showed probiotics could prevent relapse of UC as effectively as mesalazine (relative risk [17](#b17-ir-2020-00035)]. [18](#b18-ir-2020-00035)]. [19](#b19-ir-2020-00035)]. The review revealed no statistical difference in the clinical relapse (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.22) and maintenance of CI, 0.90-1.25) between probiotics and mesalazine [ [19](#b19-ir-2020-00035)]. This could be due to the small sample size used for clinical trials that limit the number of data. Thus, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the efficacy of probiotics in maintaining remission of UC. [20](#b20-ir-2020-00035), [21](#b21-ir-2020-00035)]. Shen et al. [ [20](#b20-ir-2020-00035)] reported that the supplementation with Lactobacillus GG resulted in an increase in the relapse rate of CD compared with placebo (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.07-2.64). Similarly, Rahimi et al. [ [21](#b21-ir-2020-00035)] reported on negative findings of probiotics efficacy in maintaining remission and preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse among CD patients. [16](#b16-ir-2020-00035)- [21](#b21-ir-2020-00035)]. In this review, 4 studies that reported on the beneficial consumption of foods containing probiotics as a therapeutic strategy in the management of IBD were included [ [22](#b22-ir-2020-00035)- [26](#b26-ir-2020-00035)]. 1) Fermented Milk Supplementation [22](#b22-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a clinical trial to compare a group of UC patients provided with bifidobacteria supplemented fermented milk (BFM, n = 11) and a control group (n = 10) without supplementation of BFM, however, both groups received standard medications as a part of treatment. The BFM group (n = 11) was prescribed with 100 mL/day of commercially available BFM products containing B. breve, B. bifidum, and L. acidophilus for a 1-year study period. Colonoscopy, general blood marker test, and intestinal flora examination were performed at the beginning of the trial and the end of the study period. The exacerbation of symptoms was observed in 3 out of 11 subjects in the BFM group, and 9 out of 10 subjects in the control group. The statistical findings indicated a cumulative reduction of relapse rates in the BFM group (P < 0.05). However, the effectiveness of probiotic therapy among patients with active UC has not been investigated in a placebocontrolled study. [23](#b23-ir-2020-00035)] conducted another randomized placebo-controlled trial among outpatients and hospitalized active UC patients from Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. Significant improvement in both clinical and endoscopic activity indexes of mild to moderately active UC patients was noted. The trial was conducted among a group of UC patients with BFM supplementation (n = 10) containing B. breve, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and a placebo group (n = 10) for 12 weeks [ [23](#b23-ir-2020-00035)]. The BFM group received 100 mL/day of BFM besides ongoing conventional treatment. It was concluded that BFM supplementation was safer and more effective compared with only conventional treatment in the management of active UC patients [ [23](#b23-ir-2020-00035)]. However, this is the only pilot study available, hence more studies are required to confirm the results. [24](#b24-ir-2020-00035)]. A total of 195 patients with quiescent UC was randomized into the BFM group (n = 98) and placebo group (n = 97). The BFM group was supplemented with 100 mL/day BFM for 48 days. At the end of the study, the relapse-free survival analysis conducted showed no significant difference between the BFM and placebo groups (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.63-2.14). No significant difference was also noted between the BFM group (22.7%) and the placebo group (20.0%) for the incidence of relapse with P-value of 0.651. 2) Yogurt [25](#b25-ir-2020-00035)] conducted an open-label study involving healthy (n = 20) and IBD (n = 20) subjects, with 15 and 5 of the IBD patients diagnosed with CD and UC, respectively. All the subjects were supplemented with yogurt containing probiotics namely L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus. After 30 days of treatment, the CD4+ CD25high T cells proportion increased significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of myeloid dendritic cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- /interleukin (IL)-12 monocytes content reduced in both UC and DC patients [ [25](#b25-ir-2020-00035)]. [26](#b26-ir-2020-00035)] also revealed a positive effect of yogurt containing probiotic consumption on UC patients. Effect of consuming about 250 g of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains daily for 8 weeks were evaluated [ [26](#b26-ir-2020-00035)]. Stool samples were collected from the patients at the baseline and after the treatment. The changes in stool specimens were measured using Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The results showed an increase in the CFU means of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the treatment group compared with the placebo group [ [26](#b26-ir-2020-00035)]. 2. Prebiotics [27](#b27-ir-2020-00035)]. With an advanced understanding of the interaction between diet, microbiome and host, Bindels et al. [ [28](#b28-ir-2020-00035)] proposed a new definition of prebiotic. Prebiotic was defined as a non-digestible compound that can be metabolized by microorganisms in the gut which will modulate the composition and activity of gut microbiota, thus conferring a beneficial physiological effect on the host. However, the efficacy of prebiotics in IBD treatment is still unclear. 1) Oat Bran [29](#b29-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a controlled multicenter study among a group of adult patients with quiescent UC. In this study, UC patients were randomized into an active group (n = 67) that received 60 g of oat bran equivalent to 20 g of dietary fiber/day and a control group (n = 63) that received a low-fiber wheat-based products that provided 5 g dietary fiber/day [ [29](#b29-ir-2020-00035)]. After 24-week of study, the oat bran group had significantly higher fecal butyrate concentrations with gastrointestinal symptoms prevented. However, the relapse rate was similar for both groups. [30](#b30-ir-2020-00035)]. The main outcome of this oat bran intervention was reflected by short-chain fatty acids concentration in the stools. Fifteen subjects had a 36% increase in the fecal butyrate concentration within 4 weeks of intervention and the butyrate concentration maintained throughout 12 weeks of the trial. During the trial, no patients showed signs of disease flare but significant improvement in IBD symptoms was noted as assessed by the Seo activity index. This study demonstrated that patients with quiescent UC should increase their fiber intake with the consumption of a diet rich in oat bran. However, further studies are required to determine the long-term benefits of using oat bran in maintenance therapy for UC patients. 2) Germinated Barley Foodstuff [31](#b31-ir-2020-00035)]. In 2003, Kanauchi et al. [ [32](#b32-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a multicenter open trial to investigate a long-term administration effect of GBF on the treatment of active UC in addition to the standard treatment. A total of 21 patients with mild to moderate UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks, resulting in a reduction of clinical activity of disease especially the degree of visible blood in stools and presence of nocturnal diarrhea compared with the control group (P < 0.05) [ [32](#b32-ir-2020-00035)]. [33](#b33-ir-2020-00035)]. Patients were randomized into control group (n = 37) and GBF group (n = 22). For the treatment group, patients received 20 g/day of GBF with standard drug treatment, while the control group only received the standard drug therapy. Response to treatment was assessed by monitoring the clinical activity index and endoscopic score. In this trial, the recurrence rate was found to be lower in the GBF group compared to that of the control group with significantly higher clinical activity index at 3, 6, and 12 months of the trial were observed. The authors concluded that GBF is safe and effective to prolong the remission state in UC patients [ [33](#b33-ir-2020-00035)]. [34](#b34-ir-2020-00035)]. The GBF group patients received 30 g of GBF, three times daily in addition to conventional treatment for 2 months. A decrease in serum level of C-reactive protein along with reduced gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and cramping were noted [ [34](#b34-ir-2020-00035)]. Overall, intake of GBF in daily diet by UC patients showed improvements in clinical disease activity. 3) Wheat Bran [35](#b35-ir-2020-00035)] conducted an interview-based single-armed study to evaluate the effect of wheat bran intake on CD patients health (n = 7). Patients were instructed to consume a half cup of whole wheat bran cereal daily, reduce the intake of refined carbohydrate and maintain sufficient fluid intake. At the end of the 4-week study, improvement in the clinical activity scores as measured by the Harvey-Bradshaw index was reported [ [35](#b35-ir-2020-00035)]. The authors concluded that consuming wheat bran in daily diet is feasible for CD patients and no adverse effects of the diet were reported [ [35](#b35-ir-2020-00035)]. However, the study has several limitations such as the use of small sample size and lack of objective biological measures such as fecal inflammatory markers, calprotectin, and/or lactoferrin. 3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids [36](#b36-ir-2020-00035)]. The consumption of 3FA was associated with anti-inflammatory properties that can improve mucosal healing of intestines and alleviate the active symptoms of IBD [ [37](#b37-ir-2020-00035)]. The intake of essential 3FA can be achieved by regular consumption of foods such as oily fish (tuna, salmon, mackerel or sardine) or by supplementation with fish or olive oil. [38](#b38-ir-2020-00035)]. The efficacy of salmon fillet consumption was assessed using a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), sigmoidoscopy, serum fecal calprotectin inflammatory markers, rectal biopsy, and plasma fatty acid (FA) profile evaluation before and after the dietary intervention. The findings revealed a reduction in the SCCAI and FA content in plasma and rectal specimen [ [38](#b38-ir-2020-00035)] which indicates the beneficial effects of salmon fillet consumption on disease activity in patients with mild UC [ [38](#b38-ir-2020-00035)]. [39](#b39-ir-2020-00035)], a placebo-controlled trial involving UC patients in remission was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of EPA-free FA capsules supplement (EPA-FFA) to reduce gut inflammation. In the study, patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups which were (1) patients consuming capsules supplement with EPA-FFA, 500 mg, twice per day (n = 30), and (2) placebo (n = 30) for 6 months of the study period. Assessment of fecal calprotectin and clinical parameters was performed at baseline of the study, after 3 months, and after 6 months [ [39](#b39-ir-2020-00035)]. Administration capsules supplement of EPA-FFA for 6 months was found to reduce calprotectin in fecal without adverse effects. EPA-FFA was found to be beneficial in inducing and maintaining symptom-free remission in patients with UC. However, further investigations involving a larger sample size are needed. [40](#b40-ir-2020-00035)]. Patients were required to ingest one bottle (100 mL) of commercially available 3 emulsifying test formulation daily for 28 days. The results showed that supplementation with the test formulation is safe with minimal side effects. CD activity index scores decreased after ingestion of one bottle of the test formulation (containing 600 mg of EPA and 260 mg of DHA) and blood tests revealed no serious adverse effects [ [40](#b40-ir-2020-00035)]. However, this study involved a small sample size which is insufficient to completely elucidate the effects of the 3 emulsifying formulation to maintain the remission state [ [40](#b40-ir-2020-00035)]. [41](#b41-ir-2020-00035)] systematically reviewed the safety and efficacy of 3FA for maintaining remission in CD. Six studies were included in the analysis with a total of 1,039 patients and the primary study outcome was relapse rate. Based on 2 large high-quality studies included in the review, 3FA was probably found ineffective for the maintenance of remission in CD. 4. Restriction of Refined Carbohydrates and GlutenBased Product Intake [42](#b42-ir-2020-00035), [43](#b43-ir-2020-00035)]. However, there is limited control data to support the impact of exclusions diets of refined carbohydrates on IBD. In the present review, few interventional studies that investigated the impact of refined carbohydrates in comparison to control diet for maintenance of remission in inactive CD patients were summarized [ [44](#b44-ir-2020-00035), [45](#b45-ir-2020-00035)]. [44](#b44-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a controlled trial involving inactive CD patients (n = 20) for a month trial. The study showed that none out of 10 CD patients on unrefined carbohydrate fiberrich diet (control diet) remained in the remission state compared with 7 out of 10 patients on the exclusion diet [ [44](#b44-ir-2020-00035)]. However, the study failed to explain the methods used for random allocation concealment which could influence the study findings. [45](#b45-ir-2020-00035)] to assess the effects of 2 different diets namely refined carbohydrates and unrefined carbohydrates on CD patients (n = 352). Patients were randomized to consume either carbohydrate in the refined form, e.g. rice and white flour (n = 162) or carbohydrates in the natural unrefined state (n = 190). Over the 2-year trial, no clear differences were seen in the clinical course of patients in both groups as assessed by gastrointestinal symptoms improvement, stool count, and weight changes [ [45](#b45-ir-2020-00035)]. However, there was a systematic error due to attrition bias as patients from the intervention group withdrew from the study by 4-fold compared to the control group due to noncompliance. [46](#b46-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a cross-sectional analysis involving IBD patients (n = 1,254) where GFD was adopted by approximately 5% of patients, with most of them not being diagnosed with celiac disease. [47](#b47-ir-2020-00035)] demonstrated that 65.6% of IBD patients who attempted GFD described improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported with fewer or less severe flares of IBD. These 2 cross-sectional analyses could not be used to conclude long-term effects of GFD on the course of the disease. 5. Restriction of Lactose-Based Food Intake [48](#b48-ir-2020-00035)] as a result of an interview with CD patients (n = 105) indicated significant avoidance of milk consumption which was associated with their beliefs that milk worsens their symptoms. In the study, only 6 CD patients reported that the consumption of milk does affect their symptoms. [49](#b49-ir-2020-00035)] reported that most the CD patients (67.3%) stated that the consumption of dairy products had no adverse effect on self-reported CD symptoms. Nevertheless, CD patients who experienced an adverse reaction after consuming products containing milk reported that dairy products with high-fat content (cream, ice-cream, and cheese) worsen the perceived CD symptoms. 6. Reduction of High-Fat Food Intake [50](#b50-ir-2020-00035)]. IBD patients often modify their diets by frequently avoiding fatty foods during the remission to prevent the flares of the disease [ [10](#b10-ir-2020-00035)]. [51](#b51-ir-2020-00035)] analyzed the effect of dietary intake among CD and UC patients in remission (n = 53) and active disease (n = 50) states using 146-food items self-administered food frequency questionnaire over a 1 year of the study period. The outcomes of the clinical state of disease were assessed using fecal calprotectin. A positive association between the risk of relapse and consumption of meat (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.15-11.38) was found which indicated the detrimental effects of meat on disease relapse. [52](#b52-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a prospective observational study among UC patients in remission (n = 412) who were on aminosalicylates treatment to investigate the relationship between high dietary intake of specific fatty acids with the risk of disease flares. The dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire at the baseline and follow-up was performed for a year. The disease activity of UC was assessed using the SCCAI. The study demonstrated that 11% (n = 45) of UC patients experienced a flare of disease within the 12-month study period. The output of multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the higher the intake of myristic acid (saturated fat commonly found in coconut oil, palm oil, and dairy fats), the higher the odds of relapse (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, [54](#b54-ir-2020-00035)]. [54](#b54-ir-2020-00035)] conducted a prospective case-note review to determine the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in the management of functional-like gastrointestinal symptoms (FGS) among IBD patients. In the study, IBD patients (n = 88) were advised to follow a diet low in FODMAP for a minimum of 6 weeks by a specialist gastrointestinal dietitian. About 78% of patients reported improvement of their symptoms during follow-up sessions as assessed by the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale. Besides, a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the severity of abdominal pain, heartburn, flatulence, bloating, bleaching, incomplete evacuation, and nausea was observed. Not only that, improvements in stool consistency (P = 0.002) and frequency (P < 0.001) was also assessed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale [ [54](#b54-ir-2020-00035)]. [55](#b55-ir-2020-00035)] used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and re-challenge trial to evaluate the effect of individual fermentable carbohydrates on the FGS among IBD patients in remission (n = 32) who were experiencing co-existence of FGS. The study reintroduced fructans (12 g/day), galactooligosaccharides sorbitol (6 g/day) a 3-day re-challenge period and glucose placebo (12 g/day) while monitoring the gastrointestinal symptoms. The RCT findings showed that the intake of fructans exacerbated the gastrointestinal symptoms of IBD patients compared to placebo, galactooligosaccharides and sorbitol [ [55](#b55-ir-2020-00035)]. 8. Vitamin E Rich Foods Supplementation [56](#b56-ir-2020-00035)]. Vitamin E, a lipid-soluble antioxidant compound in a cellular membrane is recognized to protect membrane lipids from lipid peroxidation by scavenging the chain-carrying lipid of TRF (containing 70% of T3, a of 150 mg/kg/day) was compared against the -tocopherol (TP; a dose of 150 mg/kg/day) for 20 days. TRF demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as indicated by the reduction of inflammation and pNF-b. Meanwhile, for treatment with TP, the MPO and inflammatory markers, no changes were observed [ [57](#b57-ir-2020-00035)]. The authors proposed clinical study to be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TRF among UC patients. WHAT CLINICIANS SHOULD ADVISE THEIR PATIENTS ON THE AID? [Table 3](#t3-ir-2020-00035)summarizes the general recommended diet for IBD patients including the specific recommendations for CD and UC patients. However, there is limited information to guide clinicians on the use of specific dietary therapy as an adjunctive treatment for CD and UC. [8](#b8-ir-2020-00035), [58](#b58-ir-2020-00035)]. Specifically, foods such as milk/dairy, fried foods/fatty foods, spicy foods, vegetables, nuts, red meats, high fiber foods, and coffee were frequently reported to worsen the IBD symptoms [ [48](#b48-ir-2020-00035)]. IBD patients should focus on dietary pattern modifications compared to exclusion of specific foods particularly the nutrient-dense foods. 1. Potential Nutritional Inadequacy of AID [59](#b59-ir-2020-00035)]. [47](#b47-ir-2020-00035)]. Gluten-based cereals such as wholegrain-wheat based bread and brown rice are the major source of dietary fiber, thus IBD patients who practice GFD may be at risk of consuming inadequate fiber intake [ [60](#b60-ir-2020-00035)]. Taetzsch et al. [ [61](#b61-ir-2020-00035)] also found that healthy dietary recommendation developed with gluten-free menus have significantly lower protein, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E, folate, and sodium contents compared to gluten-containing menus. Furthermore, recent surveys conducted on the nutritional quality of gluten-free products available in markets also showed low content of protein with high fat and salt content compared to their equivalent gluten-containing products [ [62](#b62-ir-2020-00035)]. [63](#b63-ir-2020-00035)] analyzed the means of the 22-item quantitative questionnaire of calcium intake in 187 IBD patients and confirmed that the restriction of dairy products contributed to a lower intake of calcium in IBD patients compared to healthy controls. The main concern related to calcium and vitamin D deficiency is the adverse effect on bone health. Restriction of the dairy product might impact negatively on bone mineral density which in turn can increase the risk of osteoporosis [ [64](#b64-ir-2020-00035)]. The restriction of dairy-based products also contribute to inadequate intake of protein, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin B12, phosphorus, zinc and riboflavin [ [65](#b65-ir-2020-00035)]. 2. Recommendations for IBD Patients [Table 4](#t4-ir-2020-00035). For clinicians, when advising patients on AID, it will be very helpful to consider several factors including the severity of patient's current clinical conditions, assessment of nutritional status before AID implementation, patient's willingness to adhere with AID for long-term, and also the feasibility of the AID itself (e.g., cost of the specialty foods, food preparations constraints, and challenges during social gathering). As there is no specific diet designed to treat IBD, general diet for IBD patients as proposed by medical societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines related to IBD were summarized and "}
