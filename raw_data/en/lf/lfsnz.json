Dr. Ingard offers the following tips for families trying to get back to school and back to normal. Maximize your child's health Check that your child is up-to-date on their checkups with their pediatrician and are on target with recommended vaccines for their age. If children take medications, make sure they are on the right dose and have refills if needed. Get flu vaccines for all family members this fall and COVID vaccinations for those who are eligible. Remind children about the importance of handwashing and monitor them for signs of illness. Establish routines As soon as possible, get back on school-year sleep and eating schedules. Allow plenty of time for your family's sleep to get back on track and make sure everyone is eating breakfast. Avoid screen time before bed to get the most restful sleep and focus on nutritious foods to fuel children's bodies and minds! Mentally prepare Talk with children about what is happening, including schedule changes, what to expect from the day, riding the bus, etc. Having a visual calendar of daily routines or the week can be useful for many children. Most importantly, Dr. Ingard advises, try to remain calm and positive. \"There can be a lot of anxiety starting the school year, especially after so many changes in the last year,\" she said. \"Have open discussions with your child, ask questions about how they are feeling, and continue these conversations as they start the school year.\" Catherine Ingard, MD , welcomes new patients at MedStar Georgetown Pediatrics in Leonardtown, located at 26840 Point Lookout Road, Suite 5.

I wish I had a crystal ball that would let me see into the future. I, like so many others, would love the answer to the question we have all been asking since the COVID-19 pandemic began, \"When and how will this crisis end?\" Of course, no one truly knows. We can make educated guesses and scientifically vetted predictions, but the reality is simple: there are still many unknowns we will have to traverse before this pandemic is truly behind us. Yet, as a hospital president, I find myself filled with an ever-growing sense of hope rooted primarily in what I know to be fact: vaccines are making a difference and turning the tide, and the ground our healthcare workers are standing on is now firmer than ever. We have learned, we have grown, we have adapted, and, most importantly, we are resilient. The COVID-19 pandemic set us on a course we never could have predicted, and we have managed every twist and turn while still providing exceptional medical care to our community. I have to say, I am beyond proud. I am also grateful. Grateful to our staff for never giving up and always reaching higher. Grateful for our visionaries who continued to recruit and bring new specialists to our area, even during a pandemic. And grateful to our community for the outpouring of support and encouragement. My heart is warmed by the knowledge that many who entered our hospital ill and broken, have returned to the loving arms of their families healthier and happy to be home. As we enter into fall and set our sights on the holidays, I hope you take a few moments to be thankful for all that you have survived this past year and remember we are here for you. We will be by your side whenever you need us, just as our hospital has been for more than 100 years\u2014 holding hands, helping, healing, and hoping for a brighter tomorrow. Be well ... Christine R.

Preparation is the key to easing back-to-school anxiety4 | Healthy Living Fall 2021 Healthy Living Fall 2021 | 5facility, Rebecca became frustrated and decided to move ahead with the consultation with Dr. Chen. She was able to quickly set up an appointment at Dr. Chen's Leonardtown office. \"It was a pleasure meeting with Raelynn and her mom, Rebecca,\" said Dr. Chen. \"Raelynn had enlarged tonsils at the initial consultation, and based on Raelynn's history and her physical exam, it was obvious that she had sleep disordered breathing. The most common cause in pediatric patients for sleep disordered breathing is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. My advice was to take out her tonsils and adenoids. I felt confident a sleep study would only confirm the diagnosis and really wasn't necessary in this case.\" The next step for the three-year-old was surgery, which was scheduled for May 6. Even though COVID-19 precautions were still in place, Rebecca says she was never worried about taking her daughter to the hospital for the procedure. \"I wasn't worried at all about COVID,\" said Rebecca. \"I told Dr. Chen, 'As long as you are comfortable doing it, take them out. We don't need them; they aren't doing anything but making things worse.' I just wanted it fixed so we could all get some sleep.\" Raelynn and Rebecca made the short trip to the hospital from their home the morning of surgery. Raelynn was in and out of the operating room in less than an hour. \"I got to go back with her and held her until she went to sleep,\" said Rebecca. \"Dr. Chen said it would take about 20 minutes, but everything was a little larger, so it took a little longer. He came and talked to me after the surgery and came in to check on her in recovery. Before the surgery, he had called the hospital to make sure they had room for us to stay overnight since she was so young.\" The surgery didn't keep Raelynn down for long. \"The girl was eating a hamburger three days out of surgery, so she was fine,\" said Rebecca. \"I didn't know how she was going to do pain-wise, but she never complained. I kept her on pain medication for about five days, but after the fifth day, she never took any medication, and she was back to daycare, and I was back to work, and she was good to go.\" At one point during Raelynn's recovery, Rebecca called Dr. Chen's office concerned about her daughter's temperature, which had risen just over 100 degrees. \"Instead of his nurse calling, he personally called back,\" said Rebecca. \"Dr. Chen was amazing with Raelynn; I loved him.\" Just a couple of months following the operation, Raelynn and mom were sleeping soundly, each in their own bed, something mom is still getting used to. \"I have to check her to make sure she is breathing because she is so quiet; I don't hear her snoring or tossing and turning, she sleeps through the night,\" said Rebecca. \"She used to wake up and whine and fuss for me until she knew I was there, but now there is none of that, and she sleeps in her own bed. She's doing amazing.\"Surgery helps mother and daughter rediscover a good night's sleepEars, Nose and Throat A dream come true. Sleep is not something that came easily for three-year-old Raelynn Churchwell of Mechanicsville. For nearly six months, her mother, Rebecca Churchwell, had noticed Raelynn seemed to stop breathing throughout the night, causing her to wake repeatedly. Obviously worried about her daughter, Rebecca decided to mention it during Raelynn's three-year check- up with her pediatrician in March. \"She would go without breathing for what felt like forever, but it was probably only a minute or two. Sometimes I had to stimulate her to take a breath,\" Rebecca said. \"Raelynn slept with me so I could keep an eye on her.\" Shortly after her birthday in March, Raelynn's pediatrician confirmed what Rebecca suspected\u2014her daughter's tonsils were large and most likely obstructing her airway when she slept at night. The pediatrician recommended Rebecca take Raelynn for a sleep study and then to ear, nose, and throat specialist Frank Chen, MD . \"The pediatrician had never said anything before, but I don't think she ever really looked because Raelynn had never been sick\u2014she never had strep, or a sore throat, or tonsillitis,\" Rebecca said. After several weeks of trying to arrange the sleep study with a regional children's healthcare Could an ENT help you?

MedStar St. Mary's Hospital joins the experts at the American Cancer Society (ACS) and American College of Surgeons in urging patients to return to scheduling their recommended screenings, including mammograms (x-rays of the breast) to check for breast abnormalities that could be cancerous. Women 40 and older are urged to undergo regular breast screenings (earlier if you experience pain or other concerning symptoms)\u2014but approximately 32% of American women in this age range have not undergone a mammogram in the last two years, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Setting the Standards. Centered on Patients.Five reasons not to delay your mammogram. 5Time matters. Being proactive leads to better health outcomes. Cancer is at its most treatable in the early stages. Also, when caught early, women are more likely to be able to keep their breasts; localized cancers can often be removed without a mastectomy. 4Lumps aren't always felt. Mammograms use low-dose x-rays to create images of breast tissue, detecting lumps too small to feel during a self-exam. Most of these areas are not cancer. Still, it's important to check\u2014and document them. A historical sequence of mammograms is very helpful for radiologists, who will compare the images for breast changes. 3Family history isn't everything (though it's something). Approximately 85% of women with breast cancer have no known relatives with the disease, according to the ACS. On the flip side, having a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer almost doubles a woman's own risk of developing it. 2Discomfort is fleeting. Mammography generally takes 30 minutes or less. The x-ray itself takes only a few moments. To help minimize discomfort caused by compressing the breast for these images, try scheduling your mammogram soon after your period. Breasts are more likely to be sensitive just before and during your cycle. 1Facilities are safe. More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare facilities are well-equipped to welcome patients with safety protocols and processes\u2014such as staggering patients and enhanced cleaning\u2014in place. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month Honor the women in your life by scheduling a recommended mammogram\u2014and encourage them to do the same. Perform regular breast self-exams, follow up on any unusual symptoms or concerns, and speak with your provider on the appropriate timeline for you to get screened. Schedule your mammogram at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital's Outpatient Pavilion by calling 301-475-6399. Doctor's order required.

Gastroenterologists treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) , which is an umbrella term for disorders that cause chronic intestinal autoimmune inflammation. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the major types of IBD that affect the digestive system. Symptoms include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea or bowel urgency Gas and bloating Unexplained weight loss Mucus or blood in stool Drainage due to abnormal connection of gut to the skin Nausea and vomiting due to blockage of intestines \"While IBD disorders like Crohn's are lifelong conditions, there are many medical and surgical treatment options to manage symptoms and help patients live a pain- free, complication-free life, even without a cure,\" said Dr. Nath. \"I partner with patients to discuss ways to help them achieve remission and reduce the impact on their daily lives.\"The pain can come on without warning. For those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, it's all about managing symptoms to live well. \"Crohn's is an inflammatory condition of the digestive tract. Gastrointestinal symptoms are often the result,\" said Anand Nath, MD , board-certified gastroenterologist with MedStar Group Gastroenterology at St. Mary's. \"Many patients with Crohn's disease are diagnosed at a young age\u2014typically teens and twenties. It can present at any age, however.\" Ross Ellett was diagnosed at age 19. Compared to other Crohn's patients, the 37-year-old said he is \"fortunate\"\u2014 he rarely experiences the disease's common symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Mostly, his illness manifests as episodes of severe abdominal pain. The pain was intense enough to bring him to the Emergency Department (ED) at MedStar St. Mary's Hospital in late 2020. \"I'd been in remission for over a decade when I experienced what was, I learned, a Crohn's flare-up,\" said Ross, of California, MD. \"It's intense pain. I describe it to my wife as someone taking a hot metal iron and stabbing you in the abdomen. You can't sleep. You can't concentrate. It takes over your life.\" An estimated 3 million American adults have IBD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, though experts believe that, in a genetically susceptible individual, when immune system tries to fight off an invading virus or bacterium, an abnormal immune response attacks the cells in the digestive tract, too. Being a smoker could as much as double your risk of Crohn's; and genetics, with IBD often running in families. When Ross arrived at the ED last fall, Dr. Nath was the gastroenterologist on call to assist and develop a plan to move forward. He underwent a colonoscopy and MRI, and at a follow- up visit in the Outpatient Pavilion, Dr. Nath and Ross discussed a new medication to help his symptoms. In May, after clearing up an unrelated infection, Ross was able to begin taking a biological medication, also called a biologic\u2014a powerful genetically designed protein to interrupt signals from his immune system that were triggering the painful inflammation. Six weeks in, Ross is seeing positive changes. \"I haven't had to return to the emergency room [for pain] since starting the medication, which is progress for me,\" he said.Dr. Nath will order regular bloodwork, MRI scans, and complete colonoscopies to monitor how the medication is working. \"In a normal patient, the intestine looks like a long tube,\" Dr. Nath explained. \"In an individual with Crohn's disease, the intestine appears to have been squeezed due to inflammation, with a thickened wall. We should gradually see the intestine returning to a normal appearance as the inflammation reduces.\" Remission looks like more pain-free days than painful ones. Crohn's is a chronic condition with a focus on symptom management\u2014and for Ross, that's enough. \"Right now,\" he said, \"I'm feeling great.\" Meet Dr. Nath Anand Nath, MD , is a board-certified gastroenterologist accepting new patients in Leonardtown. Specializing in concerns of the digestive system, Dr. Nath treats conditions including acid reflux, celiac disease, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and ulcerative colitis, among many others.

Scholarship program enters second decade of support for area studentsexposure to a high volume of complex shoulder and elbow problems.\" While working with Dr. Johnston, the residents and fellow received invaluable clinical experience both in the exam room and the surgical suite, but their training goes much further during the six to eight weeks spent at Dr. Johnston's side. \"The clinical work is a big part of these programs,\" said Dr. Johnston, \"but coming from a purely academic setting, there are a lot of different aspects of a medical practice they don't get to see, for example: how to run a practice, how to negotiate, how to hire staff, and how to market yourself.\" Additionally, Dr. Johnston said there is extensive collaboration occurring in the region to bring the residents and fellows together with faculty from different hospitals. \"We are collaborating with people in Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and Baltimore to discuss cases, to talk about treatment plans, strategies, new technology, and hold educational conferences,\" Dr. Johnston said. Dr. Johnston has always had a strong interest in education, research, and driving the highest level of care in our community. He feels fortunate to \"pay forward\" his skill and experience to these visiting resident and fellow surgeons. \"Personally, it has been great for me. I have always enjoyed teaching and have done so nationally at industry-sponsored courses, but this is rewarding on another level,\" Dr. Johnston said. \"It has made me a better physician and allowed me to create lifelong friendships while positively impacting the lives of more patients. The experience has been outstanding.\" \"Working with Dr. Johnston was one of the best aspects of my residency training. He took extra time in clinic and in the operating room to provide a comprehensive shoulder and elbow education, ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques. In addition to this clinical training, he taught me numerous practice management skills and demonstrated compassionate care for his patients on a daily basis. He helped shape my career goals, and I am confident that he will be a lifelong mentor.\" \u2014 Andrew Curley, MD Peter Johnston, MD, left, with Roman Ashmyan, MD, who is in the MedStar Union Memorial Hospital Shoulder and Elbow Fellowship program. \"I feel honored and privileged to have worked with Dr. Johnston during my shoulder fellowship,\" said Dr. Ashmyan. \"He is an outstanding surgeon and has taught me cutting- edge techniques in shoulder surgery. His surgical skill and compassion for his patient is second to none. I hope to one day provide the same level of care for my patients.\"18 | Healthy Living Fall 2021 Healthy Living Fall 2021 | 19Support groups Bariatric Support Meetings are currently online only Sept. 11, Oct. 9, Nov. 13, 10 a.m. Call 301-475-6019.
