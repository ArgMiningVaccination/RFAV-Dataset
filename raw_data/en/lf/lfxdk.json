Should one use conventional means to support the immune system, or look to Nature to provide protection? We look at the potential risks of allopathic flu vaccination and investigate the advantages of the natural approach... Every year winter brings along with it a variety of influenza viruses that are constantly changing - stopping our body from building up a natural defense against it. Up until now we've been urged to start thinking about getting our loved ones vaccinated against influenza as early as March or April. However, the conventional flu vaccine is much ado about nothing, according to a new study showing that the annual shots aren't as effective as billed. (Dr T Jefferson, Cochrane Vaccines Field, Rome, Italy. October 28 issue, British Medical Journal) The Contoversy... In the United States, there has been a marked increase in flu vaccine recommendations - with children aged 6 months to 5 years being vaccinated against the flu. Researchers question the alarming lack of evidence for promoting vaccinations for children under the age of two. In addition, papers published by the same researchers found that the conventional flu vaccine is only mildly effective in treating the portion of the population most urged to get a vaccination - the elderly. Overall, it was concluded, that influenza vaccines have little or no effect on many influenza campaign objectives, such as hospital stay, time off work, or death from influenza and its complications. Closer to home, over the past few years there has been a steady decline in the use of conventional flu shots in South Africa. There are other problems and side effects associated with the conventional flu vaccine. Allopathic flu shots and oral vaccines contain live virus - that can cause mild flu-like symptoms and even severe allergic reactions and have also been associated with the development of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). It is always advisable to weigh up the benefits against the disadvantages when making the choice of whether or not to be vaccinated in a conventional manner. So what is the alternative to the conventional flu vaccine? Often we find ourselves dealing with the symptoms of flu as they hit us mid-winter with a vengeance. But the best line of defense is prevention. Symptoms of cold and flu are anything but pleasant, so it makes sense to do as much as we can before the cold and flu season - giving us a better chance of escaping the sniffles and sneezes. Having said this, it is also never too late to help the immune system and provide protection against the current flu strain. From a naturopathic point of view, frequent vaccination can weaken immune functioning and ultimately lead to ill health and more serious illnesses. Some people are not able to have a flu vaccination due to allergies or other conditions. (Flu vaccines are prepared on chicken embryos and are therefore not safe for those with egg and chicken allergies.) Whether or not you have yourself vaccinated, it is important to know that there are other choices that are equally effective without the side effects associated with conventional flu vaccines. One such choice is BaniFlu - a completely Homeopathic Flu Vaccine - 100% natural and safe for the whole family. BaniFlu - the oral homeopathic flu vaccine - no needles! BaniFlu is the natural, oral homeopathic answer to the flu vaccine! It uses a homeopathic preparation of the current year's Flu virus vaccine, without any of the toxic side effects that can occur as a result of the conventional flu vaccine (as no crude matter is injected into the blood stream). BaniFlu works to stimulate the body's \"vital force\", supporting and strengthening the body's immunity against the actual flu virus - thereby making it more resilient to the virus strains for the current year. Worldwide, a proprietary preparation is produced each year using the flu virus strains recommended by the World Health Organization for the year's vaccine production. BaniFlu has been formulated using the homeopathic version of these worldwide strains combined with homeopathic ingredients well known to support immune functioning. In this way, BaniFlu will also help to address common symptoms such as a cough, running nose, fever, chills, headache, sore throat, fatigue, muscle and joint pains, loss of appetite, gastric symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, it has been formulated for all ages and is recommended to protect the whole family against the flu virus. It is well tolerated with the conventional flu vaccine for those of you who feel the need to cover all your bases! For more info on BaniFlu, click here. Prevention is better than cure! Here are some tips to support your immune system: Exercise:As little as half an hour a day of gentle exercise can help fight flu. Research suggests that moderate daily exercise can help fend off the common cold. A study found that walkers experienced half the number of 'sick days' of cold symptoms as non-exercisers. Food For Fighting Flu:The correct eating plan can greatly reduce the risk of colds and flu and has the added benefit of helping us stay in shape during winter months when we are tempted to overindulge. Foods to boost your immune system include: Oranges, grapefruit and tangerines (packed with protective nutrients such as vitamin C, bioflavonoids and anti-oxidants that help to ward off winter colds and flu), Butternut, pumpkins and squash (these are all great sources of beta-carotene, one of the most powerful antioxidants in our winter protection pack), yoghurt, fish, (a fantastic source of zinc and the omega-3 fatty acids), Oysters (a great source of zinc) and herbal tea (Chamomile tea in particular has been applauded for it's strong antibacterial properties - explaining why the tea has long been attributed as a cold fighter).
