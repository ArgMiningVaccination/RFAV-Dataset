The use of meditation has been acknowledged as a potentially beneficial, low-risk intervention for individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or increased cardiovascular risk. Consequently, meditation has been suggested as an adjunct therapy to other guideline-based risk-reduction therapies.2 Additional expert opinion has observed that, although more and higher quality research is needed, mindfulness techniques have shown benefit in terms of blood pressure reduction, CVD-related mortality reduction, and symptom improvement in patients with heart failure. However, dietary supplementation, another modality of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM), has been less supported by the available research.3 \"With the increasing awareness of CIM in patients and clinicians, the present study aimed to reevaluate the use and frequency of CIM therapies in a contemporary cohort of CVD patients and compare these trends over time,\" noted Kavita Prasad, MD, of the Zumbro Valley Health Center, Rochester, Minnesota, and colleagues in The American Journal of Cardiology. \"Contemporary medical practice focuses on alleviating physical symptoms, and integrative medicine therapies have the potential to help by addressing the mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of health and disease,\" Dr. Prasad explained to MedPage Today. Focus on outpatients This cross-sectional prospective study entailed a survey of 964 cardiology clinic outpatients with CVD from June 2016 to mid-August 2018. The survey results were then compared with those from a similar 2009 survey conducted at the same outpatient clinic. Patients willing to participate who could understand English were included and no specific exclusions were imposed. The questionnaire was developed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic Research Center and was composed of 17 questions designed to assess participant demographic, history of CVD, and use of CIM. The survey also asked about respondents' attitudes towards future CIM use in managing CVD symptoms. CIM was stratified into dietary supplements and other types of CIM intervention (such as meditation, acupuncture, and massage). Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis, and exact Kruskal-Wallis were used as indicated in comparing the 2009 survey results with the 2018 results. Who's using complimentary care? Demographically, the surveyed 2009 and 2018 groups were similar in gender distribution (P = .84), with an increase in participant mean age from 66.0 years in 2009 to 63.5 years in 2018. The proportion of White participants decreased from 98.1% in 2009 to 91.2% in 2018. The rate of smoking was < 5% among participants in both cohorts. Heart-related symptom duration was shorter for the 2018 participants, with more of this group having had symptoms for < 1 year or 1 to 3 years. Also, the 2018 respondents experienced a lower rate of heart failure than did those in 2009. Yet, the 2018 participants had higher rates of angina-associated symptoms, bypass surgery, a history of coronary artery disease, coronary stenting or bypass surgery, coronary spasm, diabetes mellitus, heart attack, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux, when compared with those in 2009. Approximately 80% of participants used CIM in both groups, though less than half used CIM specifically for heart-related symptoms. Dietary supplements and non-dietary supplement CIM Overall, the frequency of supplement use was comparable between the 2009 respondents (75.4%) and the 2018 respondents (75.3%). The top 3 supplements reported were multivitamins, fish oil, and vitamin C. In the present study, the authors \"observed a significant increase in the use of coenzyme Q10 and a decrease in the use of folic acid.\"1 The reported use of non-dietary supplement forms of CIM for any reason significantly increased from 2009 (46.7%) to 2018 (55.1%) (P < .001). Yet, the rate of patients reporting using these forms of CIM specifically for heart-related symptoms remained low at 7.7% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2009. The rate of using CIM modalities including acupuncture, acupressure, homeopathy, massage, meditation, and naturopathy for general purposes significantly increased from 23.9% in 2009 to 28.5% in 2018 (P = .02). The rates of perceived CIM efficacy in improving heart-related symptoms were similar from 2009 to 2018, and remained relatively low, representing a minority of patients. For example, in the 2018 cohort, 23.8% of the patients reported an improvement in leg swelling, 18.8% reported an improvement in chest pain, and 14.6% reported improvement in shortness of breath. The rate of patients reporting CIM use to their physicians remained low at 14.4% in 2009 and 15.0% in 2018. Interest in future use of CIM for CVD-associated symptoms was expressed by 46.6% of the 2018 participants, who were most interested in massage, relaxation techniques, and stress management programs. Conversely, the 2009 respondents had expressed more interest in dietary supplements. Finally, both groups of participants cited the desire to supplement conventional therapy as the predominant motivation for an interest in CIM. Conclusion Overall, Dr. Prasad and colleagues found that the rate of CIM use among outpatients with CVD is high. \"A large proportion (42%) of patients use therapies for cardiac symptoms,\" the authors explained. \"Of note, an increase was observed in the use of mind-body therapies over time, especially meditation, yoga, and tai chi. This growth parallels the increased awareness in the medical community about the potential therapeutic benefit.\"2 Limitations The authors observed that limitations of the study included a lack of statistical power to evaluate differences in adverse CVD events in relation to CIM intervention. The small sample size, lack of controls, blinding, and thorough follow-up, and absence of patient randomization were also cited as study limitations. \"[T]he demand for mind-body therapies is substantial for cardiac symptoms,\" the authors noted. \"In order to improve wellbeing in patients with chronic conditions, physicians should discuss the use of integrative medicine therapies such as meditation and yoga as part of the healthcare plan,\" Dr. Prasad told MedPage Today.
