However, challenges including weak immunogenicity, systemic toxicity, and off-target effects of cancer vaccines remain as barriers to their broad clinical translation. Advances in the design and implementation of biomaterials are nowenabling enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity of cancer vaccines by controlling the presentation and release of vaccine components to immune cells and their microenvironment. Here, we discuss the rational design and clinical status of several classes of cancer vaccines (including DNA, mRNA, peptide/protein, and cell-basedvaccines) along with novel biomaterial-based delivery technologies that improve their safety and efficacy. Further, strategies for designing new platforms for personalized cancer vaccines are also considered. 1. Introduction Vaccines have made tremendous contributions to global health, having led to the elimination of small pox and near eradication of polio and diphtheria [2,3]. While these traditional, whole-pathogen based vaccines against infectious diseases have mostly proven successful, therapeutic cancer vaccines have achieved mixed clinical outcomes [4]. This is likely due to a number of factors, including biological barriers to vaccine delivery [5,6], inherently low tumor antigen immunogenicity [7,8], and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [7,9]. For a cancer vaccine to be effective, numerous requirements must be sa- tisfied in order to induce the desired immune response illustrated in Fig. 1. First, antigens need to be delivered to antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs) but also macrophages, neu- cells to a lesser [10,11]. Subsequently, APCs must process and cross-present tumor antigens to become mature and activate T cells (na\u00efve CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells) that reside in lymph nodes (LNs) [12]. Lastly, activated T helpercells (Th cells) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) need to infiltrate the tumor site to shift the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment towards a pro-inflammatory environment [13,14]. This altered micro- environment aids CTLs in killing tumor cells and is accompanied by other mechanisms for tumor cell killing (e.g. natural killer cell-medi- ated killing and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) [13,14]. While this approach to treating tumors holds considerable promise, only one cancer vaccine formulation to date has beenapproved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over several decades of investigation [15]. This is due, in part, to inefficient delivery in vivo where administered vaccines cannot successfully reach their desired targets [16-19]. Therefore, immunologists, engineers, and clinicians, in recent years, have focused significant efforts towards de- veloping new delivery materials for therapeutic cancer vaccines [18]. Recently, there has been exponential growth in research at the in- terface of biomaterial science, drug delivery, and cancer vaccines [20-34]. Various delivery approaches, such as have been widely utilized in combination with various forms of cancer vaccines (e.g. DNA, mRNA, peptide/protein, and cell- based vaccines), and their preclinical outcomes are promising. Re-searchers have demonstrated that biomaterial-based cancer vaccines have many key advantages over conventional vaccines [21,39]. Most notably, biomaterial-based cancer vaccines can be delivered to the body in a controlled manner, where finely tuning vaccine physical properties (e.g.size, shape, charge, or porosity) and targeting moieties can achieve selective delivery to target cells and tissues with desirable drug releasekinetics [40-48]. In this review article, we introduce classes of vaccines and their clinical status (Table 1), highlight the advances made at the interface of biomaterials science and cancer vaccination, summarize key biomaterials design criteria to effectively present and deliver cancer vaccines, and provide our insights into the future directions of cancer vaccine development. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.008 Received 10 August 2018; Received in revised form 6 October 2018; Accepted 8 October 2018Corresponding author at: Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States E-mailaddress: mjmitch@seas.upenn.edu (M.J.

Classes of cancer vaccines and their clinical status 2.1. DNAvaccines Early DNA vaccines were developed in the 1990s [49], when re- searchers found that plasmid DNA can induce potent antibody responses against an encoded antigen [49-51]. The design simplicity and promising preclinical studies quickly sparked an interest in developing DNA vaccines for a variety of infectious diseases [52,53]. Consequently, utilizing DNA vaccines to treat cancer has become an attractive strategy in cancer im- munotherapy [54]. When DNA contains unmethylated, repeating cytosine- guanine (CpG) motifs, they cause adjuvant effects that stimulate the innate immune system [55]. Thus, plasmid DNA can be designed to act as both antigen and adjuvant [56]. However, the large size and negatively charged backbone of naked DNA typically results in low cellular uptake and transfection in target cells, as well as off-target delivery [57-60]. There- fore, significant efforts have focused on developing methods to effectively deliver plasmid DNA into APCs. One commonly used strategy to enhance DNA uptake is electroporation (EP), which temporarily permeabilizes cell membranes with an electric pulse [61,62]. EP has been shown to increase antigen delivery by 100-1,000 fold compared to naked DNA vaccines alone [63]. EP also has adjuvant-like properties, as it can induce moderate tissue injury and generate pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can recruit APCs to the injection site [64]. Another delivery strategy is gene gun- mediated vaccination, where APCs are bombarded with plasmid DNA coated with heavy metals (e.g. gold particles) at the injection site, which decreases the required plasmid DNA dose by 100-1,000 fold [65,66]. Al-though several strategies have been explored to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines, most still possess low immunogenicity profiles in human trials for reasons not yet fully understood [58,67]. As such, few DNA vaccines have advanced beyond phase I or phase II clinical trials [68]. While low efficacy remains a significant challenge, benefits including the versatility, stability, scalability, and inexpensive manufacturing ofDNA vaccines have led to their further development and investigation[68]. Because DNA vaccines have been extensively explored, their safety is largely accepted, which has allowed a number of clinical trials to combine phase I and phase II stages to focus on evaluating efficacy over toxicity [69]. Though the first DNA vaccine for cancer (ONCEPT\u00ae) was approved in 2010 by the United States Department of Agriculture for canine melanoma based off of data from nonrandomized clinical trials, similar success has not been found when targeting human cancers [68,70]. DNA vaccine phase I and II clinical trials have been conducted for numerous cancers including melanoma [71], prostate [68], lym- phoma [72], and cervical [73,74], but most cases have shown little clinical efficacy [39,69,74]. Given that the most common side effects of the vaccines include fever, pain, and redness or swelling of the injection sites rather than more severe consequences like systemic toxicity, a major hurdle in clinical trials is therapeutic efficacy rather than toxicity [68,69]. The aforementioned methods of EP and gene gun-mediated vaccination have been implemented in clinical trials in an attempt to increase therapeutic effects, and both have shown promise. EP has been used in nearly half of the current DNA vaccine clinical trials, and has shown an ability to increase the immunological response induced by DNA vaccines for treating prostate cancer and melanoma [75]. Ad- ditionally, promising preclinical data has led to phase I and II clinical trials for gene gun-mediated vaccination in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer [73]. Thus, continued improvement of EP and gene gun-mediated vaccination strategies, or the investigation of biomaterial-based delivery systems [75-77] and DNA sequence optimi- zation [75,78], is necessary to enhance the efficacy of DNA vaccination. 2.2. mRNAvaccines mRNA vaccines are another promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches, as they are a non-infectious, non-integrating plat- form with high potency and the potential for low-cost, rapid Fig. 1.

Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 258manufacturing. Early work on mRNA cancer vaccines was reported in the 1990s, shortly after the discovery of DNA cancer vaccines [79]. A major advantage of mRNA over DNA vaccines is that mRNA does not need to cross the nuclear barrier to induce protein expression [80]. By not needing to cross this additional biological barrier, mRNA can be trans- fected more efficiently than plasmid DNA, especially for slowly dividing cells [81]. Currently, two types of mRNA are commonly utilized in vaccines: non-replicating and self-amplifying [82]. While self-amplifying mRNA is commonly in prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases [83-87], most mRNA cancer vaccines use non-replicating mRNA [88-92]. One of the most explored topics in non-replicating mRNA vaccines is sequence modification, as the innate immune system can sense unmodified mRNA and induce a robust type 1 interferon response, which reduces mRNA transfection efficacy [89]. Thus, several mod- re- gions the of pseu- douridine sequences\u2014have been utilized to increase mRNA stability. These modifications can also reduce immune sensing by toll-like re- ceptors (TLRs), retinoic RNA-activated receptors (PKR)[93-96]. Ad- ditional studies also demonstrated that removing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) contaminants from mRNA vaccines is essential for improving their therapeutic effect, as dsRNA is a potent pathogen-associated mo- lecular pattern that significantly suppresses mRNA translation [89,97-99]. While immune sensing is detrimental to mRNA transfection, it also provides a danger signal to the host which plays an important role in improving vaccine efficacy [100]. Therefore, an important step in the development of mRNA vaccines is finding the appropriate level of im- mune sensing that will maximize its danger signaling while minimizing its impact on mRNA transfection [82]. Another critical step in the im- provement of mRNA vaccines is addressing delivery challenges similar to those faced with DNA vaccines. Beyond conventional EP and gene gun- mediated vaccination approaches, a variety of biomaterial-based deliverysystems such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles have been ex- tensively studied, and the preclinical outcomes are promising [101-103]. More recently, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising delivery platform for mRNA vaccines, built off of recent success in deli- vering siRNAs in vivo and the recent (patisiran) by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals [104-108]. Though LNP-based mRNA vaccines are in early stages of development, they have shown great promise for treating multiple types of cancer [80,90,92,109], as well as Zika, Ebola, and influenza [110-113]. The success of LNP de- livery platforms in cancer vaccines, such as those for breast cancer [82], is likely due to their ability to increase mRNA cargo retention time invivo [109] and enhance mRNA intracellular delivery [114]. Drawbacks to LNPs include their accumulation in off-target organs such as the liver, and some instances of allergic reactions in human patients [82,109]. As with DNA, mRNA vaccine efficacy is highly variable between animal models and human clinical trials, as the method of mRNA uptake into the cytoplasm depends heavily on cell type [82]. Thus, while LNPs have achieved pro- mising preclinical results and have demonstrated some translatability into clinical settings, approaches to improve efficacy in human trials are being investigated [82]. One major development is RNActive (first developed by CureVac)\u2014a self-adjuvanted mRNA vaccine that includes strands complexed with cationic protamine [115,116]. In phase I trials for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and phase I/II trials for prostate cancer, RNActive has elicited favorable immune responses and extended patient survival [115,116]. With multiple modification methods to improve mRNA preparation, delivery, and overall efficacy, future work must explore how these techniques can be combined to enhance mRNA cancer vaccination. 2.3. Peptideandproteinvaccines Peptide- and protein-based cancer vaccines employ either fragments of proteins or whole proteins that are specifically expressed on tumorcells as antigen sources [117]. Peptide vaccines are typically chemically synthesized due to their short length, which is both time- and cost- effective [118]. In contrast, protein vaccines are typically obtained through more complex recombinant protein expression approaches [119]. An advantage of both peptide and protein vaccines is their high level of safety, which has been shown in many preclinical and clinical studies [118-120]. However, one major drawback of peptide and pro- tein vaccines is that they usually only target one or few epitopes of tumor-associated antigens (TAA)[121]. Because it is generally believed that multivalent antigen-specific CTL responses are necessary for cancer vaccination, a mixture of multiple antigens (peptides or proteins) is required to achieve desirable effects [121-123]. Additionally, while peptides and proteins are structurally different than DNA and mRNA, delivery vehicles are still necessary to enhance vaccine stability and targeting and reduce off-target effects [124-127]. In clinical trials, a number of the aforementioned limitations for peptide-based vaccines remain. Most clinical trials in progress rely on TAA-derived short peptides, with few investigating liposome-based delivery or longer peptide formulations [128]. Many of these vaccines fail when they reach phase III trials due to a lack of optimization of peptide formulation, vaccination schedule, peptide combination, or adjuvant selection [39]. However, early clinical trials have produced promising results. A vaccine based on the TAA mucin MUC1 for treating colon cancer was highly immunogenic in half the trial's 39 individuals and was able to elicit a long-term antitumor memory, which is im- portant for cancer prevention [129]. Similarly, two phase I/II trials il- lustrated that administering peptide vaccines for melanoma and ovarian cancer\u2014which used a combination of 6 and 12 peptides, re- spectively\u2014led to an increase in overall patient survival [130,131]. Though these promising early-stage results encourage the further in- vestigation of peptide vaccines, most of the vaccines that induce an immune response do not provide enough of a clinical benefit to be used alone [128]. Thus, further optimization of vaccines - along with thedevelopment of combination therapies - is needed. 2.4. DendriticCell(DC)vaccines The major target cell type for the previously described vaccines are DCs, which are essential for initiating antitumor immunity [132]. Thus, engineering DCs ex vivo could be more effective than administrating vaccinesinvivo, where only a small portion of vaccines reach DCs. DC vaccines, consisting of exvivo engineered DCs, are prepared by isolating DCs from patient blood, treating them with adjuvants (e.g. TLR agonistsor cytokines) to trigger DC maturation, and loading them with TAAs [133,134]. DCs are then injected back to the patient, where they migrate to the LN and prime na\u00efve CD8 +T cells to initiate antitumor immunity [134,135]. A major advantage of DC vaccines is that the DCs are treatedexvivo, so there is less concern over off-target effects compared to other approaches that require vaccine components to be administered directly into patients [135]. However, challenges of DC vaccine development include the complexity and substantial cost of cell biomanufacturing processes and the batch-to-batch variability between vaccines for in- dividual patients [136]. Although the first DC-based cancer vaccine, Si- puleucel-T (Provenge), was approved by the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer in 2010 [15], their commercialization is limited to few countries in part due to the high cost of treatment and the strict manu- facturing requirements for vaccine production facilities [137]. Because DC vaccine production methods and the resulting compo- sition vary greatly, it is difficult to compare clinical trials or generalize their outcomes. While success has been found with Sipuleucel-T and promising preliminary data emerges from phase I/II clinical trials [138], there have been a number of notable failures. Argos Ther- apeutics has had to halt their phase III clinical trial of a DC vaccine for renal cell carcinoma in response to the poor interim evaluation of the patients, which conflicts with promising results from earlier trials [139]. Similarly, phase III clinical trial results for a DC vaccine againstR.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 259melanoma showed no significant impact on patient survival or markers of recovery [138,140]. The failures of these studies however, could be due to the complex process of obtaining, maturing, and treating DCs. Because DCs can be loaded with antigens (e.g. DNA, mRNA, peptide, protein, and tumor lysate), or fused with live cancerous cells to gen- erate hybrid cells, there has yet to be a unified, perfected procedure for handling these cells [138]. Thus, a major focus in DC vaccine devel- opment is the optimization of exvivo DC protocols [39]. 2.5. Tumorcellvaccines Another approach for designing cancer vaccines is utilizing TAAs from isolated tumor cells that have been either resected from patients (autologous tumor cells) or lab-grown (allogeneic tumor cells) as an- tigen sources [141-143]. Because live tumor cells can produce im- mune-suppressive cytokines and potentially form new tumors in the body, they must be inactivated before vaccination [144]. The freeze- thaw method is one of the most commonly used strategies for killing tumor cells and obtaining TAAs [142]. The repeated freezing and thawing of tumor cells induces necrotic cell death and releases cellular compartments that contain TAAs [142,145,146]. Tumor cell debris and TAAs are then separated by centrifugation, and TAAs are collected from the supernatant [147-149]. Another commonly used method to trigger tumor cell death is irradiation, which induces apoptosis [142]. Unlike obtaining soluble tumor lysate antigens using the freeze-thaw method, irradiation is milder and allows for whole tumor cells to be obtained [142]. Both methods are commonly used to obtain TAAs, and many strategies have streamlined the loading of TAAs into biomaterial delivery platforms such as nanoparticles or scaffolds [147-149]. One major advantage of utilizing tumor cells as antigen sources is that, since there is an array of mutated tumor antigens presented on tumor cells, they can generate synergistic immune responses against multipletumor antigens, reducing the risk of tumor escape [144]. Additionally, if the tumor cells are autologous, antitumor immunity can potentially be individualized, which is considered more immunogenic than using universal tumor antigens [150]. Despite these advantages, drawbacks to using tumor cells also exist. For autologous tumor cells, similar to DC vaccines, the commercialization process can be challenging due to the high cost and strict requirements of production [150]. By contrast, allogeneic tumor cell vaccines\u2014though they can be produced at a lower cost and faster pace [150]\u2014may not contain patient-specific antigens, making them less effective [143,151]. As with DC vaccines, tumor cell vaccines vary widely in prepara- tion andexvivo treatment, making clinical trials very challenging to directly compare or generalize [126]. However, highly individualizedvaccines have had a number of notable successes [7]. The GVAX vaccine\u2014an allogeneic prostate tumor cell line that has been modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF)\u2014has had successful phase I and II trials that were able to in- crease the mean survival of patients with prostate cancer [152]. The results have led to GVAX being investigated for a range of cancer types in phase I clinical trials [142]. Similarly, the FANG vaccine\u2014a whole tumor cell vaccine with plasmid DNA as well as RNA incorporated into it\u2014showed promising phase I results when used to treat ovarian, breast, colorectal, and small cell lung cancer and has progressed into a phase II trial for treating melanoma, ovarian cancer, and colorectal carcinoma [153]. While these vaccines tend to have varying efficacy based on individual patients and cancer types, they may also provide insight into future optimization [142]. For example, a phase II clinical trial on the regression of pulmonary metastases in patients with melanoma reported antitumor responses in only 11 of the 83 evalu- able patients [154]. However, the study was able to correlate small volume lung metastases with an increased likelihood of responding the vaccine [154].3. Bridging biomaterials and cancer vaccines As discussed in the previous section, a considerable number of cancer vaccine trials have resulted in mixed outcomes, in part due to a lack of effective delivery methods [155]. Peptide cancer vaccines pro- vide a prime example, as the overall clinical response rate of patients vaccinated with unmodified and naked peptides is roughly 3%[156]. However, if a patient's DCs are isolated, treated with peptides exvivo, and infused back into the patient, an improved clinical response rate is observed [157]. This difference in patient response suggests that naked peptides have difficulty reaching DCs invivo, which may be one reason for their low efficacy in the absence of a DC delivery platform [157].Therefore, biomaterials are needed to help overcome the biological barriers to vaccine delivery invivo [158]. Because of the diversity in cancer vaccination approaches, multiple classes of biomaterials areneeded to overcome the various obstacles to delivery. Thus, biomater- ials used in cancer vaccines range from the nanoscale (e.g. liposomal and polymeric Nanoparticle-baseddeliverysystems of delivery liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, self-assembled nanoparticles, and lipid nanoparticles [18]. Using nanoparticles as carriers for vaccine can enhance delivery to certain organs or tissues such as the lymph nodes, spleen, or solid tumors [18]. Liposomes are one of the first studied nanoparticles for cancer vaccination [161], with some formulations featured in ongoing clinical trials (Table 1). Lipo- somes are an attractive option for rapid clinical translation, as multiple formulations are FDA-approved and can enhance delivery compared to free drug administration [162]. However- depending on the formula-tion and the delivery cargo - early generation liposomes can have disadvantages including low loading capacity and toxicity [163-165]. Another type of widely studied and FDA-approved nanoparticle-based drug carrier are polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nano- particles [166,167]. An advantage of using PLGA nanoparticles is that they can be accurately and consistently generated using well-estab- lished protocols that create a wide range of particle sizes [168]. How- ever, a disadvantage of PLGA nanoparticles is their low therapeutic cargo encapsulation rates [166,167]. One notable difference between liposomes and PLGA nanoparticles that affects their use as delivery systems is the characteristics of the therapeutic cargo they encapsulate [169]. Liposomes contain both a hydrophilic core and a hydrophobic bilayer that make them suitable for carrying hydrophobic and hydro- philic compounds [169]. PLGA nanoparticles have been used to en- capsulate a range of therapeutic cargo at varying rates and are parti- cularly well suited for the encapsulation and delivery of lipophilic cargo compared to liposomes [410-412]. To overcome the obstacles faced by these delivery systems, sig- nificant efforts have focused on chemically modifying liposomal or PLGA nanoparticle formulations in order to improve stability and cargo encapsulation rates [171,172]. From this work, rationally-designed classes of nanoparticles have been developed [18]. For example, self- assembled nanoparticles often have high loading capacities and have shown to successfully deliver peptides or nucleic acid-based vaccines [173-176]. LNPs, with their history of efficacious siRNA delivery, have been used extensively for mRNA vaccine delivery [82,177]. However, both self-assembled nanoparticles and LNPs are limited to specific an- tigen types, as their nanoparticle formulations largely rely on charge- based complexation [82,173,176]. Therefore, self-assembled nano- particles may be more suitable for antigens with easily modified se- quences (e.g. peptide) or defined charges (e.g. DNA or mRNA), while liposomes or polymeric particles may be more suitable for other antigen types (e.g. protein, tumor lysate or tumor cell)[161,178,179].R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 2603.2. Biomaterialscaffold-baseddeliverysystems Scaffold-based cancer vaccines refer to polymeric- and hydrogel- based scaffolds that are implanted or injected locally, to recruit and reprogram immune cells to elicit an antitumor response [18]. Due to their large size, these scaffolds are meant to remain at the implantation or injection site [18]. The scaffolds often encapsulate a variety of mo- lecules, such as antigens and immunomodulators, that can efficiently program the peripheral tissue and facilitate immune cell infiltration (the vaccine mechanisms are more extensively discussed in Section 5) [180,181]. Commonly used scaffolds for degradable and highly biocompatible [182]. PLGA is FDA approved but is not injectable in scaffold form and must be implanted [149]. Alginate-based hydrogels can be processed under cryogenic conditions to form cryogels, which have strong shape- memory properties that allow them to be injected instead of implanted into patients [182]. However, cryogels require large gauge needles that can result in tissue damage at the injection site [180]. Both PLGA and cryogel scaffolds have shown great success in encapsulating tumor cell derived antigens. PLGA is more commonly used for encapsulating tumor lysate antigen, while cryogels are used to encapsulate and deliver irradiated whole tumor cells [149,181,182]. Scaffolds consisting of MSRs with high aspect ratios are perhaps the easiest to inject, as they assemble to form three-dimensional structures in situ after injection [181]. However, MSRs have been used to encapsulate relatively small cargo (e.g. nucleic acids, peptides, or proteins), so they may not be suitable for encapsulating whole tumor cells as antigen sources [183]. Because the scaffolds need to encapsulate, present, and release cargo while allowing for immune cell infiltration, they are often designed to have porous structures [180,181]. These pores can be adjusted to ac- commodate different sizes and types of cargo. For example, cryogels with larger pores are well-suited for antigens of a larger size such as whole tumor cells - as they allow for immune cell infiltration while still efficiently encapsulating large cargo [184,185]. Additionally, chemical modifications to scaffolds can enable loading and immobilization of almost all vaccine types, including nucleic acids, peptides, tumor ly- sates, and whole tumor cells [18,186].Two major differences between nanoparticle- and scaffold-base cancer vaccines are the time duration that the cancer vaccine resides ina given tissue and the type of immune cell interactions they enable [182]. Nanoparticle, because of their small size, can be internalized easily by APCs in tissues or LNs shortly after interstitial immunization [6]. Scaffolds, due to their large size, interact with immune cells via encapsulated therapeutic cargo that can be released over a prolonged period of time [158]. Therefore nanoparticles often require repeated vaccination to achieve effective antitumor immunity, while scaffolds can achieve desirable antitumor responses with single or few doses [123,187]. Nevertheless, similar to other prophylactic single-dose vaccines (e.g. microparticle-based vaccines), challenges with scaffold- based vaccines could include whether encapsulated antigens or ad- juvants remain stable within scaffolds after administration in vivo [188]. However, for antigens that are difficult to collect or processedfrequently (i.e autologous tumor cell antigens), scaffolds may be more desirable, as their vaccination schedule generally requires less frequent dosing than nanoparticle-based vaccination [123]. 4. Biomaterial vaccines for lymph node (LN) delivery 4.1. LNtargeting LNs and their surrounding microenvironment contain a large, di- verse population of cell types (e.g. APCs, T cells, and lymphatic en- dothelial cells) that orchestrate immune responses [189,190]. There- fore, targeting LNs is a promising strategy for controlling vaccine efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings [27,191]. While intranodal injections have shown great promise in delivering vaccines to LNs [192], this technique typically requires an invasive surgical procedure [193,194]. Instead, interstitial injections (e.g. subcutaneous, intradermal, and intramuscular) are a more accessible route of ad- ministration and are commonly utilized for vaccination [195-197]. Though successful in preventing some diseases (e.g. hepatitis B, smallpox, and measles-mumps-rubella [198-200]), their broader ap-plications have been severely limited due to pre-existing biological barriers that prevent interstitially administered vaccines from reaching LNs. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated that the physical Fig.2.

However, small vaccines (less than 2 nm) can easily enter blood vessels andresult in systemic dissemination. Materials with high surface density PEGylation or anionic surfaces can enhance vaccine accumulation in LNs, but can alsohinder their uptake by DCs. Cationic vaccines canexhibit stronger uptake by DCs, but can suffer from inefficient delivery to LNs.R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 261and chemical parameters of vaccines, such as size, charge, surface properties, and material chemistry, can dramatically alter vaccine biodistribution (Fig. 2). Of these factors, the size of a vaccine and its delivery system are among the most studied characteristics [44,201,202]. Vaccine size is a key factor that affects biodistribution upon interstitial injection, due to the differences between blood and lymphatic vessels that reside in the interstitial space [203]. While vascular endothelial cells form tight junctions (less than 10 nm in size) around blood capillaries, lymphatic endothelial cells form discontinuous junctions (hundreds of nanometers in size) surrounding the lymphatic capillaries [16]. Additionally, blood flow rates through vascular capillaries are 100-500 times greater than lymphatic capillaries [16]. As a result, when a vaccine is less than 2 nm in size, it can cross tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells and preferentially enter blood vessels [204]. Upon entering a blood vessel, vaccines encounter many obstacles to delivery, including serum- induced instability and the mononuclear phagocyte system that rapidly clears vaccines [205]. In contrast, vaccines over 200 nm in size are excluded from directly entering lymphatic vessels via passive diffusion [206] and must rely on tissue-resident APCs for transport to LNs. Therefore, the ideal vaccine size ranges from 2 to 200 nm, which re- duces blood vessel entry and systemic dissemination while enabling entry into lymphatic vessels. In addition to size, charge is an important factor that affects vaccine trafficking and transport via APCs within LNs. Because of the negatively charged phospholipid bilayer structure of cell membranes, anionic vaccines create a repulsive force with cells that dampens cell-vaccine interactions. While surface repulsion decreases cell contact to aid vac- cines transport within the lymphatic vessel [201,207], it also inhibits uptake by APCs after they reach LNs. In contrast, cationic vaccines exhibit stronger cell-vaccine interactions, but may become trapped within the interstitium or lymphatic endothelium and ultimately not reach LNs [16,201,207]. Despite their limitations, cationic nano-particles for vaccine delivery are heavily investigated and have shown promising experimental results [208-211]. Dampening of surface charge via incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in vaccine for- mulations also impacts cell-vaccine interactions, which ultimately in- fluences LN drainage [212]. PEG is also hydrophilic, and therefore PEGylated vaccines have decreased interactions with hydrophobic cell membranes [213,214] and excel at accumulating in LNs [215,216]. To increase vaccine uptake in cells of interest (e.g. DCs), further surface modifications, such as incorporation of cell-penetrating peptides or DCligand targeting sequences, are worth consideration [217,218]. 4.2. DCtargeting Targeting DCs in is a promising for na\u00efve CD8 +T cells and initiating antitumor immunity [223,224]. However, there are several challenges in delivering vaccines to DCs. First, other phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) compete with DCs to uptake exogenous antigens, which reduces antigen uptake by DCs[92,225]. Mature DCs also have reduced endocytic rates, which lowers their capacity to internalize and process antigens [226]. Further, many vaccines utilize PEGylated or anionic surface coatings to improve bio- distribution to LNs [27,212,227], but their internalization by DCs can then be limited by steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion between cell membranes and the PEGylated or anionic surface of the vaccine (Fig. 2) [201,228]. Therefore, once vaccines reach the LNs, additional strategies are required to enhance uptake into DCs residing in LNs. DCs can be classified into several such as CD8 +DCs, plasma- cytoid DCs, and CD11c, MHC-II, DEC-205, DC-SIGN, and CD40, reviewed in [229]). Thus, actively targeting specific DC ligands has become an attractive approach to reduce off-target ef- fects [230]. Among those receptors expressed on DCs, DEC-205, DC- SIGN, and CD40 have been the most successful as targeting moieties[231-234]. Antibody-functionalized vaccines allow for not only im-proved targeting specificity, but also the capacity to enhance antigen cross-presentation [218,235,236]. Though promising, antibody pro- duction can be time- and cost-intensive [237]. Therefore, recent work has focused on utilizing short peptide fragments, such as the WH pep- tide [238] and NW peptide [239], to target DC surface receptors and improve vaccine efficacy [240]. This strategy has been very successful for peptide-based vaccines, as a DC-targeting peptide can be tethered to the peptide epitope during vaccine synthesis [239,241]. 4.3. Antigenandadjuvantco-localizationorsegregation Advancements in the development of molecular adjuvants such as TLR agonists, have accelerated the development of cancer vaccines, as traditional adjuvants (e.g. alum and Freund's adjuvant) typically fail to induce potent CTL and Th1 immune responses [26,242-244]. An im-portant discovery from the last decade is that the co-delivery of antigen and molecular adjuvants encapsulated within a biomaterial carrier tends to induce stronger immune responses than the delivery of soluble antigens and adjuvants in the absence of a carrier [245]. This concept prompted the development of various biomaterial-based vaccines, encapsulated within a single nanoparticle platform. Additionally, recent results demonstrated that encapsulating antigens and adjuvants in separate particles induced similar or even stronger immune responses than platforms containing both antigen and adjuvant within a single nanoparticle platform [254-256] (Fig. 3A). In the above mentioned studies, it is important to note that co-en- capsulation of antigens and adjuvants into the same nanoparticles or separation into different nanoparticles does not impact the biodis- tribution of the cargo [254]. Both delivery strategies include nano- particles that can be trafficked to LNs and subsequently taken up by APCs in a similar manner [254]. However, once the antigen and ad- juvant reach to the same APCs, they could still need to separate as antigens and adjuvants may function in different cellular compartments [257-262]. Therefore, segregating antigens and adjuvants into separate nanoparticles allows them to be easily divided and transported to the desirable cell compartments after they both reach APCs. The im- portance of antigen and adjuvant segregation is further supported by recent work, where a vaccine with chemically-tethered antigens and adjuvants induced weaker immune responses than the vaccine with hydrophobically associated antigens and adjuvants [260] (Fig. 3B). Hence, while antigens and adjuvants need to be taken up by the same APC in LNs, they may not necessarily have to be encapsulated in the same particle or chemically linked together to be effective. Chemical modifications of antigens and adjuvants are frequently utilized to induce their co-localization [208,263-266]. However, sev- eral factors need to be taken into consideration when modifying anti- gens and adjuvants for cancer vaccines. For instance, peptide terminus modification can affect the capacity of peptides to be cross-presented via the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I)[267]. Therefore, it is important to consider the effect of cross-presentation when modifying cancer epitopes (e.g. neoantigens), as potent antigen-specific CTL re- sponses are a key factor for antitumor immunity. Additionally, terminus modification methods for adjuvants can greatly affect their activity\u2014as shown by CpG, a TLR-9 agonist. As one of the most commonly used adjuvants for cancer vaccine development, it has been modified using various strategies, and experimental results demonstrated that the 5' end of CpG is critically important for interacting with its receptor, TLR-9[268]. Thus, modifications on the 3' end of CpG maintain its bioac- tivity, while 5' modifications diminish adjuvanticity [268-271] with limited exceptions [225,272]. Another commonly utilized adjuvant, Pam 2C, a TLR-2 agonist, has also demonstrated changes in bioactivity resulting from chemical modifications. The structure of Pam 2C includes a -COOH group that makes it easy to conjugate with peptides, but theR.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 262adjacent amino acid residues appear to play an important role in modulating Pam 2C adjuvanticity [273-276]. Therefore, directly con- jugating antigens to Pam 2C can decrease Pam 2C adjuvanticity (Fig. 3B) [260,275], and strategies such as using an extra linker between Pam 2C and the peptide epitope must be explored to prevent diminished ad-juvanticity. 5. Biomaterial scaffolds for localized vaccine delivery 5.1. Fromphysicaladjuvant\"scaffolds\"tobiomaterialscaffolds Although DCs are abundant in secondary LNs, significant numbers of DCs also reside in the skin and circulate in blood [277,278]. While these DCs are accessible targets for therapeutic delivery, it remains challenging to selectively deliver antigens while avoiding off-target cells and tissues. To overcome this, delivery technologies that recruit DCs to specific peripheral tissue can concentrate these cells at a given site to deliver antigen cargo while avoiding systemic toxicity [279,280]. Subsequently, these DCs can be activated insitu with addi- tional reagents and then migrate to LNs to initiate immune responses[281]. Early examples of recruiting DCs to peripheral tissue were employed in the 1920s with alum adjuvant [282]. It was originally thought thatalum would function as a depot that sustainably releases antigen to LNs [283]. However, recent research has found that alum acts like a \"scaffold\", as it stimulates chemokine and cytokine induction at the injection site, which subsequently recruits and activates DCs in situ [284-286]. Other types of adjuvants including Freund's adjuvant,Montanide, MF59, and ASO4 have also been used in this strategy[287,288]. However, the application of these physical adjuvants incancer vaccines is quite limited because they typically initiate strong Th2 but weak Th1 and CTL responses [289]. Nevertheless, potent Th1 and CTL responses are essential for cancer vaccines because Th1 cells produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (most notably IFN-) that alter the immune-suppressive microenvironment, while CTLs are responsible for the direct killing of tumor cells [290-293]. Therefore, new vaccine scaffolds capable of triggering potent Th1 and CTL responses are an emerging need in cancer vaccine development [294,295]. The design of these scaffolds must address several en- gineering criteria: first, the scaffold should contain chemical signals, such as cytokines or chemokines, that enable DC recruitment [296]. Additionally, a 3D macroporous structure that enables DC infiltration is required [297]. After infiltration, DCs need to be able to uptake antigen within the scaffold and undergo maturation. Therefore, TAAs are in- corporated within the scaffold and function as antigen sources [180,181]. Additionally, TLR agonists are usually included to help in- duce potent Th1 and CTL responses [123,298]. Collectively, the design requirements for this ideal system are too complex to be addressed by traditional physical adjuvants. As an alternative approach, biomaterials have recently been used to develop cancer vaccine scaffolds to address these needs, and their design is being continuously improved to en- hance vaccine delivery (Fig. 4). 5.2. Implantablescaffold Early studies employing biomaterial scaffold-based vaccines were conducted in 2002, using ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA)-based biomaterials [299]. In protein 3b (MIP-3b) and Fig.3. Co-localizing antigen and adjuvant to the same APCs can be achieved without the need for physical (A) or chemical linkage (B). (A). Antigen and adjuvant are delivered separately by different nanoparticles but are still co-localized within the same APCs in LNs, thereby inducing similar immune responses as when antigens and adjuvants are engineered into the same nanoparticle. Adapted from [254]. (B). When antigen and adjuvant are covalently tethered, the resulting vaccine formulation induced lower immune responses than when antigens and adjuvants are hydrophobically associated. Adapted from [260].R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 263TAA were entrapped in separate EVA tubes and co-implanted sub- cutaneously in mice [299]. MIP-3b was used to Langerhans cells (LCs) that subsequently load TAA insitu [299]. Three different tumor models, including E.G7-OVA, fibrosarcoma, and Lewis lung carcoma,were evaluated using this scaffold [299]. Mice that received multiple doses of EVA vaccine showed significantly inhibited tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings [299]. The success of this proof-of-concept study encouraged researchers to develop other ra- tionally designed cancer vaccine scaffolds, which led to the utilization of PLGA\u2014an FDA-approved, biodegradable polymer [167]. In this model, PLGA scaffolds using a process [300], agonists (CpG or poly(I:C)), and tumor were incorporated into the structure [149,301,302]. GM-CSF wasreleased from the PLGA scaffold over a 30-day period, which created a cytokine gradient to recruit DCs [149]. The recruited DCs then en- countered TAA and danger signals, matured, and subsequently mi- grated to LNs [18,294]. This and attenuating TGF-, IL- 10, and FoxP3 regulatory T cells [149]. The scaffold has demonstrated great efficacy in a mouse xenograft model of melanoma, as a single dose implantation protected up to 90% of mice from melanoma cell chal- lenging, while two doses led to complete melanoma regression in 47% of the mice [149]. 5.3. Injectablehydrogelscaffold Although PLGA scaffolds have shown great promise, one drawback of this approach is that it requires surgical implantation [303]. Therefore, recent studies have focused on developing injectable cancer vaccine scaffolds [180,181,298]. Cryogels are one of the first injectable scaffolds for cancer vaccination [180,304]. To form cryogels, metha- crylated-alginate is first polymerized at -20 \u00b0C, allowing ice crystals to form within the cryogel structure [180,304]. Subsequently, the cryogels are exposed to room temperature, allowing ice crystals to thaw and leave behind macropores [180,304]. An important feature of cryogels is their shape-memory properties, which allows them to recover their intended configuration after a 16-gauge needle injection [304,305]. To test their bioactivity as a cancer vaccine, cryogels were loaded with GM-CSF, CpG, and irradiated tumor cells, then injected subcutaneously in a mouse model of melanoma. Results indicated that the cryogel induced a higher survival rate in mice than the previously investigated PLGA scaffolds, when the same immunization schedule was applied [180]. This cryogel required a more invasive 16-gauge needle, which created large wounds at the injection sites [184]. To improve injectability, a second generation cryogel was developed by incorporating additional ionic crosslinks to improve its elasticity, and it was injected through an 18-gauge needle without any damage to its structure [184]. Another strategy for designing injectable cancer vaccine scaffolds is inspired by stimuli-responsive hydrogels, which have been widely used in biomedical research [306-309]. One thermo-responsive polymer, monomethoxypoly (ethylene glycol) - co-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymer (mPEG-PLGA), has shown great promise as it is injectable at 4 \u00b0C, but turns into a gel within 5 min at body temperature [298,310]. When the scaffold is loaded with GM-CSF, it is released over a 15 day period and recruits DCs to the scaffold site [298]. Interestingly, the most potent antitumor immunity was generated when a lentivirus-encoding antigen and adjuvant (CpG or MPLA) were administered 7 days post- injection of a hydrogel loaded with GM-CSF, which extended survival in a mouse model of melanoma [298]. This indicates that there may be a time period between DC recruitment signaling and DC activation sig- naling from the scaffold that can affect therapeutic efficacy. More re- cently, researchers demonstrated that these hydrogels can be used to encapsulate nanoparticles loaded with antigen, in addition to soluble antigen [311]. This dual delivery system enhanced antigen uptake by recruited DCs and induced potent CTL responses, indicating that it is a platform worth further investigation for vaccine delivery [311]. 5.4. Injectablemesoporoussilicamicro-rod(MSR)scaffold MSRs have recently emerged as another system for cancer vaccina- tion [312-314]. Mesoporous silica has been used in many biomedical applications because of its high biocompatibility [315-317]. For cancer vaccine scaffolds, hexagonal MSRs with certain aspect ratios(88 m \u00d7 were synthesized. MSRs are injectable after recon- stitution in PBS, but, because of their high aspect ratio, they non-speci- fically self-assemble after injection and generate pores that are large enough to enable cell infiltration [181,312]. A single dose of MSRs loaded with TAA, GM-CSF, and CpG induced potent antitumor immunity, which protected 90% of mice from EG7.OVA lymphoma cell challenging Fig. 4. Schematic of biomaterial-based scaffold Various classes of TLR-agonists) can be im- planted or injected to peripheral tissue for vaccination. Immature DCs (iDCs) are then recruited to the scaffold, become mature DCs (mDCs), and migrate to lymph nodes (LNs) to initiate antitumor immunity.R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 264[181]. Interestingly, a single dose of MSR vaccine also induced durable antibody responses [181]. This indicates that MSRs may also be used for other types of vaccines, such as Zika, Ebola, and Plasmodium falciparum, where the circulation of high-titer antibodies are crucial for disease prevention [318-320]. A second generation of MSR scaffolds were fur- ther modified by MSR sti- mulate multiple damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptors and exert potent adjuvanticity, which assists in DC activation and cross- presentation [123,321,322]. When loaded with GM-CSF, CpG, and TAAs, a single dose vaccination of PEI-MSR scaffolds eradicated established, large TC-1 tumors in 80% of mice [123]. Moreover, PEI-MSR scaffolds were shown to eradicate established lung metastases when combined with an anti-CTLA4 therapy [123]. 6. Biomaterials for tumor targeting and tumor modification 6.1. Immunomodulatorsturningtumorsiteintoantigendepot In the 19th century, a surgeon named William Coley discovered that repeated intratumoral injections of bacterial lysate reduced the pro- gression of carcinomas [323]. However, it was not until almost a cen- tury later that researchers identified CpG, an immunomodulator, as the key component of the lysate that induced tumor regression [324,325]. Since this discovery, delivering immunomodulators directly to tumors has become an attractive strategy for cancer immunotherapy [326-331]. Although immunomodulators do not display antigens, they can turn tumor sites into antigen depots by inducing tumor cell death and releasing tumor antigens insitu [332-335]. Subsequently, tumor antigens are taken up by DCs that either reside in the tumor stromal area or are recruited to this area. After DCs mature, they migrate to LNs and generate systemic antitumor immunity [332,335] (Fig. 5). In many studies, checkpoint blockade therapies are combined in order to improve the therapeutic outcomes of cancer vaccines by re- ducing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [336]. For instance, CTLA-4 antibodies are used to block CTLA-4 receptors (highly expressed on exhausted T cells) that reside in tumors, which strengthens the co-stimulatory signals (CD28 and B7 engagement) for T cell activation and subsequent enhancement of T cell effector function [336]. In addition, blocking PD-1 (highly expressed on exhausted Tcells) and its ligand PD-L1 (highly expressed on cancer cells) serves thesame purpose\u2014to improve T cell activation (Fig 6) [337]. 6.2. Intratumoralinjection Intratumoral injection is one of the earliest and most direct methods for delivering immunomodulators to tumor sites [339]. Many types of immunomodulators, such as TLR agonists, stimulator of interferon gene (STING), chemotherapeutics, cytokines, and antibodies have been used in intratumoral injections [326,340,341]. However, because of their small size, these therapeutics can rapidly leak out of the tumor and enter the circulatory system within minutes, causing systemic toxicity [342-344]. Thus, various types of biomaterials have been developed to increase the retention time of immunomodulators at tumor sites [345]. Several particle-based delivery systems, [348-350], and inorganic nanoparticles [351,352] have been shown to enhance retention of immunomodulators in the tumor microenvironment and reduce systemic toxicity. Hydrogel- based delivery systems are also an attractive platform to increase drug retention at tumor sites [45,353,354], and their distinct degradation profiles allow for therapeutics to be slowly released with finely tuned kinetics [158,355-357]. As prior reports have shown that chemotherapy enhances immunotherapy efficacy [358-360], a recent study designed a hydrogel system to release chemotherapeutics faster than im- munomodulators [45]. In the design, gemcitabine (GEM), a chemother- apeutic, had a smaller molecular weight than the checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-L1), allowing it to release faster from the hydrogel [45] (Fig. 7). The results indicated that a single dose injection significantly prolonged survival in mouse xenograft models of melanoma and breast cancer [45]. Therefore, intratumorally-injected hydrogels formulated to release im- munomodulators in a controlled manner have become a promising di- rection in cancer vaccine development. 6.3. Systemicinjectionandtumortargeting Though intratumoral injections show promising efficacy, one chal- lenge to their broad implementation is that they are not a viable option for less accessible and disseminated metastatic cancers [345]. To overcome this obstacle, new strategies have been developed that utilize systemically administered vaccines that are able to reach the tumor site Fig. 5. Immunomodulators turn tumor sites into antigen depots and induce antitumor immunity. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) destructs tumor cells and effectively generates TAAs. TAAs are then cap- tured by DCs and transported to LNs, which promotestrong antitumor immunity when combined with anti-CTLA-4. Adapted from [335].

Targeting solid tumors via systemic injection requires long drug circulation times in the blood to increase the chances that the drug will reach the tumor [361]. Several factors affect the circulation time of drugs in the blood. Size is one of the most frequently studied topics, as smaller drugs (less than 8 nm) are vulnerable to renal clearance while larger particles (over 200 nm) tend to accumulate in the spleen and liver where they are processed by MPS cells [362,363]. PEGylation is another important parameter in increasing circulation time, as PEGylated particle surfaces help decrease non-specific interactions with the large population of phagocytic cells in the blood that work to opsonize foreign substances [364-367]. However, highly PEGylated nanoparticles may cause anaccelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon in later dosing [368].The ABC phenomenon occurs when repeated exposure to PEG (on particles or in therapeutic modifications) leads to the increased pro- duction of anti-PEG antibodies, which phagocytosis [368]. PEGylated nanoparticles are then cleared to the liver more rapidly, and the decreased blood circulation time limits vaccine efficacy [369,370]. Therefore, newly developed non-fouling materials, such as zwitterionic peptides or polymers, are worth consideration for incorporation in future nanoparticle platforms to reduce the effects of the ABC phenomenon [369,371-373]. Although drug shape also plays an important role in drug circulation time [374-377], its effect in tumor accumulation is still under investigation. Fig.6.

Reprinted with permission from AAAS.R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 266Because different tumor types possess different vascular wall pore sizes [376], specific drug shapes may accumulate differently depending on the type of tumor [362,378]. Overall, nanoparticles with a densely PEGylated surface tend to accumulate more at tumor sites, in a process known as passive targeting [362,379]. One recent example was a study using a highly PEGylated, 100 nm PLGA particle carrying TLR-7 ago- nist, which accumulated in the tumor following systemic injection [334]. When combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with in- docyanine green (ICG), it inhibited tumor growth and induced im- munological memory in mouse models of breast and colorectal cancer [334] (Fig. 8). Although passive targeting has shown great promise in aiding drugs accumulation at tumor sites, further strategies\u2014such as actively targeting cancer cells or tumor endothelium\u2014are worth con- sideration to further increase the efficacy of vaccines [191,380-384]. 6.4. Leveragingtumorcellmembranesfornanoparticle-mediatedvaccine delivery Another important strategy for utilizing tumor sites as antigen sources, as reviewed in Section 2.5, is processing resected tumor cells. Common methods for obtaining TAAs from tumor cells include freeze-thawing and irradiation [142,145,146]. Many strategies have streamlined the subsequent step of loading the collected TAAs onto delivery systems such as nano- particles or scaffolds for applications in cancer vaccines [147-149]. In a manner similar to obtaining TAAs from tumor cells, tumor cell membranes have recently been isolated through hypotonic lysing and mechanical ruption for coating delivery [385]. In one example, TAA-abundant tumor cell membranes were coated onto the surface of adjuvant-loaded nanoparticles to create a tumor membrane- coated nanoparticle vaccine [253,385] (Fig. 9A). When utilized in a pro- phylactic setting, three doses of the vaccine protected 80% of mice from a melanoma cell challenge [253]. When used in a therapeutic setting, four doses of the vaccine combined with checkpoint blockades induced long- term survival in 50% of melanoma tumor-bearing mice [253]. In addition to coating nanoparticle surfaces with tumor cell mem- branes, another recent study investigated the reverse strategy, wheretumor cell surfaces were coated with nanoparticles [252]. In this study, isolated tumor cells were first treated with the chemotherapeutic mitox- antrone to trigger immunogenic cell death [252]. Subsequently, the dying tumor cells were purified and decorated with adjuvant-loaded nano- particles to form a nanoparticle-coated tumor cell vaccine [252] (Fig. 9B). In this study, a single dose of the vaccine protected all mice frommelanoma cell challenging [252]. Additionally, a single dose of the vac- cine combined with multiple doses of a checkpoint blockade induced complete tumor regression in almost 80% of mice with colon carcinoma [252]. A major advantage of the tumor membrane-coated nanoparticle vaccine and the nanoparticle-coated tumor cell vaccine is that they closely mimic many natural properties of cancer cells [251,385]. However, sev- eral challenges, such as large scale production and batch-to-batch varia- bility, currently exist and can hinder their future commercialization [126]. 7. Outlook - towards personalized cancer vaccines Identification of TAAs has long been a central driving force behind the development of tumor-specific cancer vaccines [7,386,387]. Most TAAs currently in clinical use are self-tumor antigens, as they are derived from healthy cells with a normally expressed protein that is over- expressed on cancer cells [7]. This strategy has led to the successful discovery of many TAAs, such as MAGE1 (a melanoma associated an- tigen), NY-ESO-1 (a cancer-testis antigen), and HER-2 (a breast cancer associated antigen)[388-390]. Though the identification process has proven promising, early clinical investigations have had limited success, likely due to several important factors [7,8]. First, every tumor has a unique pattern of somatic mutation that generates many different copies of TAAs, but identified self-tumor antigens are usually only a small fraction of the TAAs that share common features between individual patients [8,391,392]. Therefore, administration of only self-tumor anti- gens can result in tumor escape [393]. Second, as the self-tumor antigens are also expressed in healthy tissue, they are subjected to a certain degree of central tolerance and are often recognized by T cells with low affinity, resulting in low immunogenicity [7]. Moreover, the antitumor immunity developed against those self-tumor antigens can also attack these anti- gens expressed on normal cells, which may cause off-target autoimmune effects [8]. Collectively, new strategies are needed to discover patient- specific TAAs that are expressed exclusively on cancer cells. Next generation sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cancer mutations [394,395]. More importantly, recent advancements allowing for a reduction in the time and cost of sequencing provide unique opportunities for researchers to identify tumor antigens on an individual patient basis [7,8,396-398]. Thus, experimental and com- putational pipelines have been generated to identify personalized tumor antigens in real-time (Fig. 10) [7]. In one approach to formulate personalized cancer vaccines, DNA and RNA from both normal cells and cancer cells are extracted [7]. Subsequently, whole exosome sequencing Fig.8. Schematic of passive 100 nm nanoparticles with a densely PEGylated surface were injected intravenously and passively accumulated in tumors. When combined with PDT therapy, tumor cells were disrupted and released TAAs. The TAAs were subsequently captured by DCs and transported to LNs, which promoted strong antitumor immunity with the help of anti-CTLA-4. Adapted from [334]. Reprinted with permission from Nature Publishing Group.R.Zhangetal. Journal of Controlled Release 292 (2018) 256-276 267(WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are conducted to identify mu- tated genes and their corresponding mutated antigens [388]. There- after, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is carried out to determine which mutated genes have a strong binding affinity for the individual patient to then predict and personalize the cancer vaccine epitope, known as neoantigens [7,399]. Lastly, those selected neoantigens are synthesized and combined with other immunomodulators (e.g. ad- juvants) and delivery vehicles to create the final vaccine formulation[388]. A recent study demonstrated that using nanodiscs, a novel bio- material for vaccine delivery, to deliver predicted neoantigens has significant potential as a cancer therapeutic [124]. When the nanodisc vaccine was combined with checkpoint blockade therapy in murine models, it was shown to eradicate established colon carcinoma or melanoma in 90% of mice [124]. Another strategy for developing personalized cancer vaccines is uti- lizing patient-derived tumors [117]. Compared with the previously de- vaccine, utilizing a patient's own tumor cells elim- inates the need for tumor antigen selection and synthesis, thus reducing vaccine production time [151]. A recent study in mice embedded auto- logous dead breast cancer cells, thienotriazolodiazepine (a bromodo- inhibitor), and ICG (a photothermal therapy agent) in hydrogels as a personalized cancer vaccine [151]. The vaccineinduced complete remission in all mice with breast tumors, indicatingthat personalized vaccines developed from a patient's own tumor, cou- pled with a biomaterial delivery system, may be a promising therapeutic direction [151]. This strategy is especially applicable for patients with solid tumors that require surgical resection, as the excised tumors can be modified and used in biomaterial-based vaccines that are capable of preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis post-surgery [151]. This new approach may be an attractive alternative to traditional che- motherapy and radiotherapy\u2014the current standard-of-care therapy post- surgery\u2014as both traditional methods dramatically decrease a patient's quality of life [400]. Though promising, the production process for de- veloping personalized vaccines derived from either neoantigens or a patient's own tumor are often time consuming, costly, and complex [7,151,401]. Future efforts should focus on reducing production time and costs during the manufacturing process, so that personalized cancer vaccines can become widely commercialized. 8. Conclusion Though many advances have been made at the interface of cancer vaccines, biomaterials, and bioinformatics, the final key step is to ef- fectively translate these novel techniques from academic laboratories Fig. 9.

First, the differences in immune systems between small animals, larger animals, and humans need to be taken into consideration [386]. Additionally, animal models for melanoma are widely used due to their ease of tumor manipulation and assessment [402]. However, melanoma may differ significantly from other types of solid tumor or hematological cancers, which may impact the translatability of the model to other types of cancer in the clinic [403]. Lastly, the capacity of large scale production and batch-to- batch quality control are also important factors that need to be ad- dressed before biomaterial-based vaccines can be widely commercia- lized [404]. One strategy to improve the potential for clinical transla- tion is to develop delivery technologies comprised of FDA-approved materials, as a means to reduce the length of the approval process [405-407]. A prime example is the PLGA-based scaffold vaccine (WDVAX), developed by Mooney and colleagues, which has recently been licensed by Novartis for commercial use [408]. Additionally, using existing and future clinical trial data to compare vaccine efficacy across patient subpopulations may allow for vaccines to be optimized more quickly for specific groups of patients, based on determined factors such as biomarker expression [409].Overall, various aspects of biomaterial-based cancer vaccines can be leveraged to train the immune system to selectively attack tumor cells, while possibly avoiding the off-target effects and potential toxicity of traditional vaccines. Different engineering approaches, including en- hancing lymph node delivery, immune cell recruitment, tumor tar- geting, and tumor cell modification can be exploited using scaffold and nanoparticle-based delivery systems. Moreover, the identification of optimized tumor antigen sequences has been indicated as a crucial step in improving cancer vaccine efficacy. Thus, continuing collaborations between immunologists, computational scientists, and bioengineers, entrepreneurs are necessary to design safer, more effective, and trans- latable cancer vaccines for patients.
