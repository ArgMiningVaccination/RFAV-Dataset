It was the EPA three years ago which cited Heavy Metal Detox as the leading environmental concern for health issues. Since then there has been a host of additional studies which have linked heavy metals in the environment both to neurological and degenerative diseases such as cancers and Parkinson's disease. Many heavy metals usually work their way into the environment as a part of the manufacturing process. This is especially true of the more common ones such as lead, mercury and cadmium which can come from seemingly harmless sources such as second hand cigarette smoke or your local dry cleaner. Old dental amalgams is also a common source which that industry is finally beginning to address. Specifically, the problem with lead being linked to neurological disorders was known for sometime. However, it was in the 1960's with the restrictions on leaded gasoline that brought the full impact of the problem to light. Many of the orange grooves in Florida were along the highways and increased levels of lead was showing up in orange juice. Finally, after several years the connection was made. The restriction of lead from gasoline was perhaps a turning point in bring the public's attention to the problem and ' Piggy- Backed ' on Rachael Carson's book \" Silent Spring \" which was instrumental in the whole environmental movement taking off in the early 1970's. The specific issues with Heavy Metal Detox is that the metals often interfere with enzymatic and metabolic pathways in the body. They can block receptor sites and biochemical agents can't dock and complete their intended function. This is especially true of both mercury and lead which seem to interfere with hormonal function and organs particularly the thyroid and the gonads. Fortunately there are treatment protocols to address these issues. There are also specific lab tests that can be run to evaluate an individual if they need a Heavy Metal Detox. Total cost is usually in the neighborhood of $200 and can be performed easily. Following testing there are herbs and nutritional products such as homeopathic remedies which can remove heavy metals from the body.
