VFC Program Requirement 6 Terms Used in this Guide For purposes of this guide: Awardee refers to the Arizona S tate Immunization P rogram staff responsible for implementation of the VFC program Facility refers to a specific VFC provider location AHCCCS -enrolled and AHCCCS -eligible are used interchangeably and re fer to children who have health insurance covered by the State of Arizona Medicaid program Parent refers to anyone who has legal authority to make decisions on behalf of a VFC -eligible child. This can refer to parents, legal parent s, or individuals of record Provider refers to a health care provider licensed to administer vaccines, as well as the staff within a provider facility who store and handle vaccines, order and bill for vaccines, or screen for VFC eligibility. A \"provider\" is enrolled in the VFC program and has ordered vaccine within the past 12 months. (Providers who have not ordered vaccine in 12 months are considered inactive and will be unenrolled from the program.) Future Changes to the Guide Modules will be revised and replaced if informat ion changes after the Arizona VFC Operations Guide is published. Unless otherwise noted, effective dates o f any new requirements will be 3 0 days after notice of the change. The AIPO will notify providers by e -mail anytime changes are made. 7 Summary of Arizona VFC Program Requirements Requirement Steps/Components Module 1 - Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan Providers must display , on a VFC cold storage unit, the Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan which includes procedures for routine and emergency vaccine management Contact information for the current primary and back -up VFC coordinators must always be listed on the Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan Provider staff roles and responsibilities are defined Documented training related to vaccine management is kept on site and on file for six (6) years Proper storage and handling practices, including how to handle a temperature excursion are included Procedures for vaccine ordering, receiving, inventory control, stock rotation, and handling vaccine loss and waste Procedures for emergency situations, including transport, equipment malfunction, power failure and natural disaster Plans must be signed and dated annually, when there are changes to the staff, roles and/or responsibilities or as needed .

If a patient is enrolled in AHCCCS, providers may NOT bill the patient. If a parent /patient cannot affor d the administration fee, it must be waived. Sending parent s/patients bills or sending pa rent s/patients to collections is prohibited Provider Request for a Change in VFC Status (Inactivation, Of fice Closure, Office Relocation or Other Changes) Providers must notify the AIPO in writing at least 30 days prior to their intended date of inactivation Providers are required to notify the AIPO in writing at least 30 days prior to a move or office closure Providers must submit a profile change form to the AIPO fo r any staff changes, facility name changes and any other pertinent changes Providers are required to use and submit the most up- to-date AIPO forms All required VFC forms are kept up -to-date on our website, www.azdhs.gov/vfc If requests and information are submitted to the AIPO on outdated forms, the request/action will be denied until the most up -to-date form is received by the AIPO If the Provider Agreement is terminated, the provider is responsible for transferring or returning any unused VFC vaccine prior to termination Please refer to Module 6 for t ransferring and returning instructions 10 Requirement Steps/Components Module 3 - VFC Eligibility and Requirements Providers must screen for VFC eligibility at every visit VFC eligibility screening must occur at every visit Patients are eligible for VFC vaccine if they meet one or more of the following requirements: - American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) - Medicaid -eligible - Uninsured - Underinsured VFC vaccines can only be given to children ages 0 through 18 years of age ( the day before their 19th birthday) that meet the eligibility requirements Providers may utilize the Patient Eligibility Screening Record or the electronic medical record (EMR) to document the screening information Keep the eligibility screen record s for six (6) years from the dat e of the last visit If a child has AHCCCS as a secondary insurance and the primary insurance is a high -deductible insurance plan requiring the parent /patient to pay out of pocket for vaccines, the patient should be considered VFC -eligible if the family has not yet reached its deductible. VFC vaccines should be administered and the administration fee should be billed to AHCCCS until the deductible is reached Underinsured means that the patient has private insurance but the insurance policy does not cover any or all ACIP recommended vaccines or does not cover ACIP recommended vaccines, but has a fixed dollar limit or cap for vaccines. The patient is considered underinsured once the fixed dollar amount is reached Underinsured patients can receive VFC vaccines only at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health centers (RHCs), or a deputized provider 11 Requirement Steps/Components Module 4 - Arizona State Immunization Information System (ASIIS) Each individual is required to have their own log in to ASIIS and must not use other users log ins Email a provider profile change form to asiishelpdesk@azdhs.gov to obtain a username and password Providers are required to report VFC and private doses to ASIIS for ch ildren 18 years old and younger Per Arizona Revised Statute A.R.S. \u00a736-135, all health care professionals administering immunizations to children \"birth to 18\" years of age must report those immunizations to ASIIS Providers must report administered doses to ASIIS using either HL7 reporting or manual entry reporting Providers may report administered doses to ASIIS using their EHR system to send administered information Providers may report administered doses to ASIIS by manually entering all administered doses , directly into ASIIS 12 Requirement Steps/Components Module 5 - Vaccine Storage and Handling Provider practices must comply with vaccine storage and handling requirements as outlined in this Operations Guide Stand -alone units are highly recommended but not required unless a provider is purchasing new units, then stand -alone units are required to be purchased. Dual control household units can be used if it has a separate temperature control for the refrigerator and a separate temperature control for the freezer Do not store any VFC vaccine in a dormitory -style or bar -style combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances Data loggers with continuous monitoring and reporting capabilities and a current calibration certificate s are required for all units storing VFC vaccine A back -up data logger with a current calibration certificate is required to be on site The back -up data logger must be portable to be used in the event of vaccine transport Provider offices are r esponsible for ensuring all data loggers that monitor the temperatures of any VFC vaccine are sent for recalibration by an appropriate company before the calibration expires per the calibration certificate Data logger data must be downloaded and reviewed two times per month Current t emperatures must be reviewed and documented on a temperature log two times per day The min/max temperatures must be reviewed and documented on a temperature log in the morning of the previous 24 hours If a provider office will be closed for more than four (4) days, someone must come in on the fifth and subsequent days to take the temperatures twice a day or transfer the vaccine to another VFC pro vider before the closure occurs. C onsult Module 6 for transfer instructions Data logger reports must be emailed to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov with each order and on a monthly basis All publicly supplied vaccines (VFC and KidsCare vaccines) can be stored and labeled as VFC All privately purchased vaccines must be separated from publicly supplied (VFC and Kids Care) vaccines 13 Requirement Steps/Components Mod ule 6 - Vaccine Management Activities and Reporting Providers are required to report all vaccine incidents (including temperature excursions, power outages, theft, etc.) to the AIPO immediately Providers must complete the VFC Incident Report and upload all applicable electronic data logger reports for each incident. The reports must be directly from the data logger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv) Providers without access to Google applications must email all required doc uments to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov Once the AIPO receives all required incident documents, providers will receive a response regarding viability of the VFC vaccines from the AIPO in 4 -5 business days The AIPO will not be able to determine VFC vaccine viability if all documents are not received via email from the provider If vaccines are required to be wasted due to a vaccine incident, providers will be required to email a data logger report with f ive (5) full consecutive days of current in-range temperatures before an order can be placed If a provider's cold storage unit experiences more than 2 unexplained temperature excursions in a 3 - month period, the provider will be required to have the cold storage unit serviced and the provider will be required to provide the AIPO with the service receipt Providers will be required to purchase stand -alone units if a temperature excursion occurs in a household unit within 3 months of the unit being serviced that results in wastage of any VFC vaccine . The provider will be required to provide the AIPO with a receipt of sale for a new stand- alone units Providers will be required to replace stand -alone units if VFC vaccines are wasted more than twice in a 6-month period after the unit has been serviced due to unexplained temperature excursions . The provider will be required to provide the AIPO with a receipt of sale for a new stand -alone units 14 Requirement Steps/Components Providers must abide by the proper procedures when transferring vaccines Vaccine transfers can only occur: after a transfer has been requested in ASIIS after up- to-date temperatures have been received by the AIPO from the sending and receiving facilities after the ASIIS transfer request has been approved by the AIPO in ASIIS Conditioned water bottles must be used during vaccine transpor t of refrigerated vaccines Data loggers must be used to monitor the temperature during transport If a provider has open VFC vaccine incident s, providers are not allowed to initiate a transfer to or accept a transfer from another facility until the VFC vaccine incidents have been closed by the AIPO Provider offices must have their vaccines delivered to the same location that they will be administered at The use of mobile units is limited to those providers that are currently approved by the AIPO to operate mobile units to administer vaccines Provider offices are prohibited from using mobile units to administer vaccine if the vaccine is not shipped to the location the mobile unit will be administering vaccine at Providers are required to replace VFC doses that are borrowed from private stock and administered to non- VFC eligible patients Vaccine borrowing must be a rare occurrence VFC vaccines should never be u sed as a replacement system for a provider's privately purchased vaccine inventory A borrowing report must be submitted to the AIPO for every instance of borrowing 15 Requirement Steps/Components Providers must return expired or spoiled vaccines and must dispose of wasted vaccines When managing expired, spoiled and wasted vaccine, providers must: remove the vaccines from any storage unit that stores viable vaccines label vaccines \"do not use\" email a completed wasted/expired form to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov return expired and spoiled vaccines to the depot (McKesson) within 6 months of the expiration date or spoilage wasted vaccines should be disposed of following state and local disposal requirements all expired, spoiled and wasted vaccines must be removed from the ASIIS inventory with the appropriate categor y and reason after emailing the wasted/expired form to the AIPO Reporting administered doses to ASIIS All VFC and private administered doses must be linked to a patient in ASIIS All VFC administered doses must be accounted for in ASIIS Always use the lot number and NDC from the vaccine box (not the vial) Providers should only add historical doses into ASIIS if the doses were administered at another facility (e.g., out of state) 16 Requirement Steps/Components Restitution (Dose for Dose Replacement) Dose for dose replacement is required from VFC providers when vaccine wastage of doses that expire in the calendar year is greater than 5% of the total number of VFC vaccines that expire in the calendar year and in situations where providers f ail to maintain vaccines per VFC program requirements. Wastage includes all: expired doses, drawn up/not used doses, unaccounted doses (doses not appropriately attached to patient records in ASIIS and decremented from the ASIIS inventory), lost and unacco unted doses, broken/dropped/spilled doses, etc. Each site can incur up to 5% wastage of doses that expire in that year; however, once 5% is exceeded, all wasted doses will need to be replaced by the site at its expense via private vaccine purchase. VFC si tes will receive instructions and the detailed VFC Dose for Dose Replacement Form which includes a list and quantity of vaccines that must be replaced. Providers will be required to replace all vaccines within 60 days of receiving the email and must email the completed and signed VFC Dose for Dose Replacement Form along with the packing slips/invoices for all of the privately purchased vaccines. Step by Step Dose for Dose Replacement Instructions: - The provider/si te purchases the vaccines - When the vaccine shipment arrives, the provider marks the doses \"VFC\" and puts them in the appropriate cold storage unit - The provider submits the packing slips/invoices and the completed and signed VFC Dose for Dose Replacement form to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov - The AIPO enters the replacement doses in the provider's VFC inventory in ASIIS - The AIPO emails the provider to let them know the doses are ready to use - The provider administers the doses to their VFC eligible patients and is responsible to account for every dose and ensure it has decre mented from the ASIIS inventory 17 Requirement Steps/Components Module 7 - Vaccine Ordering All VFC providers are required to submit a vaccine order at least once per calendar year through ASIIS. Providers must order all ACIP vaccines, including flu vaccine. Providers must reconcile their inventory before placing an order Providers will be prompted to reconcile the inventory during the ordering process on the \"Reconcile Inventory\" page Input the number in the \"Quantity on Hand\" column into the \"Physical Inventory\" box for each vaccine every time Provider offices may remove doses in this screen by placing the quantity on hand number minus the number of doses that need to be removed in the physical inventory box. The \"Adjustment\" column will show how many doses will be removed Provider offices may only remove doses if the doses are expired, have been spoiled ( e.g. a temperature excursion), wasted (e.g. drawn -up but not used) or a recall has occurred from the manufacturer Providers must email up-to-date data logger reports every time an order is placed Every time an order is placed, providers must email data logger reports from the last recorded date and time of the previously emailed data logger reports up until the date and time the order is submitted. The reports m ust be sent directly from the data logger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv) to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov If the AIPO does not r eceive provider temperatures when the order is placed , the order may be cancelled and another order will have to be placed Providers must receive the shipment of vaccines into the ASIIS inventory immediately after vaccines arrive in the provider office Log in to ASIIS Under the \" Orders/Transfers \" tab on the left -hand side menu, select \"Create/View Orders\" Under the \" Inbound Orders \" heading, click on the arrow under select Input the quantity received in the \"Receipt Quantity\" box for all vaccines received *If all vaccines are not received, please leave the receipt quantity blank and return to this page and enter the quantity received when the vaccines are physically received in the office Click the button that states \"Receive\" 18 Requirement Steps/Components Module 8 - Vaccine Administration and VAERS VFC makes all ACIP recommended vaccines available for program participants All CDC contracted vaccines are available for provider choice During vaccine shortages presentations may be substituted Providers are required by federal law to provide all parents/patients all applicable Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) at every visit before the administration of any vaccine VFC providers are required to distribute the most current Vaccine Information Statement s (VIS) at every immunization visit prior to the vaccines being administered Provider offices may provide laminated VISs to the parent /patient prior to vaccination Provider offices may provide VISs on a computer monitor or video display VISs may be downloaded by the parent /patient to a smartphone or other electronic device to read All VFC providers must report any clinically significant adverse events that occur after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires health care providers to report: - any event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine - any event listed in the VAERS Reportable Events Table that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination - medication errors do not need to be submitted to VAERS, however if you feel that it is directly related to the patient's reaction, please report the medication error to VAERS 19 Requirement Steps/Components Module 9 - Arizona Immunization Program Office Provider Visits All VFC providers must participate in VFC program compliance visits, including unannounced storage and handling visits and other education opportunities associated with the VFC program requirements All new/previously enrolled VFC provider locations are required to participate in a new provider training The AIPO can provide training to new provider office staff and anyone who needs a refresher in VFC policies and procedures At a minimum, once every 24 months, and perhaps more frequently AIPO program staff will conduct a VFC compliance visit at VFC enrolled provider of fices Unannounced storage and handling visits can occur at any time with no notice All VFC provi ders must also participate in Immunization Quality Improvement for Provider (IQIP) visits At a minimum, once every 24 months, and perhaps more frequently , AIPO program staff will conduct an IQIP visit at VFC enrolled provider offices 2-month and 6 -month check- ins will be conducted via phone 12-month follow -ups will also be conducted via phone Fully implemented strategies to increase vaccine uptake should be completed 12 months after the initial visit If strategies to increase vaccine uptake are not fully implemented 12 months after the initial visit, providers are encouraged to work towards full implementation 20 Requirement Steps/Components Module 10 - Fraud and Abuse/Discipline Process Federal fraud and abuse laws apply to the entire VFC program, consistent with \"fraud and abuse\" as defined in the Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7 455.2 If the AIPO finds evidence of intentional deception, misrepresentation, or negligence on the part of the VFC provider, further investigation and potential enforcement of relevant laws, including fraud and abuse, consumer protection, and professional licensure will occur If VFC provider offices have not met A rizona VFC requirements or not followed Arizona VFC procedures as outlined in this guide, but the AIPO finds no intentional deception, misrepresentation, or negligence on the part of the VFC provider, the staff at the provider office may be required to participate in training and/or to take other actions to rectify the situation 21 Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program Overview Table of Contents Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program Overview Welcome AIPO Directory VFC Overview VFC Fast Facts VFC Program At -a-Glance VFC Program Benefits VFC Vaccines VFC Program History Medicaid VFC Program Funding VFC Program Oversight ACIP and VFC Resolutions Vaccine Administration Fees and Fee Caps Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) CHIP and VFC Eligibility 22 Welcome to the Arizona Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The Arizona VFC Operations Guide has been prepared by the Arizona Department of Health Services, Arizona Immunization Program Office (AIPO) to provide information to enrolled providers to ensure compliance with federal and state VFC guidelines regarding safe handing, administration and reporting of VFC vaccines. Recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics are included. We wish to thank CDC staff who have advised and assisted us in preparation of this guide. If you have any questions regarding this guide, please call the AIPO at 602 -364-3642.

Please save the VFC webpage link to internet favorites: http://www.azdhs.gov/vfc To all VFC providers, we extend our thanks for immunizing Arizona's children. AIPO Directory AIPO Mailing Address: Arizona Immunization Program Office 150 N 18 th Avenue, Suite 120 Phoenix, AZ 85007 Children (VFC) Program Overview 23 VFC Overview The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program was established by Congress in 1994 to increase access to vaccination for children who might not get vaccinated because of financial barriers. The VFC pr ogram serves children through 18 years of age who meet at least one of the following criteria: American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) Medicaid -eligible Uninsured Underinsured For full information on patient eligibility, see Module 3 - VFC Eligibility and Requirements . To reach VFC -eligible children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses federal funds to purchase vaccines and distribute them at no cost to public health clinics and private providers enrolled in the program. VFC Program At -a-Glance CDC's immunization program awardees enroll public and private health care providers into the VFC program to meet the immunization needs of VFC -eligible children in their respective jurisdictions. Awardees educate enrolled providers on VFC program requirements, vaccine management, and fraud and abuse violations. CDC contracts with vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at a federal discount. VFC providers order vaccines (including seasonal influenza v accine) recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at no cost through their state, local, or territorial VFC program. VFC providers agree to follow all VFC requirements, which include screening patients for VFC eligibility at each immunization encounter and documenting their eligibility status. VFC vaccines must be administered only to children who a re eligible. Awardees monitor providers to ensure VFC compliance and provide guidance, with the goal of vaccinating more infants, c hildren, and teens on schedule. VFC Fast Facts VFC benefits an estimated 40 million children Approximately 39,000 enrolled health care providers 61 VFC state, local, and territorial immunization program awardees Approximately 79 million VFC vaccine doses distributed in 2017 VFC Program Benefits Reduces referrals of children from private providers to state health departments for vaccination Saves VFC -enrolled providers out-of-pocket expenses for vaccines Eliminates or reduces vaccine cost as a barrier to vaccinating eligible children 24 VFC Vaccines Vaccines covered by the VFC program are recommended by ACIP to protect infants, children, and teenagers from 16 vaccine -preventable diseases. ACIP is a federal advisory group of medical and public health experts that develops recommendations on the use of vaccines to prevent and control diseases in the United States. The gro up provides guidance on: age for vaccine administration number of doses and dosing intervals precautions and contraindications to vaccination Table: Diseases and ACIP -Recommended Vaccines Covered by the VFC against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. **DT and Td combine protection against diphtheria and tetanus. **MMR combines protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. \u00a7MMRV is combination vaccine containing MMR and varicella. \u00b6Kinrix and Quadracel are combination vaccines containing DTaP and IPV. \u00a7\u00a7Pentacel is a combination vaccine containing DTaP, IPV, and Hib . \u00b6\u00b6Pediarix is a DTaP, IPV, and Hep B . Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 25 VFC Program History Congress created the VFC program in response to the 1989- 1991 measles outbreak in the United States, at a time when vaccination coverage was low. The measles epidemic resulted in tens of thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths. The VFC program was created as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. It was established as a new entitlement program required to be a part of each state's Medicaid plan. The VFC program is a Title XIX Medicaid program. Section 1928 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a71396S) provides the legal authority for the VFC program by requiring each state to establish a program for pediatric vaccine distribution to registered providers. It provides authority for purchase of vaccines for administration to eligible children using federal Medicaid and state funds (including 317). VFC was officially implemented in October 1994 as part of the President's Childhood Immunization Initiative. The VFC program is available in all 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands , American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. VFC Program Funding Funding for the VFC program is approved annually by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The funds are allocated through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to CDC. CDC awards VFC funding through a cooperative agreement to 61 state, local, and territorial immunization programs. VFC Program Oversight The VFC program is administered at the national level by CDC through its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). CDC is the lead agency responsible for VFC policy development and national program oversight. CDC's immunization program awardees manage and implement a VFC program in their state, city, or territory. ACIP and VFC Resolutions ACIP has unique legal authority from Congress to provide recommendations for the VFC program. When recommending a new vaccine or a change in vaccine use, ACIP votes on a resolution to include the vaccine change in the VFC program. VFC resolutions passed by ACIP form the basis for VFC program policies on vaccine availability and use. Medicaid Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal/state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and limited resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture, jointly funded by the federal and state governments (including the District of Columbia and the territories) to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to eligible persons. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health- related services for America's low -income citizens. Within broad national guidelines established by the federal government, each state Medicaid program can: Establish its own eligibility standards Determine the type, amount, duration, and scope of services Set the rate of payment for services Adminis ter its own program As a result, Medicaid programs vary considerably from state to state. Vaccines for Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program Overview 26 According to the initial VFC program legislation, enrolled providers agree to the following vaccine administratio n fee requirements: Providers cannot deny access to federally purchased vaccines to an established patient whose parent is unable to pay the vaccine administration fee. Providers also cannot bill a patient if they are unable to pay the vaccine administration fee at the time of the visit. Providers cannot charge a vaccine administration fee to non-Medicaid VFC - eligible children that exceed the federal administration fee cap. For Medicaid VFC - eligible children, the provider must accept the reimbursement for vaccination set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans. Note: Providers may charge an office visit fee in addition to the vaccine administration fee. This is not prohibited by the VFC statute. Vaccines procured through the VFC program must be administered according to the guidelines o utlined by ACIP in VFC resolutions. (VFC vaccines may also be administered in accordance with state school attendance laws.) CDC establishes contracts for VFC vaccines only after a VFC resolution is in place. Vaccine Administration Fees and Fee Caps VFC providers cannot charge an eligible child's parent a fee for the vaccine itself. However, they can charge a fee to administer each vaccine. The legislation tha t created the VFC program sets a limit on the dollar amount a provider can charge and be reimbursed for administering vaccines to VFC -eligible children. This means a provider may charge a patient any amount up to, but not exceeding, the vaccine administrat ion fee. The amount of the administration fee differs from state to state, based on a regional scale determined by CMS. There is no lower limit, so providers have the option to charge what they feel is fair, including not charging a fee at all. Arizona VFC providers may charge up to $21.33 per injection as set forth in the Federal Register. An initial Federal Register notice setting forth the interim maximum amounts a participating provider may charge for administering a vaccine to a VFC child w as published on October 3, 1994. An updated fee schedule was published in November 2012. Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to address the fact that one in seven children (more than 10 million nationwide) is uninsured, and therefore, at significantly increased risk for preventable health problems. Many of these children are part of working families who earn too little to afford private insurance on their own but earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid. CHIP and VFC Eligibility Children enrolled in a Medicaid expansion program are eligible for VFC vaccines. Arizona's CHIP program is also known as KidsCare and is considered a Medicaid expansion program. Module 1 Vaccines for Children Vaccines for Children 27 Module 1 - Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan Table of Contents Module 1 - Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan Overview Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan Components VFC Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan 28 Overview All VFC providers must maintain the Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan that includes procedures for routine and emergency vaccine management.

Vaccine Management and Accountability Plan (Module 1) Initials : ___________________________ Providers must display the Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan that includes procedures for routine and emergency vaccine management on the VFC refrigerator or freezer at all times and utilized a s appropriate . Submit a revised Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan to the AIPO (The Arizona Immunization Program Office) EVERY TIME facility changes occur (including changes in staff). VFC Program Participation Requirements (Module 2) Initials : _______________________________ Providers must meet eligibility criteria required for VFC program enrollment . Providers must complete the Provider Agreement for initial program enrollment and program re-enrollment (annually). Program inactivation may occur due to failure to re -enroll. VFC program participation is required for participating in AHCCCS; if you are inactivated your AHCCCS panel may be removed/reassigned. If a Provider Agreement is terminated, the provider is responsible for transferring or returning any unused vaccine prior to termination. Annual training for all VFC staff is required. VFC E ligibility and Requirements (Module 3) Initials : ______________________________________ Facility staff must understand, screen and document VFC/C HIP eligibility at EVERY immunization encounter PRIOR to selecting the vaccine stock for administration. **Only VFC/CHIP eligible children may receive VFC/CHIP vaccines. Do not c harge patients or bill AHCCCS for the cost of VFC or CHIP vaccine. An administration fee, not to exceed $21.33 per injection may be charged to AHCCCS or the parent/patient. If a patient is enrolled in AHCCCS, providers may NOT bill the patient. VFC eligible patients that cannot pay the administration fee may not be denied VFC vaccine s. Sending the bill to collections is not allowed. Arizona State Immunization Information System (ASIIS) (Module 4) Initials : ___________ ________ Each ASIIS user must have a unique (not shared) ASIIS log in. Each dose of VFC/CHIP/Private vaccine administered to a patient must be documented in the facilities records and in the Arizona Immunization Information System (ASIIS). All required fields must be included. Each dose of VFC/CHIP vaccine administered to a patient must be decremented appropriat ely from the ASIIS vaccine inventory. Annual signature in ASIIS of HIPAA agreement is required for all ASIIS users. Vaccine Storage and Handling (Module 5 ) Initials : _______________________________ _________ 32 Refrigerated vaccine storage units must maintain a temperature range between 36.0 \u00b0 F and 46.0 \u00b0 F (2.0\u00b0 C and 8 .0\u00b0 C). Freezer vaccine storage units must m aintain a temperature range between -58.0\u00b0 F and +5 .0\u00b0 F (-50.0\u00b0 C and - 15.0\u00b0 C). Vaccine storage un its must have sufficient storage space to accommodate vaccine stock at the busiest times of year without overcrowding. CDC recommends the following vaccine storage unit types (in order of preference): p urpose -built or pharmaceutical/medical- grade units, i ncluding door less, dual control and dispensing units (preferred); Stand -alone refrigerator and freezer units ; dual control household units can be used if it has a separate temperature control for the refrigerator and a separate temperature control for the freezer . CDC strictly prohibits use of all dorm -style and bar -style units for vacc ine storage. If a new unit is purchased, the provider office will be required to provide the AIPO with a receipt of sale for a new stand -alone unit(s) and a data logger report with five (5) full consecutive days of current in- range temperatures , after the date of purchase, before the new unit(s) can be used to store VFC vaccines. Each vaccine storage unit is required to have a data logger. Portable back up data logger is also required. Data logger data must be downloaded and reviewed two times per month. Vaccine must b e stored under appropriate temperatures as described in the package inserts at all times. Vaccine storage unit temperatures must be monitored and documented on a temperature log to include the following : At least two current temperature readings per day recorded to the tenths place ( e.g. 34.2\u00b0 F). Exact time and date of each reading. Name (or initials) of the person who assess ed and recorded the readings. Minimum and maximum temperatures of each unit once in the morning for the previous 24 hours . Vaccine Management Activities and Reporting (Module 6) Initials : _____________________ _____ Temperature Excursions - If a temperature excursion is suspected, providers should follow their Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan, including keeping the vaccines in the cold storage unit, isolating affected vaccines in a bag or box and labeling them \"do not use\". Providers must complete the VFC Incident Report and upload all applicable electronic data logger reports for each incident. The reports must be directly from the data logger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv) . Providers without access to Google applications must email all required documents to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . Vaccine should only be transported from the physical location of a VFC provider during an emergency, unexpected extended power outage, or with the permission of the Immunization Program to prevent vaccine wastage. If the power has been out at a provider office for two (2) hours, providers must appropriately pack their vaccines and transport the m to the address listed on their VFC Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan. Contact the AIPO for directions and permissions. Expired or spoiled vaccines should NEVER be kept in a vaccine storage unit. Expired or spoiled vaccines should be placed outside the storage unit in a container labeled \" DO NOT USE \". A 'wasted/expired form' must be completed and sent to the Immunization Program within one month of spoilage or expiration. You will receive an e -mail with a shipping label to use for returning the vaccine to McKesson per CDC requirements. Wasted vaccines should be disposed of appro priately and documented on the 'Wasted/Expired form' . The following items should N OT be returned to McKesson: 33 - Vaccine vials and syringes that have been opened (with OR without needles ) - Broken or damaged vaccine vials or syringes (with OR without needles) , syringes that have been activated and vaccines that ha ve been pre- drawn. - Vaccine vials that do not have the original sealed cap intact . Dose for dose replacement is required from VFC providers when vaccine wastage of doses that expire in the calendar year is greater than 5% of the total number of VFC vaccines that expire in the calendar year and in situations where providers fail to maintain vaccines per VFC program requirements. Each site can incur up to 5% wastage of doses that expire in that year; however, once 5% is exceeded, all wasted doses will need to be replaced by the site at its expense via private vaccine purchase. Vaccine Ordering (Module 7) Initials : ______________________________________________ ____ Adequate inventory of vaccine for all patients served (VFC, CHIP, p rivate) must be maintained and clearly marked to indicate which funding source provided the vaccine. Borrowing VFC or CHIP vaccine must be a very rare occurrence, and cannot be part of the business practice. A borrowing report must be completed and the vaccine repaid to the appropriate funding source. Excessive borrowing may result in program probation. Regular reconciliation is required. Vaccines should be rotated to keep shorter -dated vaccines in front of longer -dated vaccines. Vaccine orders should reflect the most recent Provider Profile submi tted and placed as follows: Vaccines should be ordered at least monthly, smaller more frequ ent orders are encouraged, to maintain a 3 -4 week stock of VFC/CHIP/p rivate vaccines at all times. All efforts should be made to prevent borrowing from other vaccine funding sources. In ASIIS, on the order screen, ensure that vaccines are scheduled to be delivered during your current office hours. The VFC Program entitles children to all ACIP recommended vaccines. Receiving and inspecting vaccine shipments: The primary vaccine coordinator or back -up vaccine coordinator should take proper steps to receiv e and inspect vaccine deliveries. NOTE that if problems are encountered during any of the steps or there are any doubts that the vaccines may not have been shipped properly, immediately contact the AIPO at 602 -364-3642. Vaccine deliveries should NOT be refused. IMMEDIATELY store vaccines in the appropriate refrigerator or freezer vaccine storage unit. Be certain to label the vaccines according to fund type . Vaccine Administration and VAERS (Module 8) Initials : _________________________ _________ __ The Arizona VFC Program makes all ACIP recommended vaccines available for program participants. VFC providers are required to distribute the most current Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) for every vaccine at every visit prior to a vaccine being administered . VFC providers must also maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA); this includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Arizona Immunization P rogram Office Provider Visits (Module 9) Initials : __________ ___________ VFC providers must actively participate in all program visits; compliance visits, storage and handling, new p rovider/staff in services, IQIP and others as needed and defined by the program. 34 Fraud and Abuse /Discipline Process (Module 10) Initials : __________________________ ________ Fraud is the intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. Abuse includes practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business or medical practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, CHIP Program, Immunization Program, Health Insurance Company or patient. Any provider that is involved in the fraud or abuse of VFC vaccine will be subject to a progressive disciplinary process that may include; issuance of a Notice of Action - information shared with AHCCCS, program proba tion, involuntary program separation. An appeal process is available in the VFC Operations Guide for providers that request it. 35 Module 2 - VFC Program Participation Requirements Table of Contents Module 2 - VFC Program Participation Requirements Overview Provider Enrollment Criteria Requirements Vaccine Coordinators Provider Re -Enrollment Provider Billing Procedures Provider Request for a Change in VFC Status AIPO VFC Forms 36 Overview Being a VFC provider is a sound investment in your practice and in your patients. It reduces your up -front costs because you will not have to pay to purchase vaccines for VFC eligible children. Also, you can charge an administrative fee to offset your cost s of doing business. Your patients benefit because they won't have to go somewhere else to get the vaccines they need, and there is no charge to you, the provider. Any healthcare provider authorized to prescribe vaccines in Arizona can be a VFC provider. Provider Enrollment Criteria Requirements VFC providers must be licensed in the State of Arizona to prescribe vaccine s to children aged 18 and younger. Please note that there are exceptions for providers that are employed by Indian Health Services Be willing and able to follow all VFC program requirements, policies and procedures, including participation in site visits and educational opportunities Have the capacity to order, receive, manage, store and monitor the temperature of all publicly supplied vaccin es Be open at least 4 days a week and 4 consecutive hours in a day to receive VFC vaccines Providers must complete the Provider Agreement for initial program enrollment and program re-enrollment ( annually ). Providers that are authorized to sign the Provider Agreement are Medical Doctors (M.D.), Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O), Family Nurse Practitioners (F.N.P.) and Nurse Practitioners (N.P.). The signing provider in a group practice must be authorized to prescribe pediatric vaccines under state law. The provider signing the Provider Agreement on behalf of a multi -provider practice must have the authority to sign on behalf of the entity. All licensed health care providers in an enrolled practice and th eir corresponding professional license numbers must be listed on the P rovider Agreement. If pharmacists are administering vaccines under the direct supervision of a physician, both the pharmacist and the physician must sign the Provider Agreement. The fo llowing information will be required for initial enrollment into the VFC program: 1) Provider Agreement - defines CDC compliance parameters of the VFC program 2) VFC Provider License Information - lists the names, NPI number s, and medical license number s of all providers in the facility that have the authority to prescribe vaccines . The signing provider is responsible for ensuring that all staff within the organization are in compliance with the VFC provider enrollment requirement 3) Provider Profile Form - provides demographic information of the provider site and identifies the number of children in the practice by eligibility and age group. Providers are required to make an educated guess if they are a new practice that has not been seeing patients or they have not been seeing AHCCCS eligible patients. If a facility is already seeing patients, they may obtain private patient demographic information from ASIIS, doses administered, provider encounter data, billing systems or benchmarking. This information is important to accurately order vaccines 4) Refrigerator/Freezer Verification Form - describes refrigeration/freezer requirement for vaccines. Refrigerator and freezer (if applicable) temperatures must be recorded on a temperature log twice daily and data logger report s must be emailed prior to the 37 new provider training . This is to ensure that storage units will maintain proper temperatures to maintain vaccine viability . Providers cannot order frozen vaccines without having an AIPO approved freezer and having a Refrigerator/Freezer Verification Form on file 5) Add/Remove ASIIS Users Form - identifies staff that will need access to ASIIS and the varying levels they may need. Access levels range from being able to only view immunization data, enter and/or edit immuniz ation data to ordering VFC vaccine to removing users . All users are required to have their own unique username and password for ASIIS 6) Training certificates for the primary and back -up VFC coordinators - primary and back - up VFC coordinators are required to complete the CDC You Call the Shots (Vaccines for Children or Storage and Handling modules) or the AIPO Train ing (Arizona Vaccines for Children Training module) or Certificate of Completion from AIPO Train: Keeping on track with ASIIS and Vaccine Storage and Handling 7) Valid data logger calibration certificates for all units storing VFC vaccines and the back - up data logger prior to receiving a new provider visit Upon receipt of the completed application by the AIPO, the AIPO will process the application and the assigned Immunization Program Specialist will reach out to the new location to schedule a required new provider training to examine the refrigerator/freezer, data loggers and to train the provider office staff in VFC policies and procedures . Providers that are in compliance with all aspects of the VFC program will be issued VFC provider identification number (pin). Please remember your pin. You will be asked for the pin on all correspondence, orders, and inquiries to the AIPO. Vaccine Coordinators VFC providers are required to designate a primary vaccine coordinator and at least one back -up vaccine coordinator that must be on site for each facility. VFC primary and back -up coordinators are not permitted to float between facilities. The vaccine coordinators are responsible for overseeing all vaccine management within the facility, including: maintaining the Vaccine Accountability and M anagement Plan monitoring storage and handling and vaccine administration practices in the facility overseeing va ccine ordering and notifying the AIPO if vaccines will expire before they are administered ensuring and documenting annual vaccine management training for designated staff at re-enrollment and as needed , as well as training new staff upon hire storing all required documentation for six (6) years as required by Arizona State law To effectively perform their duties, the vaccine coordinator and back -up coordinator must be fully trained and actively engaged i n routine and emergency standard operating procedures for vaccine ordering, storage, handling, transport, and inventory management. VFC providers are required to notify the AIPO anytime there is a change in vaccine coordinator staff. If any VFC coordinator do es not cooperate or does not respond after 3 attempts to contact them or resolve the issue the AIPO may contact the office manager or signing physician to seek resolution. 38 Provider Re- Enrollment Providers are responsible for re -enrolling in the VFC Program every year. The AIPO will communicate to the providers when the re -enrollment period will be open and when it will close. Vaccine ordering privileges may be stopped during the period of time the provider is re - enrolling and restored once the re -enrollment is completed and approved. The AIPO will supply providers with instructions on how to input the re -enrollment into ASIIS. All re -enrollments must be completed in ASIIS. The AIPO no longer accepts re -enrollments via paper. The following information will be required annually for re -enrollment into the VFC program: 1) Provider Agreement - defines CDC compliance parameters of the VFC program 2) VFC Provider License Information - lists the names, NPI numbers, and medical license numbers of all providers in the facility that have the authori ty to prescribe vaccines. The signing provider is responsible for ensuring that all staff within the organization are in compliance with the VFC provider enrollment requirement 3) Provider Profile Form - provides demographic information of the provider site a nd identifies the number of children in the practice by eligibility and age group. The profile numbers must be based on real data, not provider estimates. Providers may obtain patient demographic information from ASIIS, AHCCCS claims data, doses administered, provider encounter data, billing systems or benchmarking. This information is important to accurately order vaccines 4) Refrigerator/Freezer Verification Form - describes refrigeration/freezer requirement for vaccines. Providers cannot order frozen vaccin es without having an AIPO approved freezer and having a Refrigerator/Freezer Verification Form on file 5) Completed and signed Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan, see Module 1 6) Training certificates for the primary and back -up VFC coordinators - primary and back -up VFC coordinators are required to complete the CDC You Call the Shots, VFC or Storage and Handling modules or the AIPO Train Mandatory Primary and Back -Up module or Certificate of Completion from AIPO Train: Keeping on track with ASIIS and Vaccine Storage and Handling 7) Valid data logger calibration certificates for all units storing VFC vaccines and the back -up data logger Providers are required to provide all required re -enrollment documents in the manner described in the re -enrollment notification. The required documents are: s igned VFC Provider Agreement Signature Page, all 5 pages of the completed and signed Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan, certificates for completed annual training for the primary and backup coordinators, signed Refrigerator and Freezer Verification Form and the valid data logger calibration certificates for all units storing VFC vaccines and the back -up data logger. Upon receipt of the re -enrollment in ASIIS and the re -enrollment documents , the AIPO will review the submitted information and return the re -enrollment to the provider with a message detailing what is needed in ASIIS if the documentation or ASIIS re -enrollment is missing and/or incomplete. If the documents and ASIIS re -enrollment are complete the AIPO will approve the application in ASIIS and the provider will receive a message that their re -enrollment is now approved. Providers who fail to re -enroll will automatically be inactivated and vaccine ordering , delivery will be discontinued. It will then become the provider's responsibility to transfer all remaining 39 VFC vaccines to other VFC providers and return any equipment provided by the AIPO to the AIPO. Providers that were inactivated for failure to re -enroll who also fail to transfer (with prior approval from the AIPO) VFC vaccine s to other VFC providers (and, as a result waste the VFC vaccine) will be unable to re -enroll in the VFC program at a future date until they have replac ed any wasted vaccine from their previous enrollment that resulted in wastage via dose for dose replacement. In addition, VFC providers that fail to re -enroll may be inactivated from the VFC program for non -compliance and may have their AHCCCS panel reassigned. The provider may be permitted to return to the VFC program by submitting a new enrollment, no earlier than one (1) year after the Notice of Action. Provider Billing Procedures VFC providers are provided VFC vaccines at no cost to the provider. An administration fee, not to exceed $21.33 per injection, may be charged to AHCCCS or the parent/patient. If a patient is enrolled in AHCCCS, providers may NOT bill the patient. $21.33 is the maximum fee set forth by the regional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). For those children who are Medicaid eligible please contact the individual AHCCCS health plans for specific requirements and rates f or billing. If a parent /patient is unable to pay the administration fee, the administration fee must be waived. It is unacceptable to send those who cannot afford the administration fee bills or send them to collections. Failure to waive the administration fees according the VFC program policy could be conside red fraud and abuse (see Module 10 ). Provider Request for a Change in VFC Status (Inactivation, Office Closure, Office Relocation or Other Changes) Providers may inactivate their enrollment from the Arizona VFC program at any time. To prevent wastage of VFC vaccines, providers must notify the AIPO in writing on office letterhead signed by the VFC signing provider at least thirty (30) days prior to their intended date of in activation. This will allow time for the provider t o transfer (with prior approval from the AIPO) VFC vaccines to another VFC provider. Data loggers and any other equipment supplied by the AIPO will need to be returned to the AIPO. All inactivations will be reported to AHCCCS. Providers that request an inactivation from the VFC program may have their VFC AHCCCS member panel reassigned. If a VFC provider office has a new signing physician, a new provider agreement must be submitted electronically in ASIIS and a copy of the signe d Provider Agreement signature page , signed refrigerator and freezer verification form and updated and signed Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan must be emailed to the AIPO. If a VFC provider office is planning to relocate, the office must notify the AIPO in writing at least 30 days prior to the move. This notice will prevent shipments going to the incorrect location. Data logger report with five (5) full consecutive days of current in range temperatures must be recorded at the new location prior t o transferring the vaccines from Providers that inactivate who fail to transfer VFC vaccines to another VFC provider will not be able to re -enroll in the VFC program at a future date until they have replaced any wasted vaccine from their previous enrollment that resulted in wastage 40 the previous location. All vaccine transfer requests must be entered into AS IIS and approved by AIPO staff before the transport of vaccines can take place. Providers must notify the AIPO of any changes, such as name change , mailing address, shipping address, contact information, new VFC coordinator, new backup VFC coordinator, email, phone, fax, or VFC population changes within one week of the change(s). These changes must be reported via the Provider Profile Change Form Go ogle Doc that can be accessed on the ASIIS home page or the PDF found on our website. AIPO VFC Forms All required VFC forms are kept up -to-date on our website, www.azdhs.gov/vfc . Please always submit requests and information on the most up -to-date forms. If requests and information are submitted on outdated forms, the request /action will be denied until the most up- to-date form is re ceived. 41 Module 3 - VFC Eligibility and Requirements Table of Contents Module 3 - VFC Eligibility and Requirements Overview VFC Eligibility Criteria for Patients American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) AHCCCS -Eligible Medicaid as Secondary Insurance AHCCCS as Secondary Insurance and High- Deductible Plans Underinsured Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) 42 Overview VFC providers agree to screen patients for program eligibility at each immunization encounter prior to administering VFC vaccine and document their eligibility status using the Patient Eligibility Screening Record or the electronic medical record (EMR). Eligibility screening records are required to be kept for six (6) years. VFC vaccines can be administered only to children who mee t the congressionally mandated eligibility requirements for the program. (For more information about VFC provider requirements, see Module 2 - VFC Program Participation Requirements .) When screening patients, providers should select and document the VFC eligibility category requiring the least out - of-pocket expense to the parent. The VFC signing provider must ensure that all staff fully understand the VFC eligibility categories and are meeting this basic program requirement of documenting VFC eligibility at each immunization visit. VFC Eligibility Criteria for Patients VFC-eligible children must be 18 years old or younger and meet the definition of at least one of the following criteria: Table: VFC Eligibility Criteria for Pa tients VFC Eligibility Criteria Definition Not VFC Eligible Financial class code - V01 Patient's private insurance covers all ACIP recommended vaccines AHCCCS (Medicaid) - eligible Financial class code - V02 Children who are eligible for the state AHCCCS (Medicaid) program Uninsured Financial class code - V03 Children not covered by any health insurance plan American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) Financial class code - V04 This population is defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603). (AI/AN children are VFC - eligible under any circumstance ) Underinsured Financial class code - V05 Children who have health insurance, but coverage does not include any vaccines Children who have health insurance, but coverage does not include all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Children who have health insurance, but there is a fixed dollar limit or cap for vaccines Underinsured children are only eligible to receive VFC vaccines at a federally qualified health center (FQHC), a rural health clinic (RHC), or a deputized provider Program Eligibility Criteria The VFC program provides vaccines at no cost to children 18 years of age or younger (the day before their 19 th birthday) who meet at lea st one of the following criteria: American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) AHCCCS (Medicaid)- eligible Uninsured Underinsured 43 American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) The American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) population, for the purposes of the VFC program, is defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act [25 U.S.C. 1603]. AI/AN children are VFC -eligible under any circumstance. However, because VFC is an entitlement program, participation is voluntary. When an AI/AN child also fits into a second VFC eligibility category, the provider should always choose the category that will cost less for the family. Depending on the facility where an AI/AN parent chooses to have their child vaccinated, the parent may be responsible for the vaccine administration fee if the vaccines are delivered through the VFC program. Therefore, if the child has private insurance (non- grandfathered plan under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 ) or is enrolled in the KidsCare program, it may result in fewer out -of-pocket costs for the child to receive vaccinations through these programs than through VFC, as there would be no cost- sharing. Likewise, if the AI/AN child is also AHCCCS -eligible, AHCCCS should be used for the administration fee because it will provide the least out -of-pocket expense. AHCCCS -Eligible Under the legislation that created the VFC program, the term \" AHCCCS -eligible\" is d efined as a child entitled to medical assistance under a Medicaid state plan. Children enrolled in Medicaid make up the largest category of VFC eligibility. Medicaid as Secondary Insurance Some children may have a private primary health insurance plan with AHCCCS as their secondary insurance. These children are considered VFC -eligible because of their AHCCCS enrollment. However, their parents are not required to participate in the VFC program. There are billing options for the parent and provider in this situation. The provider should choose the option that is most cost- effective for the family. The parent of a child with AHCCCS as secondary insurance should never be billed for a vaccine or an a dministration fee. Options include: Option 1: The provider can administer VFC vaccines and bill AHCCCS for the administration fee. In most health care situations, AHCCCS is considered the \"payer of last resort.\" This means that claims must be filed with and rejected by all other insurers before AHCCCS will consider payment for the service. This is not true of the vaccine administration fee for AHCCCS -eligible VFC children . AHCCCS must pay the VFC provider the administration fee because vaccinations are a component of the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. However, once a claim is submitted to AHCCCS, AHCCCS has the option to seek r eimbursement for the administration fee from the primary insurer. Note: If AHCCCS rejects a claim for a vaccine administration fee and states the claim must first be submitted to the primary insurer for payment, the provider should notify the AIPO. Conside rations regarding this option: easiest way for a provider to use VFC vaccines and bill AHCCCS for the administration fee no out -of-pocket costs to the parent for the vaccine or the administration fee 44 Option 2: The provider can administer private stock vaccines and bill the primary insurance carrier for both the cost of the vaccine and the administration fee. If the primary insurer reimburses less than AHCCCS for the vaccine administration fee, the provider can bill AHCCCS for the balance, up to the amount AHCCCS pays for the administration fee. If the primary insurer denies payment of a vaccine and the administration fee, such as in cases where a deductible m ust be met, the provider may replace the privately purchased vaccine wi th VFC vaccine and bill AHCCCS for the administration fee. The provider must document this replacement on the VFC borrowing form (see Module 6 ). Consider ations regarding this option: the provider may be reimbursed a higher dollar amount if privately purchased vaccine is administered and both the vaccine and the administration fee ar e billed to the primary insurer AHCCCS as Secondary Insurance and High -Dedu ctible Plans If a child has AHCCCS as secondary insurance and the primary insurance is a high -deductible insurance plan requiring the parent to pay out of pocket for vaccines, the child should be considered VFC -eligible if the family has not yet reached it s deductible. VFC vaccines should be administered, and the administration fee should be billed to AHCCCS until the deductible is reached. If a child does not have AHCCCS as secondary insurance, the child is not VFC-eligible even if a child's family has a high -deductible plan. Underinsured Underinsured means the child has health insurance, but the insurance policy: doesn't cover any ACIP -recommended vaccines doesn't cover all ACIP -recommended vaccines (underinsured for vaccines not covered) does cover ACIP -recommended vaccines, but has a fixed dollar limit or cap for vaccines . The child is considered underinsured once the fixed dollar amount is reached Before administering a vaccine, providers must verify whether the child's health insurance plan covers ACI P-recommended vaccines. If the provider cannot verify vaccination coverage, for the purposes of the VFC program, the child is considered insured and not eligible to receive VFC vaccines at that immunization encounter. Note: As required by the Affordable Ca re Act, insurance plans purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace are required to cover ACIP -recommended vaccines (including seasonal flu vaccine) for children of all ages, without charging a deductible, copayment, or billing coinsurance. Module 3 - VFC Eligibility and Requirements 45 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) Underinsured children can receive VFC vaccines only at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) , rural health clinics (RHCs ), or under an approved deputization agreement. FQHCs and RHCs provide health care to medically underserved areas and meet certain criteria under Medicare and Medicaid programs . Table: Qui ck View of VFC Eligibility and Insurance Situations Child's Insurance Status VFC- Eligible? VFC Eligibility Category Enrolled in AHCCCS Yes AHCCCS Has private health insurance plan with AHCCCS as secondary insurance Yes AHCCCS Has health insurance covering all vaccines, but has not yet met plan's deductible or paid for other services received at visit No Insured. This applies even when the primary insurer would deny reimbursement for the cost of the vaccine and its administration because the pla n's deductible has not been met Has health insurance covering all vaccines, but has not yet met plan's deductible or paid for other services received at visit and has AHCCCS as secondary insurance Yes AHCCCS What is an FQHC? An FQHC is a health center designated by the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to provide health ca re to a medically underserved population. FQHCs include community and migrant health centers, special health facilities such as those for the homeless and persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that receive grants under the Public Health Se rvice (PHS) Act, and \"look -alikes,\" which meet the qualifications but do not actually receive grant funds. They also include health centers within public housing and Indian health centers. What is an RHC? An RHC is a clinic located in a Health Professional Shortage Area, a Medically Underserved Area, or a Governor - Designated Shortage Area. RHCs are required to be staffed by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or certified nurse midwives at least half of the time that the clinic is open. 46 Has health insurance covering all vaccines, but the plan has a fixed dollar limit or cap on amount that it will cover No Yes Insured until the fixed dollar limit is met Underinsured after the fixed dollar limit is reached Has an insurance plan that does not cover all ACIP -recommended vaccines Yes Underinsured.

With implementation of ACA, this situation should be rare *FQHCs, RHCs and deputized providers can only vaccinate these patients Enrolled in a Health Care Sharing Ministry Yes Uninsured as Health Care Sharing Ministry plans are not recognized insurance by the State of Arizona Insurance Departm ent Enrolled in KidsCare Yes AHCCCS Has no health insurance coverage Yes Uninsured Has private health insurance that covers all vaccinations and is AI/AN Yes AI/AN. However, provider should choose the eligibility category most cost -effective for the child and family Has AHCCCS and is AI/AN Yes Medicaid or AI/AN. Provider should use Medicaid for the administration fee because this provides the least out -of-pocket expense for the family VFC eligibility is not generally retroactive. Contact the AIPO if you discover that a child was actually VFC eligible on the date of service but was treated as an ineligible child. In rare circumstances and when this is not part of the regular business practice VFC may be able to replace the private stock vaccine with VFC vaccine. 47 Module 4 - Arizona State Immunization Information System (ASIIS) Table of Contents Module 4 - Arizona State Immunization Information System (ASIIS) Overview ASIIS Access State Law Concerning ASIIS ASIIS Electronic Reporting ASIIS Manual Entry 48 Overview The Arizona State Immunization Information System (ASIIS) is an immunization registry designed to capture immunization data on individuals throughout the state. The registry serves as a repository for the reported data. In this capacity, the registry provi des a valuable tool for the management and reporting of immunization information to the public, health professionals, private and public health providers, parents or guardians . ASIIS Access Each individual is required to have their own log in to ASIIS and must not use other user's log-ins. To gain access to ASIIS and obtain a username and password , email a provider change form to asiishelpdesk@azdhs.gov . Individuals that are not designated as the primary or ba ck-up VFC coordinator s that would like access to ordering and inventory reconciliation are required to submit their CDC You Call the Shots (the Vaccines for Children or Storage and Handling module) or the AIPO Training (Arizona Vaccines for Children Train ing) certificate to gain access to these modules . State Law Concerning ASIIS Requirement: All providers are required to report all (VFC and private) vaccines they administer to children birth through 18 years of age to ASIIS. Arizona Revised Statute (A.R.S. \u00a736 -135) https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00135.htm requires all providers to report V FC and private doses they administer to children birth through 18 years of age to ASIIS. Reporting administered VFC doses to ASIIS is also a VFC program requirement. Failure to report administered doses to ASIIS can lead to inactivation as a VFC provider. The following information must be included for all reporting methods: ASIIS Electronic Reporting All electronic reporting providers are encouraged to utilize a HL7 upload process allowing electronic health records to communicate with ASIIS thus reducing the need to manually report doses into ASIIS. Please send an email to ASIIS_Group1@azdhs.gov for more information on how to transition to a HL7 upload process.

P roviders are responsible for maintaining vaccine quality from the time a shipment arrives at a facility until a dose is administered. Therefore, sound vaccine manag ement practices related to storage a nd handling are critical to minimizing vaccine loss and waste and potentially putting VFC children at risk from compromised vaccine. Providers are responsible for: ensuring vaccine coordinators are properly trained and that a V accine Accountability and Management Plan is posted on a VFC cold storage unit to be accessed by all when /if needed implementing best practices for vaccine storage and handling to avoid vaccine wastage enforcing vaccine inventory accountability policies Vaccine Storage and Handling All VFC vaccine st orage and handling requirements and recommendations are in place to ensure the vaccine cold chain is maintained. The cold chain begins at the manufacturing plant, includes delivery to and storage at the provider facility, and ends with administration of vaccine to the patient. Too much exposure to heat, cold, or light at any step in the cold chain can result in a loss of vaccine potency. Once potency is lost, it cannot be restored. Each time vaccines are exposed to improper conditions, potency is reduced ev en further. With loss of potency, vaccines become non-viable and are unable to provide immunity for the vaccinated individual. CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit provides guidance on safe and effective vaccine management practices for all health care providers. The AIPO strongly encourages all providers to adopt all recommendations and best practices in the Toolkit. Following the Toolkit's guidance can minimize fin ancial burden for providers due to vaccine loss and prevent the need for revaccination. The result is maximum vaccine effectiveness and patient protection. Please note that all VFC providers must abide by the rules and regulations outlined by the AIPO in this operations guide. 51 Refrigerator and Freezer Units Storage units must have enough room to store the largest inventory a provider might have at the busiest point in the year without crowding. The AIPO recommends the following units, in order of preference, for the storage of VFC vaccines: Purpose -built or pharmaceutical/medical- grade units, including door less , dual control and dispensing units Stand -alone refrigerator and freezer units \u2014 these units can vary in size from a compact, under -the-counter style to a larg e, stand - alone, pharmaceutical- grade storage unit Dual control household units can be used if it has a separate temperature control for the refrigerator and a separate temperature cont rol for the freezer . If the combination household unit has only one control, providers will be required to purchase stand- alon e units The use of dormitory or bar -style refrigerator s/ freezers is prohibited at all times for VFC program providers. These units have a single exterior door and an evaporator plate/cooling coil, usually located in an icemaker/freezer compartment. Providers should follow the manufacturer's storage specifications for each vaccine, found in the manufacturer package insert. If a provider office is purchas ing new refrigerator and/or freezer units, they are required to purchase stand- alone units. The AIPO will only ship varicella containing vaccines to sites where the refrigerator/freezer used to store VFC vaccine is CDC/VFC a pproved. The VFC program does not endorse any specific refrigerator/freezer brand or manufacturer, however units used to store VFC vaccine must meet the required specifications above. Please contact the AIPO at 602 -364-3642 if you have questions about the unit's ability to properly store vaccines. Storage Unit Practices To protect the viability of vaccines: never store food or beverages in a unit with vaccines store biologics or other medications on the bottom shelf to avoid inadvertent administration and medication errors do not store vaccines on the top shelf, in the deli, fruit, or vegetable bins (remove bins if possible), in the doors or on the floor of the unit, or under or near cooling vents place water bottles, marked as \"do not d rink\" throughout the refrigerator and the freezer \u2014 against walls, in the back, on the floor, and in the doors \u2014to help maintain proper temperatures place vaccines and diluents in the center of the unit, two to three inches away from walls, ceiling, floor, and door store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration 52 Storage Unit Set Up Providers should only plug one storage unit into an electrical outlet to avoid creating a fire hazard. Providers should avoid using power outlets that can be tripped or switched off, incl uding built in - circuit switches (as they may have reset buttons), outlets that can be activated by a wall switch and multi -outlet power strips. Providers are required to protect the power source for all cold storage units, by means of posting \"do not unplug\" signs on the wall next to the outlet to ensure cold storage units don't inadvertently become unplugged, resulting in wasted vaccine. Providers are also required to have a \"do not turn off circuit breaker\" sign on their circuit breaker b ox, the number of the circuit breaker that corresponds to the outlet the unit is plugged into and a contact person's name and number. Red \"caution perishable vaccine\" magnets are no longer required but the AIPO still recommends having one on the refriger ator and/or freezer with the emergency contact's names and numbers filled out. Data Loggers VFC providers must use a data logger with continuous temperature monitoring capability and a current and valid calibration certificate (also known as a report of c alibration or certificate of calibration ) in each unit storing public vaccines. Data loggers must be used during routine, on -site vaccine storage, vaccine transport ( with prior approval from the AIPO ), and as a back -up. Providers are required to have one d ata logger for each refrigerator and each freezer that stores VFC vaccine and one on site as the back -up. In some instances, data loggers may be supplied by the AIPO. To meet VFC program requirements, the data logger must be equipped with: a temperature p robe or sensor in a buffered material (usually glycol) . The probe must be kept in the middle of the unit with the VFC vaccines to ensure that the temperature of the air around the VFC vaccines is being recorded an active temperature display on the outside of the unit that can be easily read without opening the storage unit's door or have another way of seeing the data ( cloud, download, another screen away from the unit etc..) continuous temperature monitoring and recording capabilities and the capacity to routinely download data *There may be providers who have purpos e-built or pharmaceutical- grade cold storage units (e.g., door less or dispensing units) with temperature monitoring capabilities that may be as reliable as a data logger in monitoring vaccine temperature. Not all of these units may be capable of digitally logging temperatures. When in doubt, consult the AIPO at arizonavfc@azdhs.gov on whether or not the unit is capable of meeting VFC temperature monitoring device requirements. 53 Additional recommended data logger features include: alarm for out -of-range temperatures temperature display showing current, minimum, and maximum temperatures low battery indicator accuracy of +/ -1\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C) Calibration Certificates are required for all data loggers monitoring temperatures in all units storing VFC vaccines as well as the backup and must include: model/device number serial number date of calibration (report or issue date) calibration expiration date ( not to exceed three (3) years) confirmation the instrument passed testing (or instrument in tolerance) Calibration certificates must include at least one of the following items in regards to the calibration testing : conforms to ISO 17025 was performed by an ILAC/MRA Signatory body accredited Laboratory is traceable to the standards maintained by NIST meets specifications and testing requirements for the American Society for Test ing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E2877 tolerance Class F ( 0.5\u00b0C) or better Providers must ensure that data loggers are properly set up and recording temperatures in all cold storage units that contain VFC vaccines every 15 minutes. The lower data logge r alarm for the refrigerator must be set to 35.9\u00b0F (1.9\u00b0C) and the upper alarm to 46.1\u00b0F (8.1\u00b0C). The lower data logger alarm for the freezer must be set to - 40.0\u00b0F ( -40.0\u00b0C) and the upper alarm to 5.1\u00b0F ( -14.9\u00b0C). A back -up data logger must be readily available in case a data logger fails or calibration testing is required. The back - up data logger should have a different calibration retesting da te than other data loggers to avoid requiring all data loggers to be sent out for recalibratio n at the same time . Back -up data loggers must be maintained on site. The back -up data logger must be portable to be used in the event of vaccine transport. The AIPO recommends that providers keep just the probe (not the digital display) in the refrigerator so it is at temperature so it can be used in the event of an emergency. If providers opt to keep the probe in the refrigerator, t he digital display of the back -up data logger must not be operational or on the cold storage unit to avoid conflicting temperature readings between the back -up and main data loggers which can lead to potential confusion. Provider offices are responsible for ensuring all data loggers that monitor the temperatures of any VFC vaccine are sent for recalibration by an appropriate company before t he calibration expires per the calibration certificate . Repeated data logger issues within provider offices may require staff to take a training and/or vaccines may be wasted . Module 5 - Vaccine Storage and Handling 54 Daily Temperature Monitoring and Recording Providers are required to have protocols for reviewing and recording the temperature twice daily, once in the morning and once in the afternoon and the minimum and maximum (min/max) temperature readings of vaccine cold storage units , once in the morning for the previous 24 hours . They s hould also have procedures for training appropriate staff to document, assess, and interpret temperature monitoring data. The CDC requires reviewing and recording min/max temperature readings at the beginning of the workday for the previous 24 hours. This helps to identify temperature excursions quickly so corrections can be made to prevent vaccine loss. Information that is required when documenting a temperature reading: tempe ratures must be handwritten on the appropriate temperature log with the providers pin. The log s must be posted on the VFC refrigerator and freezer two temperature readings per day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) and one min/max temperature reading p er day at the beginning of the workday for the previous 24 hours to the tenths place ( e.g. 40.2 \u00b0F) exact t ime (e.g. 8:07am) and date of each reading name or initials of the person who assessed and recorded the reading Data logger data must be downloaded and reviewed two times per month. This will assist you in finding any missed temperature excursions and ensures that the data logger has adequate memory. The provider is required to enable access to all saved data logge r reports to its staff (e.g. public computer drive, share d drive, external storage device , etc. ). All provider staff are Providers must main tain all paper temperature logs and data logger reports for a minimum of six (6) years. If a temperature excursion is suspected, providers should follow their V accine Accountability and Management P lan, including keep ing the vaccines in the cold storage unit , isolating affected vaccines in a bag or box, labeling them \"do not use\", complete the VFC Incident Report and u pload all applicable electronic data logger reports for each incident to determine whether the vaccine can still be used. The reports must be directly from the data logger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv). Providers without access to Goo gle applications must email all required documents to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . Once the AIPO receives all required incident documents, providers will receive a response regarding viability of the VFC vaccines from t he AIPO in 4 -5 business days. The AIPO will not be able to determine VFC vaccine viability if all documents are not received via email from the provider. If a provider office will be closed for more than four (4) days, someone must come in on the fifth a nd subsequent days to take the temperatures twice a day or transport the vaccines to another VFC provider before the closure occurs. C onsult Module 6 for transport instructions. If a provider office is closed for more than fo ur (4) days and their data loggers are not operational, vaccines may be wasted as the AIPO will not be able to determine if the cold storage units were maintaining appropriate temperatures for the duration of the office closure. Cold Storage Unit Temperatures Refrigerated vaccines must be stored between 36.0\u00b0F and 46 .0\u00b0F (2 .0\u00b0C and 8 .0\u00b0C). Refrigerated vaccine freezes when it reaches \u00b0F If refrigerated vaccines reach 32.0 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C), the provider will be required to waste them as they are frozen and no longer viable. If the HPV9 Module 5 - Vaccine Storage and Handling 55 (Gardasil\u00ae9) is exposed to temperatures between 32.1 \u00b0F and 35.9 \u00b0F (0.1 \u00b0C and 2.0 \u00b0C) for more than 72 hours it needs to be wasted. If the o pen IPV (IPOL\u00ae) i s exposed to temperatures above 46.0\u00b0 F for more than 30 minutes it needs to be wasted. Store water bottles in all refrigerators, including pharmacy grade units, unless the manufacturer indicates that water bottles negatively impact the functionality of the unit. Water bottles placed in refrigerators help maintain proper temperatures during busy days and power outages. Frozen vaccines (MMRII, Varivax and Proquad) must be stored at 5 .0\u00b0F or lower ( -15.0\u00b0C). MMRII may be stored in the freezer or the refrigerat or. MMRII is heat sensitive and much less likely to be spoiled if kept in the freezer. Store water bottles in all freezers, including pharmacy grade units, unless the manufacturer indicates that water bottles negatively impact the functionality of the unit. Water bottles placed in freezers help maintain proper temperatures during busy days and power outages . Separating Pediatric Vaccine Stock Providers are required to have two separate vaccine inventories: one for publicly purchased (VFC) vaccines and one for privately purchased vaccines. VFC vaccines must be labe led as VFC to ensure the correct stock is selected . Publicly purchased vaccine inventory includes VFC vaccines supplied to the prov ider for administration to VFC and KidsCare children. Privately p urchased vaccine inventory includes vaccines purchased for the provider's privately insured children. All privately purchased vaccines must be separated from publicly purchased vaccines in vaccine storage units. Maintaining VFC Vaccine Viability The foll owing tips are intended to assist in maintaining a safe refrigerator and freezer environment and constant temperature for the vaccine supply: install the refrigerator/freezer away from the any heat sources such as direct sunlight, furnaces or radiators keep the refrigerator and freezer sections full, but don't overcrowd the shelves (allow full air circulation) when accessing the unit open and close the door quickly to minimize the time the refrigerator door is kept open check units frequently for tight door seals clean condenser coils at the rear or underside of the refrigerator at least two (2) to six (6) times a year to prevent loss of cooling efficiency when coils become insulated with dust defrost the freezer compartment whenever the frost layer is \u00bc -inch thi ck. Excess frost can prevent a tight door seal do not freeze diluent. Providers can call the AIPO to request additional diluent for VFC vaccines rotate vaccine according to expiration dates every week or when a new shipment comes in (whichever happens more frequently) so that newer vaccines are stored toward the back of the unit while soonest -to-expire are stored in the front open only one vial or box of a particular vaccine at a time to control vaccine use and allow for easier inventory control. On each opened vaccine vial, indicate on the label the date and time it was reconstituted or first opened 56 Module 6 - Vaccine Management Activities and Reporting Table of Contents Module 6 - Vaccine Management Activities and Reporting Overview Managing Vaccine Incidents Vaccine Transfer/Transport Off-site Clinics/Mobile Units Vaccine Borrowing Vaccine Borrowing Documentation Invoices Management of Expired, Spoiled, and Wasted Vaccines Reporting Administered Dosed to ASIIS Restitution (Dose for Dose Replacement) Year End Report Card Dose for Dose Replacement Exceptions/Extensions/Substitutions for Year End Report Card Dose for Dose Replacement Dose for Dose Replacement Due to Provider's Failure to Maintain Vaccines per VFC Program Requirements Instructions for All Dose for Dose Replacements 57 Overview Vaccine management and reporting are broad terms intended to describe vaccine management related to transferring vaccines, returns and reporting practices that should be followed by VFC providers and their staff. The AIPO follow s the CDC Storage and Handling T oolkit, a comprehensive resource for providers on vaccine management recommendations and best practices. Please note, the Arizona VFC Operations Guide may have requirements no t found in the CDC Storage and Handling Toolkit, providers must comply with the Arizona VFC Operations Guide. Managing Vaccine Incidents To ensure vaccines continue to be viable, providers are required to report all vaccine incidents to the AIPO immediate ly. Vaccine incidents include but are not limited to, temperature excursions, power outages, theft of vaccine etc. If a temperature excursion is suspected, providers should follow their Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan, including keeping the vaccines in the cold storage unit, isolating affected vaccines in a bag or box and labeling them \"do not use\". Providers mu st complete and email the VFC I ncident Report, all applicable electronic data logger reports for each incident. The reports must be directly from the data logger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv). Providers without access to Google applications must email all required documents to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . Once the AIPO receive s all required incident documents, providers will receive a response from the AIPO within 4-5 business days. The response will contain a vaccine viability information summary as verified by the AIPO. The AIPO will not be able to determine VFC vaccine viability if all documents are not received via email from the provider. Vaccine should only be transported from the physical location of a VFC provider during an emergency, unexpected extended power outage, or with the permission of the Immunization Program t o prevent vaccine wastage. If the power has been out at a provider office for two (2) hours, providers must appropriately pack their vaccines and transport them to the address listed on their VFC Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan. Contact the AIP O for directions and permissions. If provider offices experience multiple vaccine incident due to power outages, the AIPO will require a summary document from the power company, documenting the dates and times of the power outages in the provider offices' area. When a freezer experiences a defrost cycle and the temperature increases above 5.0\u00b0F (-15.0 \u00b0C) for more than an hour, providers are required to keep the vaccines in the cold storage unit, isolate affected vaccines in a bag or box, label them \"do no t use\" and email electronic data logger reports to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . Depending on the outcome of the time and temperature analysis, providers may be required to complete the VFC Incident Report. The AIPO will email providers if additional information is required. If vaccines are required to be wasted due to a vaccine incident, providers will be required to email a data logger report with five (5) full consecutive days of current in-range temperatures before a n order can be placed. 58 If a provider's cold storage unit experiences more than two (2) unexplained temperature excursions in a three (3) month period, the provider will be required to have the cold storage unit serviced and the provider will be required t o provide the AIPO with the service receipt. Providers will be required to purchase stand -alone units if a temperature excursion occurs in a household unit with three (3) months of the unit being serviced that results in wastage of any VFC vaccine. Provi ders will be required to replace stand -alone units if VFC vaccines are wasted more than twice in a six (6) month period after the unit has been serviced due to unexplained temperature excursions. If a new unit is purchased, the provider office will be re quired to provide the AIPO with a receipt of sale for a new stand -alone unit(s) and a data logger report with five (5) full consecutive days of current in-range temperatures , after the date of purchase, before the new unit(s) can be used to store VFC vacci nes. If a location continues to experience unexplained temperature excursions after a storage unit is replaced with a stand -alone unit, an action plan will be required. Vaccine Transfer /Transport Proper vaccine inventory management at the provider level plays a major role in preventing the need to transfer vaccines. However, even with proper inventory management, providers may experience a situation where they have to transfer vaccines . Please no te, the CDC does not allow for the use of vaccine depots and therefore provider offices cannot order large quantities of VFC vaccine for re -distribution to their other VFC facilities. Requirement: VFC providers are required to gain the approval of the AIPO prior to transporting vaccines except in emergency situations. Vaccine viability is essential for preventing vaccine preventable diseases and transport of vaccine s is strongly discouraged by the CDC therefore transport of vaccines is allowed ONLY under the following circumstances : soon to expir e vaccines (at least 90 days prior to the expiration date ) facilities that close temporarily (for more than 4 days) or perma nently emergency situations (providers will need to activate their emergency handing plan within the Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan) Varicella and MMRV ( Proquad) are not allowed to be transferred between providers except in an emergency due to their fragile nature. Provider transfer requests will be denied if the request contains the following: if a provider has open VFC vaccine incidents, providers are not allowed to initiate a transfer to or accept a transfer from another facility until the VF C vaccine incidents have been closed by the AIPO 59 Due to the fragile nature of vacci nes, and the tendency to freeze during transport, vaccine transfer requests may be denied depending on the distance from the sending to the receiving facility . The AIPO ret ains the discretion to require providers to replace doses on a dose for dose replacement if vaccines are transferred and the following procedures are not followed: a transfer request must be submitted to the AIPO in ASIIS by the sending facility both the s ending and receiving facilities must email up-to-date in -range data logger reports to the AIPO the same day the transfer request was submitted the transfer request must be approved by the AIPO in ASIIS before transport can take place conditioned water bottles must be used during vaccine transport of refrigerated vaccines all transfers must include the use of a data loggers with a current and valid c alibration certificate for temperature monitoring during transport, as well as other appropriate equipment. *Please note, if a data logger is not used for transporting to and from facilities, vaccines may be wasted at th e discretion of AIPO management all data logger reports used during transport must be kept on site for six (6) years the receiving facility mu st inspect the vaccines. If the provider chooses to accept the transferred vaccines they will immediately place the vaccines in the refrigerator and/or freezer and then the receiving provider will receive the vaccines in ASIIS by marking the transfer as re ceived Off-site Clinics/Mobile Units Provider offices must have their vaccines delivered to the same location that the y will be administered at. The use of mobile units is limited to those providers that are currently approved by the AIPO to operate mobile units to administer vaccines. Provider offices are prohibited from using mobile units to administer vaccine if the vaccine is not shipped to the location the mobile unit will be administering vaccine at. VFC vaccines may not be ship ped to, or stored at a private residence. Vaccine Borrowing The AIPO's expectation is that vaccine borrowing will be rare as providers should maintain adequate inventories of vaccine for both privately and publicly insured children. VFC vaccines should ne ver be used as a continuous replacement system for a provider's private ly purchased vaccine inventory. Borrowing of vaccines must be due to unforeseen delays or circumstances. Borrowing activities will be monitored as part of the compliance with the VFC program and follow -up actions will be taken when excessive or inappropriate borrowing activities are noted. If a VFC vaccine is intentionally or unintentionally administered to a non -VFC eligible patient, the provider must replace the misused VFC dose with a privately purchased dose and submit a borrowing report to the AIPO immediately upon discovery. Providers should not use privately purchased vaccines to vaccinate VFC eligible patients as the VFC program will not compensate providers for those doses used except in the following approved circumstances: a lack of VFC-stock vaccine due to unexpected circumstances such as a distributor 60 and/or manufacturer shipment delay VFC vaccine s spoiled in transit to the provider office from the distributor and/or manufac turer new staff that calculated ordering time of VFC vaccine incorrectly (*Note: This should only occur in exceeding ly rare circumstances*) Providers are not permitted to borrow influenza doses. Borrowing reports containing influenza will not be processed. Approval of borrowing reports may be subject to AIPO's discretion . Excessive use of borrowing reports may lead to the VFC provider being placed on probation for failure to comply with program policies and procedures. Vaccine Borrowing Documentation If any of the above instances occur, providers are required to complete a Vaccine Borrowing Report and email it to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . AIPO staff will adjust the inventory after receiving borrowing reports fro m the provider. Provider staff must NOT adjust the inventory in ASIIS themselves. Once the provider's inventory has been adjusted by AIPO staff, the provider office will receive an email indicating the adjustments have been made. If the number of borrowed doses exceeds 0.2% of reported doses linked to patients in ASIIS over the last year: private doses will no longer be replaced with VFC doses VFC d oses will need to be replaced on a dose for dose basis, by purchasing private doses to be converted into VFC doses. Providers will be required to submit the invoice for the privately purchased vaccine to the AIPO . Invoices The AIPO requires a copy of the invoice validating that the privately purchased va ccine was used to replenish the borrow ed VFC vaccines. The AIPO may also ask for copies of the packing slips for the privately purchased vaccines . Management of Expired, Spoiled, and Wasted Vaccines When managing expired, spoiled, and wasted vaccine, providers must: remove the vac cines from any storage unit that stores viable vaccines label vaccines \"do not use\" email a completed wasted/expired form to the AIPO via arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . Once the AIPO receives the wasted/expired form, providers will receive an email from the AIPO with the next steps return expired and spoiled vaccines to the depot (McKesson) within six (6) months of the expiration date or spoilage wasted vaccines should be disposed of following state and local disposal requirements Types of Vaccine Loss Expired or spoiled vaccine: nonviable vaccine in its original container (vial or syringe) that is able to be returned. This includes expired vaccine or vaccine spoiled due to temperature excursions, transport conditions, or emergency situations such as a power failure. Wasted vaccine: nonviable vaccine that is unable to be returned. This includes vaccines in an open vial, drawn into a syringe, or compromised because its container was dropped or broken. 61 after the wasted/expired form is emailed to the AIPO, all expired, spoiled and wasted vaccines must be removed from the ASIIS inventory using the appropriate category and reason matching the form Providers must remove wasted/expired doses fro m the ASIIS inventory monthly, at a minimum. It is recommended to remove wasted/expired doses from the ASIIS inventory at the time of the event to ensure that the ASIIS inventory is up- to-date. The AIPO will work proactively to ensure VFC vaccine is tracke d and accounted for at all VFC provider offices. If providers need technical assista nce with ASIIS inventory management, please contact the ASIIS helpdesk at 602 -364-3899 or 1-877-491-5741. Every attempt should be made to use VFC vaccine appropriately. I f you need assistance with spoiled, wasted or expired VFC vaccines, please contact the AIPO, do not call the manufacturer. Reporting Administered Doses to ASIIS VFC providers are required to report VFC and privately administered doses to ASIIS. All doses must be linked to a patient. All administered doses must decrement from the ASIIS inventory. When reporting administered doses in ASIIS, it is not acceptable to r econcile administered doses out of the ASIIS inventory using \"matches physical inventory\" as a reconciliation reason. All administered doses must be accounted for and the vaccine inventory must be reconciled to reflect the doses that were wasted, expired , or spoiled to continue to order VFC vaccine. Doses that are considered accounted for are those doses that were administered and linked to a patient in ASIIS and those do ses that were removed from ASIIS as expired, wasted/spoiled and the AIPO has received a wasted/expired form from the provider. Providers are required to report the lot number from the box (not the vial or syringe ). The lot number from the box will be used in the ASIIS inventory. Using the lot number or NDC from the vial or syringe will cause inventory issues. In addition, if there is a vaccine recall, the lot number from the box will be used to determine which patients should be contacted. The following components are required to be documented in the patient's medical record for every vaccine administered : o vaccine name o lot number (from the box) o manufacturer o date vaccine given o site and route given (IM/Sq) o documentation from the child's parent confirming that the child's parent r equests that the designated vaccine be administered to the child o the name of person giving the vaccine - and their title o date VIS was given o VIS publication date o VFC eligibility code o name and address of the provider office 62 Providers may add administered vaccines that were not administered at their facility to ASIIS using the \"add historical\" button in a patient's vaccination record in ASIIS. For example, a new patient comes into a provider office and presents immunization re cords administered in the State of Texas, the provider staff could add the doses administered in Texas in to ASIIS as historical. Please note, doses that were gi ven at your facility on a previous date are not considered historical. Restitution (Dose for Dose Replacement) As a VFC provider you have agreed to account for every VFC dose that you have received. The AIPO acknowledges that providers make good faith efforts to store and handle vaccines appropriately as outlined in this operations guide. However , the AIPO will require providers to provide dose for dose replacement for any doses of VFC vaccines that have been wasted due to the provider's failure to properly receive, store or account for their inventory in ASIIS. Dose for dose replacement is required from VFC providers when vaccine wastage of doses that expire in the calendar year is greater than 5% of the total number of VFC vaccines that expire in the calendar year and in situations where providers fail to maintain vaccines per VFC program require ments. Wastage includes all: expired doses, drawn up/not used doses, unaccounted doses (doses not appropriately attached to patient records in ASIIS and decremented from the ASIIS inventory), lost and unaccounted doses, broken/dropped/spilled doses, etc. Year End Report Card Dose for Dose Replacement Each site can incur up to 5% wastage of doses that expire in that year; however, once 5% is exceeded, all wasted doses will need to be replaced by the site at its expense via private vaccine purchase. Vaccine w astage will be monitored by the AIPO. Providers will receive quarterly report cards in April, July and October and the year -end report card in January of the following year notifying them of their current wastage percentage per ASIIS records . All VFC vacc ines will need to be fully accounted for by their expiration date. Expired, unaccounted VFC vaccines will be removed from the ASIIS inventory at the end of the year as lost and unaccounted for and will count towards the site's wastage. Once the doses have expired and are removed from the ASIIS inventory, sites will not be allowed to go back and account for the doses. Arizona state law requires all pediatric vaccine records to be entered in ASIIS within 30 days of administration. Flu doses are exempt from do se for dose replacement; however, they still need to be fully accounted for appropriately in ASIIS. Exceptions/Extensions/Substitutions for Year End Report Card Dose for Dose Replacement VFC sites can submit an exception form for wastage due to unit failur e or other events outside of the provider's control if all Arizona VFC program guidelines were adhered to during these incidents. Exceptions may be granted on a case -by-case basis. The VFC program may allow for an extended dose for dose replacement timeline, not exceeding 6 months. VFC sites may request to substitute replacement vaccines for a different type (replace same dollar value with any combination of vaccines to reach the identified current VFC dollar value) by submitting a substitution form. Su bstitution requests may be granted on a case -by-case basis. 63 Dose for Dose Replacement Due to Provider's Failure to Maintain Vaccines per VFC Program Requirements Immediate dose for dose replacement may be required in the following situations: failure to immediately open a vaccine shipment from McKesson or Merck resulting in non -viable vaccine; failure to contact the AIPO at the first instance of a recorded temperature excursion resulting in spoiled vaccines; failure to continuously monitor VFC doses at the site with a properly calibrated data logger; or failure to continuously monitor a vaccine transport with a data logger; any unauthorized transfer of vaccine all t ransfers must be submitted in ASIIS and approved by the AIPO prior to transporting the vaccines); or wasting viable vaccines. Instructions for All Dose for Dose Replacements VFC sites will be advised via email when there is a need for dose for dose replace ment for either the year -end report card dose for dose replacement or dose for dose replacement due to the provider's failure to maintain vaccines per VFC program requirements. VFC sites will receive instructions and the detailed VFC Dose for Dose Replacem ent Form which includes a list and quantity of vaccines that must be replaced. Providers will be required to replace all vaccines within 60 days of receiving the email and must email the completed and signed VFC Dose for Dose Replacement Form along with th e packing slips/invoices for all of the privately purchased vaccines. Step by Step Dose for Dose Replacement Instructions: 1. The provider/site purchases the vaccines that are listed on the dose for dose replacement form using provider/private funds. 2. When the vaccine shipment arrives, the provider marks the doses \"VFC\" and puts them in the appropriate cold storage unit. Do not administer the doses yet (if doses are administered prior to being added to ASIIS by the AIPO it will result in dose accountability issues). 3. The provider submits the packing slips/invoices and the completed and signed VFC Dose for Dose Replacement form to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov . 4. The AIPO enters the replacement doses in provider's VFC invento ry in ASIIS. 5. The AIPO emails the provider to let them know the doses are ready to use. 6. The provider administers the doses to their VFC eligible patients and is responsible to account for every dose and ensure it has decremented from the ASIIS inventory. Providers who do not adhere to this policy and do not complete their dose for dose replacement within the allowed 60 days, without an approved extension, will have a hold placed on their vaccine ordering privileges and will be placed on probation with the VFC program until they complete the dose for dose replacement and submit the required documentation. A corrective action plan will also be required from the VFC site if the AIPO has not received communication from the site regarding the dose for dose replacement after 60 days of receiving the email regarding dose for dose replacement. 64 Module 7 - Vaccine Ordering Table of Contents Module 7 - Vaccine Ordering Overview Vaccine Ordering Receiving VFC Vaccine Shipments Order Delays or Cancellations Maintaining Vaccine Inventory Vaccine Shipments 65 Overview Vaccine loss due to expiration is frequently a consequence of over -ordering and/or poor inventory management. To prevent this, providers need to determine the appropriate amounts to order for thei r private and public vaccine inventories. Requirement: Providers must monitor vaccine orders to ensur e they are ordering vaccine in the appropriate amounts and properly maintaining their vaccine inventories. Vaccine Ordering All VFC providers are required to submit a vaccine order at least once per calendar year through ASIIS. Providers must order all ACIP vaccines, including flu vaccine. The following steps are required when placing an order: providers will be prompted to reconcile their dose s during the ordering process on the \"reconcile inventory\" page in ASIIS to reconcile doses, please move the number in the \" quantity on hand \" column to the \"physical inventory \" column for all vaccines regardless if the numbers match or not. Any administere d doses removed from the ASIIS inventory using the reconciliation reasons \"matches physical inventory,\" or \"administered but chose not to be in the registry\" (without proper documentation) are subject to the restitution policy, please see M odule 6 for the restitution policy if providers need to remove doses that are expired, wasted/spoiled, they can be removed from this \"reconciliation inventory\" page. Providers will place the quantity on hand number minus the number of doses that need to be removed into the \"physical inventory\" box . The \"adjustment\" column will show how many doses will be removed providers may only remove doses from the ASIIS inventory if the doses are expired, have been spoiled ( e.g. a temperature excursion ), wasted (e .g. drawn -up but not used) or a recall has occurred from the manufacturer removing doses as a means of matching up the inventory is not allowed when the reconciliation inventory page is completed, please press \"submit monthly inventory\" to ensur e the AIPO receives the updated inventory once providers press \"submit monthly inventory\" they will automatically be taken to the order screen o confirm the days and times the provider office is available to receive shipments, make any adjustments that are n eeded o select the correct order set from the \"Order Set\" drop down menu. Providers will have a separate flu order set during flu season o enter the quantity, by doses, that are needed in the \"Order Quantity\" box for all vaccines that need to be ordered o take a physical inventory of all doses in each storage unit and enter the current physical inventory count in the \"Comments\" box next to each vaccine if the \"Order Quantity\" and \"Comments\" boxes are gray for a vaccine, enter the physical inventory count in a similar vaccine type ( e.g. if Engerix -B is grayed out, you would put the physical inventory of the Engerix -B plus the Recombivax HB into the Recombivax HB \"Comments\" box) if the current inventory is not listed in the \"Comments\" box, the order may be denied 66 every time an order is placed, providers must email data logger reports from the last recorded dat e and time of the previously emailed data logger reports up until the date and time the order is submitted. The reports m ust be sent directly from the data lo gger application or in data format (.xls, .txt, or .csv) to arizonavfc@azdhs.gov if the AIPO does not receive provider data logger reports when the order is placed, the order may be cancelled and another order wi ll have to be placed Although provider offices are required to utilize data loggers , provider offices must utilize and retain a paper copy of the temperature logs on the VFC refrigerator and freezer. Receiving VFC Vaccine Shipments Proper handling and temperature maintenance of any vaccine shipment is imperative to maintain the cold chain and vaccine viability. Each provider site is required to have a standard office procedure in place for receiving vaccine shipments. Because a VFC v accine shipment can be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, proper handling of each dose is critical in preventing unnecessary loss or wastage. If vaccines are improperly handled they will lose viability and will have to be replaced. The provider off ice VFC primary or back -up coordinator should: notify other office staff that vaccine shipments will be arriving instruct front office staff on how to receive and store refrigerated and frozen vaccine shipments As soon as a VFC vaccine shipment arrives, office staff should do the following: receive and sign for vaccine orders placed by your office only open vaccine packages immediately determine the length of time the vaccine was in transit by looking at the packing list (shipments of frozen vaccine only). This insert will indicate the acceptable transit time based on the shipment date shown. The packing slip will state \"vaccines are viable if received on or before (this date). If vaccines are received after the documented date on the packing slip, pl ease call the AIPO immediately checking the cold chain monitor (CCM) for any indication of a temperature excursion during transit. CCMs are stored in a separate compartment of the shipping container and may not be included when vaccines are shipped directly from the manufacturer. CCMs are for one- time use only and should be thrown away after being checked inspect the packages and vaccines for damage compare the vaccine received with the vaccine products that appear on the packing list review the information provided on the packing slip to ensure: o the number of doses shipped and the number received are the same o the vacc ine expiration dates are the same on the vaccine boxes and the packing slip o the lot number(s) on the vaccine boxes match the packing slip making sure lyophilized (freeze -dried) vaccines came with the correct type and quantity of diluents. (Diluents for var icella- containing vaccines are stored in a separate compartment in the lid of the shipping container and are stored separately in the refrigerator.) checking both vaccine and diluent expiration dates to ensure none are expired or soon -to- expire products check the diluents (any diluents arriving frozen must not be used). Call the AIPO immediately if the diluents are frozen 67 remove vaccines from the shipping container and immediately store refrigerated vaccine in the refrigerator and frozen vaccine in the freezer MMR can be stored in the freezer or the refrigerator; varicella and varicella containing vaccine s must be stored in the freezer All VFC providers must receive the shipment of vaccine into the ASIIS inventory immediately after vaccines arrive in the provider office. To receive the order into ASIIS, follow the following steps: log into ASIIS under the \"orders/transfers\" tab on the left-hand side menu, select \"create/view orders\" under the \"inbound orders\" heading, click on the arrow under select compare the order in ASIIS to the vaccine shipment input the quantity received in the \"receipt quantity\" box for all vaccines received. If a ll the vacci nes are not received, please leave the \"receipt quantity\" blank and return to this page and enter the quantity received when the vaccines are physically received in the provider office click on the button that states \"receive.\" The received vac cine quantities will be transferred to the ASIIS inventory for use write any shipment discrepancies and/or problems with the vaccine order on the packing slip and email or fax the slip to the AIPO within 2 hours of receipt. Do not call the manufacturer wit h any VFC vaccine problems. Notify the AIPO immediately of all vaccine shipping problems - AIPO staff will determine what should be done do not fax the packing slip to the AIPO unles s there are discrepancies with the shipment or the shipment is rejected i n ASIIS it is critical that each VFC provider label and store VFC vaccine separately from private stock vaccines to be used for adults or other non VFC public stock vaccines. VFC vaccine must not be administered to adults, even if the packaging indicates that the vaccine can be used for adults carefully examine each v aricella shipment packing slip to determine whether it is VFC or private st ock. The box that contains the v aricella vaccine shipment will not be marked \"VFC\" so be sure to check the shipment before putting it into the freezer. Do not call the AIPO about a missing v aricella shipment until all shipments received in the past month have been checked place a \"VFC\" label on all VFC vaccine boxes or mark the boxes \"VFC\" The AIPO uses comments in ASI IS to provide direct communication to individual provider offices regarding their orders. It is important to frequently check ASIIS \"comments\" to determine the status of an order. Providers are encouraged to keep a 3 -4 week supply of vaccine on hand based on the providers' anticipated VFC eligible population and previous order history. If a provider must order more than a 3 - 4 week supply a comment must be placed by the provider on the order screen in ASIIS stating the reason for ordering additional vac cine. It will be at the discretion of the AIPO to approve or deny t he order. Order Delays or Cancellations Orders may be denied or placed on hold for the following reasons: up-to-date data logger reports have not been received via email 68 the data logger t emperatures are out of range having an open vaccine incident previous order (s) have not been received in ASIIS If orders are delayed or cancelled, the reason will be posted in the ASIIS comments. Maintaining Vaccine Inventory When establishing vaccine needs, please consider: vaccine deliveries usually take 7 -10 days to arrive in the provider office vaccine usage patterns ( e.g., increase d orders during July and August for \"back - to- school\" ) length of ti me before the next order is approved, shipped and received storage capabilities (do not order more vaccine than you can st ore and do not order pre - filled syringes if you do not have a large refrigerator - pre-filled syringes take more room than vials) Vaccine Shipments The AIPO acts as the coordinating center in Arizona for federally purchased vaccines. The AIP O will notify the provider via the comments section in ASIIS if there are any changes to the standard vaccine shipping routine. The AIPO will utilize the ASIIS Newsflash to communicate McKesson's holiday shipping schedule. When an order for VFC vaccine is placed by the provider the order is reviewed and approved by the AIPO. The order is then transmitted to McKesson, the vaccine distributor. McKesson will facilitate the delivery of the vaccines t o the provider's office. Orders from McKesson should arrive in provider offices on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays. Varicella and v aricella containing vaccines are shipped directly from Merck Manufacturing. Please allow 2 -4 weeks to receive these vaccines . Module 5 Module 5 Fraud and Abuse 69 Module 8 - Vaccine Administration and VAERS Table of Contents Module 8 - Vaccine Administration and VAERS Overview Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommended Vaccines Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Provider Administration Requirements Vaccine Administration Best Practices 70 Overview Appropriate vaccine administration is critical to vaccine effectiven ess. Only properly trained individuals should administer, report and record vaccines. All persons who administer vaccine should have continuing vaccine administration education and regular skills assessments. All VFC providers are required to report any clinically significant adverse events to the VAERS system. Advisory C ommittee Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommended Vaccines Providers are required to comply with the appropriate immunization schedule, dosage and contraindications established by the ACIP in VFC resolutions and included in the VFC program unless (a) in the provider's medical judgement and in accordance with accepted medical practice, it is deemed such compliance is medically inappropriate or (b) the particular requirements contradict the laws in Arizona pertaining to acceptable exemptions. ACIP V FC resolutions are available at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/providers/resolutions.html . All childhood vaccines r ecommended by the ACIP are available through the AIPO, Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. Therefore, VFC providers with a product preference may choose a particular brand as long as it is available through the VFC program. During vac cine shortages, presentations may be substituted. The AIPO will make every attempt to honor provider choice whenever possible, but the following situations might result in limited brand choice: manufacturing and distribution product availability or shortage influenza vaccine may not be available due to shortages or delays from the vaccine manufacturers new or changing vaccines may not be available immediately upon approval by the AIPO due to procurement processes or due to technical changes or updates to ASIIS that require planning, clinical review and imp lementation by technology staff the AIPO Manager has the authority to remove vaccines from availability as necessary If a brand chosen by a provider is not available (such as a supply shortage), AIPO st aff may take the following action under the authority and approval of the AIPO manager: if an identical vaccine is available, the alternate brand may be shipped without notification (e.g., PedvaxHIB \u00ae and ActHIB \u00ae). Providers are expected to make use of the equivalent vaccine to the best of their abilities until vaccine supplies normalize if a similar, but not equivalent vaccine is available, the provider will be asked to approve a replacement before any vaccine is shipped (e.g., Trumenba vs. Bexsero ) if a c ombination vaccine becomes unavailable, the provider will be asked to approve a shipment of individual antigen equivalents before the order is placed with CDC The AIPO will honor provider preference for packaging (e.g., syringes vs. vials) whenever possi ble. If syringes become unavailable for an extended period of time, the AIPO will ship vials without notification to the provider. If vials become unavailable for an extended period of time the AIPO will ship syringes to providers ordering less than 50 dos es of vaccine in vials. Providers with vial orders greater than 50 must approve a shipment of syringes as a replacement befo re the order is placed with CDC to ensure sufficient storage space availability. 71 If a provider chooses to use a different brand of vaccine, the physician bears the responsibility for using all remaining doses of the previously supplied vaccine before the expiration date, or safely transferring that vaccine to another active VFC provide r. This must receive prior approval from the AIPO Staff. Allowing a vaccine to expire because the provider has chosen to change brands will be considered a failure to properly monitor vaccine, and that provider will be subject to dose for dose vaccine replacement from the AIPO . Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) According to federal law VFC providers must provide a current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) at every immunization visit before a patient receives a vaccine and document the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the parent /patient in the patient's medical record. VISs are CDC fact sheets that inform parent s/patients of the benefits and risks of a vaccine. Providers can have paper VISs, laminated VISs or electronic VISs available to parent s/patients. If a parent /patient asks for a paper copy, provider offices must provide the parent /patient with a paper copy. It is not necessary to have the parent /patient sign anything to show they have received the VIS, unless provider offices require this. VISs can be downloaded from t he CDC's current VIS webpage at: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/vis -downloads.htm . Ensure that parent s/patients have a chance to have the ir questions answered. Give parent s/patients a phone number to call in case of any questions or unexpected symptoms after receiving a vaccine. When possible, provide the VIS in the person's native o r preferred language. Translated VISs are available from the CDC's current VIS webpage at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/ . All VFC providers are required to document the publication date of the VIS, located on the bottom corner of each VIS, in the patient's medical record and the date the VIS was given to the parent /patient. It is acceptable to provide a VIS before the immunization visit (e. g. by giving the parent /patient a copy to take home duri ng the prior visit or telling them how download or view a copy from the internet ). Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) All VFC providers must report any clinically significant adverse events that occur after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires health care providers to report the following: any event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine any event listed in the VAERS reportable event table that occurs within the specific time period after the vaccination any time a parent /patient asks providers and/or provider office staff to report any event (eve n if it may not be outside of the expected side effects) 72 Medication errors do not need to be submitted to VAERS, however if you feel that it is directly related to the patient's reaction, please report the medication error to VAERS. All documentation related to VAERS reports must be kept on site for a minimum of six (6) years. Provider Administration Requirements Providers are required to provide the following resources and trainings to provider office staff: current CDC/ACIP recommended immunization schedule vaccine contraindications/precautions administration techniques Vaccine Administration Best Practices Proper vaccine handling and preparation are equally as important as storing vaccines properly. Providers should fo llow best practices, including: always check the expiration date on vaccines and diluents before administering vaccines. Never use expired vaccine or diluents only use the diluents provided by the manufacturer for that vaccines as indicated in the product insert vaccines should be drawn up immediately before administration only prepare vaccines in a designated, clean medication area, away from any space where potentially contaminated items are placed vaccines s hould remain in their original boxes until all syringes and vials have been used vaccines may lose their viability if stored in syringes for any period of time. Do not pre - draw doses a single -dose vial contains one dose and should only be used for one patient only the number of doses indicated in the manufacturers package insert should be withdrawn from a multidose vial. After the maximum number of doses has been withdrawn the vial should be discarded even if there is residual or the expiration has not been reached a separate, sterile needle and syringe should be used for each injection vaccines that are not used within the acceptable reconstituted time frames are considered non-viable and must be discarded and accounted for in ASIIS. Please reconcile w asted VFC vaccine doses in ASIIS and provide the AIPO with the supporting documentation 73 Module 9 - Arizona Immunization Program Office Provider Visits Table of Contents Module 9 - Arizona Immunization Program Office Provider Visits Overview New Provider Visits New Staff \\Education Visit VFC Compliance Visits Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits Immunization Quality Improvement for Provider (IQIP) Visits IQIP Program Overview IQIP Strategies Brief Overview of IQIP Process Provider Survey 74 Overview VFC providers are required to participate in AIPO provider visits. AIPO provider visits must be conducted by the AIPO staff to ensure the ongoing integrity of the VFC program. Multiple types of VFC site visits are designed to evaluate different aspects of provider compliance with and understanding of the VFC requirements. New Provider Visits AIPO staff will conduct provider staff training/educati on on VFC program requirements for all newly enrolled. Providers must email valid data logger calibration certificates for all units storing VFC vaccines and the back -up data logger and a data logger report showing five (5) full consecutive days of current in- range temperatures prior to receiving a new provider visit. AIPO staff will ensure that all providers have the required cold storage units in place before ordering can occur. These visits are scheduled at a time that is mutua lly agreed upon and will take approximately 1 -2 hours or longer. Providers must place an order within three (3) months of the new provider staff training to be in compliance with the VFC program and to be able to complete the required VFC Compliance Visit. VFC Compliance Visits Once at a minimum every 24 months and perhaps more frequently AIPO program staff will conduct a VFC compliance visit at VFC enrolled provider offices. The purpose of the VFC compliance visit is to evaluate for proper screening of VFC eligibility, vaccine administration documentation, vaccine ordering protocols, and vaccine management which includes storage and handling requirements. The VFC compliance visit is designed to protect against fraud and abuse and observe office practices that: ensure compliance with VFC program requirements (reporting/documentation/vaccine storage and handling) minimize vaccine loss and wastage ensure that vaccines are purchased with VFC funds are administered only to VFC eligible children ensure VFC vaccine stewardship and accountability AIPO staff members and provider staff are also required to follow -up on corrective action plans or improvements received during the VFC compliance site visit. Note : AIPO staff will make every atte mpt to schedule and conduct these visits at a time that will not interrupt office practice. A VFC compliance visit will be scheduled in advance. Each visit takes approximately two (2) to three (3) hours or longer based on information obtained prior to and during the compliance visit and training needs at the provider site. During the VFC compliance visit the Immunization Program Specialist (IPS) may identify areas that need attention/correction. The findings are documented and shared with the provider staff during the visit . Provider staff members are given verbal and written feedback on items identified for correction and are educated on the importance of the VFC Program requirements. 75 The following are examples of issues that can be resolved during the compliance visit: ou tdated Vaccine Information Statements (VIS), lack of \"do not disconnect\" signage next to storage unit outlets, or vaccines that have been placed in the back of the unit that will soon expire. While these can be corrected during the visit, staff will still make note of the issues. If non- compliance issues identified during a VFC site visit cannot be resolved during the visit the IPS will try to determine the root cause behind the non- compliant issue. The IPS will discuss the purpose of the requirement with the provider staff present and educate them on how to become compliant. The IPS will provide a timeframe for corrective actions during the site visit. Additional follow up will occur in the form of a letter, phone call, and/or follow up visits to ensure that corrections were made. Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits These are visits that will occur at any time with no notice. They may last 1 -2 hours or longer and will inclu de a short questionnaire. The A IPO staff will look at the cold storage unit(s) to check for proper storag e techniques and any expired vaccines. Additionally, staff will review any areas previously found to be out of compliance. New Staff/ Education Visits AIPO staff members are available to conduct trainings for new provider office staff. AIPO staff will provide training/education on the VFC program requirements. AIPO staff can also conduct this training for those who need a refresher course. Immunizatio n Quality Improvement for Provider (IQIP) Visits IQIP Program Overview IQIP is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national, Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider- level immunization quality improvement (QI) program. IQIP promotes and supports implementation of provider -level strategies designed to help increase on -time vaccination of children and adolescents. These strategies are designed to increase vaccine uptake among child and adolescent patients in adherence to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) recommended routine immunization schedule . IQIP Strategies Schedule the next immunization visit before the patient leaves the provider office Leverage ASIIS functionality to improve immunization practice s Give a strong vaccine recommendation (include emphasis on HPV vaccine) IQIP serves to assist and support health care providers by identifying opportunities to improve vaccine uptake, determini ng options for improving immunization delivery practices, and ensuring providers are: 76 aware of and knowledgeable about their vaccination coverage and missed opportunities to vaccinate motivated to try new immunization service delivery strategies and incorp orate changes into their current practices capable of sustaining changes and improvements to their vaccination delivery services able to use available data from the AS IIS and/or EHR to improve services and coverage More detailed information about the IQIP process can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iqip/at- a-glance.html Brief Overview of the IQIP Process IQIP is a 12 -month process where Immunization Program Specialists and VFC providers collaborate to identify QI strategies to increase vaccine uptake by improving and enhancing immunization workflow. 1) Site Visit Discuss provider workflow Review initial coverage Select QI strategies Plan for implementation of QI strategies 2) 2-month and 6- month check -ins Review progress toward strategy implementation Update Strategy Implementation Plan 3) 12-month follow -up Review progress toward strategy implementation Review year -over -year coverage change The IQIP s ite visit usually takes approximately two hour s to complete depending on the discussion regarding provider processes and strategies . If you have questions about the IQIP process, would like access to IQIP -ASIIS training materials, or would like to reque st an IQIP visit, please contact the AIPO at 602 -364-3642 and ask to speak to an Immunization Pro gram Specialist . Provider Survey The AIPO management team conducts a survey related to the provider's experience with their VFC compliance visit reviewer. Providers will receive this survey via email. In order to better serve our providers we appreciate your feedback. 77 Module 10 - Fraud and Abuse/Discipline Process Table of Contents Module 10 - Fraud and Abuse/Discipline Process Overview Addressing Provider Non -Compliance with VFC Requirements Appeals Process 78 Overview The AIPO is responsible for ensuring that providers meet all VFC program requirements. Failure to comply with Arizona VFC program requirements as described in this operations gu ide will result in progressive disciplinary actions. Follow -up visits will occur throughout the process. The terms \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" related to VFC are consistent with the definitions in Medicaid regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 445.2). Well -organized and correctly administered VFC accountability programs are the cornerstones for preventing potential fraud and abuse incidents. Accountability measures should be emphasized to all provider staff. If the AIPO staff finds evidence of intentional deception, misrepresentation, or negligence on the part of the VFC provider, further investigation and potential enforcement of relevant laws, including fraud and abuse, consumer protection and professional licensur e will occur. If VFC provider offices have not met Arizona VFC requirements or followed Arizona VFC procedures as outlined in this operations guide, but the AIPO finds no intentional deception, misrepresentation or negligence on the part of the VFC provider, the staff a t the provider office may be required to participate in training and/or take other actions to rectify the situation. Fraud An intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable federal or state laws.

Lack of adherence could lead to fraud and abuse charges for providers. Failure to comply with VFC requirements is defined as: any VFC provider who does not maintain the federal and/or state requirements associated with implementation of the Provider Agreement. The details of the federal and state requ irements are discussed throughout this operations guide If a provider's office has been identified by their IPS and/or AIPO staff as being non -compliant in any area of the VFC program and these VFC requirements have not been met by a provider after multiple follow -ups, the provider will be placed on probation. The provider will be asked to submit a corrective action plan to their assigned IPS that address es how the non -compliant issue(s) have been resolved; the IPS will make any needed edits and approve the corrective action plan. If a provider is placed on probation a site visit is required before the probation ends. Probation will end when the IPS has observed sustained improvement by the provider. If the items in the needed areas of compliance are not corrected while on probation the provider will be inactivated from the VFC progr am due to non -compliance with VFC program requirements. The AIPO will report all instances of probation and suspected fraud and abuse to AHCCCS. Appeal s Process If a provider feels that removal from the AIPO VFC Program has occurred in error, the provider may request a meeting with the Immunization Program Office Chief to address the issue. The request must be submitted in writing to the Immunization Office within ten (10) business days of receipt of the removal notice. All appeals should be addres sed to: ADHS, Immunization Program Office Office Chief 150 N 18th Avenue, Suite 120 Phoenix, AZ 85007 The Immunization Program Office Chief will schedule a meeting within five (5) business days after receiving the request. A written final decision from t he Immunization Office Chief will be issued within five (5) business days of the meeting. 80 Definitions and Acronyms Used in this Guide ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices AHCCCS Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System AIPO Arizona Immunization Program Office ASIIS Arizona State Immunization Information System Back -Up Coordinator Fulfills all the roles of the primary coordinator as a secondary CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cold Chain A temperature -controlled supply chain.
