As previously mentioned, faculty, staff, and postdoctoral associates employed by the University on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 for the 2021-22 academic year, subject to certain exceptions, including medical and religious exemptions. Employees must receive their final vaccine dose by Aug. 1 to be fully vaccinated by the start of the fall term. Our plans, which prioritize the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and our South Florida community, continue to be shaped by public health guidance. Please review the following instructions for submitting your COVID-19 vaccination confirmation or exemption request before the deadline. How to upload your COVID-19 vaccine documentation You can submit your COVID-19 vaccination confirmation into Workday by following one of the methods below: 1. If you previously uploaded your vaccination confirmation to your MyUHealthChart account and would like validation to be automatically transferred to Workday, you must authorize release of this information. No medical information will be provided to Workday in this transfer. Click here for instructions. And for further assistance, please review this tip sheet. One of these methods should be completed within one week of the Aug. 1 deadline of receiving your final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, unless you have received an approved exemption. How to request a vaccine exemption Faculty, staff, and postdoctoral associates seeking a COVID-19 vaccination exemption must apply through Workday by Aug. 1, 2021. If you wish to request an exemption, please review information regarding the required supporting documentation prior to submitting your request. Click here for more information. Individuals who have been approved for a COVID-19 vaccine exemption will be required to take a COVID-19 test twice a week and continue to wear masks in all indoor spaces. Managers and faculty leaders will be provided additional information on this process in the coming weeks. Additional resources We know that many of you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and how it applies to your individual situation. We compiled answers to frequently asked questions. As academic and administrative units begin to safely return additional faculty and staff to campus in the fall, we do so with the knowledge that most of our colleagues have been vaccinated, and with testing safeguards in place for approved exemptions. We are committed to updating and revising our policies and guidelines as new information becomes available and we will communicate any changes. Thank you for your extraordinary work in providing our students with an unparalleled learning experience and for your compliance with these important health protocols.
