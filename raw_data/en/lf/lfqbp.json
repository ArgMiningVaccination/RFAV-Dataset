Today, I sit down with Dr. Lindsey Elmore - certified pharmacist, functional medicine clinician, and renowned wellness expert. Our bodies are beautifully designed, but living in a modern world can make us prone to not feeling well. Tune in to learn from one of the leading experts on metabolic and hormone health. We doctors geek out on the best, most cutting-edge ways to feel and look your best. Dr. Lindsey Elmore is a board-certified pharmacist, functional medicine clinician, speaker, author, entrepreneur, and world-renowned wellness expert. She helps patients uncover true health through diet, exercise, meditation, sleep, and transformative self-assessment. Dr. Elmore has a degree in chemistry from the University of Alabama, Birmingham and a doctorate in pharmacy from the University of California San Francisco. She completed her post-doctoral residency in general medicine at Princeton Baptist Medical Center and in ambulatory care at New Hanover Regional Medical Center. After realizing just how broken the allopathic medical system is, she decided to deviate from standard practice and pursue integrative options for her patients. In addition to an extensive blog and social media presence, she authored Essentials: 75 Answers to Common Questions about Essential Oils and Supplements to help people safely use essential oils safely and effectively, and the vegan, gluten free cookbook and workbook Clean Slate Cleanse to get people started on an elimination diet to transform their health. Her most recent cookbook is Bountiful: A Phytonutrient Cookbook. As a certified vinyasa, yin, and Aroma Yoga\u00ae instructor, Dr. Elmore teaches students how to reduce stress, control the breath, and practice self-love and self-compassion. Her practice integrates crystals and essential oils alongside movement and emotional release techniques. When not teaching, Dr. Elmore helps other entrepreneurs establish their own health and wellness brands through her business coaching, Brand Strategies Lab.
