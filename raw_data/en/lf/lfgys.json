The Chief Justice said: The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the Resolutions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. The Court recognizes the Acting Solicitor General of the United States. Acting Solicitor General Gershengorn addressed the Court as follows: Mr. Chief Justice , and may it please the Court: At a meeting of the Bar of this Court, Resolutions memori- alizing our deep respect and affection for Justice Scalia were adopted unanimously. RESOLUTIONS Today the bar of this Court convenes to pay respect to a towering fgure in American law\u2014a Justice of conviction, character, and courage; a treasured colleague; an irreplace- *Justice Scalia died in Shafter, Texas, on February 13, 2016 (577 U. S., p. v). v vi JUSTICE SCALIA able mentor; and a man devoted to his country, its Constitu- tion, and this Court. In his nearly 30-year tenure on this Court, Antonin Scalia displayed a forceful intellect, a re-markable wit, and an inimitable writing style. His ideas helped to shape the way we think about law. And for those blessed to know him, his compassion, humanity, and com-mitment to his family, friends, and faith will remain an inspiration. On March 11, 1936, fve months after this Court heard its frst case in this building, Antonin Scalia was born in Tren-ton, New Jersey. His mother, Catherine Panaro, was the oldest of seven and born to parents who immigrated to the United States from Italy in 1904. His father, Salvatore Eu- gene Scalia, came to this country from Sicily in 1920 at age 17. Both became teachers\u2014S. Eugene a professor of Ro- mance Languages at Brooklyn College and Catherine an ele-mentary school teacher. Antonin\u2014Nino to family and friends\u2014was his parents' only child and the only child of his generation on either side of the large family. He grew up in Trenton and later in the diverse Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens in New York City, where his parents made \"an education project\" out of him. Antonin's curiosity and love of argument surfaced early. One aunt recalled that, \"[w]hen [Antonin] wanted to do some-thing\" an adult had put off-limits, \"you had to give him a very, very good argument about why he could not do it.\" 1 Through their example and, one suspects, occasional direc-tion, Scalia's parents fostered his religious faith and charac-ter. He also inherited from them a lifelong love of music\u2014 especially opera\u2014and the ability to play the piano, which he learned from his father. After an uncharacteristically subpar showing on an en- trance examination for his preferred high school\u2014missing a grammar question of all things\u2014Scalia attended Xavier High School in Manhattan. \"One door closes, another door 1 Joan Biskupic, American Original: The Life and Constitution of Su- preme Court Justice Antonin Scalia 18, 20 (2009). JUSTICE SCALIA vii opens,\" as he would say. Faith was foremost at the Jesuit school at that point and military discipline a close second. Scalia graduated frst in his class, collecting an array of awards along the way. He was a stand-out debater\u2014even appearing on local television\u2014and played the French horn for the marching band and starred in several school plays, including the title role in Macbeth. From a teacher at Xa- vier, Scalia learned what he often referred to as the \"Shake-speare Principle\": \"When you read Shakespeare, Shake-speare's not on trial. You are.\" Scalia continued the pursuit of a Jesuit education by attending Georgetown University, where he studied history and government and once again graduated frst in his class. He and a teammate rose to national prominence in competi-tive debate, and he continued to perform on stage. George-town also made a mark on the Justice's faith. The \"last les-son\" he learned in college, imparted by a professor during his oral examinations, was \"not to separate your religious life from your intellectual life.\" Scalia took that lesson to heart. In his commencement speech, he challenged his classmates to be courageous and to \"carry and advance into all sections of our society this distinctively human life, of reason learned and faith believed.\" \"If we will not lead,\" Scalia asked, \"who will?\" 2 After Georgetown, Scalia attended Harvard Law School, where he relished debating cases with professors in the classroom and with classmates through his work as an editor of the Law Review. But however rich the academic envi-ronment, the signal event of his Harvard years occurred out-side the classroom, when he met Maureen McCarthy, an un-dergraduate student from Radcliffe College, on a blind date. The two had much in common\u2014sharp intellects and quick wits. Perhaps most importantly, Maureen recalled, they had shared convictions on \"all the important things,\" includ- 2 Id., at 25; Jacob Gershman, `If We Really Love the Truth'\u2014Excerpts from Scalia's 1957 Graduation Speech, Wall St. J.

In Antonin's telling, Maureen was drawn by the Sheldon Fellowship he had won at Harvard to travel around Europe after graduation. Whatever the prox-imate cause, the marriage took place in September 1960 and was a blessing and a source of strength to both. Their 55-year union produced nine children and dozens of grandchil-dren. Antonin joked that the \"secret\" to their marriage's longevity was that \"Maureen made it very clear early on that if we split up, [he] would get the children.\" 3 For her part, Maureen explained that she \"would have been bored\" with someone \"wishy washy.\" 4 Upon returning from their European travels, the Scalias moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Antonin joined Jones, Day, Cockley & Reavis. During his six years there, his work cov-ered a range of felds, from antitrust and real estate to labor law, contracts, and tax. Although Scalia enjoyed the prac-tice of law and was well regarded at the frm, he had long aimed to follow his parents' path by becoming a teacher. In 1967, Scalia accepted a post at the University of Vir- ginia School of Law, where he taught contracts and compara-tive law. The focus of his scholarship, if not always his teaching, would become administrative law. 5 In the class- room he was energetic and engaging, posing inventive and often entertaining hypotheticals. He enjoyed encouraging students to consider legal problems from the standpoint of a layperson, asking classes, \"What would Joe Sixpack say 3CNN Transcripts, Piers Morgan Tonight: Interview with Antonin Scalia, CNN.com (transcript of July 18, 2012 cable-television broadcast), http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1207/18/pmt.01.html. 4 Lesley Stahl, 60 Minutes: Interview with Antonin Scalia, Part 2, at 5:38-5:48, CBS News (recording of April 27, 2008 interview), http://www. cbsnews.com/videos/justice-scalia-on-60-minutes-part-2. 5 See, e. g., Antonin Scalia, Sovereign Immunity and Nonstatutory Re- view of Federal Administrative Action: Some Conclusions from the Public-Lands Cases, 68 Mich.

JUSTICE SCALIA ix about this?\" He often concluded the semester by quoting a line from Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons, which to Scalia was a \"beautiful expression of the importance of the law.\" In the passage, Sir Thomas More boldly declares: \"Whoever hunts for me, Roper, God or Devil, will fnd me hiding in the thickets of the law! And I'll hide my daughter with me! Not hoist her up to the mainmast of your seagoing principles! They put about too nimbly!\" 6 Several years into teaching, Scalia was appointed to the frst of several Executive Branch positions. In 1971, he be-came the general counsel of the newly created Offce of Tele-communications Policy, where he addressed legal and policy issues arising in the still-nascent cable industry. The follow- ing year, Scalia was asked to chair the Administrative Con-ference of the United States, a body composed of offcials from various agencies, academics, and other experts in the feld to study problems of administrative law and procedure and to recommend solutions to Congress or agencies. Scalia enjoyed the Conference's work, and was gratifed when the Conference was revived in 2010 after a multi-year hiatus. In 1974, Scalia became the Assistant Attorney General for the Offce of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice. Then-Deputy Attorney General Laurence Silberman ex - plained that, in choosing a new head of OLC in the aftermath of Watergate, the Ford Administration \"wanted a brilliant lawyer with steel nerves.\" 7 Scalia ft the bill. Confrmed just weeks after President Ford took offce, Scalia confronted a litany of diffcult constitutional and other issues, starting with the legal ownership of President Nixon's papers. The work entailed long hours. As Maureen recounted, Scalia \"slept in the White House, and I don't mean the Lincoln bed-room.\" 8 But even through those trying and exhilarating professional days, family and faith remained priorities. 6 Biskupic, supra, n. 1, at 66-67, 76. 7 Justice Scalia Memorial Service, at 15:45-15:49, C-Span (Mar. 1, 2016), https://www.c-span.org/video/?405460-1/memorial-service-supreme-court- justice-antonin-scaila&start=939. 8 Biskupic, supra, n. 1, at 53. x JUSTICE SCALIA In 1977, Scalia returned to academia, joining the Univer- sity of Chicago faculty, where he remained, aside from a visit to Stanford, until 1982. In Chicago, Scalia continued to focus on administrative law and became head of the Ameri-can Bar Association's Section of Administrative Law in 1981. He was particularly pleased with the amicus brief he wrote for the ABA in INS v. Chadha, 9 the landmark separation-of-powers case striking down a one-house legisla-tive veto. When President Reagan took offce in 1981, he looked for a new Solicitor General, and before long Scalia and Rex Lee emerged as fnalists. Scalia was crestfallen when he did not receive the appointment. The President had other ideas, however, nominating him to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit in 1982. In his four years on that court, Scalia encountered a range of constitutional and statu-tory questions. While there, he wrote what he considered one of the best openings in all of his opinions: \"This case, involving legal requirements for the content and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters, affords a rare opportu-nity to explore simultaneously both parts of Bismarck's aph-orism that `No man should see how laws or sausages are made.' \" 10 When Chief Justice Burger announced his retirement in 1986, President Reagan nominated Justice Rehnquist to fll Burger's seat and tapped Scalia to fll Rehnquist's seat. At his confrmation hearing, Scalia was asked to explain the \"success of the Constitution.\" While the Bill of Rights is \"very important,\" he responded, its provisions standing alone \"do not do anything.\" Other countries, even those with authoritarian regimes, have \"at least as good guar-antees of personal freedom.\" Instead, Scalia explained, \"[w]hat makes it work, what assures that those words are not just hollow promises, is the structure of government that the original Constitution established, the checks and bal- 9 462 U. S. 919 (1983). 10 Community Nutrition Inst. v. Block, 749 F. 2d 50, 51 (D. C. Cir. 1984). JUSTICE SCALIA xi ances among the three branches.\" 11 When Senator Metzen- baum in jest criticized Scalia's \"bad judgment in whipping\" the Senator on the tennis court, Scalia confessed that \"[i]t was a case of [his] integrity overcoming [his] judgment.\" 12 Scalia was confrmed 98-0 on September 17, 1986, the 199th anniversary of the Constitution's signing in Philadelphia. Over the next three decades, Justice Scalia left his mark on the law in numerous ways, too many to recount in full here. His steadfast commitment to the idea that external legal principles rather than internal policy preferences should govern judicial decisionmaking made him deeply re-spectful of the Constitution's allocation of powers and vigi-lant in respecting legal texts. That commitment showed up frst, and most often, in his views on statutory interpreta-tion. Justice Scalia pressed the elementary proposition that, when interpreting a statutory text, judges must try to discern and enforce the meaning of words enacted by Con-gress to express its policies. In his view, courts should never rewrite a discernible statutory text to conform to a law's unenacted legislative purposes. This position chal-lenged the practice of frst divining and then enforcing the \"spirit\" rather than the \"letter\" of a law, an approach embod-ied by the Holy Trinity decision. 13 With characteristic en- ergy, Justice Scalia contested that practice. The legislative process is opaque, path-dependent, and prone to \"backroom deals\" that do not make their way into the public eye. An awkwardly worded statute that falls short of its apparent policy aspirations thus might not be the product of legislative misstatement, but might instead be \"the result of compro-mise among various interest groups, resulting in a decision to go so far and no farther.\" 14 Hence, when judges rewrote 11 Nomination of Judge Antonin Scalia, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: Hearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 99th Cong. 32 (1986) (statement of Antonin Scalia). 12 Id., at 13. 13 Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, 459 (1892). 14 Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 68-69 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). xii JUSTICE SCALIA a clear statute to conform its terms to what they perceived to be the law's underlying purposes, they risked upsetting whatever \"legislative compromise [may have] enabled the law to be enacted\" in the frst place. 15 Holy Trinity was never the same after Justice Scalia joined the Court. During his career, the Court moved a good way (though not as far as he would have liked) toward his rigorous em-phasis on the enacted text. 16 The Court's citation of diction- aries has risen to levels previously unseen in the U. S. Re-ports. 17 After a post-New Deal judicial trend away from the use of semantic canons, they now play a visible, sometimes pivotal, role in the Court's determinations of statutory mean-ing. 18 And the Court became skeptical of implied statutory rights of action.19 This new textualism20 had an undeniable impact on the way the Court does business. Perhaps most pronounced has been the Court's embrace of the idea, championed by Justice Scalia, that extrinsic indicia of statutory intention, such as legislative reports or foor statements, may not override a clear statutory text. In an opinion for the Court early in his tenure, Justice Scalia wrote that \"[t]he best evidence of [a statute's] purpose is the statu-tory text adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the President.\" 21 He added that where such a text is \"unambiguous,\" the Court \"do[es] not permit it to be ex-panded or contracted by the statements of individual legisla- 15 Artuz v.

JUSTICE SCALIA xiii tors or committees during the course of the enactment process.\" 22 Before 1986, the Court frequently used legislative history in an effort to discern legislative intent. Often, the Court would treat the views of a statute's sponsor or a drafting committee as if they represented the intentions of Congress as a whole. 23 So strong was the acceptance of legislative history that a Burger Court opinion, in an unguarded mo-ment, declared that because \"[t]he ambiguous[,] . . . we must look primarily to the statutes themselves to fnd the legislative intent.\" 24 Justice Scalia criticized the use of legislative history as a tool of construction every chance he got, all but affxing a badge of shame on it. In vivid prose informed by practical experience in government, he questioned whether rank-and-fle legislators necessarily read, much less agreed with, foor statements or even the committee reports that had be-come a staple of interpretive practice. When the Court in-terpreted the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act by parsing lower court cases that the committee reports had cited, Justice Scalia wrote: \"As anyone familiar with modern-day drafting of congressional committee reports is well aware, the references to the cases were inserted, at best by a committee staff member on his or her own initiative, and at worst by a committee staff member at the suggestion of a lawyer-lobbyist; and the purpose of those references was not primarily to inform the Members of Congress what the bill meant . . . , but rather to infuence judicial construction.\" 25 22 Id., at 98-99. 23 See, e. g., North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512, 526-527 (1982); Steadman v. SEC , 450 U. S. 91, 101 (1981); J. W. Bateson Co. v. United States ex rel. Bd. of Trustees of Nat. Automatic Sprinkler Industry Pen- sion Fund, 434 U.

S. 87, 98-99 (1989) (Scalia, J., concur- ring in part and concurring in judgment). xiv JUSTICE SCALIA Ultimately, Justice Scalia's principal concern was less the accuracy of legislative reports than their legitimacy. The Constitution conditions Congress's power to legislate on a bill's passage by two Houses and either the assent of the President or the override of a presidential veto by two-thirds of each house. 26 According to Justice Scalia, even if most Members of Congress would want and expect the courts to treat legislative history as an authoritative indication of a statute's intended meaning, \"the very frst provision of the Constitution\" precludes that arrangement by vesting \" `[a]ll legislative Powers' \" in Congress itself. 27 If legislative com- mittees or bill sponsors could make pronouncements that specifed the entire body's intended policies, then Members of Congress could make an end-run around the bicameral-ism and presentment requirements themselves. In Justice Scalia's words: \"We are governed by laws, not tions of legislators. . . . `The law as it passed is the will of the majority of both houses, and the only mode in which that will is spoken is in the act itself.' \" 28 It is fair to say that the connection between statutory text and judicial interpretations of it has tightened substantially since Justice Scalia joined the Court. The Court has re-stored the primacy of statutory text and routinely declines to \"resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear,\" as Justice Ginsburg wrote for the Court. 29 Today, the Court instead \"presume[s] that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\" 30 That is no small legacy. 26 U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 7. 27 Bank One Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank & Trust Co., 516 U. S. 264, 280 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quot- ing U. S.

JUSTICE SCALIA xv Just as Justice Scalia believed that courts should do their best to honor a statute's text, he thought the same should be true for the Constitution. And if it was essential to respect the language of the Constitution, it followed that its meaning should be fxed unless and until the People followed the proc-ess for ratifying amendments to the charter. As he saw it, the words of the Constitution, like all legal texts and docu-ments, bear the same meaning today as they did when adopted, neither diminished nor augmented\u2014though of course capable of application to new technologies and other features of modern society. 31 He grounded this principle of interpretation in part in re- spect for democracy. To recognize constitutional rights that he could not locate in the Constitution, he believed, \"prohib-it[s] . . . acts of self-governance that never, ever, voted to outlaw.\" 32 \"This practice of constitutional re- vision by an unelected committee of nine,\" he argued, \"robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.\" 33 He thus voted against recognition of new rights that he believed lacked a foundation in the Constitution's original meaning\u2014in areas ranging from abortion 34 and same-sex marriage35 to punitive- damage caps36 and retroactive taxation.37 Any other approach, he worried, placed at risk the guaran- tees of liberty actually enshrined in the Constitution. Just as he resisted imposing new restrictions on democratic self- 31 Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001). 32 Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.

It is doubtful that any Justice has done more for the cause of legal history or placed more light on once-obscure legal texts. 38 See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989). 39 United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515, 568 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). 40 Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.

JUSTICE SCALIA xvii His opinions are replete with references to Coke's Institutes and Blackstone's Commentaries, to Johnson's Dictionary and Publius' Federalist, and to statutes enacted by early Con-gresses and constitutions adopted by the original States. His lead opinion in Harmelin v. Michigan 48 canvassed every- thing from Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys' remarks during the Bloody Assizes to Patrick Henry's remarks during the Vir-ginia ratifcation convention before concluding that dispro-portionality alone does not render a punishment cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. And in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 49 he concluded in dissent that, in the absence of a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President lacked power to detain American citizens without charge as enemy combatants\u2014though only after a reconnais-sance of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, English treason prosecutions, and previous English and American statutes suspending the privilege. He summed up his approach to text and tradition this way: \"[A] venerable and accepted tradition is not to be laid on the examining table and scrutinized for its conform-ity to some abstract principle . . . devised by this Court. To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court's principles are to be formed. They are, in these uncertain areas, the very points of reference by which the legitimacy or illegitimacy of other practices are to be fgured out. When it appears that the latest `rule,' or `three-part test,' or `balancing test' devised by the Court has placed us on a collision course with such a landmark practice, it is the former that must be recalculated by us, and not the latter that must be abandoned by our citizens.\" 50 That meant that in Establishment Clause cases, to use one example, he voted to uphold prayer at public-school gradua- 48 501 U.

By the end of Justice Scalia's tenure, a focus on the origi- nal public meaning of the Constitution's text had become, if not orthodoxy, a thoroughly respectable and commonplace approach to constitutional interpretation. Two decisions\u2014 District of Columbia v. Heller 54 and Crawford v. Washing- ton55\u2014illustrate the point. In Heller , the Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court showcases his meticulous approach to uncovering how the Constitution was understood by \"ordinary citizens in the founding generation\" 56\u2014starting with an analysis of the words of the Second Amendment, continuing with an ex-amination of analogous provisions in early state constitu-tions, and turning to an analysis of how the Second Amend-ment was interpreted through the 18th and 19th centuries. This focus on text and history was hardly limited to the Jus-tice's opinion for the Court. Justice Stevens' dissent empha-sized the debates surrounding the ratifcation of the Consti-tution and the drafting history of the Second Amendment, while Justice Breyer's dissent stressed the prevalence of gun laws in colonial towns. Crawford is of a piece. His 7-2 decision for the Court interpreted the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause and turned on the public understanding of the guarantee at the time of ratifcation rather than on the Framers' broader interest in promoting the reliability of evidence in a criminal 51 Lee v.

In a series of cases exemplifed by Ohio v. Roberts,57 the Court had employed a balancing test designed to iden- tify reliable evidence. Crawford memorably dispatched the Roberts balancing test and the elevation of the Framers' broader interest in reliable evidence over the textual guar-antee of confrontation. \"By replacing categorical constitu-tional guarantees with open-ended balancing tests,\" Justice Scalia reasoned, \"we do violence to [the Framers'] design.\" 58 And while Justice Scalia happily conceded that \"the Clause's ultimate goal is reliable evidence,\" he was quick to remind that the Framers embraced a particular means to that end. The Clause \"commands not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\" 59 \"Dispensing with con- frontation because the evidence is obviously reliable,\" he trenchantly concluded, \"is akin to dispensing with jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty. That is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\" 60 He was proud of both decisions. Justice Scalia may be best known for his views about the proper methodology for statutory and constitutional inter-pretation. But his frst love was an area of substantive law\u2014constitutional structure\u2014which shaped his answers to the underlying questions that appear in every case: Who decides? And how? Even his methods of statutory and constitutional interpretation were informed by these consid-erations. He eschewed the use of legislative history, for ex-ample, because it empowered the Judiciary at the expense of Congress and because committee reports did not comply with the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment. And he criticized judicial amendments of a living Constitution because they aggrandized the power of judges and disregarded the Constitution's explicit means of 57 448 U. S. 56 (1980). 58 Crawford, 541 U. S., at 67-68. 59 Id., at 61. 60 Id., at 62. xx JUSTICE SCALIA amendment, all at the expense of the People and their representatives. Throughout his tenure, Justice Scalia sought to honor the Constitution's structure\u2014its distinct horizontal and vertical lines of power\u2014realizing that they were as essential to the preservation of individual liberty as the provisions of the Bill of Rights. He appreciated that men and women were not \"angels,\" 61 and that electing (or appointing) them to govern- ment posts did not make it otherwise. By assigning three distinct kinds of government power (legislative, executive, and judicial) to three distinct branches of government, he believed, the Constitution prevented the concentration of government power in the same hands\u2014considered by the Founders to be the epitome of tyranny. 62 In his iconic dissent in Morrison v. Olson,63 written early in his tenure, Justice Scalia put these principles to work. He objected that Congress's attempt to restrict the Presi-dent's ability to remove an independent counsel\u2014an offcer who exercised executive power\u2014violated Article II, which vests the executive power in the President and obligates him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. As he saw it, the Constitution vested all\u2014not some\u2014of the executive power in the President. For Justice Scalia, this made Mor- rison an easy case: \"Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effect important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately evi-dent, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive anal-ysis. But this wolf comes as a wolf.\" 64 Justice Scalia was no less vigilant in preventing legislative incursions on the judicial power, exemplifed by his opinion for the Court in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 65 rejecting 61 The Federalist No. 51 (James Madison). 62 See The Federalist No. 47 (James Madison). 63 487 U. S. 654 (1988). 64 Id., at 699 (Scalia, J., dissenting). 65 514 U. S. 211 (1995). JUSTICE SCALIA xxi an attempt by Congress to reopen fnal judgments of Article III courts. As Scalia explained, the Article III judicial power gave federal courts the power to decide cases with fnality, and the statute in question trespassed on that as-signment. \"The Framers of the Constitution,\" he reasoned, built separation of powers into the structure because they had \"lived among the ruins of a system of intermingled legis-lative and judicial powers,\" and they established \"high walls and clear distinctions because low walls and vague distinc-tions will not be judicially defensible in the heat of inter-branch confict.\" 66 At the same time Justice Scalia thought it essential that the Court stand sentinel over efforts by one branch to as-sume power allocated to another branch, he was insistent that the Judiciary not use its fnal say over the meaning of federal law to aggrandize power the Constitution never gave it. Throughout his career, he rejected attempts to expand the judicial power beyond the limits embedded in Article III. Witness Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 67 where Justice Scalia wrote that \"the Constitution's central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common under-standing of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.\" The requirement of standing, he explained, helped to identify those disputes properly\u2014and improperly\u2014resolved through the judicial process. Absent a claim that alleged a particularized, imminent injury of the kind redressable by courts, Justice Scalia concluded that the federal courts had no warrant to referee the dispute. Justice Scalia likewise regarded the Constitution's vertical separation of powers\u2014federalism\u2014as a core feature of the Constitution's structure that needed to be preserved. He honored the States' \"residuary and inviolable sovereignty\" 68 under the Constitution by joining the Court's decisions rec- 66 Id., at 219, 239. 67 504 U. S. 555, 559-560 (1992). 68 Printz v.

S. 898, 918-919 (quoting The Federalist No. 39 (James Madison)). xxii JUSTICE SCALIA ognizing limits on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce69 and upholding the States' sovereign immunity from suit.70 Perhaps his most notable federalism opinion came in Printz v. United States,71 in which the Court held that the Constitution prohibited Congress from comman-deering state executive offcials to enforce federal law. Per-mitting Congress to impress state executive offcers into federal service, he reasoned, would threaten the States' sep-arate sphere of constitutional authority by \"immeasurably\" augmenting the power of the federal government at the expense of the States and eventually individual liberty. 72 \"Just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serve to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch,\" he ex-plained, \"a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.\" 73 In view of Justice Scalia's appreciation of separation-of- powers principles and his scholarship as a professor, it should come as no surprise that the Court's administrative-law docket engaged him. His opinions touched many areas of administrative law, including the scope and limitations of Chevron deference. 74 He was a tireless defender of the proposition that judicial deference to agency interpreta-tions should not depend on a case-by-case determination of whether Congress would want the Court to defer based on multiple unranked and unweighted factors. 75 At the same time, he made clear that Chevron does not permit courts 69 See United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995). 70 See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). 71 521 U. S. 898 (1997). 72 Printz, 521 U.

JUSTICE SCALIA xxiii refexively to credit whatever reading of a statute an agency tenders and thus does not permit courts to abdicate their Marbury function to interpret the law. 76 His decisions un- derscore that, if an agency's interpretation is inconsistent with Congress's clear direction, courts need not\u2014indeed can-not\u2014disregard Congress's commands. 77 As he acknowl- edged early in his tenure, his commitment to giving primacy to the statutory text necessarily meant that Chevron defer- ence will matter less often, and will affect fewer case out-comes, than if he \"permit[ted] the apparent meaning of the statute to be impeached by legislative history\" or other sources outside the text Congress enacted. 78 Chevron, he explained, does not compel courts to defer merely because a statute contains some ambiguity; the mere \"presence of some uncertainty does not expand Chevron deference to cover vir- tually any interpretation\" the agency advances. 79 \"It does not matter,\" Justice Scalia memorably observed, \"whether the word `yellow' is ambiguous when the agency has inter-preted it to mean `purple.' \" 80 One other area of substantive law deserves mention. When people think of transformative criminal law opinions, Mapp v. Ohio , 81 Miranda v. Arizona,82 and decisions restrict- ing capital punishment come to mind. But to Justice Scalia, many of those Warren Court landmarks transformed the pre-existing law precisely because they had no basis in the Consti- 76 Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). 77 See, e. g., Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 747-760 (2015); Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 307-334 (2014); Cuomo v.

He thus led the charge to limit the reach of Mapp83 and critiqued Miranda84 and many death-penalty decisions.85 That is not to say he resisted the rights of criminal defend- ants. He just preferred to enforce a different set of rights\u2014 those protections that, in his view, were properly grounded in the Constitution's text and history. He became an uncompro-mising defender of those rights. Take the breathtaking im-pact of his commitment to the Sixth Amendment's trial by jury. When Justice Scalia dissented in Almendarez-Torres v. United States 86 to point out that laws that create new statu- tory maximum sentences on the basis of judicial factual fnd-ings violate the jury guarantee, he launched a wholesale shift in the Court's view of sentencing laws. A majority of the Court ultimately came around to his viewpoint through three system-changing decisions, one of which (Blakely) he wrote, all of which he joined. 87 Sentencing laws in the state and fed- eral courts have shifted markedly ever since. Justice Scalia led a similar transformation of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause.88 That shift also began with a vigorous dissent (joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens), in which he maintained that the Court had \"sub-ordinat[ed]\" the Constitution's textual demand that the de-fendant had a right \"to be confronted with the witnesses 83 See, e. g., Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S. 586 (2006) (limiting the reach of the exclusionary rule). 84 See, e. g., Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 448 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that \"Miranda was objectionable for innumerable reasons\"). 85 See, e. g., Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 337-338 (2002) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing \"death-is-different jurisprudence\" that \"fnd[s] no support in the text or history of the Eighth Amendment\"); Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863, 894 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring) (responding to the suggestion that the Eighth Amendment might preclude the death penalty, and arguing that \"[i]t is impossible to hold unconstitutional that which the Constitution explicitly contemplates\"). 86 523 U.

JUSTICE SCALIA xxv against him\" to \"currently favored public policy\" when it al- lowed a child witness to testify by one-way closed circuit tele-vision. 89 In Crawford, the Justice persuaded six colleagues to join his opinion for the Court insisting that out-of-court testi-monial statements by witnesses are barred unless the defend-ant had a prior opportunity to examine the witness and the witness is currently unavailable. 90 This, too, led to a sea change in the handling of criminal cases. Justice Scalia also was a stalwart defender of the Constitu- tion's prohibition against vague criminal laws.91 Consider his treatment of the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, which triggers higher penalties for those who commit vio-lent felonies. The clause raised vexing questions about what crimes were included in its scope, prompting Justice Scalia to urge the Court to invalidate the clause as vague: \"We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular. It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of im-precise laws. And no surprise that our indulgence of impreci-sions that violate the Constitution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.\" 92 While he initially raised these concerns in dissent, here too he persuaded a majority to see his point of view. In Johnson v. United States, 93 he wrote the opinion striking down the clause as unconstitutionally vague. The rule of law is indeed a law of rules, 94 as thousands of criminal defendants have come to appreciate.95 Justice Scalia not only took seriously the Constitution's many criminal procedure protections. He also respected 89 Maryland v. Craig , 497 U. S., 836, 860-861 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting). 90 Crawford, 541 U. S., at 53-54. 91 See, e. g., Skilling v. United States, 561 U.

Exhibit A is the rule of lenity, which had no greater ad-vocate on the Court than Justice Scalia. 96 That Justice Scalia, whose frst stint in public service came in a Republican admin-istration promising law-and-order judges, ended up where he did on so many matters of criminal law shows that he worked to follow his principles where they led him. No account of Justice Scalia's contribution to this Court would be complete without mentioning his remarkably clear and vivid writing\u2014qualities praised in the last three Justices to occupy his seat: Justices Jackson, Harlan, and Rehnquist. Scalia's writing stands out for its lucidity, poignant wit, and succinctness\u2014and the inventive, memorable images sprin-kled throughout. The images were memorable precisely because they cap- tured the substance of the legal point the Justice was making. Surely there was a separation-of-powers problem with the cre-ation of \"a sort of junior-varsity Congress,\" 97 or a deep faw in a dormant Commerce Clause test that asked judges to divine \"whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy.\" 98 By the same token, who could argue with his ob- servation that Congress \"does not . . . hide elephants in mouse-holes,\" 99 or his injunction that no government has the \"author- ity to license one side of a debate to fght freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensbury Rules\"? 100 The Justice could cut to the heart of a matter and 96 See, e. g., Burrage v. United States, 571 U. S. 204 (2014); United States v. Santos, 553 U. S. 507 (2008); Holloway v. United States, 526 U. S. 1, 20 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting); United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.

Has the Lemon test every fully recov- ered from Justice Scalia's critique in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.? Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that re- peatedly sits up in its grave and shuffes abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon stalks our Es- tablishment Clause jurisprudence once again, frighten-ing the little children and school attorneys of Center Moriches Union Free School District. Its most recent burial, only last Term, was, to be sure, not fully six feet under . . . . Over the years, however, no fewer than fve of the currently sitting Justices have, in their own opin-ions, personally driven pencils through the creature's heart . . . , and a sixth has joined an opinion doing so. The secret of the Lemon test's survival, I think, is that it is so easy to kill. It is there to scare us (and our audi-ence) when we wish it to do so, but we can command it to return to the tomb at will. When we wish to strike down a practice it forbids, we invoke it; when we wish to uphold a practice it forbids, we ignore it entirely. Sometimes, 101 PGA TOUR, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.

By any measure, including the Harvard Law Review's opinion count, his output was prodigious. Over 30 years, Justice Scalia authored 870 opinions, including 281 majority (or plurality) opinions. Many of Justice Scalia's most memorable contributions appear in separate writings. While a number of his 274 dissents are well and widely known, concurring opinions occupied an even larger share of his work. Over three decades, Justice Scalia authored 315 concur-rences\u2014the second most of any Justice who joined the Court since the Harvard Law Review began tabulating opinions by author in 1949. Justice Scalia appreciated that vibrant debate today can lay the foundation for persuading readers tomorrow\u2014himself in-cluded. More than once he acknowledged that new and better arguments had persuaded him to alter views he had expressed in prior cases. 105 And when an oversight in an earlier case was called to his attention, he confessed error, borrowing a page from Justice Jackson to explain: \" `I see no reason why I should be consciously wrong today because I was uncon-sciously wrong yesterday.' \" 106 The North Star to Justice 104508 U. S. 384, 398-399 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). 105 See Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 611 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring) (explaining that, since Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.

JUSTICE SCALIA xxix Scalia was getting the reasoning right\u2014an admonition he never ceased to urge on others and never desisted to accept for himself. While Justice Scalia's writing frequently leapt off the page, advocates before the Court often confronted his tenacity and wit long before he unsheathed his pen. Before 1986, oral ar-gument in the Court was more disquisition than dialogue. Counsel could lead the Court on a leisurely stroll through the facts, the procedural history, and the argument\u2014interrupted by questions only a handful of times. During then-Assistant Attorney General Scalia's only argument before the Supreme Court, in Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 107 he faced a total of 12 questions from two Justices; the other seven Justices said not a word. Scalia won the case. But he took a different approach to the Court's argument ses-sions once he arrived on the other side of the bench. He pep-pered lawyers with questions, sometimes posing 30 or 40 in a single argument. If he found an answer unsatisfactory, he pursued the point through short, often finty-minded, follow-up inquiries. While his approach to oral argument was unique when he joined the Court, that is no longer so. Most Members of the Court have embraced an engaged style of questioning, and the advocates appreciate it (most of the time). Even after Justice Scalia left the academy to start his ju- dicial career, he maintained his connection with the law schools\u2014nearly all of them\u2014by accepting scores of invitations over the years to speak with students and professors. In one sense, he never left teaching; his classroom just got bigger. He often thought of the audience of his opinions as today's and tomorrow's law students, and relished opportunities to talk to students about his theories of judging and about the many useful ways to use a law degree. Justice Scalia's productivity and many contributions to the law could leave the misimpression that he left little time for anything else\u2014that he was all work and no play. Only some-one who did not know him could make that mistake. This son 107 425 U. S. 682 (1976). xxx JUSTICE SCALIA of Trenton and Queens became an avid hunter and fsherman, both of which allowed him to see and experience the Nation's breadth and diversity. He and Maureen looked forward to their annual visits to the Fifth Circuit, where he was the Cir-cuit Justice, each year giving the \"duck call award\" to district court judges reversed by the Fifth Circuit only to be vindi-cated by the Supreme Court. He relished meals with friends, colleagues, and law clerks, often at the late but much-beloved A.V . Ristorante, replete with anchovy pizza and an occasional glass of red wine. He was an ever-present mentor to his many law clerks, often traveling to their cities to speak at local events, always taking time to give career advice. He found a way despite his many other commitments to write several books. 108 He took time to indulge his love of music, even ap- pearing with one of his \"best buddies,\" Justice Ginsburg, in a local opera production. 109 And of course he was deeply de- voted to his large and remarkably close family. Stories about family trips were a staple of chambers conversations, includ-ing descriptions of summer trips to \"Nag's End,\" the North Carolina beach house that Maureen named in honor of her own years of indefatigable advocacy. He loved to tell the story of his grandson, who, when told at a young age that his grandfa-ther worked at the Supreme Court, exclaimed proudly, \"Pop-Pop is the Court Jester.\" Through it all, the Justice did ev-erything in his brim-flled life with unstinting vigor, curiosity, engagement, and a twinkle in his eye. As Justice Scalia once observed, \"[w]hen participating in programs such as this, consisting of brief memorial tributes, one sometimes fears that he will paint a portrait of his de-parted friend that others will not recognize\u2014that perhaps he saw or thought he saw colorations of character or personality 108 Antonin Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (1997); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.

JUSTICE SCALIA xxxi that others did not; rose where they saw pink, or violet where they saw purple.\" As was true of the colleague Justice Scalia was honoring then, \"[t]hat is not a problem when one stands up to talk about\" Antonin Scalia: \"His colors were bright, and they neither changed nor were ever dissembled.\" 110 Carry- ing on our tradition dating to the days of Chief Justice Mar-shall, 111 it is accordingly: RESOL VED that we, the members of the Bar of the Su- preme Court of the United States, express our deepest respect for the late Justice Antonin Scalia; our loss at his passing from this life; our admiration for his commitment to the Nation, its charter, and this Court; and our enduring gratitude for the ex-ample he set in his life both within and beyond the law; and we have further RESOL VED that the Acting Solicitor General be asked to present these resolutions to the Court, and that the Attorney General be asked to move that they be inscribed upon the per-manent records of the Court. The Chief Justice said: Thank you, General Gershengorn. The Court recognizes the Attorney General of the United States. Attorney General Lynch addressed the Court as follows: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Antonin G. Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1986 to 2016. The passing of Justice Scalia has left an enormous void in this courtroom and in the life of the law throughout the United States. With his razor-sharp brilliance and un-matched eloquence, Justice Scalia transformed the way the 110 Antonin Scalia, Tribute to Emerson G. Spies, 77 Va. L. Rev. 427, 427 (1991). 111 10 Pet., at vii, viii (1836). xxxii JUSTICE SCALIA jurists and lawyers approach the law. He strode like a co- lossus through some of the most important opinions, con-currences, and dissents of our time, and he had a singular presence both in the courtroom and on the page. His pene-trating questions at oral argument did not merely seek to clarify minor nuances; they cut to the heart of a position's faws. And his writing did not merely state the law, it capti-vated all who treasure memorable and radiant prose. And even those who disagreed with Justice Scalia could appreci-ate his inspired wordsmithing, like his assertion that Con-gress does not hide elephants in mouseholes or his contention that the rule of law requires a law of rules. Justice Scalia's life was a quintessentially American story. His father was a Sicilian immigrant who came through Ellis Island as a teenager, earned a doctorate from Columbia, and became a professor. His mother was an elementary school-teacher, herself the daughter of Italian immigrants. By all accounts, Justice Scalia's talent was obvious from a young age: from Xavier High School in Manhattan to Georgetown, where he graduated frst in his class, to Harvard Law School, where he edited the Harvard Law Review. He was a charis-matic student who loved to debate. That charisma and his love of the clash of ideas would come to defne him. With these gifts, he could have gone anywhere and done anything. He could have conquered the worlds of commerce or found a home within the business of the law. But rather than pursue material wealth in the private sector, he chose the wealth of ideas to be found in academia. And instead of seeking public acclaim, he turned to public service. Law students at the University of Virginia, as well as the Univer-sity of Chicago, Georgetown, and Stanford, benefted from his rigorous intellectualism and love of the law. And we at the Department of Justice also benefted from his dedication to public service. From 1974 to 1977, he served as the head of the Offce of Legal Counsel at the De- partment of Justice. The traits that would come to defne Justice Scalia's judicial presence were apparent in that role as he provided written opinions that showcased his intellec-JUSTICE SCALIA xxxiii tual rigor, his sharp pen, and his independent mind. He was also known for his ferce support of the independence of the Offce of Legal Counsel and of the Department, traditions we are proud to uphold. Justice Scalia's contributions to the Supreme Court cannot be overstated. Countless pages have been written about the textualist approach to statutory interpretation he cham-pioned. In his three decades on the bench, he succeeded in changing the very way that lawyers and judges determine the meaning of congressional enactments, and he fundamen-tally transformed legal argument. As Justice Kagan noted in her Scalia lecture at Harvard Law School, we're all textu-alists now. Justice Scalia will also be remembered for his robust inter- pretations of the protections that the Constitution affords those who come in contact with the criminal justice system. His Fourth Amendment and Sixth Amendment decisions re-garding searches, the right to a jury trial, and the Confronta-tion Clause fundamentally shaped the way law enforcement offcers investigate potential wrongdoing, and the way prose-cutors put on their cases. The opinions are noteworthy for their reliance on Justice Scalia's originalist approach to inter-preting the Constitution, a philosophy that looks backwards in order to look forward. It looks back to the founding of this great Nation in an effort to understand the protections reserved in the Constitution, and it looks forward to demand that we uphold these protections despite changing times. But Justice Scalia's greatest legacy may be that he brought unmatched conviction and enthusiasm to his jurisprudence. In doing so, he elevated our national legal discourse for all Americans. He challenged even those who agreed with him, and he earned the respect of those who did not. Lawyers who appeared before Justice Scalia found themselves com-pelled to clarify their positions and to sharpen their ar-guments. Readers of Justice Scalia's opinions could not disregard the strength of his reasoning and were forced to re-examine their own convictions. xxxiv JUSTICE SCALIA Justice Scalia knew that this was the point of debate, and he also knew that debate was the essence of democracy. For decades, he had an outsized role in the debates over the meaning of our most fundamental principles: principles of lib-erty, justice, and equality. And because of the brilliance, the eloquence, and the unique passion he brought to that debate, he guaranteed that he will continue to shape it for decades to come. Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Na- tion, and in particular, the members of this Court's Bar, I respectfully request that the resolutions presented to you in honor of Antonin Scalia be accepted by the Court and that they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the records of this Court. The Chief Justice said: Thank you, General Lynch. Your request that the Bar resolutions be made part of the permanent record of the Court is granted, The Court extends to the members of the Resolutions Committee, to the members of the Arrangements Commit-tee, and to the Chairman of today's meeting of the Bar our appreciation for the resolutions adopted today. Antonin Scalia was nominated to the U. S. Court of Ap- peals for the D. C. Circuit by President Reagan on July 15, 1982. He joined that court on August 17 that same year. And just four years later, President Reagan nominated him to be our 103rd Supreme Court Justice. At the time of the White House announcement, he was not well-known to the public. The press had to ask Justice Scalia how to pronounce both his frst and last names. An-tonin Scalia was confrmed on Constitution Day in 1986 by a vote of 98-0. He took the oath of offce as an Associate Jus-tice of this Court on September 26, 1986. Today, every law-yer and journalist in this country, and most other citizens as well know how to pronounce Justice Antonin Scalia. JUSTICE SCALIA xxxv In nearly three decades on this Court, Justice Scalia wrote, by our count, 282 opinions for the Court, beginning with O'Connor v. United States, which he announced exactly 30 years ago today, and ending with Kansas v. Carr , which he announced on January 20 of this year. He was also known to write separately from time to time\u2014authoring more than 300 concurrences and nearly as many dissents. He served with 17 other Justices during his long tenure on this Court. You have already heard of Justice Scalia's extraordinary legacy. On matters of constitutional interpretation, he championed the judicial philosophy of originalism, a view that the Constitution means today what it meant when it was adopted. He espoused this approach in opinions, both for the Court and in dissent, that are now a central feature of every law school's constitutional curriculum. His opinions explaining our Constitution's structural con- straints on governmental power are among the most impor-tant intellectual contributions to the study of liberty since The Federalist Papers. Justice Scalia defended the Presi-dent's power to appoint and remove executive offcials, not to aggrandize presidential power, but to maintain the equi-librium between co-equal branches of government. He in-sisted that Congress perform the duties within its Constitu-tional charge and leave other matters alone, not to manage the legislative process, but to promote individual freedom through electoral accountability. He approached the Judicial Branch with the same rigor. Justice Scalia demanded that federal courts stay within their constitutionally prescribed role of deciding only concrete cases and controversies. He did so not to avoid diffcult is-sues, but to ensure that judges who are insulated from the political process resolve only those matters within Article III's grant of judicial power. Justice Scalia applied originalist scrutiny to interpreting the Bill of Rights. His views were especially infuential with respect to the First Amendment's religion clauses, the Second Amendment's right to bear arms, and the Sixth xxxvi JUSTICE SCALIA Amendment's Confrontation Clause. He persuasively ex- plained how the guarantees set forth 225 years ago continue to provide vital protections in our own age. Writing for the Court in cases involving the Fourth Amendment, he demon-strated how the centuries-old protections against unreason-able searches and seizures reach contemporary police investi-gatory tools, ranging from thermal imaging to electronic tracking devices to drug-sniffng dogs. He once commented that his opinions on the scope of criminal law safeguards in the Bill of Rights should make him the favorite Jus-tice among criminal defendants across the country. Now, whether he wrote for the Court or in dissent, Justice Scalia's incisive analysis and unforgettable prose compelled jurists, lawyers, and citizens alike to think deeply about the meaning of the compact that binds us. Justice Scalia left an equally enduring mark on statutory construction. His insistence on the primacy of a statute's text has enforced greater discipline on the task of construc-tion. As he explained, reliance on the statutory text re-strains judicial discretion and thereby promotes democracy. Although Justice Scalia was a keen legal theorist, he was deeply concerned about the practical workings of govern-ment, and that intense focus is refected in his contributions to administrative law. He made enduring contributions to that feld as a teacher, scholar, and Chairman of the Adminis-trative Conference of the United States, even before he be-came a judge. Whatever the discipline, whatever the role, Justice Scalia was committed to fnding the right answer. And once he had settled upon what was right, he let the chips fall where they may, and cared not a whit what others thought about it. Justice Scalia's voice is perhaps most deeply missed in this very chamber. From his frst day on the bench, he was a vigorous participant in oral argument. His insightful in-quiries enlivened debate and brought out the best in his colleagues and the attorneys who appeared before him, on many occasions also confrming that their best was not good enough. JUSTICE SCALIA xxxvii Now, it would be a stretch to say that there was never a dull moment in this chamber\u2014but often, just when things were getting a bit soporifc, counsel would make some asser-tion that would trigger a reaction from Justice Scalia, rang-ing from explosive to subtle, and the game would be on. His comments in this room also included priceless sotto voce in-sights shared only with those fortunate enough to sit beside him on the bench. Justice Scalia was not restrained in stating his views clearly and forcefully, but he never ceased being our dear friend and valued colleague. He wrestled with ideas, not people, and he knew the difference. He made our days warmer, livelier, and happier. He sang loudest and best at our traditional birthday celebrations. He raised his glass highest to toast others' happy occasions, and his rich laugh-ter flled our halls and our hearts. Justice Scalia's life reached far beyond the law. He would never have said that the law was what was most important to him. He was steadfast in his Roman Catholic faith, and he was devoted beyond measure to his beloved wife, Mau-reen, and the nine children they raised. On occasions such as this, speakers often employ so many laudatory adjectives that the effect can be to sow doubt rather than admiration. But no one who knew Justice Scalia, however they viewed his work, would dispute for a moment that he was patriotic, principled, loyal, courageous, engaging, and brilliant. Those of us on the Court will miss Nino, but we will con- tinue to feel his presence throughout this building. Our ears will hear his voice in this courtroom when advocates invoke his words searching for powerful authority. Our minds will move to the measure of his reason in our chambers when we study his opinions. And our hearts will smile, even as our eyes glisten, when we walk the halls and recall how happy we were whenever we saw him rounding the corner.

Mental Hygiene . THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AT OCTOBER TERM, 2016 BOSSE v. OKLAHOMA on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of oklahoma No. 15-9173. Decided October 11, 2016 In Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, this Court held that Booth v. Mary- land, 482 U. S. 496, wrongly concluded that the Eighth Amendment bans \" `victim impact' evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim and the emotional impact of the crimes on the victim's family,\" 501 U. S., at 817. However, the Court had no occasion to reconsider Booth's prohibition on considering victims' family members' \"character-izations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appro-priate sentence,\" 501 U. S., at 830, n. 2, because no such evidence was presented in Payne. Nonetheless, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has since held that this latter portion of Booth was also \"implic- itly overruled\" by Payne. Petitioner Bosse was convicted of three counts of frst-degree murder. At the trial's penalty phase, the State asked three of the victims' rela-tives to recommend a sentence to the jury. All three recommended death, and the jury agreed. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affrmed the sentence, rejecting Bosse's argument that the testimony about appropriate sentencing violated the Eighth Amendment under Booth. Held: The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals erred in concluding that Payne implicitly overruled Booth in its entirety. \"[I]t is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.\" United States v. 1 2 BOSSE v. OKLAHOMA Per Curiam Hatter, 532 U. S. 557, 567. The Oklahoma court remains bound by Booth's prohibition on characterizations and opinions from a victim's family members about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence unless this Court reconsiders that ban. See Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252-253. Whether this error affected the jury's sentencing determination and whether the defendant's rights were pro-tected by the mandatory sentencing review in capital cases required under Oklahoma law may be addressed on remand. Certiorari granted; 2015 OK CR 14, 360 P. 3d 1203, vacated and remanded. Per Curiam. In Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987), this Court held that \"the Eighth Amendment prohibits a capital sentencing jury from considering victim impact evidence\" that does not \"relate directly to the circumstances of the crime.\" Id., at 501-502, 507, n. 10. Four years later, in Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808 (1991), the Court granted certiorari to recon-sider that ban on \" `victim impact' evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim and the emotional im-pact of the crimes on the victim's family.\" Id., at 817. The Court held that Booth was wrong to conclude that the Eighth Amendment required such a ban. Payne , 501 U. S., at 827. That holding was expressly \"limited to\" this particular type of victim impact testimony. Id., at 830, n. 2. \"Booth also held that the admission of a victim's family members' charac-terizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence violates the Eighth Amendment,\" but no such evidence was presented in Payne , so the Court had no occasion to reconsider that aspect of the decision. Ibid. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has held that Payne \"implicitly overruled that portion of Booth regard- ing characterizations of the defendant and opinions of the sen- tence.\" Conover v. State , 933 P. 2d 904, 920 (1997) (emphasis added); see also Ledbetter v. State , 933 P. 2d 880, 890-891 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997). The decision below presents a straightforward application of that interpretation of Payne . Cite as: 580 U. S. 1 (2016) 3 Per Curiam A jury convicted petitioner Shaun Michael Bosse of three counts of frst-degree murder for the 2010 killing of Katrina Griffn and her two children. The State of Oklahoma sought the death penalty. Over Bosse's objection, the State asked three of the victims' relatives to recommend a sentence to the jury. All three recommended death, and the jury agreed. Bosse appealed, arguing that this testimony about the appropriate sentence violated the Eighth Amendment under Booth. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals af- frmed his sentence, concluding that there was \"no error.\" 2015 OK CR 14, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 360 P. 3d 1203, 1226-1227. We grant certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and now vacate the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. \"[I]t is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.\" United States v. Hatter , 532 U. S. 557, 567 (2001) (quoting State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997); internal quotation marks omitted); see Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989). The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has recog-nized that Payne \"specifcally acknowledged its holding did not affect\" Booth's prohibition on opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate punishment. Ledbetter , 933 P. 2d, at 890-891. That should have ended its inquiry into whether the Eighth Amendment bars such testimony; the court was wrong to go further and conclude that Payne implicitly overruled Booth in its entirety. \"Our decisions re- main binding precedent until we see ft to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.\" Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252-253 (1998). The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals remains bound by Booth's prohibition on characterizations and opinions from a victim's family members about the crime, the defend-ant, and the appropriate sentence unless this Court reconsid-ers that ban. The state court erred in concluding otherwise. 4 BOSSE v. OKLAHOMA Thomas, J., concurring The State argued in opposing certiorari that, even if the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals was wrong in its victim impact ruling, that error did not affect the jury's sentenc-ing determination, and the defendant's rights were in any event protected by the mandatory sentencing review in capital cases required under Oklahoma law. See Brief in Opposi-tion 14-15. Those contentions may be addressed on remand to the extent the court below deems appropriate. The judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas , with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring. We held in Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987), that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a court from admitting the opinions of the victim's family members about the appro-priate sentence in a capital case. The Court today correctly observes that our decision in Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808 (1991), did not expressly overrule this aspect of Booth. Because \"it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents,\" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997), the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals erred in holding that Payne invalidated Booth in its entirety. In va- cating the decision below, this Court says nothing about whether Booth was correctly decided or whether Payne swept away its analytical foundations. I join the Court's opinion with this understanding. OCTOBER TERM, 2016 5 Syllabus BRAVO-FERNANDEZ et al. v. UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the rst circuit No. 15-537. Argued October 4, 2016\u2014Decided November 29, 2016 The issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a sec- ond contest of an issue of fact or law raised and necessarily resolved by a prior judgment. Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, 443. The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the issue he seeks to shield from reconsideration was actually decided by a prior jury's verdict of acquit-tal. Schiro v. Farley , 510 U. S. 222, 233. When the same jury returns irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts on the issue in question, a defendant cannot meet that burden. The acquittal, therefore, gains no preclusive effect regarding the count of conviction. United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 68-69. Issue preclusion does, however, attend a jury's verdict of acquittal if the same jury in the same proceeding fails to reach a verdict on a different count turning on the same issue of ultimate fact. Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 121-122. In this case, a jury convicted petitioners Juan Bravo-Fernandez (Bravo) and Hector Mart\u00ednez-Maldonado (Mart\u00ednez) of bribery in viola-tion of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 666. Simultaneously, the jury acquitted them of conspiring to violate \u00a7 666 and traveling in interstate commerce to vio-late \u00a7 666. Because the only contested issue at trial was whether Bravo and Mart\u00ednez had violated \u00a7 666 (the other elements of the acquitted charges\u2014agreement and travel\u2014were undisputed), the jury's verdicts were irreconcilably inconsistent. Unlike the guilty verdicts in Powell, however, petitioners' convictions were later vacated on appeal because of error in the judge's instructions unrelated to the verdicts' inconsist-ency. In the First Circuit's view, \u00a7 666 proscribes only quid pro quo bribery, yet the charge had permitted the jury to fnd petitioners guilty on a gratuity theory. On remand, Bravo and Mart\u00ednez moved for judg-ments of acquittal on the standalone \u00a7 666 charges. They argued that the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the Government from retrying them on those charges because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating \u00a7 666 when it acquitted them of the related conspiracy and Travel Act offenses. The District Court denied the motions, and the First Circuit affrmed, holding that the eventual invalidation of petitioners' \u00a7 666 convictions did not undermine Powell's instruction that issue preclusion does not apply when the same jury returns logically inconsistent verdicts. 6 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Syllabus Held: The issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Government from retrying defendants, like petitioners, after a jury has returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal and the convictions are later vacated for legal error unrelated to the inconsistency. Pp. 18-24. (a) Because petitioners' trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts, peti- tioners cannot establish that the jury necessarily resolved in their favor the question whether they violated \u00a7 666. In view of the Government's inability to obtain review of the acquittals, Powell, 469 U. S., at 68, the inconsistent jury fndings weigh heavily against according those acquit-tals issue-preclusive effect. The subsequent vacatur of petitioners' bribery convictions does not alter this analysis. The critical inquiry is whether the jury actually decided that petitioners did not violate \u00a7 666. Ashe instructs courts to approach that task with \"realism and rational- ity,\" 397 U. S., at 444, in particular, to examine the trial record \"with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,\" ibid. The jury's ver- dicts convicting petitioners of violating \u00a7 666 remain relevant to this practical inquiry, even if the convictions are later vacated on appeal for unrelated trial error. Petitioners could not be retried if the Court of Appeals had vacated their \u00a7 666 bribery convictions because of insuffcient evidence, see Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 10-11, or if the trial error could resolve the apparent inconsistency in the jury's verdicts. But the evi-dence here was suffcient to convict petitioners on the quid pro quo bribery theory the First Circuit approved. And the instructional error cannot account for the jury's inconsistent determinations, for the error applied equally to every \u00a7 666-related count. Pp. 18-21. (b) Petitioners argue that vacated judgments should be excluded from the Ashe inquiry because vacated convictions, like the hung counts in Yeager , are legal nullities that \"have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.\" Yeager , 557 U. S., at 124. That argument misapprehends the Ashe inquiry. Bravo and Mart\u00ednez bear the burden of showing that the issue whether they violated \u00a7 666 has been \"deter- mined by a valid and fnal judgment of acquittal.\" 557 U. S., at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted). To judge whether they carried that burden, a court must realistically examine the record to identify the ground for the \u00a7 666-based acquittals. Ashe , 397 U. S., at 444. A conviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly relevant to that determination, no less so simply because it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated legal error. See Powell, 469 U. S., at 65. Petitioners further contend that, under Yeager, the \u00a7 666 convictions are meaningless because the jury was allowed to convict on the basis of conduct not criminal in the First Circuit\u2014payment of a gratuity. But Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 7 Opinion of the Court Yeager did not rest on a court's inability to detect the basis for a decision the jury in fact rendered. Rather, when a jury hangs, there is no deci- sion, hence no inconsistency. 557 U. S., at 124-125. By contrast, a ver- dict of guilt is a jury decision, even if subsequently vacated, and there- fore can evince jury inconsistency. That is the case here. Petitioners gained a second trial on the standalone bribery charges, but they are not entitled to more. Issue preclusion is not a doctrine they can com-mandeer when inconsistent verdicts shroud in mystery what the jury necessarily decided. Pp. 22-24. 790 F. 3d 41, affrmed. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Thomas, J., fled a concurring opinion, post, p. 24. Lisa S. Blatt argued the cause for petitioners. With her on the briefs were Anthony J. Franze , R. Stanton Jones, Elizabeth S. Theodore, Abbe David Lowell, and Christopher D. Man. Elizabeth B. Prelogar argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Acting Solicitor Gen- eral Gershengorn, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and Vijay Shanker .* Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. This case concerns the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.1 In criminal prosecutions, as in civil litigation, the issue-preclusion principle means that \"when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were fled for the Cato Institute by David Debold, Ilya Shapiro , and Randal Meyer; for Criminal Law Professors by Jonathan D. Hacker , Deanna M. Rice , and Anton Metlit- sky; for the National Association for Public Defense by David T. Goldberg , Sara B. Thomas, Daniel R. Ortiz, John P . Elwood, and Joshua S. Johnson; and for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Jeffrey T. Green and David M. Porter . 1 The parties use the expression \"collateral estoppel component,\" but as this Court has observed, \"issue preclusion\" is the more descriptive term. Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 120, n. 4 (2009); see Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27, Comment b, pp. 251-252 (1980). 8 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court a valid and fnal judgment, that issue cannot again be lit- igated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, 443 (1970). Does issue preclusion apply when a jury returns inconsist- ent verdicts, convicting on one count and acquitting on an-other count, where both counts turn on the very same issue of ultimate fact? In such a case, this Court has held, both verdicts stand. The Government is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause from challenging the acquittal, see Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957), but because the ver-dicts are rationally irreconcilable, the acquittal gains no pre- clusive effect, United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 68 (1984). Does issue preclusion attend a jury's acquittal verdict if the same jury in the same proceeding fails to reach a verdict on a different count turning on the same critical issue? This Court has answered yes, in those circumstances, the acquit-tal has preclusive force. Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 121-122 (2009). As \"there is no way to decipher what a hung count represents,\" we reasoned, a jury's failure to decide \"has no place in the issue-preclusion analysis.\" Ibid.; see id., at 125 (\"[T]he fact that a jury hangs is evidence of nothing\u2014other than, of course, that it has failed to decide anything.\"). In the case before us, the jury returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal. Without more, Powell would control. There could be no retrial of charges that yielded acquittals but, in view of the inconsist-ent verdicts, the acquittals would have no issue-preclusive effect on charges that yielded convictions. In this case, how-ever, unlike Powell, the guilty verdicts were vacated on appeal because of error in the judge's instructions unrelated to the verdicts' inconsistency. Petitioners urge that, just as a jury's failure to decide has no place in issue-preclusion analysis, so vacated guilty verdicts should not fgure in that analysis. We hold otherwise. One cannot know from the jury's re- port why it returned no verdict. \"A host of reasons\" could Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 9 Opinion of the Court account for a jury's failure to decide\u2014\"sharp disagreement, confusion about the issues, exhaustion after a long trial, to name but a few.\" Yeager , 557 U. S., at 121. But actual in- consistency in a jury's verdicts is a reality; vacatur of a con-viction for unrelated legal error does not reconcile the jury's inconsistent returns. We therefore bracket this case with Powell, not Yeager , and affrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which held that issue preclusion does not apply when verdict inconsistency renders unanswerable \"what the jury necessarily decided.\" 790 F. 3d 41, 47 (CA1 2015). I A The doctrine of claim preclusion instructs that a fnal judg- ment on the merits \"foreclos[es] successive litigation of the very same claim.\" New Hampshire v. Maine , 532 U. S. 742, 748 (2001); see Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19, p. 161 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement). So instructing, the doctrine serves to \"avoid multiple suits on identical entitle-ments or obligations between the same parties.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Proce-dure \u00a7 4402, p. 9 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). Long operative in civil litigation, Restatement, at 2, claim preclusion is also essential to the Constitution's prohibition against successive criminal prosecutions. No person, the Double Jeopardy Clause states, shall be \"subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Amdt. 5. The Clause \"protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction\"; as well, \"[i]t protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\" North Carolina v. Pearce , 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969). \"[A] verdict of acquittal [in our justice system] is fnal,\" the last word on a criminal charge, and therefore oper-ates as \"a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offence.\" Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957) (internal quotation marks omitted). 10 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court The allied doctrine of issue preclusion ordinarily bars relit- igation of an issue of fact or law raised and necessarily re- solved by a prior judgment. See Restatement \u00a7\u00a7 17, 27, at 148, 250; Wright & Miller \u00a7 4416, at 386. It applies in both civil and criminal proceedings, with an important distinction. In civil litigation, where issue preclusion and its ramifcations frst developed, the availability of appellate review is a key factor. Restatement \u00a7 28, Comment a, at 274; see id., \u00a7 28, Reporter's Note, at 284 (noting \"the pervasive importance of reviewability in the application of preclusion doctrine\"). In signifcant doctrine is premised on \"an un- derlying confdence that the result achieved in the initial liti-gation was substantially correct.\" Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 23, n. 18 (1980); see Restatement \u00a7 29, Comment f, at 295. \"In the absence of appellate review,\" we have observed, \"such confdence is often unwarranted.\" Standefer , 447 U. S., at 23, n. 18. In civil suits, inability to obtain review is exceptional; it occurs typically when the controversy has become moot. In criminal cases, however, only one side (the defendant) has recourse to an appeal from an adverse judgment on the mer-its. The Government \"cannot secure appellate review\" of an acquittal, id., at 22, even one \"based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,\" Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503 (1978). Juries enjoy an \"unreviewable power . . . to return a verdict of not guilty for impermissible reasons,\" for \"the Government is precluded from appealing or otherwise upsetting such an acquittal by the Constitution's Double Jeopardy Clause.\" United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 63, 65 (1984). The absence of appellate review of acquittals, we have cautioned, calls for guarded application of preclusion doctrine in criminal cases. See Standefer , 447 U. S., at 22- 23, and n. 18. Particularly where it appears that a jury's verdict is the result of compromise, compassion, lenity, or misunderstanding of the governing law, the Government's in-ability to gain review \"strongly militates against giving an Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 11 Opinion of the Court acquittal [issue] preclusive effect.\" Id., at 23. See also Re- statement \u00a7 29, Comment g, at 295 (Where circumstances suggest that an issue was resolved on erroneous considera- tions, \"taking the prior determination at face value for pur-poses of the second action would [impermissibly] extend the . . . imperfections in the adjudicative process.\"); id., \u00a7 28, Comment j, at 283 (Issue preclusion may be denied where it is \"evident from the jury's verdict that the verdict was the result of compromise.\"); Wright & Miller \u00a7 4423, at 617 (same). B This case requires us to determine whether an appellate court's vacatur of a conviction alters issue-preclusion analy-sis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Three prior deci-sions guide our disposition. This Court frst interpreted the Double Jeopardy Clause to incorporate the principle of issue preclusion in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970). 2 Ashe involved a robbery of six poker players by a group of masked men. Ashe was charged with robbing one of the players, but a jury acquitted him \"due to insuffcient evidence.\" Id., at 439. The State then tried Ashe again, this time for robbing another of the poker players. Aided by \"substantially stronger\" testimony from \"witnesses [who] were for the most part the same,\" id., at 439-440, the State secured a conviction. We held that the second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because the sole issue in dispute in the frst trial was whether Ashe had been one of the robbers, the jury's acquit- 2 Though we earlier recognized that res judicata (which embraces both claim and issue preclusion) applies in criminal as well as civil proceedings, we did not link the issue-preclusion inquiry to the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Sealfon v. United States, 332 U. S. 575, 578 (1948); Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 334 (1915) (The principle that \"a question of fact or of law distinctly put in issue and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot afterwards be disputed between the same parties\" ap-plies to \"the decisions of criminal courts.\"). 12 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court tal verdict precluded the State from trying to convince a different jury of that very same fact in a second trial. Id., at 445. Our decision in Ashe explained that issue preclusion in criminal cases must be applied with \"realism and rational-ity.\" Id., at 444. To identify what a jury in a previous trial necessarily decided, we instructed, a court must \"examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter.\" Ibid. (quoting Mayers & Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 38 (1960)). This inquiry, we explained, \"must be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the pro-ceedings.\" 397 U. S., at 444 (quoting Sealfon v. United States, 332 U. S. 575, 579 (1948)). We have also made clear that \"[t]he burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was actu-ally decided\" by a prior jury's verdict of acquittal. Schiro v. Farley , 510 U. S. 222, 233 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 350 (1990). In United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, we held that a defendant cannot meet this burden when the same jury returns irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts on the question she seeks to shield from reconsideration. Powell's starting point was our holding in Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390 (1932), that a criminal defendant may not attack a jury's fnding of guilt on one count as inconsistent with the jury's verdict of acquittal on another count. Powell, 469 U. S., at 58-59. The Court's opinion in Dunn stated no exceptions to this rule, and after Dunn the Court had several times \"alluded to [the] rule as an established principle,\" 469 U. S., at 63. Nevertheless, several Courts of Appeals had \"recog-niz[ed] exceptions to the rule,\" id., at 62, and Powell sought an exception for the verdicts of guilt she faced. At trial, a jury had acquitted Powell of various substantive drug charges but convicted her of using a telephone in \"caus-Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 13 Opinion of the Court ing and facilitating\" those same offenses. Id., at 59-60. She appealed, arguing that \"the verdicts were inconsistent, and that she therefore was entitled to reversal of the tele-phone facilitation convictions.\" Id., at 60. Issue preclu- sion, she maintained, barred \"acceptance of [the] guilty ver-dict[s]\" on the auxiliary offenses because the same jury had acquitted her of the predicate felonies. Id., at 64. Rejecting Powell's argument, we noted that issue preclu- sion is \"predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally.\" Id., at 68. When a jury returns irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts, we said, one can glean no more than that \"either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions.\" Id., at 64 (quoting Dunn, 284 U. S., at 393). Although it is impossible to discern which verdict the jurors arrived at rationally, we observed, \"that does not show that they were not convinced of the defend-ant's guilt.\" Powell, 469 U. S., at 64-65 (quoting Dunn, 284 U. S., at 393). In the event of inconsistent verdicts, we pointed out, it is just as likely that \"the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on [one count], and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an incon-sistent conclusion on the [related] offense.\" Powell, 469 U. S., at 65. Because a court would be at a loss to know which verdict the jury \"really meant,\" we reasoned, princi- ples of issue preclusion are not useful, for they are \"predi-cated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally and found certain facts in reaching its verdict.\" Id., at 68. Holding that the acquittals had no preclusive effect on the counts of conviction, we reaffrmed Dunn's rule, under which both Powell's convictions and her acquittals, albeit inconsist-ent, remained undisturbed. 469 U. S., at 69. Finally, in Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110 (2009), we clarifed that Powell's holding on inconsistent verdicts does not extend to an apparent inconsistency between a jury's verdict of acquittal on one count and its inability to reach a verdict on another count. See 557 U. S., at 124 (\"[I]nconsist-ent verdicts\" present an \"entirely different context\" than one 14 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court involving \"both verdicts and seemingly inconsistent hung counts.\"). Yeager was tried on charges of fraud and insider trading. Id., at 114. The jury acquitted him of the fraud offenses, which the Court of Appeals concluded must have refected a fnding that he \"did not have any insider informa-tion that contradicted what was presented to the public.\" Id., at 116. Yet the jury failed to reach a verdict on the insider-trading charges, as to which \"the possession of in-sider information was [likewise] a critical issue of ultimate fact.\" Id., at 123. Arguing that the jury had therefore acted inconsistently, the Government sought to retry Yeager on the hung counts. We ruled that retrial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. A jury \"speaks only through its verdict,\" we noted. Id., at 121. Any number of reasons\u2014including confusion about the issues and sheer exhaustion, we observed\u2014could cause a jury to hang. Ibid. Accordingly, we said, only \"a jury's decisions, not its failures to decide,\" identify \"what a jury necessarily determined at trial.\" Id., at 122. Because a hung count reveals nothing more than a jury's failure to reach a decision, we further reasoned, it supplies no evidence of the jury's irrationality. Id., at 124-125. Hung counts, we therefore held, \"ha[ve] no place in the issue-preclusion analy-sis,\" id., at 122: When a jury acquits on one count while fail- ing to reach a verdict on another count concerning the same issue of ultimate fact, the acquittal, and only the acquittal, counts for preclusion purposes. Given the preclusive effect of the acquittal, the Court concluded, Yeager could not be retried on the hung count. Id., at 122-125. C With our controlling precedent in view, we turn to the in- consistent verdicts rendered in this case. The prosecution stemmed from an alleged bribe paid by petitioner Juan Bravo-Fernandez (Bravo), an entrepreneur, to petitioner Hector Mart\u00ednez-Maldonado (Mart\u00ednez), then a senator serv-ing the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The alleged bribe Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 15 Opinion of the Court took the form of an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, including a $1,000 seat at a professional boxing match featur-ing a popular Puerto Rican contender. United States v. Fer- nandez, 722 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2013). According to the Govern-ment, Bravo intended the bribe to secure Mart\u00ednez' help in shepherding legislation through the Puerto Rico Senate that, if enacted, would \"provid[e] substantial fnancial benefts\" to Bravo's enterprise. Ibid. In the leadup to the Las Vegas trip, Mart\u00ednez submitted the legislation for the Senate's con-sideration and issued a committee report supporting it; within a week of returning from Las Vegas, Mart\u00ednez issued another favorable report and voted to enact the legislation. Id., at 6-7. Based on these events, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted petitioners for, inter alia, federal-program bribery, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 666; conspiracy to violate \u00a7 666, in violation of \u00a7 371; and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of \u00a7 666, in violation of the Travel Act, \u00a7 1952(a)(3)(A). 3 Following a three-week trial, a jury con- victed Bravo and Mart\u00ednez of the standalone \u00a7 666 bribery offense, but acquitted them of the related conspiracy and Travel Act charges. Fernandez, 722 F. 3d, at 7. Each re- ceived a sentence of 48 months in prison. Id., at 8. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the \u00a7 666 convictions for instructional error. Id., at 27. In the First Circuit's view, the jury had been erroneously charged on what constitutes criminal conduct under that stat - ute. Id., at 22-27. The charge permitted the jury to fnd Bravo and Mart\u00ednez \"guilty of offering and receiving a gra-tuity,\" id., at 16, but, the appeals court held, \u00a7 666 pro- scribes only quid pro quo bribes, and not gratuities, id., at 6, 22. 4 True, the court acknowledged, the jury was in- 3 Petitioners were indicted on several other charges not relevant here. See United States v. Fernandez, 722 F. 3d 1, 7 (CA1 2013). 4 As the First Circuit acknowledged, this holding is contrary to the rul- ings of \"most circuits to have addressed th[e] issue.\" Id., at 6. Three other Federal Courts of Appeals have considered the question; each has 16 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court structed on both theories of bribery, and the evidence at trial suffced to support a guilty verdict on either theory. Id., at 19-20. But the Court of Appeals could not say with conf-dence that the erroneous charge was harmless, so it vacated the \u00a7 666 convictions and remanded for further proceedings. Id., at 27, 39. On remand, relying on the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause, Bravo and Mart\u00ednez moved for judgments of acquittal on the standalone \u00a7 666 charges. 988 F. Supp. 2d 191 (PR 2013). They could not be retried on the bribery offense, they insisted, because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating \u00a7 666 when it acquitted them of conspiring to violate \u00a7 666 and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of \u00a7 666. Id., at 193. That was so, petitioners maintained, because the only contested issue at trial was whether Bravo had offered, and Mart\u00ednez had accepted, a bribe within the meaning of \u00a7 666. Id., at 196; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 (\"There was no dispute that they agreed to go to a boxing match together\"; nor was there any dispute \"that to get to Las Vegas from Puerto Rico, you have to travel\" across state lines.). The District Court de-nied the motions for acquittal. 988 F. Supp. 2d, at 196-198. If the sole issue disputed at trial was whether Bravo and Mart\u00ednez had violated \u00a7 666, the court explained, then \"the jury [had] acted irrationally.\" Id., at 196. Because the same jury had simultaneously convicted Bravo and Mart\u00ednez on the standalone \u00a7 666 charges, \"the verdict simply was in-consistent.\" Ibid. The First Circuit affrmed the denial of petitioners' mo- tions for acquittal, agreeing that the jury's inconsistent re-turns were fatal to petitioners' issue-preclusion plea. 790 F. 3d 41. The jury received the same bribery instructions held that \u00a7 666 prohibits gratuities as well as quid pro quo bribes. See United States v. Bahel, 662 F. 3d 610, 636 (CA2 2011); United States v. Hawkins, 777 F. 3d 880, 881 (CA7 2015); United States v. Zimmerman, 509 F. 3d 920, 927 (CA8 2007). Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 17 Opinion of the Court for each count involving \u00a7 666, the court noted, so the \u00a7 666- based verdicts\u2014convicting on the standalone bribery charges but acquitting on the related Travel Act and conspir-acy counts\u2014could not be reconciled. Id., at 54-55. 5 The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' argument that the eventual invalidation of the bribery convictions rendered Powell's inconsistent-verdicts rule inapplicable. Ashe , the court reminded, calls for a practical appraisal based on the complete record of the prior proceeding; the \u00a7 666 bribery convictions, like the \u00a7 666-based acquittals, were part of that record. See 790 F. 3d, at 50. Nor are vacated convictions like hung counts for issue-preclusion purposes, the court con-tinued. Informed by our decision in Yeager , the First Cir- cuit recognized that a hung count reveals only a jury's failure to decide, and therefore cannot evidence actual inconsistency with a jury's decision. 790 F. 3d, at 50-51. In contrast, the court said, vacated convictions \" are jury decisions, through which the jury has spoken.\" Id., at 51. The later upset of a conviction on an unrelated ground, the court reasoned, does not undermine Powell's recognition that \"inconsistent verdicts make it impossible to determine what a jury nec-essarily decided.\" 790 F. 3d, at 51. The First Circuit therefore concluded that \"vacated convictions, unlike hung counts, are relevant to the Ashe [issue-preclusion] inquiry.\" Ibid. We granted certiorari to resolve a confict among courts on this question: Does the issue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause bar the Government from retrying defendants, like Bravo and Mart\u00ednez, after a jury has re- 5 As just observed, see supra, at 16, petitioners urge that \u00a7 666 bribery was the sole issue in controversy, and that there was no dispute on other elements of the Travel Act and conspiracy counts. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4. See also Brief for United States 13 (accepting that the jury \"returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts\"). If another element could explain the acquittals, then there would be no inconsistency and no argument against a new trial on bribery. See infra, at 19-20. 18 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court turned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal, and the convictions are later vacated for legal error unrelated to the inconsistency? 6 577 U. S. 1234 (2016). Holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar re-trial in these circumstances, we affrm the First Circuit's judgment. II When a conviction is overturned on appeal, \"[t]he general rule is that the [Double Jeopardy] Clause does not bar re-prosecution.\" Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294, 308 (1984). The ordinary consequence of vacatur, if the Government so elects, is a new trial shorn of the error that infected the frst trial. This \"continuing jeopardy\" rule neither gives effect to the vacated judgment nor offends double jeopardy principles. Rather, it refects the reality that the \"criminal proceedings against an accused have not run their full course.\" Ibid. And by permitting a new trial post vacatur, the continuing-jeopardy rule serves both society's and criminal defendants' interests in the fair administration of justice. \"It would be a high price indeed for society to pay,\" we have recognized, \"were every accused 6 Compare United States v. Citron, 853 F. 2d 1055, 1058-1061 (CA2 1988) (holding that retrial does not violate Double Jeopardy Clause under these circumstances); United States v. Price , 750 F. 2d 363, 366 (CA5 1985) (same); Evans v. United States, 987 A. 2d 1138, 1141-1142 (D. C. 2010) (same); and State v. Kelly , 201 N. J. 471, 493-494, 992 A. 2d 776, 789 (2010) (same), with People v. Wilson, 496 Mich. 91, 105-107, 852 N. W. 2d 134, 141-142 (2014) (holding that Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial in this situation). As the First Circuit explained, \"[a]lthough Citron and Price predate Yeager , both the Second and Fifth Circuits decided that vacated counts are relevant to the Ashe analysis at a time when those circuits had already ruled that hung counts should be disregarded for purposes of the Ashe inquiry.\" 790 F. 3d 41, 51, n. 7 (2015) (citing United States v. Mes- poulede , 597 F. 2d 329, 332, F. 2d 714, 716-717 (CA5 1979)). The Second Circuit, moreover, has adhered to Citron since Yeager . See United States v. Bruno , 531 Fed. Appx. 47, 49 (2013). Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 19 Opinion of the Court granted immunity from punishment because of any defect suffcient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.\" United States v. Tateo , 377 U. S. 463, 466 (1964). And the rights of criminal defendants would suf-fer too, for \"it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the ef-fects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution.\" Ibid. Bravo and Mart\u00ednez ask us to deviate from the general rule that, post vacatur of a conviction, a new trial is in order. When a conviction is vacated on appeal, they maintain, an acquittal verdict simultaneously returned should preclude the Government from retrying the defendant on the vacated count. Our precedent, harmonious with issue-preclusion doctrine, opposes the foreclosure petitioners seek. A Bravo and Mart\u00ednez bear the burden of demonstrating that the jury necessarily resolved in their favor the question whether they violated \u00a7 666. Schiro , 510 U. S., at 233. But, as we have explained, see supra, at 12-13, a defendant can- not meet that burden where the trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts on the issue the defendant seeks to insulate from relitigation. Here, the jury convicted Bravo and Mart-\u00ednez of violating \u00a7 666 but acquitted them of conspiring, and traveling with the intent, to violate \u00a7 666. The convictions and acquittals are irreconcilable because other elements of the Travel Act and conspiracy counts were not disputed. See supra, at 16, 17, n. 5. It is unknowable \"which of the inconsistent verdicts\u2014the acquittal[s] or the conviction[s]\u2014 `the jury really meant.' \" 790 F. 3d, at 47 (quoting Powell, 469 U. S., at 68); see Restatement \u00a7 29, Comment f, at 295 (\"Where a determination relied on as preclusive is itself in-consistent with some other adjudication of issue, determination] is generally v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court ranted.\"). In view of the Government's inability to obtain review of the acquittals, Powell, 469 U. S., at 68, the incon- sistent jury fndings weigh heavily against according those acquittals issue-preclusive effect. See Standefer , 447 U. S., at 23, n. 17. That petitioners' bribery convictions were later vacated for trial error does not alter our analysis. The critical in-quiry is whether the jury actually decided that Bravo and Mart\u00ednez did not violate \u00a7 666. Ashe counsels us to approach that task with \"realism and rationality,\" 397 U. S., at 444, in particular, to examine the trial record \"with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,\" ibid. As the Court of Appeals explained, \"the fact the jury . . . convicted [Bravo and Mart\u00ednez] of violating \u00a7 666 would seem to be of quite obvious relevance\" to this practical inquiry, \"even though the convictions were later vacated.\" 790 F. 3d, at 50. Because issue preclusion \"depends on the jury's assess- ment of the facts in light of the charges as presented at trial,\" a conviction overturned on appeal is \"appropriately considered in our assessment of [an acquittal] verdict's pre-clusive 2d 1055, 1061 (CA2 1988). Indeed, the jurors in this case might not have acquitted on the Travel Act and conspiracy counts absent their belief that the \u00a7 666 bribery convictions would stand. See ibid. Bravo and Mart\u00ednez could not be retried on the bribery counts, of course, if the Court of Appeals had vacated their \u00a7 666 convictions because there was insuffcient evidence to support those convictions. For double jeopardy purposes, a court's evaluation of the evidence as insuffcient to convict is equivalent to an acquittal and therefore bars a second prose-cution for the same offense. See Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1978); cf. Powell, 469 U. S., at 67 (noting that defendants are \"afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by [courts'] independent review of the suffciency of the evidence\"). But this is scarcely a case in which the Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 21 Opinion of the Court prosecution \"failed to muster\" suffcient evidence in the frst proceeding. Burks, 437 U. S., at 11. Quite the opposite. The evidence presented at petitioners' trial, the Court of Ap-peals determined, supported a guilty verdict on the gratuity theory (which the First Circuit ruled impermissible) as well as the quid pro quo theory (which the First Circuit ap- proved). 790 F. 3d, at 44. Vacatur was compelled for the sole reason that the First Circuit found the jury charge erro-neous to the extent that it encompassed gratuities. See supra, at 15-16, and n. 4. Therefore, the general rule of \"allowing a new trial to rectify trial error\" applied. Burks, 437 U. S., at 14 (emphasis deleted). Nor, as the Government acknowledges, would retrial be tolerable if the trial error could resolve the apparent incon- sistency in the jury's verdicts. See Brief for United States 30 (If, for example, \"a jury receives an erroneous instruction on the count of conviction but the correct instruction on the charge on which it acquits, the instructional error may recon-cile the verdicts.\"). But the instructional error here cannot account for the jury's contradictory determinations because the error applied equally to every \u00a7 666-related count. See supra, at 16-17. As in Powell, so in this case, \"[t]he problem is that the same jury reached inconsistent results.\" 469 U. S., at 68. The convictions' later invalidation on an unrelated ground does not erase or reconcile that inconsistency: It does not bear on \"the factual determinations actually and necessarily made by the jury,\" nor does it \"serv[e] to turn the jury's otherwise inconsistent and irrational verdict into a consist-ent and rational verdict.\" People v. Wilson, 496 Mich. 91, 125, 852 N. W. 2d 134, 151 (2014) (Markman, J., dissenting). Bravo and Mart\u00ednez, therefore, cannot establish the factual predicate necessary to preclude the Government from retry-ing them on the standalone \u00a7 666 charges\u2014namely, that the jury in the frst proceeding actually decided that they did not violate the federal bribery statute. 22 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court B To support their argument for issue preclusion, Bravo and Mart\u00ednez highlight our decision in Yeager . In Yeager , they point out, we recognized that hung counts \"have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.\" 557 U. S., at 124. That is also true of vacated convictions, they urge, so vacated convictions, like hung counts, should be excluded from the Ashe inquiry into what the jury necessarily deter- mined. Brief for Petitioners 20-24. Asserting that we have \"never held an invalid conviction . . . relevant to or evidence of anything,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, Bravo and Mart\u00ednez argue that taking account of a vacated conviction in our issue-preclusion analysis would impermissibly give effect to \"a legal nullity,\" Brief for Petitioners 39; see Wilson, 496 Mich., at 107, 852 N. W. 2d, at 142 (majority opinion) (consid-ering a vacated count would impermissibly \"bring that le-gally vacated conviction back to life\"). This argument misapprehends the Ashe inquiry. It is un- disputed that petitioners' convictions are invalid judgments that may not be used to establish their guilt. The question is whether issue preclusion stops the Government from pros-ecuting them anew. On that question, Bravo and Mart\u00ednez bear the burden of showing that the issue whether they vio-lated \u00a7 666 has been \"determined by judg-ment of acquittal.\" 557 U. S., at 119 (internal quota- tion marks omitted). To judge whether they carried that burden, a court must realistically examine the record to iden-tify the ground for the \u00a7 666-based acquittals. Ashe , 397 U. S., at 444. A conviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly relevant to that determination, no less so simply because it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated legal error: The split verdict\u2014fnding \u00a7 666 violated on the stand-alone counts, but not violated on the related Travel Act and conspiracy counts\u2014tells us that, on one count or the other, \"the jury [did] not follo[w] the court's instructions,\" whether because of \"mistake, compromise, or lenity.\" Powell, 469 Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 23 Opinion of the Court U. S., at 65; see supra, at 13. Petitioners' acquittals there- fore do not support the application of issue preclusion here.7 Further relying on Yeager , Bravo and Mart\u00ednez contend that their vacated convictions should be ignored because, as with hung counts, \"there is no way to decipher\" what they represent. Brief for Petitioners 28 (quoting Yeager , 557 U. S., at 121). The \u00a7 666 convictions are meaningless, they maintain, because the jury was allowed to convict on the basis of conduct not criminal in the First Circuit\u2014payment of a gratuity. Brief for Petitioners 24. This argument trips on Yeager 's reasoning. Yeager did not rest on a court's inability to detect the basis for a jury's decision. Rather, this Court reasoned that, when a jury hangs, there is no decision, hence no evidence of irrationality. 557 U. S., at 124-125. A verdict of guilt, by contrast, is a jury decision, even if subsequently vacated on appeal. It therefore can evince irrationality. That is the case here. Petitioners do not dispute that the Government's evidence at trial supported a guilty verdict on the quid pro quo theory, or that the gratuity instruction held erroneous by the Court of Appeals applied to every \u00a7 666-based offense. Because no rational jury could have reached conficting verdicts on those counts, petitioners' \u00a7 666 convic-tions \"reveal the jury's inconsistency\u2014which is the relevant issue here\u2014even if they do not reveal which theory of liabil-ity jurors relied upon in reaching those inconsistent ver-dicts.\" Brief for United States 31. In other words, be-cause we do not know what the jury would have concluded 7 Nor is this the frst time we have looked to a vacated conviction to ascertain what a jury decided in a prior proceeding. Our holding in Mor- ris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237 (1986), that a conviction vacated on double jeopardy grounds may be \"reduced to a conviction for a lesser included offense which is not jeopardy barred,\" id., at 246-247, rested on exactly that rationale. See id., at 247 (relying on a jeopardy-barred vacated con- viction for aggravated murder to conclude that the jury \"necessarily found that the defendant's conduct satisfe[d] the elements of the lesser included offense\" of simple murder). 24 BRAVO-FERNANDEZ v. UNITED STATES Thomas, J., concurring had there been no instructional error, Brief for Petitioners 28-29, a new trial on the counts of conviction is in order. Bravo and Mart\u00ednez have succeeded on appeal to that extent, but they are entitled to no more. The split verdict does not impede the Government from renewing the prosecution. 8 The Double Jeopardy Clause, as the First Circuit ex- plained, forever bars the Government from again prosecuting Bravo and Mart\u00ednez on the \u00a7 666-based conspiracy and Travel Act offenses; \"the acquittals themselves remain inviolate.\" 790 F. 3d, at 51, n. 6. Bravo and Mart\u00ednez have also gained \"the beneft of their appellate victory,\" ibid.: a second trial on the standalone bribery charges, in which the Government may not invoke a gratuity theory. But issue preclusion is not a doctrine they can commandeer when inconsistent ver-dicts shroud in mystery what the jury necessarily decided. * * * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap- peals for the First Circuit is Affrmed. Justice Thomas, concurring. The question presented in this case is whether, under Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), and Yeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110 (2009), a vacated conviction can nullify the pre- 8 A number of lower courts have reached the same conclusion. See Cit- ron, 853 F. 2d, at 1059 (If the defendant \"was convicted of the offense that is the subject of the retrial,\" the case is materially different from one with \"an acquittal accompanied by a failure to reach a verdict.\"); Price , 750 F. 2d, at 366 (a case in which \"the jury returned no verdict of conviction\" on the compound count, \"but only a verdict of acquittal on the substantive count,\" is not instructive on whether the Government may retry a defend-ant after an inconsistent verdict has been vacated); Evans, 987 A. 2d, at 1142 (\"Yeager does nothing to undermine\" the conclusion that a defendant may be retried after an inconsistent verdict is overturned.); Kelly , 201 N. J., at 494, 992 A. 2d, at 789 (explaining in the context of retrial following vacatur that \"Yeager has no application to a case . . . involving an inconsist- ent verdict of acquittals and convictions returned by the same jury\"). Cite as: 580 U. S. 5 (2016) 25 Thomas, J., concurring clusive effect of an acquittal under the issue-preclusion prong of the Double Jeopardy Clause. As originally understood, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not have an issue-preclusion prong. \"The English common-law pleas of auterfoits acquit and auterfoits con- vict, on which the Clause was based, barred only repeated `prosecution for the same identical act and crime.' \" Id., at 128 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Com-mentaries on the Laws of England 330 (1769); emphasis added by dissent); see also Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 530-535 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting). But \"[i]n Ashe the Court departed from the original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause, holding that it precludes successive prose-cutions on distinct crimes when facts essential to conviction of the second crime have necessarily been resolved in the defendant's favor by a verdict of acquittal of the frst crime.\" Yeager , supra, at 128 (Scalia, J., dissenting). , this Court erroneously and illogically extended Ashe . See 557 U. S., at 128-131. \"Ashe held only that the Clause sometimes bars successive prosecution of facts found during `a prior proceeding.' \" Id., at 129 (quoting Ashe , supra, at 444). Yeager , however, \"bar[red] retrial hung counts after what was not . . . a prior proceeding but simply an earlier stage of the same proceeding.\" 557 U. S., at 129 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In an appropriate case, we should reconsider the holdings of Ashe and Yeager . Because the Court today properly de- clines to extend those cases, and indeed reaches the correct result under the Clause's original meaning, I join its opinion. 26 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Syllabus STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fth circuit No. 15-513. Argued November 1, 2016\u2014Decided December 6, 2016 The False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes private parties (known as rela- tors) to seek recovery from persons who make false or fraudulent pay- ment claims to the Federal Government, 31 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-3730, and permits the Attorney General to intervene in a relator's action or bring an FCA suit in the frst instance, \u00a7\u00a7 3730(a)-(b). This system is designed to beneft both the relator and the Government. A relator who initiates a meritorious qui tam suit receives , inter alia, a percent- age of the ultimate damages award, \u00a7 3730(d), while \" `encourag[ing] more private enforcement suits' \" serves \" `to strengthen the Govern-ment's hand in fghting false claims,' \" Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280, 298. The FCA establishes specifc procedures for relators to follow, including the requirement relevant here: \"The complaint shall be fled in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\" \u00a7 3730(b)(2). In the years before Hurricane Katrina, petitioner State Farm issued, as pertinent here, both Federal Government-backed food insurance poli-cies and petitioner's own general homeowner policies. Respondents Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters for one of petitioner's contractors, E. A. Renfroe & Co., fled a complaint under seal in April 2006, claiming that petitioner instructed them and other adjusters to misclassify wind damage as food damage in order to shift petitioner's insurance liability to the Government. The District Court extended the length of the seal several times at the Government's request, but lifted the seal in part in January 2007, allowing disclosure of the action to another District Court hearing a suit by E. A. Renfroe against re-spondents. In August 2007, the District Court lifted the seal in full. The Government subsequently declined to intervene. Petitioner moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds that respondents had violated the seal requirement. Specifcally, it alleged, respondents' former attorney had disclosed the complaint's existence to several news outlets, which issued stories about the fraud allegations, but did not mention the existence of the FCA complaint; and respondents had met with a Congressman who later spoke out against the purported fraud. Cite as: 580 U. S. 26 (2016) 27 Syllabus The District Court applied the test for dismissal set out in United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 67 F. 3d 242, 245-247. Balancing three factors\u2014actual harm to the Government, severity of the viola- tions, and evidence of bad faith\u2014the court decided against dis - missal. Petitioner did not request a lesser sanction. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. It first concluded that a seal violation does not require mandatory dismissal of a relator's complaint. It then considered the same factors weighed by the District Court and reached a similar conclusion. Held: 1. A seal violation does not mandate dismissal of a relator's complaint. Pp. 33-37. (a) The FCA does not enact so harsh a rule. Section 3730(b)(2)'s requirement that a complaint \"shall\" be kept under seal is a mandatory rule for relators. But the statute says nothing about the remedy for violating that rule; and absent congressional guidance regarding a rem-edy, \"the sanction for breach [of a mandatory duty] is not loss of all later powers to act.\" United States v. Montalvo-Murillo , 495 U. S. 711, 718. The FCA's structure supports this result. The FCA has a number of provisions requiring, in express terms, the dismissal of a relator's action. E. g., \u00a7\u00a7 3730(b)(5), (e)(1)-(2). It is thus proper to infer that Congress did not intend to require dismissal for a violation of the seal require-ment. See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 384. This result is also consistent with the general purpose of \u00a7 3730(b)(2), which was enacted as part of a set of reforms meant to \"encourage more pri-vate enforcement suits,\" S. Rep. No. 99-345, pp. 23-24, and which was intended to protect the Government's interests, allaying its concern that a relator fling a civil complaint would alert defendants to a pending federal criminal investigation. It would thus make little sense to adopt a rigid interpretation that prejudices the Government by depriving it of needed assistance from private parties. Pp. 33-35. (b) Petitioner's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. There is no textual indication that Congress conditioned the authority to fle a private right of action on compliance with the seal requirement or that the relator's ability to bring suit depends on adherence to the seal re-quirement. And the Senate Committee Report's recitation of the FCA's general purpose is best understood to support respondents rather than a mandatory dismissal rule. Moreover, because the FCA's text and structure are clear, there is no need to accept petitioner's invitation to consider a few stray sentences from the legislative history. Pp. 35-37. 2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying petition- er's motion to dismiss. The question whether dismissal is appropriate 28 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Syllabus should be left to the sound discretion of the district court. While the Hughes Aircraft factors appear to be appropriate, it is unnecessary to explore these and other relevant considerations, which can be discussed in the course of later cases. P. 37. 3. On this record, where petitioner requested no sanction other than dismissal, the question whether a lesser sanction\u2014such as monetary penalties\u2014is warranted is not preserved. Pp. 37-38. 794 F. 3d 457, affrmed. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Kathleen M. Sullivan argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Sheila L.

This case addresses the question of the proper remedy when there is a violation of the False Claims Act (FCA) re- quirement that certain complaints must be sealed for a lim-ited time period. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). There are two questions presented before this Court. First, do any and all violations of the seal requirement mandate dismissal of a private party's complaint with prejudice? Second, if dismissal is not mandatory, did the District Court here abuse its discretion by declining to dismiss respondents' complaint? I A The FCA imposes civil liability on an individual who, inter alia, \"knowingly presents . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\" to the Federal Government. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A). Almost unique to the FCA are its qui tam enforcement provisions, which allow a private party known as a \"relator\" to bring an FCA action on behalf of the Gov-ernment. \u00a7 3730(b)(1); Vermont Agency of Natural Re- sources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 768, n. 1 (2000) (listing three other qui tam statutes). The Attor- ney General retains the authority to intervene in a relator's ongoing action or to bring an FCA suit in the frst instance. \u00a7\u00a7 3730(a)-(b). This system is designed to beneft both the relator and the Government. A relator who initiates a meritorious qui tam suit receives a percentage of the ultimate damages award, plus attorney's fees and costs. \u00a7 3730(d). In turn, \" `encour-ag[ing] more private enforcement suits' \" serves \" ` to strengthen the Government's hand in fghting false claims.' \" Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. 280, 298 (2010). The FCA places a number of restrictions on suits by re- lators. For example, under the provision known as the \"frst-to-fle bar,\" a relator may not \" `bring a related action 30 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Opinion of the Court based on the facts underlying [a] pending action.' \" Kellogg Brown & Root Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Carter , 575 U. S. 650, 663 (2015) (quoting \u00a7 3730(b)(5); emphasis de- leted). Other FCA provisions require compliance with stat-utory requirements as express conditions on the relators' ability to bring suit. The paragraph known as the \"public disclosure bar,\" for instance, provided at the time this suit was fled that \" `[n]o court shall have jurisdiction over an ac-tion under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions . . . unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or . . . an original source of the information.' \" Graham County Soil and Water Conserva- tion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, supra, at 283, n. 1, 285-286 (quoting 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.); foot-note omitted). The FCA also establishes specifc procedures for the re- lator to follow when fling the complaint. Among other things, the relator must serve on the Government \"[a] copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the [relator] possesses.\" \u00a7 3730(b)(2). Most relevant here, the FCA provides: \"The complaint shall be fled in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\" Ibid. B Petitioner State Farm is an insurance company. In the years before Hurricane Katrina, petitioner issued two types of homeowner insurance policies that are relevant in this case: (1) Federal Government-backed food insurance policies and (2) petitioner's own general homeowner insurance poli-cies. The practical effect for homeowners who were af-fected by Hurricane Katrina and who purchased both policies was that petitioner would be responsible for paying for wind damage, while the Government would pay for food damage. As the Court of Appeals noted, this arrangement created a Cite as: 580 U. S. 26 (2016) 31 Opinion of the Court potential confict of interest: Petitioner had \"an incentive to classify hurricane damage as food-related to limit its eco-nomic exposure.\" 794 F. 3d 457, 462 (CA5 2015). Respondents Cori and Kerri Rigsby are former claims ad- justers for one of petitioner's contractors, E. A. Renfroe & Co. Together with other adjusters, they were responsible for visiting the damaged homes of petitioner's customers to determine the extent to which a homeowner was entitled to an insurance payout. According to respondents, petitioner instructed them and other adjusters to misclassify wind damage as food damage in order to shift petitioner's insur- ance liability to the Government. See id., at 463-464 (sum- marizing trial evidence). In April 2006, respondents fled their qui tam complaint under seal. At the Government's request, the District Court extended the length of the seal a number of times. In January 2007, the court lifted the seal in part, allowing disclosure of the qui tam action to another District Court hearing a suit by E. A. Renfroe against respondents for pur-ported misappropriation of documents related to petitioner's alleged fraud. See E. A. Renfroe & Co. v. Moran, No. 2:06- cv-1752 (ND Ala.). In August 2007, the District Court lifted the seal in full. In January 2008, the Government de-clined to intervene. In January 2011, petitioner moved to dismiss respondents' suit on the grounds that they had violated the seal require-ment. The parties do not dispute the essential background. In the months before the seal was lifted in part, respondents' then-attorney, one Dickie Scruggs, e-mailed a disclosed the complaint's existence to jour-nalists at ABC, the Associated Press, and the New York Times. All three outlets issued stories discussing the fraud allegations, but none revealed the existence of the FCA com-plaint. Respondents themselves met with Mississippi Con-gressman Gene Taylor, who later spoke out in public against petitioner's purported fraud, although he did not mention the 32 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Opinion of the Court existence of the FCA suit at that time. After the seal was lifted in part, Scruggs disclosed the existence of the suit to various others, including a public relations frm and CBS News. At the time of the motion to dismiss in 2011, respondents were represented neither by Scruggs nor by any of the attor-neys who had worked with him. In March 2008, Scruggs withdrew from respondents' case after he was indicted for attempting to bribe a state-court judge. Two months later, the District Court removed the remaining Scruggs-affliated attorneys from the case, based on their alleged involvement in improper payments made from Scruggs to respondents. The District Court did not punish respondents themselves for the payments because they were not made \"aware of the ethical implications\" and, as laypersons, \"are not bound by the rules of professional conduct that apply to\" attorneys. App. 21. In deciding petitioner's motion the District Court consid- ered only the seal violations that occurred before the seal was lifted in part, reasoning the partial lifting in effect had mooted the seal. Applying the test for dismissal set out in United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 67 F. 3d 242, 245-247 (CA9 1995), the District Court balanced three factors: (1) the actual harm to the Government, (2) the sever-ity of the violations, and (3) the evidence of bad faith. The court decided against dismissal. Petitioner did not request some lesser sanction. The case went to trial, resulting in a victory for respondents on what the Court of Appeals re-ferred to as a \"bellwether\" claim regarding a single damaged home. 794 F. 3d, at 462. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affrmed the denial of petitioner's motion to dismiss. The court recog-nized that the case presented two related issues of the frst impression under its case law: (1) whether a seal violation requires mandatory dismissal of a relator's complaint and, if not, (2) what standard governs a district court's decision to dismiss. The court noted that the Courts of Appeals for the Cite as: 580 U. S. 26 (2016) 33 Opinion of the Court Second and Ninth Circuits had held that the FCA does not require automatic dismissal for a seal violation, while the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had held that dis-missal is mandatory. See United States ex rel. Pilon v. Martin Marietta Corp., 60 F. 3d 995, 998 (CA2 1995); United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., supra, at 245; United States ex rel. Summers v. LHC Group Inc., 623 F. 3d 287, 296 (CA6 2010); see also United States ex rel. Smith v. Clark/Smoot/Russell, 796 F. 3d 424, 430 (CA4 2015) (follow-ing Pilon). After a careful analysis, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held automatic dismissal is not required by the FCA. 794 F. 3d, at 470-471. It then considered the same factors the District Court had weighed and came to a similar conclu-sion. Id., at 471-472. First, the Court of Appeals held the Government was in all likelihood not harmed by the disclo-sures because none of them led to the publication of the pendency of the suit before the seal was lifted in part. Sec-ond, the Court of Appeals determined the violations were not severe in their repercussions because respondents had complied with the seal requirement when they frst fled their suit. Third, the Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that the bad behavior of respondents' then-attorney could be imputed to respondents; but it held that, even presuming the attribution of bad faith, the other factors favored respondents. This Court granted certiorari, 578 U. S. 1011 (2016), and now affrms. II A Petitioner's primary contention is that a violation of the seal provision necessarily requires a relator's complaint to be dismissed. The FCA does not enact so harsh a rule. Section 3730(b)(2)'s text provides that a complaint \"shall\" be kept under seal. True, this language creates a manda-tory rule the relator must follow. See Rockwell Int'l Corp. 34 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Opinion of the Court v. United States, 549 U. S. 457, 464 (2007) (\"As required under the Act, [the relator] fled his complaint under seal . . . \"); see also Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 579 U. S. 162, 172 (2016) (\"[T]he word `shall' usually connotes a requirement\"). The statute says nothing, how-ever, about the remedy for a violation of that rule. In the absence of congressional guidance regarding a remedy, \"[a]lthough the duty is mandatory, the sanction for breach is not loss of all later powers to act.\" United States v. Montalvo-Murillo , 495 U. S. 711, 718 (1990). The FCA's structure is itself an indication that violating the seal requirement does not mandate dismissal. This Court adheres to the general principle that Congress' use of \"explicit language\" in one provision \"cautions against infer-ring\" the same limitation in another provision. Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 384 (2013). And the FCA has a number of provisions that do require, in express terms, the dismissal of a relator's action. Supra, at 29-30 (citing \u00a7 have jurisdiction\" over certain FCA claims by relators against a member of the military or of the judicial, legisla-tive, or executive branches). It is proper to infer that, had Congress intended to require dismissal for a violation of the seal requirement, it would have said so. The Court's conclusion is consistent with the general pur- pose of \u00a7 3730(b)(2). The seal provision was enacted in the 1980's as part of a set of reforms that were meant to \"encour-age more private enforcement suits.\" S. Rep. No. 99-345, pp. 23-24 (1986). At the time, \"perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective enforcement\" of the FCA was \"a lack of resources on the part of Federal enforcement agen-cies.\" Id., at 7. The Senate Committee Report indicates that the seal provision was meant to allay the Government's concern that a relator fling a civil complaint would alert de-fendants to a pending federal criminal investigation. Id., at 24. Because the seal requirement was intended in main to Cite as: 580 U. S. 26 (2016) 35 Opinion of the Court protect the Government's interests, it would make little sense to adopt a rigid interpretation of the seal provision that prejudices the Government by depriving it of needed assistance from private parties. The Federal Government agrees with this interpretation. It informs the Court that petitioner's test \"would undermine the very governmental interests that the seal provision is meant to protect.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10. B Petitioner's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, petitioner urges that because the seal provision ap-pears in the subsection of the FCA creating the relator's private right of action, Congress intended to condition the right to bring suit on compliance with the seal requirement. It is true that, as discussed further below, the Court some-times has concluded that Congress conditioned the authority to fle a private right of action on compliance with a statutory mandate. E. g., Hallstrom v. Tillamook County , 493 U. S. 20, 25-26 (1989). There is no textual indication, however, that Congress did so here. Section 3730(b)(2) does not tie the seal requirement to the right to bring the qui tam suit in conditional terms. As noted above, the statute just provides: \"The complaint shall be fled in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\" The text at issue in Hallstrom, by contrast, was quite dif- ferent from the statutory language that controls here. The Hallstrom statute, part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, provided: \" `No action may be com-menced . . . prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the violation' \" to the Government. 493 U. S., at 25. Petitioner cites two additional cases to support its ar- gument, but those decisions concerned statutes that used even clearer conditional words, like \"if\" and \"unless.\" See 36 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Opinion of the Court United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, 233 U. S. 157, 161 (1914) (statute allowed creditors of Govern- ment contractors to bring suit \" `if no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and fnal settlement of said contract' \"); McNeil v. United States, 508 U. S. 106, 107, n. 1 (1993) (statute provided that \" `[a]n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages . . . unless the claimant shall have frst presented the claim to the appropriate Fed-eral agency' \"). Again, the FCA's structure shows that Congress knew how to draft the kind of statutory language that petitioner seeks to read into \u00a7 3730(b)(2). The applicable version of the public disclosure bar, for example, requires a district court to dismiss an action when the underlying information has already been made available to the public, \" `unless' \" the plaintiff is the Attorney General or an original source. Gra- ham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S., at 286. Second, petitioner contends that because this Court has described the FCA's qui tam provisions as \"effecting a par- tial assignment of the Government's damages claim,\" Ver- mont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S., at 773, adherence to all of the FCA's man-datory requirements\u2014no matter how small\u2014is a condition of the assignment. This argument fails for the same reason as the one discussed above: Petitioner can show no textual indication in the statute suggesting that the relator's ability to bring suit depends on adherence to the seal requirement. Third, petitioner points to a few stray sentences in the Senate Committee Report that it claims support the man-datory dismissal rule. As explained above, however, the Report's recitation of the general purpose of the statute is best understood to support respondents. Supra, at 34-35. And, furthermore, because the meaning of the FCA's text and structure is \"plain and unambiguous, we need not accept Cite as: 580 U. S. 26 (2016) 37 Opinion of the Court petitioner['s] invitation to consider the legislative history.\" Whitfeld v. United States, 543 U. S. 209, 215 (2005). III Petitioner's secondary argument is that the District Court did not consider the proper factors when declining to dismiss respondents' complaint or, at a minimum, that it was plain error not to consider respondents' conduct after the seal was lifted in part. This Court holds the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioner's motion, much less commit plain error. In light of the questionable conduct of respondents' prior attorney, it well may not have been reversible error had the District Court granted the motion; that possibility, however, need not be considered here. In general, the question whether dismissal is appropriate should be left to the sound discretion of the district court. While the factors articulated in United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co. appear to be appropriate, it is unnec- essary to explore these and other relevant considerations. These standards can be discussed in the course of later cases. IV Petitioner and its amici place great emphasis on the repu- tational harm FCA defendants may suffer when the seal re-quirement is violated. But even if every seal violation does not mandate dismissal, that sanction remains a possible form of relief. District courts have inherent power, moreover, to impose sanctions short of dismissal for violations of court orders. See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 43-46 (1991). Remedial tools like monetary penalties or attorney discipline remain available to punish and deter seal violations even when dismissal is not appropriate. Of note in this case, petitioner did not request any sanction other than dismissal. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 17. Had peti-tioner sought some lesser sanctions, the District Court might have taken a different course. Yet petitioner failed 38 STATE FARM FIRE & CASUALTY CO. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. RIGSBY Opinion of the Court to do so. On this record, the question whether a lesser sanc- tion is warranted is not preserved. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is Affrmed. OCTOBER TERM, 2016 39 Syllabus SALMAN v. UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 15-628. Argued October 5, 2016\u2014Decided December 6, 2016 Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5 prohibit undisclosed trading on inside corporate information by persons bound by a duty of trust and confdence not to exploit that information for their personal advantage. These persons are also forbidden from tipping inside information to oth-ers for trading. A tippee who receives such information with the knowledge that its disclosure breached the tipper's duty acquires that duty and may be liable for securities fraud for any undisclosed trading on the information. In Dirks v. SEC , 463 U. S. 646, this Court ex- plained that tippee liability hinges on whether the tipper's disclosure breaches a fduciary duty, which occurs when the tipper discloses the information for a personal beneft. The Court also held that a personal beneft may be inferred where the tipper receives something of value in exchange for the tip or \"makes a gift of confdential information to a trading relative or friend.\" Id., at 664. Petitioner Salman was indicted for federal securities-fraud crimes for trading on inside information he received from a friend and relative-by-marriage, Michael Kara, who, in turn, received the information from his brother, Maher Kara, a former investment banker at Citigroup. Maher testifed at Salman's trial that he shared inside information with his brother Michael to beneft him and expected him to trade on it, and Michael testifed to sharing that information with Salman, who knew that it was from Maher. Salman was convicted. While Salman's appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, the Second Circuit decided that Dirks does not permit a factfnder to infer a per- sonal beneft to the tipper from a gift of confdential information to a trading relative or friend, unless there is \"proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship\" between tipper and tippee \"that generates an ex-change that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a poten-tial gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature,\" United States v. Newman, 773 F. 3d 438, 452, cert. denied, 577 U. S. 874. The Ninth Circuit declined to follow Newman so far, holding that Dirks allowed Salman's jury to infer that the tipper breached a duty because he made \" `a gift of confdential information to a trading relative.' \" 792 F. 3d 1087, 1092 (quoting Dirks, supra, at 664). 40 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Syllabus Held: The Ninth Circuit properly applied Dirks to affrm Salman's convic- tion. Under Dirks, the jury could infer that the tipper here personally benefted from making a gift of confdential information to a trading relative. Pp. 46-52. (a) Salman contends that a gift of confdential information to a friend or family member alone is insuffcient to establish the personal beneft required for tippee liability, claiming that a tipper does not personally beneft unless the tipper's goal in disclosing information is to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value. The Government counters that a gift of confdential information to anyone, not just a \"trading relative or friend,\" is enough to prove securities fraud because a tipper personally benefts through any disclosure of confdential trad-ing information for a personal (noncorporate) purpose. The Govern-ment argues that any concerns raised by permitting such an inference are signifcantly alleviated by other statutory elements prosecutors must satisfy. Pp. 46-48. (b) This Court adheres to the holding in Dirks, which easily resolves the case at hand: \"[W]hen an insider makes a gift of confdential infor-mation to a trading relative or friend . . . [t]he tip and trade resemble trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profts to the recipient,\" 463 U. S., at 664. In these situations, the tipper personally benefts because giving a gift of trading information to a trading relative is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds. Here, by disclosing confdential information as a gift to his brother with the expectation that he would trade on it, Maher breached his duty of trust and confdence to Citigroup and its clients\u2014a duty acquired and breached by Salman when he traded on the information with full knowledge that it had been improperly disclosed. To the extent that the Second Circuit in Newman held that the tipper must also receive something of a \"pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\" in exchange for a gift to a trading relative, that rule is inconsistent with Dirks. Pp. 48-50. (c) Salman's arguments to the contrary are rejected. Salman has cited nothing in this Court's precedents that undermines the gift-giving principle this Court announced in Dirks. Nor has he demonstrated that either \u00a7 10(b) itself or Dirks' s gift-giving standard \"leav[e] grave uncer- tainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\" or are plagued by \"hopeless indeterminacy.\" Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. 591, 597, 598. Salman also has shown \"no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty that would trigger\" the rule of lenity. Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 492 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, his conduct is in the heartland of Dirks's rule concerning gifts of confdential informa- tion to trading Pp. 50-52. 792 F. 3d 1087, affrmed. Cite as: 580 U.

These persons also may not tip inside information to oth- ers for trading. The tippee acquires the tipper's duty to disclose or abstain from trading if the tippee knows the infor-mation was disclosed in breach of the tipper's duty, and the tippee may commit securities fraud by trading in disregard of that knowledge. In Dirks v. SEC , 463 U. S. 646 (1983), this Court explained that a tippee's liability for trading on inside information hinges on whether the tipper breached a fduciary duty by disclosing the information. A tipper breaches such a fduciary duty, we held, when the tipper dis-closes the inside information for a personal beneft. And, we went on to say, a jury can infer a personal beneft\u2014and thus a breach of the tipper's duty\u2014where the tipper receives something of value in exchange for the tip or \"makes a gift of confdential information to a trading relative or friend.\" Id., at 664. Petitioner Bassam Salman challenges his convictions for conspiracy and insider trading. Salman received lucrative trading tips from an extended family member, who had received the information from Salman's brother-in-law. Sal-man then traded on the information. He argues that he can-not be held liable as a tippee because the tipper (his brother-in-law) did not personally receive money or property in exchange for the tips and thus did not personally beneft from them. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that Dirks allowed the jury to infer that the tipper here breached a duty because he made a \" `gift of confdential information to a trading relative.' \" 792 F. 3d 1087, 1092 (CA9 2015) (quoting Dirks, supra, at 664). Because the Court of Ap- peals properly applied Dirks, we affrm the judgment below. Cite as: 580 U. S. 39 (2016) 43 Opinion of the Court I Maher Kara was an investment banker in Citigroup's healthcare investment banking group. He dealt with highly confdential information about mergers and acquisitions in-volving Citigroup's clients. Maher enjoyed a close relation-ship with his older brother, Mounir Kara (known as Michael). After Maher started at Citigroup, he began discussing as-pects of his job with Michael. At frst he relied on Michael's chemistry background to help him grasp scientifc concepts relevant to his new job. Then, while their father was bat-tling cancer, the brothers discussed companies that dealt with innovative cancer treatment and pain management techniques. Michael began to trade on the information Maher shared with him. At frst, Maher was unaware of his brother's trading activity, but eventually he began to suspect that it was taking place. Ultimately, Maher began to assist Michael's trading by sharing inside information with his brother about pending mergers and acquisitions. Maher sometimes used code words to communicate corporate information to his brother. Other times, he shared inside information about deals he was not working on in order to avoid detection. See, e. g., App. 118, 124-125. Without his younger brother's knowledge, Michael fed the information to others\u2014including Salman, Mi-chael's friend and Maher's brother-in-law. By the time the authorities caught on, Salman had made over $1.5 million in profts that he split with another relative who executed trades via a brokerage account on Salman's behalf. Salman was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 371, and four counts of secu-rities fraud, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78ff; U. S. C. \u00a7 2; 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5. Facing charges of their own, both Maher and Michael pleaded guilty and testifed at Salman's trial. The evidence at trial established that Maher and Michael enjoyed a \"very close relationship.\" App. 215. Maher \"love[d] [his] brother very much,\" Michael was like \"a second 44 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court father to Maher,\" and Michael was the best man at Maher's wedding to Salman's sister. Id., at 158, 195, 104-107. Maher testifed that he shared inside information with his brother to beneft him and with the expectation that his brother would trade on it. While Maher explained that he disclosed the information in large part to appease Mi-chael (who pestered him incessantly for it), he also testi-fed that he tipped his brother to \"help him\" and to \"fulfl[l] whatever needs he had.\" Id., at 118, 82. For instance, Mi- chael once called Maher and told him that \"he needed a favor.\" Id., at 124. Maher offered his brother money but Michael asked for information instead. Maher then dis-closed an upcoming acquisition. Ibid. Although he in- stantly regretted the tip and called his brother back to im-plore him not to trade, Maher expected his brother to do so anyway. Id., at 125. For his part, Michael told the jury that his brother's tips gave him \"timely information that the average person does not have access to\" and \"access to stocks, options, and what have you, that I can capitalize on, that the average person would never have or dream of.\" Id., at 251. Michael testi- fed that he became friends with Salman when Maher was courting Salman's sister and later began sharing Maher's tips with Salman. As he explained at trial, \"any time a major deal came in, [Salman] was the frst on my phone list.\" Id., at 258. Michael also testifed that he told Salman that the information was coming from Maher. See, e. g., id., at 286 (\" `Maher is the source of all this information' \"). After a jury trial in the Northern District of California, Salman was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised re-lease, and over $730,000 in restitution. After his motion for a new trial was denied, Salman appealed to the Ninth Cir-cuit. While his appeal was pending, the Second Circuit is-sued its opinion in United States v. Newman, 773 F. 3d 438 (2014), cert. denied, 577 U. S. 874 (2015). There, the Second Circuit reversed the convictions of two portfolio managers Cite as: 580 U. S. 39 (2016) 45 Opinion of the Court who traded on inside information. The Newman defendants were \"several steps removed from the corporate insiders\" and the court found that \"there was no evidence that either was aware of the source of the inside information.\" 773 F. 3d, at 443. The court acknowledged that Dirks and Sec- ond Circuit case law allow a factfnder to infer a personal beneft to the tipper from a gift of confdential information to a trading relative or friend. 773 F. 3d, at 452. But the court concluded that, \"[t]o the extent\" Dirks permits \"such an inference,\" the inference \"is impermissible in the absence of proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential, and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or simi-larly valuable nature.\" 773 F. 3d, at 452. 1 Pointing to Newman, Salman argued that his conviction should be reversed. While the evidence established that Maher made a gift of trading information to Michael and that Salman knew it, there was no evidence that Maher received anything of \"a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\" in ex-change\u2014or that Salman knew of any such beneft. The Ninth Circuit disagreed and affrmed Salman's conviction. 792 F. 3d 1087. The court reasoned that the case was gov-erned by Dirks's holding that a tipper benefts personally by making a gift of confdential information to a trading relative or friend. Indeed, Maher's disclosures to Michael were \"precisely the gift of confdential information to a trading relative that Dirks envisioned.\" 792 F. 3d, at 1092 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Newman went further and required additional gain to the tipper in cases involving gifts of confdential information to family and friends, the Ninth Circuit \"decline[d] to follow it.\" 792 F. 3d, at 1093. 1 The Second Circuit also reversed the Newman defendants' convictions because the Government introduced no evidence that the defendants knew the information they traded on came from insiders or that the insiders received a personal beneft in exchange for the tips. 773 F. 3d, at 453- 454. This case does not implicate those issues. 46 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court We granted certiorari to resolve the tension between the Second Circuit's Newman decision and the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case.2 577 U. S. 1101 (2016). II A In this case, Salman contends that an insider's \"gift of con- fdential information to a trading relative or friend,\" Dirks, 463 U. S., at 664, is not enough to establish securities fraud. Instead, Salman argues, a tipper does not personally beneft unless the tipper's goal in disclosing inside information is to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value. He claims that our insider-trading precedents, and the cases those precedents cite, involve situations in which the insider exploited confdential information for the insider's own \"tan-gible monetary proft.\" Brief for Petitioner 31. He sug-gests that his position is reinforced by our criminal-fraud precedents outside of the insider-trading context, because those cases confrm that a fraudster must personally obtain 2 Dirks v. SEC , 463 U. S. 646 (1983), established the personal-beneft framework in a case brought under the classical theory of insider-trading liability, which applies \"when a corporate insider\" or his tippee \"trades in the securities of [the tipper's] corporation on the basis of material, nonpub-lic information.\" United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651-652 (1997). In such a case, the defendant breaches a duty to, and takes advantage of, the shareholders of his corporation. By contrast, the misappropriation theory holds that a person commits securities fraud \"when he misappropri-ates confdential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information\" such as an employer or client. Id., at 652. In such a case, the defendant breaches a duty to, and defrauds, the source of the information, as opposed to the shareholders of his corporation. The Court of Appeals observed that this is a misappro-priation case, 792 F. 3d, 1087, 1092, n. 4 (CA9 2015), while the Government represents that both theories apply on the facts of this case, Brief for United States 15, n. 1. We need not resolve the question. The parties do not dispute that Dirks's personal-beneft analysis applies in both classi- cal and misappropriation cases, so we will proceed on the assumption that it does. Cite as: 580 U. S. 39 (2016) 47 Opinion of the Court money or property. Id., at 33-34. More broadly, Salman urges that defning a gift as a personal beneft renders the insider-trading offense indeterminate and overbroad: inde-terminate, because liability may turn on facts such as the closeness of the relationship between tipper and tippee and the tipper's purpose for disclosure; and overbroad, because the Government may avoid having to prove a concrete per-sonal beneft by simply arguing that the tipper meant to give a gift to the tippee. He also argues that we should interpret Dirks's standard narrowly so as to avoid constitutional con-cerns. Brief for Petitioner 36-37. Finally, Salman con- tends that gift situations create especially troubling prob-lems for remote tippees\u2014that is, tippees who receive inside information from another tippee, rather than the tipper\u2014 who may have no knowledge of the relationship between the original tipper and tippee and thus may not know why the tipper made the disclosure. Id., at 43, 48, 50. The Government disagrees and argues that a gift of con- fdential information to anyone, not just a \"trading relative or friend,\" is enough to prove securities fraud. See Brief for United States 27 (\"Dirks's personal-beneft test encom-passes a gift to any person with the expectation that the information will be used for trading, not just to a `trading relative or friend' \" (quoting 463 U. S., at 664; emphasis in original)). Under the Government's view, a tipper person-ally benefts whenever the tipper discloses confdential trad-ing information for a noncorporate purpose. Accordingly, a gift to a friend, a family member, or anyone else would sup-port the inference that the tipper exploited the trading value of inside information for personal purposes and thus person-ally benefted from the disclosure. The Government claims to fnd support for this reading in Dirks and the precedents on which Dirks relied. See, e. g., id., at 654 (\"fraud\" in an insider-trading case \"derives from the `inherent unfairness involved where one takes advantage' of `information in-tended to be available only for a corporate purpose and not 48 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court for the personal beneft of anyone' \" (quoting In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 43 S. E. C. 933, 936 (1968))). The Government also argues that Salman's concerns about unlimited and indeterminate liability for remote tippees are signifcantly alleviated by other statutory elements that prosecutors must satisfy to convict a tippee for insider trad-ing. The Government observes that, in order to establish a defendant's criminal liability as a tippee, it must prove be-yond a reasonable doubt that the tipper expected that the information being disclosed would be used in securities trad-ing. Brief for United States 23-24; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. The Government also notes that, to establish a defendant's criminal liability as a tippee, it must prove that the tippee knew that the tipper breached a duty\u2014in other words, that the tippee knew that the tipper disclosed the information for a personal beneft and that the tipper expected trading to ensue. Brief for United States 43; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37, 39. B We adhere to Dirks, which easily resolves the narrow issue presented here. In Dirks, we explained that a tippee is exposed to liability for trading on inside information only if the tippee partici-pates in a breach of the tipper's fduciary duty. Whether the tipper breached that duty depends \"in large part on the purpose of the disclosure\" to the tippee. 463 U. S., at 662. \"[T]he test,\" we explained, \"is whether the insider person-ally will beneft, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure.\" Ibid. Thus, the disclosure of confdential information with- out personal beneft is not enough. In determining whether a tipper derived a personal beneft, we instructed courts to \"focus on objective criteria, i. e., whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal beneft from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational beneft that will trans-late into future earnings.\" Id., at 663. This personal bene-Cite as: 580 U. S. 39 (2016) 49 Opinion of the Court ft can \"often\" be inferred from \"objective facts and circum- stances,\" we explained, such as \"a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a quid pro quo from the latter, or an intention to beneft the particular recipient.\" Id., at 664. In particular, we held that \"[t]he elements of fduciary duty and exploitation of nonpublic information also exist when an insider makes a gift of confdential infor- mation to a trading relative or friend.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). In such cases, \"[t]he tip and trade resemble trading by the insider . . . followed by a gift of the profts to the recipient.\" Ibid. We then applied this gift-giving principle to resolve Dirks itself, fnding it dispositive that the tippers \"received no monetary or personal beneft\" from their tips to Dirks, \"nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable information to Dirks.\" Id., at 667 (emphasis added). Our discussion of gift giving resolves this case. Maher, the tipper, provided inside information to a close relative, his brother Michael. Dirks makes clear that a tipper breaches a fduciary duty by making a gift of confdential information to \"a trading relative,\" and that rule is suffcient to resolve the case at hand. As Salman's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Maher would have breached his duty had he per-sonally traded on the information here himself then given the proceeds as a gift to his brother. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4. It is obvious that Maher would personally beneft in that situation. But Maher effectively achieved the same result by disclosing the information to Michael, and allowing him to trade on it. Dirks appropriately prohibits that approach, as well. Cf. 463 U. S., at 659 (holding that \"insiders [are] forbidden\" both \"from personally using undisclosed corpo-rate information to their advantage\" and from \"giv[ing] such information to an outsider for the same improper purpose of exploiting the information for their personal gain\"). Dirks specifes that when a tipper gives inside information to \"a trading relative or friend,\" the jury can infer that the tipper meant to provide the equivalent of a cash gift. In such situ-50 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court ations, the tipper benefts personally because giving a gift of trading information is the same thing as trading by the tip-per followed by a gift of the proceeds. Here, by disclosing confdential information as a gift to his brother with the ex-pectation that he would trade on it, Maher breached his duty of trust and confdence to Citigroup and its clients\u2014a duty Salman acquired, and breached himself, by trading on the information with full knowledge that it had been improp-erly disclosed. To the extent the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also receive something of a \"pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\" in exchange for a gift to family or friends, Newman, 773 F. 3d, at 452, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that this requirement is inconsistent with Dirks. C Salman points out that many insider-trading cases\u2014in- cluding several that Dirks cited\u2014involved insiders who per- sonally profted through the misuse of trading information. But this observation does not undermine the test Dirks ar- ticulated and applied. Salman also cites a sampling of our criminal-fraud decisions construing other federal fraud stat-utes, suggesting that they stand for the proposition that fraud is not consummated unless the defendant obtains money or property. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. 729 (2013) (Hobbs Act); Skilling v. United States, 561 U. S. 358 (2010) (honest-services mail and wire fraud); Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12 (2000) (wire fraud); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987) (mail fraud). Assuming that these cases are relevant to our construction of \u00a7 10(b) (a proposition the Government forcefully disputes), nothing in them undermines the commonsense point we made in Dirks. Making a gift of inside information to a relative like Michael is little different from trading on the information, obtaining the profts, and doling them out to the trading relative. The tipper benefts either way. The facts of this case illustrate Cite as: 580 U. S. 39 (2016) 51 Opinion of the Court the point: In one of their tipper-tippee interactions, Michael asked Maher for a favor, declined Maher's offer of money, and instead requested and received lucrative trading information. We reject Salman's argument that Dirks's gift-giving standard is unconstitutionally vague as applied to this case. Dirks created a simple and clear \"guiding principle\" for de- termining tippee liability, 463 U. S., at 664, and Salman has not demonstrated that either \u00a7 10(b) itself or the Dirks gift- giving standard \"leav[e] grave uncertainty about how to esti-mate the risk posed by a crime\" or are plagued by \"hopeless indeterminacy,\" Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. 591, 597, 598 (2015). At most, Salman shows that in some factual circumstances assessing liability for gift giving will be diff-cult. That alone cannot render \"shapeless\" a federal crimi-nal prohibition, for even clear rules \"produce close cases.\" Id., at 602, 601. We also reject Salman's appeal to the rule of lenity, as he has shown \"no grievous ambiguity or uncer-tainty that would trigger the rule's application.\" Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 492 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, Salman's conduct is in the heart-land of Dirks's rule concerning gifts. It remains the case that \"[d]etermining whether an insider personally benefts from a particular disclosure, a question of fact, will not al-ways be easy for courts.\" 463 U. S., at 664. But there is no need for us to address those diffcult cases today, because this case involves \"precisely the `gift of confdential informa-tion to a trading relative' that Dirks envisioned.\" 792 F. 3d, at 1092 (quoting 463 U. S., at 664). III Salman's jury was properly instructed that a personal ben- eft includes \"the beneft one would obtain from simply mak-ing a gift of confdential information to a trading relative.\" App. 398-399. As the Court of Appeals noted, \"the Govern-ment presented direct evidence that the disclosure was in-tended as a gift of market-sensitive information.\" 792 F. 3d, 52 SALMAN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court at 1094. And, as Salman conceded below, this evidence is suffcient to sustain his conviction under our reading of Dirks . Appellant's Supplemental Brief in No. 14-10204 (CA9), p. 6 (\"Maher made a gift of confdential information to a trading relative [Michael] . . . and, if [Michael's] testimony is accepted as true (as it must be for purposes of suffciency review), Salman knew that Maher had made such a gift\" (in-ternal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted)). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit's judgment is affrmed. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2016 53 Syllabus SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., et al. v. APPLE INC. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit No. 15-777. Argued October 11, 2016\u2014Decided December 6, 2016 Section 289 of the Patent Act makes it unlawful to manufacture or sell an \"article of manufacture\" to which a patented design or a colorable imita- tion thereof has been applied and makes an infringer liable to the patent holder \"to the extent of his total proft.\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 289. As relevant here, a jury found that various smartphones manufactured by petition-ers (collectively, Samsung) infringed design patents owned by respond-ent Apple Inc. that covered a rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen. Apple was awarded $399 million in damages\u2014Samsung's entire proft from the sale of its infring-ing smartphones. The Federal Circuit affrmed the damages award, re-jecting Samsung's argument that damages should be limited because the relevant articles of manufacture were the front face or screen rather than the entire smartphone. The court reasoned that such a limit was not required because the components of Samsung's smartphones were not sold separately to ordinary consumers and thus were not distinct articles of manufacture. Held: In the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant \"article of manufacture\" for arriving at a \u00a7 289 damages award need not be the end product sold to the consumer but may be only a component of that prod- uct. Pp. 58-62. (a) The statutory text resolves the issue here. An \"article of manu- facture,\" which is simply a thing made by hand or machine, encompasses both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product. This reading is consistent with \u00a7 171(a) of the Patent Act, which makes certain \"design[s] for an article of manufacture\" eligible for design pat-ent protection, and which has been understood by the Patent Offce and the courts to permit a design patent that extends to only a component of a multicomponent product, see, e. g., Ex parte Adams, 84 Off. Gaz. Pat. Offce 311; Application of Zahn, 617 F. 2d 261, 268 (CCPA). This reading is also consistent with the Court's reading of the term \"manufac-ture\" in \u00a7 101, which \"any new and useful . . . manufacture\" eligi-ble patent protection. See Chakrabarty , 447 U. S. 303, 308. Pp. 58-61. 54 SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. v. APPLE INC. Syllabus (b) Because the term \"article of manufacture\" is broad enough to em- brace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that prod- uct, whether sold separately or not, the Federal Circuit's narrower read-ing cannot be squared with \u00a7 289's text. Absent adequate briefng by the parties, this Court declines to resolve whether the relevant article of manufacture for each design patent at issue here is the smartphone or a particular smartphone component. Doing so is not necessary to resolve the question presented, and the Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand. Pp. 61-62. 786 F. 3d 983, reversed and remanded.

Section 289 of the Patent Act provides a damages remedy specifc to design patent infringement. A person who manu- factures or sells \"any article of manufacture to which [a pat-ented] design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total proft.\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 289. In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the \"article of manufacture\" to which the design has been applied. In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the \"article of manufacture\" to which the design has been applied is a more diffcult task. This case involves the infringement of designs for smart- phones. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fed-eral Circuit identifed the entire smartphone as the only permissible \"article of manufacture\" for the purpose of calculating \u00a7 289 damages because consumers could not sepa-rately purchase components of the smartphones. The ques-tion before us is whether that reading is consistent with \u00a7 289. We hold that it is not.

Opinion of the Court signs. See Patent Act of 1842, \u00a7 3, 5 Stat. 543-544. Patent protection is available for a \"new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 171(a). A patentable design \"gives a peculiar or distinctive appear-ance to the manufacture, or article to which it may be ap-plied, or to which it gives form.\" Gorham Co. v. White , 14 Wall. 511, 525 (1872). This Court has explained that a de-sign patent is infringed \"if, in the eye of an ordinary ob-server, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, two designs are substantially the same.\" Id., at 528. In 1885, this Court limited the damages available for de- sign patent infringement. The statute in effect at the time allowed a holder of a design patent to recover \"the actual damages sustained\" from infringement. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4919. In Dobson v. Hartford Carpet Co., 114 U. S. 439 (1885), the lower courts had awarded the holders of design patents on carpets damages in the amount of \"the entire proft to the [patent holders], per yard, in the manufacture and sale of carpets of the patented designs, and not merely the value which the designs contributed to the carpets.\" Id., at 443. This Court reversed the damages award and construed the statute to require proof that the profts were \"due to\" the design rather than other aspects of the carpets. Id., at 444; see also Dobson v. Dornan, 118 U. S. 10, 17 (1886) (\"The plaintiff must show what profts or damages are attributable to the use of the infringing design\"). In 1887, in response to the Dobson cases, Congress enacted a specifc damages remedy for design patent infringement. See S. Rep. No. 206, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1886); Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1886). The new provision made it unlawful to manufacture or sell an article of manufacture to which a patented design or a colorable imitation thereof had been applied. An act to amend the law relating to patents, trademarks, and copyright, \u00a7 1, 24 Jeanine Hayes; and for the Industrial Designers Society of America by Robert S. Katz. Cite as: 580 U. S. 53 (2016) 57 Opinion of the Court Stat. 387. It went on to make a design patent infringer \"lia- ble in the amount of\" $250 or \"the total proft made by him from the manufacture or sale . . . of the article or articles to which the design, or colorable imitation thereof, has been applied.\" Ibid. The Patent Act of 1952 codifed this provision in \u00a7 289. 66 Stat. 813. That codifed language now reads, in relevant part: \"Whoever during the term of a patent for a design, with-out license of the owner, (1) applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of man-ufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total proft, but not less than $250 . . . .\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 289. B Apple Inc. released its frst-generation iPhone in 2007. The iPhone is a smartphone, a \"cell phone with a broad range of other functions based on advanced computing capability, large storage capacity, and Internet connectivity.\" Riley v. California, 573 U. S. 373, 379 (2014). Apple secured many design patents in connection with the release. Among those patents were the D618,677 patent, covering a black rectangu-lar front face with rounded corners, the D593,087 patent, cov-ering a rectangular front face with rounded corners and a raised rim, and the D604,305 patent, covering a grid of 16 colorful icons on a black screen. App. 530-578. Samsung Electronics Co., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., and Samsung Telecommunications America, LLC (col-lectively, Samsung), also manufacture smartphones. After Apple released its iPhone, Samsung released a series of smartphones that resembled the iPhone. Id., at 357-358. Apple sued Samsung in 2011, alleging, as relevant here, that various Samsung smartphones infringed Apple's 58 SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. v. APPLE INC. Opinion of the Court D593,087, D618,677, and D604,305 design patents. A jury found that several Samsung smartphones did infringe those patents. See id., at 273-276. All told, Apple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung's design patent in-fringement, the entire proft Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones. See id., at 277-280, 348-350. The Federal Circuit affrmed the design patent infringe- ment damages award. 1 In doing so, it rejected Samsung's argument \"that the profts awarded should have been limited to the infringing `article of manufacture' \"\u2014for example, the screen or case of the smartphone\u2014\"not the entire infringing product\"\u2014the smartphone. 786 F. 3d 983, 1002 (2015). It reasoned that \"limit[ing] the damages\" award was not re-quired because the \"innards of Samsung's smartphones were not sold separately from their shells as distinct articles of manufacture to ordinary purchasers.\" Ibid. We granted certiorari, 577 U. S. 1215 (2016), and now re- verse and remand. II Section 289 allows a patent holder to recover the total proft an infringer makes from the infringement. It does so by frst prohibiting the unlicensed \"appli[cation]\" of a \"pat-ented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any arti-cle of manufacture for the purpose of sale\" or the unlicensed sale or exposure to sale of \"any article of manufacture to which [a patented] design or colorable imitation has been ap-plied.\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 289. It then makes a person who vio-lates that prohibition \"liable to the owner to the extent of his total proft, but not less than $250.\" Ibid. \"Total,\" of 1 Samsung raised a host of challenges on appeal related to other claims in the litigation between Apple and Samsung. The Federal Circuit af- frmed in part\u2014with respect to the design patent infringement fnding, the validity of two utility patent claims, and the design and utility patent infringement damages awards\u2014and reversed and remanded in part\u2014with respect to trade dress dilution. Only the design patent infringement award is at issue here. Cite as: 580 U. S. 53 (2016) 59 Opinion of the Court course, means all. See American Heritage Dictionary 1836 (5th ed. 2011) (\"[t]he whole amount of something; the en-tirety\"). The \"total proft\" for which \u00a7 289 makes an in-fringer liable is thus all of the proft made from the prohib-ited conduct, that is, from the manufacture or sale of the \"article of manufacture to which [the patented] design or col-orable imitation has been applied.\" Arriving at a damages award under \u00a7 289 thus involves two steps. First, identify the \"article of manufacture\" to which the infringed design has been applied. Second, cal-culate the infringer's total proft made on that article of manufacture. This case requires us to address a threshold matter: the scope of the term \"article of manufacture.\" The only ques-tion we resolve today is whether, in the case of a multicom-ponent product, the relevant \"article of manufacture\" must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product. Under the former interpretation, a patent holder will always be entitled to the infringer's total proft from the end product. Under the lat-ter interpretation, a patent holder will sometimes be entitled to the infringer's total proft from a component of the end product. 2 A The text resolves this case. The term \"article of manufac- ture,\" as used in \u00a7 289, encompasses both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product. \"Article of manufacture\" has a broad meaning. An \"arti- cle\" is just \"a particular thing.\" J. Stormonth, A Dictionary of the English Language 53 (1885) (Stormonth); see also 2 In its petition for certiorari and in its briefng, Samsung challenged the decision below on a second ground. It argued that 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 289 con- tains a causation requirement, which limits a \u00a7 289 damages award to the total proft the infringer made because of the infringement. Samsung abandoned this theory at argument, and so we do not address it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. 60 SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. v. APPLE INC. Opinion of the Court American Heritage Dictionary, at 101 (\"[a]n individual thing or element of a class; a particular object or item\"). And \"manufacture\" means \"the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\" and \"the articles so made.\" Stormonth 589; see also American Heritage Dictionary, at 1070 (\"[t]he act, craft, or process of manufacturing products, especially on a large scale\" or \"[a] product that is manufactured\"). An article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine. So understood, the term \"article of manufacture\" is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product. A component of a product, no less than the product itself, is a thing made by hand or machine. That a component may be integrated into a larger product, in other words, does not put it outside the category of articles of manufacture. This reading of article of manufacture in \u00a7 289 is consistent with 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 171(a), which makes \"new, original and or-namental design[s] for an article of manufacture\" eligible for design patent protection. 3 The Patent Offce and the courts have understood \u00a7 171 to permit a design patent for a design extending to only a component of a multicomponent product. See, e. g., Ex parte Adams, 84 Off. Gaz. Pat. Offce 311 (1898) (\"The several articles of manufacture of peculiar shape which when combined produce a machine or structure having mov-able parts may each separately be patented as a design . . . \"); Application of Zahn, 617 F. 2d 261, 268 (CCPA 1980) (\"Sec- 3 As originally enacted, the provision protected \"any new and original design for a manufacture.\" \u00a7 3, 5 Stat. 544. The provision listed exam- ples, including a design \"worked into or worked on, or printed or painted or cast or otherwise fxed on, any article of manufacture\" and a \"shape or confguration of any article of manufacture.\" Ibid. A streamlined ver- sion enacted in 1902 protected \"any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.\" Ch. 783, 32 Stat. 193. The Patent Act of 1952 retained that language. See \u00a7 171, 66 Stat. 813. Cite as: 580 U. S. 53 (2016) 61 Opinion of the Court tion 171 authorizes patents on ornamental designs for arti- cles of manufacture. While the design must be embodied in some articles, the statute is not limited to designs for com-plete articles, or `discrete' articles, and certainly not to arti-cles separately sold . . . \"). This reading is also consistent with 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 101, which makes \"any new and useful . . . manufacture . . . or any new and useful improvement thereof\" eligible for utility patent protection. Cf. 8 D. Chisum, Patents \u00a7 23.03[2], pp. 23-12 manufacture\" in \u00a7 171 includes \"what would be considered a `manufacture' within the meaning of Section 101\"). \"[T]his Court has read the term `manufacture' in \u00a7 101 . . . to mean `the production of articles for use from raw or prepared materials by giving to these materials new forms, qualities, properties, or combina-tions, whether by hand-labor or by machinery.' \" Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 447 U. S. 303, 308 (1980) (quoting American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co., 283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)). The broad term includes \"the parts of a machine considered separately from the machine itself.\" 1 W. Robinson, The Law of Patents for Useful Inventions \u00a7 183, p. 270 (1890). B The Federal Circuit's narrower reading of \"article of manu- facture\" cannot be squared with the text of \u00a7 289. The Fed-eral Circuit found that components of the infringing smart-phones could not be the relevant article of manufacture because consumers could not purchase those components separately from the smartphones. See 786 F. 3d, at 1002 (declining to limit a \u00a7 289 award to a component of the smart-phone because \"[t]he innards of Samsung's smartphones were not sold separately from their shells as distinct articles of manufacture to ordinary purchasers\"); see also Nordock, Inc. v. Systems Inc., 803 F. 3d 1344, 1355 (CA Fed. 2015) (declining to limit a \u00a7 289 award to a design for a \" `lip and hinge plate' \" because it was \"welded together\" with a leveler 62 SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. v. APPLE INC. Opinion of the Court and \"there was no evidence\" it was sold \"separate[ly] from the leveler as a complete unit\"). But, for the reasons given above, the term \"article of manufacture\" is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not. Thus, read-ing \"article of manufacture\" in \u00a7 289 to cover only an end product sold to a consumer gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase. The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smart-phone component. Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture at the frst step of the \u00a7 289 damages inquiry and to parse the rec-ord to apply that test in this case. The United States as amicus curiae suggested a test, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27-29, but Samsung and Apple did not brief the issue. We decline to lay out a test for the frst step of the \u00a7 289 damages inquiry in the absence of adequate briefng by the parties. Doing so is not necessary to resolve the question presented in this case, and the Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand. III The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2016 63 Syllabus SHAW v. UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 15-5991. Argued October 4, 2016\u2014Decided December 12, 2016 Petitioner Shaw used identifying numbers of a bank account belonging to bank customer Hsu in a scheme to transfer funds from that account to accounts at other institutions from which Shaw was able to obtain Hsu's funds. Shaw was convicted of violating 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(1), which makes it a crime to \"knowingly execut[e] scheme . . . The Ninth Circuit affrmed. Held: 1. Subsection (1) of the bank fraud statute covers schemes to deprive a bank of money in a customer's deposit account. Shaw's arguments in favor of his claim that subsection (1) does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor, not a bank, are unpersuasive. First, the bank did have property rights in Hsu's bank deposits: When a customer deposits funds, the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds, which the bank has a right to use as a source of loans that help the bank earn profts. Sometimes, the contract between the cus-tomer and the bank provides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank only assumes possession; even then, the bank has a property interest in the funds because its role is akin to that of a bailee. Hence, for purposes of the bank fraud statute, a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor's account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a \"fnancial institution,\" at least where, as here, the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits, the funds obtained came from the deposit account, and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds. Second, Shaw may not have intended to cause the bank fnancial harm, but the statute, while insisting upon \"a scheme to defraud,\" demands neither a showing that the bank suffered ultimate fnancial loss nor a showing that the defendant intended to cause such loss. This Court has found no case that interprets the statute as Shaw does. Cf. Carpen- ter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19, 26. Third, that Shaw may have been ignorant of relevant bank-related property law is no defense to criminal prosecution for bank fraud. Shaw knew that the bank possessed Hsu's account, Shaw made false statements to the bank, Shaw believed that those false statements would lead the bank to release from that account funds that ultimately 64 SHAW v. UNITED STATES Syllabus and wrongfully ended up with Shaw, and the bank in fact possessed a property interest in the account. These facts are suffcient to show that Shaw knew that he was entering into a scheme to defraud the bank even if he was not aware of the niceties of bank-related property law. Cf. Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 355-356. Fourth, Shaw mistakenly contends that the statute requires the Gov- ernment to prove not just that he acted with the knowledge that he would likely harm the bank's property interest but also that such was his purpose. This Court has found no relevant authority supporting the view that a statute making criminal the \"knowin[g] execut[ion of] a scheme . . . to defraud\" requires something more than knowledge. Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 553 U. S. 662, 665- 668; Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 110-112; United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 343; and Bridges v. United States, 346 U. S. 209, 221-222, distinguished. Fifth, subsection (2) of the bank fraud statute, which makes criminal the use of \"false or fraudulent pretenses\" to obtain \"property . . . under the custody or control of\" a bank, may overlap with subsection (1), but it does not do so completely. Thus, it should not be read as excluding from subsection (1) applications that would otherwise fall within the scope of subsection (1), such as the conduct at issue in this case. See Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. 351, 358, n. 4. Finally, because the bank fraud statute is clear enough, the rule of lenity is not implicated. Pp. 66-72. 2. With regard to the parties' dispute over whether the District Court improperly instructed the jury that a scheme to defraud a bank must be one to deceive the bank or deprive it of something of value, instead of one to deceive and deprive, the Ninth Circuit is left to determine whether that question was properly presented and, if so, whether the instruction given is lawful, and, if not, whether any error was harmless in this case. P. 72. 781 F. 3d 1130, vacated and remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Koren L. Bell argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Hilary L. Potashner and James H. Locklin. Anthony A. Yang argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Ger-Cite as: 580 U. S. 63 (2016) 65 Opinion of the Court shengorn, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell, Deputy So- licitor General Dreeben, and Scott A. C. Meisler .* Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. A federal statute makes it a crime \"knowingly [to] exe- cut[e] institution,\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(1), for example, a federally insured bank, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 20. The petitioner, Lawrence Shaw, was convicted of violating this provision. He argues here that the provision does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor, not a bank. We do not accept his arguments. I The relevant criminal statute makes it a crime: \"knowingly [to] execut[e] fnancial institution; or \"(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a fnancial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\" \u00a7 1344. Shaw obtained the identifying numbers of a Bank of America account belonging to a bank customer, Stanley Hsu. Shaw used those numbers (and other related information) to trans-fer funds from Hsu's account to other accounts at other insti-tutions from which Shaw could obtain (and eventually did obtain) Hsu's funds. Shaw was convicted of violating the frst clause of the statute, namely, the prohibition against \"defraud[ing] a fnancial institution.\" The Ninth Circuit af-frmed his conviction. 781 F. 3d 1130 (2015). Shaw then fled a petition for certiorari arguing that the words \"scheme to defraud a fnancial institution\" require the Government to *A brief of amicus curiae was fled for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by John D. Cline and Jeffrey L. Fisher . 66 SHAW v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court prove that the defendant had \"a specifc intent not only to deceive, but also to cheat, a bank,\" rather than \"a non- bank third party.\" Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added). We granted review. II Shaw makes several related arguments in favor of his basic claim, namely, that the statute does not cover schemes to deprive a bank of customer deposits. First, he says that subsection (1) requires \"an intent to wrong a victim bank [a `fnancial institution'] in its property rights . . . .\" Brief for Petitioner 23. He adds that the property he took, money in Hsu's bank account, belonged to Hsu, the bank's customer, and that Hsu is not a \"fnancial institution.\" Id., at 25, 45. Hence Shaw's was a scheme \"designed\" to obtain only \"a bank property,\" not \"a bank's own property.\" Id., at 24-25. The basic faw in this argument lies in the fact that the bank, too, had property rights in Hsu's bank account. When a customer deposits funds, the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds and consequently has the right to use the funds as a source of loans that help the bank earn profts (though the customer retains the right, for example, to with-draw funds). 5A Michie, Banks and Banking, at 162; Phoenix Bank v. Risley , 111 U. S. 125, 127 (1884). Some- times, the contract between the customer and the bank pro-vides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank merely assumes possession. Michie, ch. 9, \u00a7 38, at 162; Phoenix Bank, supra, at 127. But even then the bank is like a bailee, say, a garage that stores a customer's car. Michie, ch. 9, \u00a7 38, at 162. And as bailee, the bank can assert the right to possess the deposited funds against all the world but for the bailor (or, say, the bailor's 685-686 (2009). This right, too, is a property right. 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 452-454 (1766) (referring to a bailee's Cite as: 580 U. S. 63 (2016) 67 Opinion of the Court right in a bailment as a \"special qualifed property\"). Thus, Shaw's scheme to cheat Hsu was also a scheme to deprive the bank of certain bank property rights. Hence, for purposes of the bank fraud statute, a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor's account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a \"fnancial institution,\" at least where, as here, the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits, the funds obtained came from the deposit account, and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds. Second, Shaw says he did not intend to cause the bank fnancial harm. Indeed, the parties appear to agree that, due to standard banking practices in place at the time of the fraud, no bank involved in the scheme ultimately suffered any monetary loss. Brief for Petitioner 4; Brief for United States 4, 27-28. But the statute, while insisting upon \"a scheme to defraud,\" demands neither a showing of ultimate fnancial loss nor a showing of intent to cause fnancial loss. Many years ago Judge Learned Hand pointed out that \"[a] man is none the less cheated out of his property, when he is induced to part with it by fraud,\" even if \"he gets a quid pro quo of equal value.\" United States v. Rowe , 56 F. 2d 747, 749 (CA2 1932). That is because \"[i]t may be impossible to measure his loss by the gross scales available to a court, but he has suffered a wrong; he has lost,\" for example, \"his chance to bargain with the facts before him.\" Ibid. Cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law 132 (1881) (\"[A] man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it to be false, but intending that the other should believe and act upon it\"); Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 21-25 (1999) (bank fraud statute's defnition of fraud refects the common law). It is consequently not surprising that, when interpreting the analogous mail fraud statute, we have held it \"suffcient\" that the victim (here, the bank) be \"deprived of its right\" to use of the property, even if it ultimately did not suffer 68 SHAW v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court unreimbursed loss. Carpenter v. United States, 484 U. S. 19, 26-27 (1987). Lower courts have explained that, where cash is taken from a bank \"but the bank [is] fully insured[,] [t]he theft [is] complete when the cash [i]s taken; the fact that the bank ha[s] a contract with an insurance company enabling it to shift the loss to that company [is] immaterial.\" United States v. Kucik, 844 F. 2d 493, 495 (CA7 1988). And com- mentators have made clear that \"on the criminal side, it is generally held that the lack of fnancial loss is no defense to false pretenses.\" 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 8.7(i)(3), p. 404 (1986). We have found no case from this Court interpreting the bank fraud statute as requiring that the victim bank ultimately suffer fnancial harm, or that the defendant intend that the victim bank suf-fer such harm. Third, Shaw appears to argue that, whatever the true state of property law, he did not know that the bank had a property interest in Hsu's account; hence he could not have intended to cheat the bank of its property. Shaw did know, however, that the bank possessed Hsu's account. He did make false statements to the bank. He did correctly believe that those false statements would lead the bank to release from that account funds that ultimately and wrongfully ended up in Shaw's pocket. And the bank did in fact possess a property interest in the account. These facts are suffcient to show that Shaw knew he was entering into a scheme to defraud the bank even if he was not aware of the niceties of bank-related property law. To require more, i. e., to require actual knowledge of those bank-related property-law nice-ties, would free (or convict) equally culpable defendants de-pending upon their property-law expertise\u2014an arbitrary re-sult. We have found no case from this Court requiring legal knowledge of the kind Shaw suggests he lacked. But we have found cases in roughly similar fraud-related contexts where this Court has asked only whether the targeted prop-erty was in fact property in the hands of the victim, not Cite as: 580 U. S. 63 (2016) 69 Opinion of the Court whether the defendant knew that the law would characterize the items at issue as \"property.\" See Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 355-356 (2005) (Canada's right to uncollected excise taxes on imported liquor counted as \"property\" for purposes of the wire fraud statute); Carpen- ter, supra, at 25-26 (a newspaper's interest in the confden- tiality of the contents and timing of a news column counted as property for the purposes of the mail and wire fraud stat-utes). We conclude that the legal ignorance that Shaw claims here is no defense to criminal prosecution for bank fraud. Fourth, Shaw argues that the bank fraud statute requires the Government to prove more than his simple knowledge that he would likely harm the bank's property interest; in his view, the Government must prove that such was his purpose. See Voisine v. United States, 579 U. S. 686, 691-692 (2016) (\"knowingly\" committing an assault requires an awareness \" `that [harm] is practically certain,' \" whereas \"purposefully\" committing an assault is \"to have that result as a `conscious object' \" (quoting ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.02(2)(a)-(b) (1962))). Shaw adds that his purpose was to take money from Hsu; taking property from the bank was not his purpose. But the statute itself makes criminal the \"knowin[g] exe- cut[ion of] a scheme . . . to defraud.\" (Emphasis added.) To hold that something other than knowledge is required would assume that Congress intended to distinguish, in re-spect to states of mind, between (1) the fraudulent scheme, and (2) its fraudulent elements. Why would Congress wish to do so? Shaw refers us to a number of cases involving fraud against the Government and points to language in those cases suggesting that the relevant statutes required that the defendant's purpose be to harm the statutorily pro-tected target and not a third party. Brief for Petitioner 25- 29. But in two of those cases, the fraudulent statement was made not to the Government but to the third party\u2014a cir-70 SHAW v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court cumstance not present here. See Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 553 U. S. 662, 665-668 (2008); Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 110-112 (1987). In the third, the relevant portion of the statute expressly re-quired a false statement \" `for of . ing the Government of the United States.' \" United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 343 (1926) (emphasis added). As for the fourth case, the language Shaw cites states the uncontro-versial proposition that \"defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States\" means \"fraud against the Government.\" Bridges v. United States, 346 U. S. 209, 221-222 (1953). In any event, these cases all involved crimes of fraud targeting the Government\u2014an area of the law with its own special rules and protections. We have found no relevant authority in the area of mail fraud, wire fraud, fnancial frauds, or the like supporting Shaw's view. Fifth, Shaw, reading the bank fraud statute as a whole, urges us to compare subsection (1) with subsection (2). Supra, at 65. Subsection (2), he points out, makes criminal the use of \"false or fraudulent pretenses\" to obtain \"property . . . under the custody or control of\" a bank. And in his view that fact means that we should read subsection (1) not to apply to those circumstances. That is to say, given the language of subsection (2), efforts such as his effort fraudu-lently to obtain money deposited in a bank account should not fall within the scope of the subsection (1) phrase \"scheme . . institution.\" Petitioner 30-33. As we read the two subsections, however, they do not de- mand that interpretation. The two subsections overlap sub-stantially but not completely. Subsection (2) makes criminal the use of a scheme \"to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a fnancial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\" Cite as: 580 U. S. 63 (2016) 71 Opinion of the Court This language covers much that subsection (1) also covers, for example, making a false representation to a bank in order to obtain property belonging to that bank. See Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. 351, 358, n. 4 (2014) (recognizing the \"substantial\" overlap between the two subsections and not-ing that such overlap \"is not uncommon in criminal stat-utes\"). At the same time, it applies to a circumstance in which a shopper makes a false statement to a department store cashier in order to pay for goods with money \"under the custody or control of a fnancial institution,\" say, Bank A. The shopper's false statement, though designed to ob- tain Bank A's property, might well not amount to an effort (under subsection (1)) to defraud Bank A (since the state-ment was made not to Bank A but to an agent of the depart-ment store). Given, on the one hand, the overlap and, on the other hand, a plausible reading of the language that applies it to circumstances signifcantly different from those at issue here, we have no good reason to read subsection (2) as ex-cluding from subsection (1) applications that would other-wise fall within the scope of subsection (1), such as conduct of the kind before us. Finally, Shaw asks us to apply the rule of lenity. Brief for Petitioner 40-41. We have said that the rule applies if \"at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed,\" Callanan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 596 (1961), there is \" `a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,' \" Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138- 139 (1998) (quoting Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619, n. 17 (1994)). The statute is clear enough that we need not rely on the rule of lenity. As we have said, a deposit account at a bank counts as bank property for purposes of subsection (1). Supra, at 66-67. The defendant, in circum- stances such as those present here, need not know that the deposit account is, as a legal matter, characterized as bank property. Supra, at 68-69. Moreover, in those circum- stances, the Government need not prove that the defendant 72 SHAW v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court intended that the bank ultimately suffer monetary loss. Supra, at 67-68. Finally, the statute as applied here re- quires a state of mind equivalent to knowledge, not purpose. Supra, at 69-70. III Shaw further argues that the instructions the District Court gave the jury were erroneous. He points out that the District Court told the jury that the \"phrase `scheme to defraud' means any deliberate plan of action or course of conduct by which someone intends to deceive, cheat, or deprive a fnancial institution of something of value.\" App. 18 (emphasis added). This instruction, Shaw says, could be understood as permit-ting the jury to fnd him guilty if it found no more than that his scheme was one to deceive the bank but not to \"deprive\" the bank of anything of value. Brief for Petitioner 22-23 (emphasis added). The parties agree, as do we, that the scheme must be one to deceive the bank and deprive it of something of value. For reasons previously pointed out, we have held that a plan to deprive a bank of money in a customer's deposit ac-count is a plan to deprive the bank of \"something of value\" within the meaning of the bank fraud statute. The parties dispute whether the jury instruction is nonetheless ambigu-ous or otherwise improper. We leave to the Ninth Circuit to determine whether that question was fairly presented to that court and, if so, whether the instruction is lawful, and, if not, whether any error was harmless in this case. For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2016 73 Syllabus WHITE et al. v. PAUL Y, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF PAUL Y, DECEASED, et al. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 16-67. Decided January 9, 2017 Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal went to the residence of Daniel and Sam- uel Pauly to interview Daniel about a reported road-rage incident ear- lier that evening. Finding a house with the lights on, two men inside, and Daniel's truck parked outside, the offcers covertly approached the house on foot and radioed Offcer White to join them. The Paulys de-manded to know who was outside. Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal shouted several responses them as \"State Police.\" The Paulys heard yelling but did not hear the offcers identify themselves as State Police. Just as Offcer White arrived, he heard one brother exclaim, \"We have guns.\" All three offcers took cover. A few seconds later, Daniel stepped out of the back door and fred two shotgun blasts. After that, Samuel opened a front window and pointed a handgun in Offcer White's direction. Offcer Mariscal fred at Samuel but missed. Offcer White then shot and killed Samuel. Samuel's estate and Daniel sued claiming, inter alia, that the offcers were liable under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 for violating Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. All three offcers moved for summary judgment on qualifed immunity grounds, which the District Court denied. A divided panel of the Tenth Circuit affrmed. On the issue of whether Samuel had a clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from deadly force under the circumstances, the panel majority analyzed Offcer White's qualifed immunity defense separately from the defense raised by the other offcers given Offcer White's later arrival on the scene. The panel majority denied qualifed immunity to Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal, concluding that reasonable offcers in their position would have understood that the offcers' conduct would cause the Paulys to defend their home and could result in the use of deadly force against Samuel. As to Offcer White, the panel majority denied qualifed immunity because, in the panel majority's view, clearly established law required a reasonable offcer in Offcer White's position to issue a warning prior to fring his weapon. Held: On the record described by the Tenth Circuit panel, Offcer White did not violate clearly established law. Qualifed immunity attaches when an offcial's conduct \" `does not violate clearly established statutory 74 WHITE v. PAUL Y Per Curiam or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.' \" Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U. S. 1, 11. Clearly established law should not be defned \"at a high level of generality,\" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 742, but must be \"particularized\" to the facts of the case, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. The panel majority did not identify a case where an offcer acting under similar circumstances as Offcer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. The panel majority instead relied on general excessive-force principles set forth in Tennessee v. Garner , 471 U. S. 1, and Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386, which by themselves do not create clearly established law outside \"an obvious case,\" Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 199. This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law as set forth in Garner and Graham. The Court ex- presses no opinion on the question whether\u2014in light of the Court's hold-ing today\u2014Offcers F. 3d 1060, vacated and remanded. Per Curiam. This case addresses the situation of an offcer who\u2014having arrived late at an ongoing police action and having witnessed shots being fred by one of several individuals in a house surrounded by other offcers\u2014shoots and kills an armed oc-cupant of the house without frst giving a warning. According to the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to re-spondents, shows the following. Respondent Daniel Pauly was involved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa Fe, New Mexico. 814 F. 3d 1060, 1064-1065 (CA10 2016). It was in the evening, and it was raining. The two women involved called 911 to report Daniel as a \" `drunk driver' \" who was \" `swerving all crazy.' \" Id., at 1065. The women then followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with their bright lights on. Daniel, feeling threat-ened, pulled his truck over at an off-ramp to confront them. After a brief, nonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short dis-tance to a secluded house where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly. Cite as: 580 U. S. 73 (2017) 75 Per Curiam Sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., Offcer Kevin Trues- dale was dispatched to respond to the women's 911 call. Truesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene, interviewed the two women at the off-ramp. The women told Truesdale that Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate number to Truesdale. The state po-lice dispatcher identifed the plate as being registered to the Pauly brothers' address. After the women left, Offcer Truesdale was joined at the off-ramp by Offcers Ray White and Michael Mariscal. The three agreed there was insuffcient probable cause to arrest Daniel. Still, the offcers decided to speak with Daniel to (1) get his side of the story, (2) \" `make sure nothing else happened,' \" and (3) fnd out if he was intoxicated. Ibid. The offcers split up. White stayed at the off-ramp in case Daniel returned. Truesdale and Mariscal drove in separate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers' address, less than a half mile away. Record 215. Neither offcer turned on his fashing lights. When Offcers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at the ad- dress they had received from the dispatcher, they found two different houses, the frst with no lights on inside and a sec-ond one behind it on a hill. Id., at 217, 246. Lights were on in the second one. The offcers parked their cars near the frst house. They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not fnd Daniel's truck. Id., at 310. Offcers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the lights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner to maintain offcer safety. Both used their fashlights in an in-termittent manner. Truesdale alone turned on his fashlight once they got close to the house's front door. Upon reaching the house, the offcers found Daniel's pickup truck and spotted two men moving around inside the residence. Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White, who left the off-ramp to join them. At approximately 11 p.m., the Pauly brothers became aware of the offcers' presence and yelled out \" `Who are 76 WHITE v. PAUL Y Per Curiam you?' \" and \" `What do you want?' \" 814 F. 3d, at 1066. In response, Offcers Mariscal and Truesdale laughed and re-sponded: \" `Hey, (expletive), we got you surrounded. Come out or we're coming in.' \" Ibid. Truesdale shouted once: \" `Open the door, Police, the door.' \" Ibid. Mariscal also yelled: \" `Open the door, open the door.' \" Ibid. The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling, \" `We're coming in. We're coming in.' \" Ibid. Neither Samuel nor Daniel heard the offcers identify themselves as state police. Rec-ord 81-82. The brothers armed themselves, Samuel with a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun. One of the brothers yelled at the police offcers that \" `We have guns.' \" 814 F. 3d, at 1066. The offcers saw someone run to the back of the house, so Offcer Truesdale positioned himself behind the house and shouted \" `Open the door, come outside.' \" Ibid. Offcer White had parked at the frst house and was walk- ing up to its front door when he heard shouting from the second house. He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys' house, arriving \"just as one of the brothers said: `We have guns.' \" Ibid.; see also Civ. No. 12-1311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-78. When White heard that statement, he drew his gun and took cover behind a stone wall 50 feet from the front of the house. Offcer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup truck. Just \"a few seconds\" after the \"We have guns\" statement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fred two shotgun blasts while screaming loudly. 814 F. 3d, at 1066- 1067. A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front window and pointed a handgun in Offcer White's direc-tion. Offcer Mariscal fred immediately at Samuel but missed. \" `Four to fve seconds' \" later, White shot and killed Samuel. Id., at 1067. The District Court denied the offcers' motions for sum- mary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Paulys. Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U. S. 7, 9, n. (2015) (per curiam ). Because this case concerns Cite as: 580 U. S. 73 (2017) 77 Per Curiam the defense of qualifed immunity, however, the Court consid- ers only the facts that were knowable to the defendant off-cers. Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U. S. 389, 399 (2015). Samuel's estate and Daniel fled suit against, inter alios, Offcers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White. One of the claims was that the offcers were liable under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, for violating Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. All three offcers moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. White in particular argued that the Pauly broth-ers could not show that White's use of force violated the Fourth Amendment and, regardless, that Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from deadly force under the circumstances of this case was not clearly established. The District Court denied qualifed immunity. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affrmed. As to Offcers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that \"[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs' version of the facts, a reason-able person in the offcers' position should have understood their conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to de-fend their home and could result in the commission of deadly force against Samuel Pauly by Offcer White.\" 814 F. 3d, at 1076. The panel majority analyzed Offcer White's claim separately from the other offcers because \"Offcer White did not participate in the events leading up to the armed con-frontation, nor was he there to hear the other offcers order-ing the brothers to `Come out or we're coming in.' \" Ibid. Despite the fact that \"Offcer White . . . arrived late on the heard only `We have guns' . . . before taking cover behind a stone wall,\" the majority held that a jury could have concluded that White's use of deadly force was not rea-sonable. Id., at 1077, 1082. The majority also decided that this rule\u2014that a reasonable offcer in White's position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm\u2014was clearly established at the time of Sam-uel's death. The Court of Appeals' ruling relied on general 78 WHITE v. PAUL Y Per Curiam statements from this Court's case law that (1) \"the reason- ableness of an offcer's use of force depends, in part, on whether the offcer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force\" and (2) \"if the suspect threatens the offcer with a weapon[,] deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where feasible, some warning has been given.\" Id., at 1083 (citing, inter alia, Tennessee v. Garner , 471 U. S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 (1989); emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The court concluded that a reasonable offcer in White's position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without frst warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon. Judge Moritz contending that the \"majority im- permissibly second-guesses\" Offcer White's quick choice to 814 F. 3d, at 1084. Judge Moritz ex-plained that the majority also erred by defning the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contraven-tion of this Court's precedent. The offcers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which 6 of the 12 judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant. In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was \"unaware of any clearly established law that suggests . . . that an offcer . . . who faces an occupant pointing a frearm in his direction must refrain from fring his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a warning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.\" 817 F. 3d 715, 718 (CA10 2016). Judge Hartz expressed his hope that \"the Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.\" Id., at 719. The offcers petitioned for certiorari. The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Offcer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals panel. Qualifed immunity attaches when an offcial's conduct \" `does not violate clearly established statutory or constitu-Cite as: 580 U. S. 73 (2017) 79 Per Curiam tional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.' \" Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U. S., at 11. While this Court's case law \" `do[es] not require a case directly on point' \" for a right to be clearly established, \" `existing prece-dent must have placed the statutory or constitutional ques-tion beyond debate.' \" Id., at 12. In other words, immunity protects \" `all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.' \" Ibid. In the last fve years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualifed immunity cases. See, e. g., City and County of San Francisco v. Shee- han, 575 U. S. 600, 611, n. 3 (2015) (collecting cases). The Court has found this necessary both because qualifed immu-nity is important to \" `society as a whole,' \" ibid., and because as \" `an immunity from suit,' \" qualifed immunity \" `is effec-tively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,' \" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009). Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that \"clearly established law\" should not be defned \"at a high level of generality.\" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U. S. 731, 742 (2011). As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be \"particularized\" to the facts of the case. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). Otherwise, \"[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualifed immunity . . . into a rule of virtually unquali-fed liability simply by alleging violation of extremely ab-stract rights.\" Id., at 639. The panel majority misunderstood the \"clearly estab- lished\" analysis: It failed to identify a case where an offcer acting under similar circumstances as Offcer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the ma-jority relied on Graham, Garner , and their Court of Appeals progeny, which\u2014as noted above\u2014lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level. Of course, \"general state-ments of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\" to offcers, United States v. Lanier , 520 80 WHITE v. PAUL Y Per Curiam U. S. 259, 271 (1997), but \"in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent,\" Anderson v. Creighton, supra, at 640. For that reason, we have held that Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly established law outside \"an obvious case.\" Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 199 (2004) (per curiam ); see also Plumhoff v. Rick- ard, 572 U. S. 765, 779 (2014) (emphasizing that Garner and Graham \"are `cast at a high level of generality' \"). This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under Garner and Gra- ham. Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct\u2014such as his failure to shout a warning\u2014constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation. Indeed, it recognized that \"this case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances\" in light of White's late arrival on the scene. 814 F. 3d, at 1077. This alone should have been an impor-tant indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a \"clearly established\" right. Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable offcer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as offcer identi-fcation, have already been followed. No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that offcer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow offcers in instances like the one White confronted here. On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Offcer White did not violate clearly established law. The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Offcer White ar-rived on the scene only two minutes after Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel's shots were fred. On the assumption that the conduct of Of-fcers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police offcers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other offcers' defcient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly Cite as: 580 U. S. 73 (2017) 81 Ginsburg, J., concurring force. Brief in Opposition 11, 22, n. 5. This Court ex- presses no position on this potential alternative ground for affrmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals panel addressed it. The Court also expresses no opinion on the question whether this ground was properly preserved or whether\u2014in light of this Court's holding today\u2014Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal are entitled to qualifed immunity. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Ginsburg , concurring. I join the Court's opinion on the understanding that it does not foreclose the denial of summary judgment to Offcers Truesdale 1074 (CA10 2016) (Court of Appeals emphasized, repeatedly, that fact disputes exist on question whether Truesdale and Maris-cal \"adequately identifed themselves\" as or we're coming in\" (internal quota-tion marks omitted)). Further, as to Offcer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Offcer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Offcer White shot Pauly. Compare id., at 1080, with ante, at 80 and this page. See also Civ. No. 12-1311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), pp. 7, and n. 5, 9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-76, and n. 5, 77 (suggesting that Offcer White may have been on the scene when Offcers Truesdale and Mariscal threatened to invade the Pauly home). 82 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Syllabus LIGHTFOOT et al. v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP., dba PHH MORTGAGE, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 14-1055. Argued November 8, 2016\u2014Decided January 18, 2017 The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is a federally chartered corporation that participates in the secondary mortgage mar- ket. By statute, Fannie Mae has the power \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1723a(a). When petitioners Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington and her daughter Crystal Lightfoot fled suit in state court alleging defciencies in the refnancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home, Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court, relying on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction. The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court and later en-tered judgment against petitioners. The Ninth Circuit affrmed. In concluding that the District Court had jurisdiction under Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause, the court relied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U. S. 247, which it read as establishing a rule that when a sue- and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in fed- eral court, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. Held: Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause does not grant federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae. Pp. 88-99. (a) This Court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be- sued clauses in fve federal charters. Three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction\u2014Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738; D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC , 315 U. S. 447; American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U. S. 247\u2014while two were found wanting\u2014Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61; Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacifc R. Co., 241 U. S. 295. Describing the earlier decisions as this Court's \"best efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,\" 505 U. S., at 252, the Court in Red Cross concluded that those decisions \"support the rule that a congressional charter's `sue and be sued' provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifcally mentions the federal courts,\" id., at 255. In specifcally mentioning the federal courts, Fannie Mae's sue-and- be-sued clause resembles the three clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction. But unlike those clauses, Fannie Mae's clause adds the qualifcation \"any court of competent jurisdiction,\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1723a(a). Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2016) 83 Syllabus Thus, the outcome here turns on the meaning of \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudi- cate the case before it, Black's Law Dictionary 431, and a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defnes its power to hear cases, see Steel Co. v. Citi- zens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89. It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter juris-diction covering the case before it. This Court has understood that phrase as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e. g., Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610. On this understanding, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause is most nat-urally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae but to permit suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction. Red Cross does not require a different result. It did not set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffces to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdiction. Rather, it re-stated \"the basic rule\" of Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts. 505 U. S., at 253. Pp. 88-94. (b) Fannie Mae's arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued clause as merely capacity conferring are unpersuasive. Its alternative readings of \"court of competent jurisdiction\" are premised on the al-ready rejected reading of Red Cross. The prior construction canon of statutory interpretation does not apply because none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have sur-veyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. Finally, Fannie Mae's appeals to con-gressional purpose do not call into question the plain text reading of its sue-and-be-sued clause. Pp. 94-99. 769 F. 3d 681, reversed.

S. C. \u00a7 1723a(a). This case presents the question whether this sue-and-be-sued clause grants federal district courts ju-risdiction over cases involving Fannie Mae. We hold that it does not. I A During the Great Depression, the Federal Government worked to stabilize and strengthen the residential mortgage market. Among other things, it took steps to increase li-quidity (reasonably available funding) in the mortgage mar-ket. These efforts included the creation of the Federal Home Loan Banks, which provide credit to member institu-tions to fnance affordable housing and economic develop-ment projects, and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures residential mortgages. See Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Background and His-tory of the Federal National Mortgage Association 1-7, A4 (1966). Also as part of these efforts, Title III of the National Housing Act (1934 Act) authorized the Administrator of the *Jeffrey R.

As originally chartered, Fannie Mae was wholly owned by the Federal Government and had three objectives: to \"establish a market for [FHA-insured] frst mortgages\" covering new housing construction, to \"facilitate the con-struction and fnancing of economically sound rental housing projects,\" and to \"make bonds it issued] Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. Information Regard-ing the Activities of the Assn. 1 (Circular No. 1, 1938). Fannie Mae was rechartered in 1954. Housing Act of 1954 (1954 Act), \u00a7 201, 68 Stat. 613. No longer wholly Govern-ment owned, Fannie Mae had mixed ownership: Private shareholders held its common stock and the Department of the Treasury held its preferred stock. The 1954 Act re-quired the Secretary of the Treasury to allow Fannie Mae to repurchase that stock. See id., at 613-615. It expected that Fannie Mae would repurchase all of its preferred stock and that legislation would then be enacted to turn Fannie Mae over to the private stockholders. From then on, Fannie Mae's duties would \"be carried out by a privately owned and privately fnanced corporation.\" Id., at 615. Along with these structural changes, the 1954 Act replaced Fannie Mae's initial set of powers with a more detailed list. In doing so, it revised the sue-and-be-sued clause to give Fannie Mae the power \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, 86 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" Id., at 620. In 1968, Fannie Mae became fully privately owned and re- linquished part of its portfolio to its new spinoff, the Govern-ment National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae). See Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (1968 Act), 82 Stat. 536. Fannie Mae \"continue[d] to operate the secondary market operations\" but became \"a Government-sponsored private corporation.\" 12 U. \u00a7 1716b. Mae \"remain[ed] in the Government\" and took over \"the special assistance functions and management and liquidating functions.\" Ibid. Ginnie Mae received the same set of powers as Fannie Mae. See \u00a7 1723(a); see also 1968 Act, \u00a7 802(z), 82 Stat. 540 (minor revisions to \u00a7 1723a(a)). This general structure remains in place. Fannie Mae con- tinues to participate in the secondary mortgage market. It purchases mortgages that meet its eligibility criteria, pack-ages them into mortgage-backed securities, and sells those securities to investors, and it invests in mortgage-backed securities itself. One of those mortgage purchases led to Fannie Mae's entanglement in this case. B Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington refnanced her mortgage with Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant) in the sum-mer of 1999. Fannie Mae then bought the mortgage, while Cendant continued to service it. Unable to make her pay-ments, Hollis-Arrington pursued a forbearance arrangement with Cendant. No agreement materialized, and the home entered foreclosure. Around this time, Cendant re - purchased the mortgage from Fannie Mae because it did not meet Fannie Mae's credit standards. To stave off the foreclosure, Hollis-Arrington and her daughter, Crystal Lightfoot, pursued bankruptcy and trans-ferred the property between themselves. These efforts failed, and the home was sold at a trustee's sale in 2001. Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 87 Opinion of the Court The two then took to the courts to try to undo the foreclosure and sale. After two unsuccessful federal suits, the pair fled this suit in state court. They alleged that defciencies in the ref-nancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home entitled them to relief against Fannie Mae. Their claims against other de-fendants are not relevant here. Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441(a), which permits a defendant to remove from state to federal court \"any civil action\" over which the federal district courts \"have original jurisdiction.\" It relied on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction. The Dis-trict Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court. The District Court then dismissed the claims against Fan- nie Mae on claim preclusion grounds. After a series of mo-tions, rulings, and appeals not related to the issue here, the District Court entered fnal judgment. Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot immediately moved to set aside the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), alleging \"fraud upon the court.\" App. 95-110. The District Court denied the motion. The Ninth Circuit affrmed the dismissal of the case and the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. 465 Fed. Appx. 668 (2012). After Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot sought re-hearing, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion and ordered briefng on the question whether the District Court had ju-risdiction over the case under Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause. 769 F. 3d 681, 682-683 (2014). A divided panel affrmed the District Court's judgment. The majority relied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U. S. 247 (1992). It read that decision to have established a \"rule [that] resolves this case\": When a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in fed-eral courts, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. 769 F. 3d, at 684. The dissent instead read Red Cross as setting out only a \" `default rule' \" that provides a \"starting point for 88 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court [the] analysis.\" 769 F. 3d, at 692 (opinion of Stein, J.). It read \"any court of competent jurisdiction\" in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause to overcome that default rule by re-quiring an independent source for jurisdiction in cases in-volving Fannie Mae. Ibid. Two Circuits have likewise concluded that the language in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause grants jurisdiction to federal courts. See Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston v. Moody's Corp., 821 F. 3d 102 (CA1 2016) (Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston's identical sue-and-be-sued clause); Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Medical Benefts Trust ex rel. Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. v. Raines, 534 F. 3d 779 (CADC 2008) (Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause). Four Circuits have disagreed, fnding that similar language did not grant jurisdiction. See Western Securities Co. v. Derwinski, 937 F. 2d 1276 (CA7 1991) (under 38 U. S. C. \u00a7 1820(a)(1) (1988 ed.), Secretary of Veterans Affairs' authority to \"sue and be sued . . . in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\"); C. H. Sanders Co. v. BHAP Housing Development Fund Co., 903 F. 2d 114 (CA2 1990) (under 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1702 (1988 ed.), Secretary of Housing and Urban Development's authority \"in his offcial capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\"); Indus- trial Indemnity, Inc. v. Landrieu, 615 (CA5 1980) (per curiam 2d 1367 (CA3 1974) (similar). We granted certiorari, 579 U. S. 940 (2016), and now reverse. II Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause authorizes it \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1723a(a). As in other federal corporate charters, this lan-guage serves the uncontroversial function of clarifying Fan-nie Mae's capacity to bring suit and to be sued. See Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 85-86 (1809). The Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 89 Opinion of the Court question here is whether Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause goes further and grants federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae. A In answering this question, \"we do not face a clean slate.\" Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 252. This Court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be-sued clauses in fve federal charters. Three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction, while two were found wanting. The frst discussion of sue-and-be-sued clauses came in a pair of opinions by Chief Justice Marshall. The charter of the frst Bank of the United States allowed it \" `to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.' \" Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 85. Another provision allowed suits in federal court against certain bank offcials, suggesting \"the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be expressed.\" Id., at 86. In light of this language, the Court held that the frst Bank of the United States had \"no right . . . to sue in the federal courts.\" Ibid. The Court concluded that the second Bank of the United States was not similarly disabled. Its charter allowed it \" `to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all State Courts having competent jurisdiction, and in any Circuit Court of the United States.' \" Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 817 (1824). The Court took from Deveaux \"that a general capacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the Courts of the Union, may not give a right to sue in those Courts.\" 9 Wheat., at 818. By con- trast, the second Bank's charter did grant jurisdiction to the federal circuit courts because it used \"words expressly con-ferring a right to sue in those Courts.\" Ibid. A mortgage dispute between a railroad and its creditor led to the next consideration of this issue. The Texas and Pa-90 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court cifc Railway Company's federal charter authorized it \" `to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be de-fended, in all courts of law and equity within the United States.' \" Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacifc R. Co., 241 U. S. 295, 302 (1916). This Court held that the clause had \"the same generality and natural import as\" the clause in Deveaux. 241 U. S., at 304. Thus, \"all that was intended was to render this corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court . . . whose jurisdic-tion as otherwise competently defned was adequate to the occasion.\" Id., at 303. Another lending dispute, involving defaulted bonds, led to the next statement on this issue. The Federal Deposit In- surance Corporation's (FDIC) sue-and-be-sued clause au-thorized it \"[t]o sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 264(j) (1940 ed.). In D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC , 315 U. S. 447, 455 (1942), this Court held that federal jurisdiction over the case was based on the FDIC's sue-and-be-sued clause. See Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 254 (expressing no \"doubt that the Court held federal jurisdiction to rest on the\" sue-and-be-sued clause). This Court's most recent discussion of a sue-and-be-sued clause came in Red Cross, which involved a state-law tort suit related to a contaminated blood transfusion. It de-scribed the previous quartet of decisions as refecting this Court's \"best efforts at divining congressional intent retro-spectively,\" efforts that had put \"Congress on prospective notice of the language necessary and suffcient to confer ju-risdiction.\" Id., at 252. Those decisions \"support the rule that a congressional charter's `sue and be sued' provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifcally mentions the federal courts.\" Id., at 255. Under that rule, the Court explained, the result was \"clear.\" Id., at 257. The Red Cross' sue-and-be-sued clause, which permits it to \"sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 91 Opinion of the Court State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 36 U. S. C. \u00a7 300105(a)(5), confers jurisdiction. Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 257. \"In expressly authorizing [suits] in federal courts, using language . . . in all relevant respects identical to [the clause in D'Oench ] on which [the Court] based a holding of federal jurisdiction just fve years before [its enactment], the provision extends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue, and suffces to confer federal jurisdiction.\" Ibid. Armed with these earlier cases, as synthesized by Red Cross, we turn to the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue here. B Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction in one important re-spect. In authorizing Fannie Mae \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1723a(a), it \"spe-cifcally mentions the federal courts.\" Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 255. This mention of the federal courts means that Fan-nie Mae's charter clears a hurdle that the clauses in Deveaux and Bankers Trust did not. But Fannie Mae's clause differs in a material respect from the three clauses the Court has held suffcient to grant fed-eral jurisdiction. Those clauses referred to suits in the fed-eral courts without qualifcation. In contrast, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause refers to \"any of competent ju- risdiction, State or Federal.\" \u00a7 1723a(a) (emphasis added). Because this sue-and-be-sued clause is not \"in all relevant respects identical\" to a clause already held to grant federal jurisdiction, Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 257, this case cannot be resolved by a simple comparison. The outcome instead turns on the meaning of \"court of competent jurisdiction\" in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause. A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it. See Black's Law Dictionary 431 (10th ed. 2014) (\"[a] court that has the power and author-92 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court ity to do a particular act; one recognized by law as possess- ing the right to adjudicate a controversy\"). And a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defnes its power to hear cases. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998) (Subject-matter jurisdiction is \"the courts' stat-utory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case\" (empha-sis deleted)); Wachovia Bank, N. A. v. Schmidt, 546 U. S. 303, 316 (2006) (\"Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . concerns a court's competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases\"). It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it. Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 733 (1878) (\"[T]here must be a tribunal competent by its consti-tution\u2014that is, by the law of its creation\u2014to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit\"). As a result, this Court has understood the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610 (1886), provides an example. There, the Court explained that a statute \"providing for the transfer to a trustee of the interest of the owner in the vessel and freight, provides only that the trustee may `be appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction,' leaving the question of such competency to depend on other provisions of law.\" Id., at 617. See also Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter , 177 U. S. 505, 506-507 (1900) (statute authorizing suit \" `in a court of competent jurisdiction' . . . unquestionably meant that the competency of the court should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts\"). Califano v. Sanders, 430 U. S. 99 (1977), provides another. It held that \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, codifed in 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-704, did not con-tain \"an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to re-view agency actions.\" 430 U. S., at 105. In noting that \"the actual text . . . nowhere contains an explicit grant of jurisdiction,\" the Court pointed to two clauses requiring \"ju-Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 93 Opinion of the Court dicial review . . . to proceed `in a court by statute' or `in a court of competent jurisdiction' \" and stated that both \"seem to look to outside sources of jurisdictional authority.\" Id., at 105-106, and n. 6. On this understanding, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae. In authorizing Fannie Mae to sue and be sued \"in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" it permits suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit. C Red Cross does not require a different result. Some, in- cluding the lower courts here, have understood it to set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffces to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdic-tion. Red Cross contains no such rule. By its own terms, the rule Red Cross restates is \"the basic rule\" drawn in Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts. Red Cross, 505 U. S., at 253. Each mention of a \"rule\" refers back to this principle. See id., at 255 (reading this Court's sue-and-be-sued clause cases to \"support the rule . . `sue and be sued' provi-sion may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifcally mentions the federal courts\" (emphasis added)); id., at 256 (Bankers Trust applied \"the rule thus established\" to hold that the railroad's sue-and-be-sued clause did not confer jurisdiction); id., at 257 (fnding the re- sult \"clear\" under these cases\" be-cause the charter \"expressly authoriz[es]\" suits in federal courts in a clause \"in all relevant respects identical\" to one already found to confer jurisdiction). True enough, the dissent thought Red Cross established a broad rule. See id., at 271-272 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (de-94 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court scribing Red Cross as announcing a \"rule . . . that any grant of a general capacity to sue with mention of federal courts will suffce to confer jurisdiction\" (emphasis deleted)). The certainty of the dissent may explain the lower court deci-sions adopting a broader reading of Red Cross. But Red Cross itself establishes no such rule. And such a rule is hard to square with the opinion's thorough consideration of the contrary arguments based in text, purpose, and legisla-tive history. See id., at 258-263. Nothing in Red Cross suggests that courts should ignore \"the ordinary sense of the language used,\" id., at 263, when confronted with a federal charter's sue-and-be-sued clause that expressly references the federal courts, but only those that are courts \"of competent jurisdiction.\" III Fannie Mae, preferring to be in federal court, raises sev- eral arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued clause as merely capacity conferring. None are persuasive. A Fannie Mae frst offers several alternative readings of \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" It suggests that the phrase might refer to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it, a court of proper venue, or a court of general, rather than specialized, jurisdiction. Brief for Re-spondents 41-45. At bottom, Fannie Mae's efforts on this front are premised on the reading of Red Cross rejected above. In its view, an express reference to the federal courts suffces to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on federal courts. It sees its only remaining task as explaining why that would not render \"court of competent jurisdiction\" superfuous. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. But the fact that a sue-and-be-sued clause references the federal courts does not resolve the juris-dictional question. Thus, arguments as to why the phrase Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 95 Opinion of the Court \"court of competent jurisdiction\" could still have mean- ing if it does not carry its ordinary meaning are beside the point. Moreover, even if the phrase carries additional meaning, that would not further Fannie Mae's argument. Take its sug-gestion that a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is a court with personal jurisdiction. A court must have the power to decide the claim before it (subject-matter jurisdiction) and power over the parties before it (personal jurisdiction) before it can resolve a case. See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 583-585 (1999). Recognizing as much, this Court has stated that the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" while \"usually used to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, has also been used on occasion to refer to a court's jurisdic-tion over the defendant's person.\" United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984) (footnote omitted). See also Black- mar v. Guerre , 342 U. S. 512, 516 (1952). But nothing in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause suggests that the refer-ence to \"court of competent jurisdiction\" refers only to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it. At most then, this point might support reading the phrase to refer to both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction. That does not help Fannie Mae. So long as the sue-and-be-sued clause refers to an outside source of subject-matter jurisdic-tion, it does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction. B Fannie Mae next claims that, by the time its sue-and- be-sued clause was enacted in 1954, courts had interpreted provisions containing the phrase \"court of competent juris-diction\" to grant jurisdiction and that Congress was entitled to rely on those interpretations. This argument invokes the prior construction canon of statutory interpretation. The canon teaches that if courts have settled the meaning of an existing provision, the enactment of a new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text indicates, as a general 96 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court matter, that the new provision has that same meaning. See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998). Fannie Mae points to cases discussing three types of statu- tory provisions that, in its view, show that the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" had acquired a settled meaning by 1954. The frst pair addresses the FHA's sue-and-be-sued clause. See 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1702 (\"sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\"). Two Court of Appeals decisions in the 1940's concluded that the FHA sue-and-be-sued clause overrode the general rule, today found in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491, that monetary claims against the United States exceeding $10,000 must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than the federal district courts. See Ferguson v. Union Nat. Bank of Clarksburg , 126 F. 2d 753, 755-757 (CA4 1942); George H. Evans & Co. v. United States, 169 F. 2d 500, 502 (CA3 1948). These courts did not state that their jurisdiction was founded on the sue-and-be-sued clause, as opposed to statutes governing the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 41(a) (1946 ed.). Thus, even assuming that two appellate court cases can \" `settl[e]' \" an issue, A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 325 (2012), these two cases did not because they did not speak to the question here. The second set of cases addresses provisions authorizing suit for a violation of a statute. One arose under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which authorizes employees to sue for violations of the Act in \"any . . . court of competent jurisdiction.\" \u00a7 Stat. 61, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 216(b). This Court, in its description of the facts, stated that \"[j]u-risdiction of the action was conferred by . . . U. S. C. \u00a7 216(b).\" Williams v. Jackson- ville Terminal Co., 315 U. S. 386, 390 (1942). This brief, am-biguous statement did not settle the meaning of \u00a7 216(b), and thus did not settle the meaning of the phrase \"court of com-petent jurisdiction.\" The other cases in this set dealt with Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 97 Opinion of the Court the Housing and Rent Act of 1947. As enacted, the statute permitted suit in \"any Federal, State, or Territorial court of competent jurisdiction.\" \u00a7 206(b), 61 Stat. 199. Some courts read \u00a7 206 not to confer jurisdiction and instead assessed their jurisdiction under the federal-question juris-diction statute. See, e. g., Schuman v. Greenberg , 100 F. Supp. 187, 189 (NJ 1951) (collecting cases). At the time, that statute carried an amount-in-controversy requirement, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 41(1) (1946 ed.), and so some cases were dismissed or remanded to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction. Congress later amended \u00a7 206 to permit suit \"in any Federal court of competent jurisdiction regardless of the amount in-volved.\" Defense Production Act Amendments of 1951, \u00a7 204, 65 Stat. 147. Congress' elimination of the amount-in-controversy requirement suggests, if anything, it understood that \"court of competent jurisdiction\" could be read to re-quire an outside source of jurisdiction. The third set of cases interpreted provisions making fed- eral jurisdiction over certain causes of action exclusive. Brief for Respondents 36-37. Those cases confrm that the provisions require suit to be brought in federal courts but do not discuss the basis for federal jurisdiction. In sum, none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the ju-risprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. C Fannie Mae ends with an appeal to congressional purpose, or, more accurately, a lack of congressional purpose. It argues that its original sue-and-be-sued clause, enacted in 1934, granted jurisdiction to federal courts and that there is no indication that Congress wanted to change the status quo in 1954. The addition in 1954 of \"court of competent 98 LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP. Opinion of the Court jurisdiction,\" a phrase that, as discussed, carries a clear meaning, means that the current sue-and-be-sued clause does not confer jurisdiction. An indication whether that meaning was understood as a change from the 1934 Act is not required.* Fannie Mae next points to its sibling rival, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac. The two share parallel authority to compete in the secondary mortgage market. Compare 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1717(b)(2)-(6) (Fannie Mae) with \u00a7 1454(a) (Freddie Mac). Suits involving Freddie Mac may be brought in federal court. See \u00a7 1452(c) (\"to sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any State, Fed-eral, or other court\"); \u00a7 1452(f) (providing that Freddie Mac is a federal agency under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1345, 1442, that civil actions to which Freddie Mac is a party arise under federal law, and that Freddie Mac may remove cases to federal dis-trict court before trial). Fannie Mae argues there is no good reason to think that Congress gave Freddie Mac fuller access to the federal courts than it has. Leaving aside the clear textual indica-tions suggesting Congress did just that, a plausible reason does exist. In 1970, when Freddie Mac's sue-and-be-sued clause and related jurisdictional provisions were enacted, Freddie Mac was a Government-owned corporation. See Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, \u00a7 304(a), 84 Stat. 454. Fannie Mae, on the other hand, had already transitioned into a privately owned corporation. Fannie Mae's argument on this front, moreover, contains a deeper faw. The doors to federal court remain open to Fannie Mae through diversity *The legislative history of the 1934 Act provides some reason to ques- tion Fannie Mae's premise about Congress' view of the status quo under the 1934 Act. During debate on this provision, Senator Logan asked Sen-ator Bulkley, the chair of the subcommittee with authority over the bill, about the original sue-and-be-sued clause. Senator Bulkley explained that it merely conferred a capacity to sue and be sued \"and [did] not con-fe[r] a right to go into a Federal court where it would not otherwise exist.\" 78 Cong. Rec. 12008 (1934). Cite as: 580 U. S. 82 (2017) 99 Opinion of the Court and federal-question jurisdiction. Fannie Mae provides no reason to think that in other cases, involving only state-law claims, access to the federal courts gives Freddie Mac an unintended competitive advantage over Fannie Mae that Congress would have wanted to avoid. Indeed, the usual assumption is that state courts are up to the task of adjudi-cating their own laws. Cf. Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473, 483-484 (1981). IV The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered. 100 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Syllabus BUCK v. DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fth circuit No. 15-8049. Argued October 5, 2016\u2014Decided February 22, 2017 Petitioner Duane Buck was convicted of capital murder in a Texas court. Under state law, the jury was permitted to impose a death sentence only if it found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. Buck's attorney called a psychologist, Dr. Walter Quijano, to offer his opinion on that issue. Dr. Quijano had been appointed to evaluate Buck by the presid-ing judge and had prepared a report setting out his conclusions. To determine the likelihood that Buck would act violently in the future, Dr. Quijano had considered a number of statistical factors, including Buck's race. Although Dr. Quijano ultimately concluded that Buck was un-likely to be a future danger, his report also stated that Buck was statis-tically more likely to act violently because he is black. The report read, in relevant part: \"Race. Black: Increased probability.\" App. 19a. Despite knowing the contents of the report, Buck's counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand, where he testifed that race is a factor \"know[n] to predict future dangerousness.\" Id., at 146a. Dr. Quijano's report was admitted into evidence at the close of his testimony. The prosecution questioned Dr. Quijano about his conclusions on race and violence during cross-examination, and it relied on his testimony in summation. During deliberations, the jury requested and received the expert reports ad-mitted into evidence, including Dr. Quijano's. The jury returned a sen-tence of death. Buck contends that his attorney's introduction of this evidence vio- lated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Buck failed to raise this claim in his frst state postconviction proceed-ing. While that proceeding was pending, this Court received a petition for certiorari in Saldano v. Texas, 530 U. S. 1212, a case in which Dr. Quijano had testifed that the petitioner's Hispanic heritage weighed in favor of a fnding of future dangerousness. Texas confessed error on that ground, and this Court vacated the judgment below. Soon after-ward, the Texas Attorney General issued a public statement identifying six similar cases in which Dr. Quijano had testifed. Buck's was one of them. In the other fve cases, the Attorney General confessed error Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 101 Syllabus and consented to resentencing. But when Buck fled a second state habeas petition alleging that his attorney had been ineffective in intro-ducing Dr. Quijano's testimony, the State did not confess error, and the court dismissed the petition as an abuse of the writ on the ground that Buck had failed to raise the claim in his frst petition. Buck then sought federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254. The State again declined to confess error, and Buck's ineffective assistance claim was held procedurally defaulted and unreviewable under Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722. This Court's later decisions in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, and Trevino v. Thaler , 569 U. S. 413, modifed the rule of Coleman. Had they been decided before Buck fled his federal ha- beas petition, Buck's claim could have been heard on the merits provided he had demonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been con-stitutionally ineffective in failing to raise the claim, and (2) the claim had some merit. Following the decision in Trevino , Buck sought to reopen his \u00a7 2254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). To demonstrate the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required for relief, Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U. S. 524, 535, Buck cited the change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino , as well as ten other factors, including the introduction of expert testimony linking Buck's race to violence and the State's confession of error in similar cases. The District Court de-nied relief. Reasoning that \"the introduction of any mention of race\" during Buck's sentencing was \"de minimis,\" the court concluded, frst, that Buck had failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances; and second, that even if the circumstances were extraordinary, Buck had failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance under Strickland v. Wash- ington, 466 U. S. 668. Buck sought a certifcate of appealability (COA) from the Fifth Circuit to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The Fifth Circuit denied his application, concluding that he had not shown extraordinary circumstances justifying relief from the District Court's judgment. Held: 1. The Fifth Circuit exceeded the limited scope of the COA analysis. The COA statute sets forth a two-step process: an initial determination whether a claim is reasonably debatable, and, if so, an appeal in the normal course. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253. At the frst stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that \"jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or . . . could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encourage-ment to proceed further.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 327. Here, the Fifth Circuit phrased its determination in proper terms. But it reached its conclusion only after essentially deciding the case on the 102 BUCK v. DAVIS Syllabus merits, repeatedly faulting Buck for having failed to demonstrate ex- traordinary circumstances. The question for the Court of Appeals was not whether Buck had shown that his case is extraordinary; it was whether jurists of reason could debate that issue. The State points to the Fifth Circuit's thorough consideration of the merits to defend that court's approach, but this hurts rather than helps its case. Pp. 115-118. 2. Buck has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland. Pp. 118-122. (a) To satisfy Strickland, a defendant must frst show that counsel performed defciently. 466 U. S., at 687. Buck's trial counsel knew that Dr. Quijano's report refected the view that Buck's race predisposed him to violent conduct and that the principal point of dispute during the penalty phase was Buck's future dangerousness. Counsel nevertheless called Dr. Quijano to the stand, specifcally elicited testimony about the connection between race and violence, and put Dr. Quijano's report into evidence. No competent defense attorney would introduce evidence that his client is liable to be a future danger because of his race. Pp. 118-119. (b) Strickland further requires a defendant to demonstrate preju- dice\u2014\"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional er-rors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" 466 U. S., at 694. It is reasonably probable that without Dr. Quijano's testimony on race and violence, at least one juror would have harbored a reason-able doubt on the question of Buck's future dangerousness. This issue required the jury to make a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of speculation. But Buck's race was not subject to speculation, and according to Dr. Quijano, that immutable characteristic carried with it an increased probability of future violence. Dr. Quijano's testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype and might well have been val-ued by jurors as the opinion of a medical expert bearing the court's imprimatur. For these reasons, the District Court's conclusion that any mention of race during the penalty phase was de minimis is rejected. So is the State's argument that Buck was not prejudiced by Dr. Qui- jano's testimony because it was introduced by his own counsel, rather than the prosecution. Jurors understand that prosecutors seek convic-tions and may reasonably be expected to evaluate the government's evi-dence in light of its motivations. When damaging evidence is intro-duced by a defendant's own lawyer, it is in the nature of an admission against interest, more likely to be taken at face value. Pp. 119-122. 3. The District Court's denial of Buck's Rule 60(b)(6) motion was an abuse of discretion. Pp. 122-128. (a) Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Gonzalez, 545 U. S., at 535. Determining whether Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 103 Syllabus such circumstances are present may include consideration of a wide range of factors, including \"the risk of injustice to the parties\" and \"the risk of undermining the public's confdence in the judicial process.\" Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 863-864. The District Court's denial of Buck's motion rested largely on its deter-mination that race played only a de minimis role in his sentencing. But there is a reasonable probability that Buck was sentenced to death in part because of his race. This is a disturbing departure from the basic premise that our criminal law punishes people for what they do, not who they are. That it concerned race amplifes the problem. Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction \"poisons public confdence\" in the judicial process, Davis v. Ayala, 576 U. S. 257, 285, a concern that sup- ports Rule 60(b)(6) relief. The extraordinary nature of this case is con-frmed by the remarkable steps the State itself took in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony in other cases. Although the State attempts to jus-tify its decision to treat Buck differently from the other fve defendants identifed in the Attorney General's public statement, its explanations for distinguishing Buck's case from Saldano have nothing to do with the Attorney General's stated reasons for confessing error in that case. Pp. 122-126. (b) Unless Martinez and Trevino, rather than Coleman, would gov- ern Buck's case were it reopened, his claim would remain unreviewable and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be inappropriate. The State argues that Martinez and Trevino would not govern Buck's case because they an- nounced a \"new rule\" under Teague v. Lane , 489 U. S. 288, that does not apply retroactively to cases (like Buck's) on collateral review. This argument, however, has been waived: The State failed to advance it in District Court, before the Fifth Circuit, or in its brief in opposition to Buck's petition for certiorari. Pp. 126-128. 623 Fed. Appx. 668, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy , Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan, JJ., joined.

Mateer , First Assistant At- torney General, J. Campbell Barker , Deputy Solicitor Gen- eral, and Bill Davis and Ari Cuenin, Assistant Solicitors General.* Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. A Texas jury convicted petitioner Duane Buck of capital murder. Under state law, the jury could impose a death sentence only if it found that Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. Buck's attorney called a psycholo-gist to offer his opinion on that issue. The psychologist tes-tifed that Buck probably would not engage in violent con-duct. But he also stated that one of the factors pertinent in assessing a person's propensity for violence was his race, and that Buck was statistically more likely to act violently be-cause he is black. The jury sentenced Buck to death. Buck contends that his attorney's introduction of this evi- dence violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. This claim has never been heard on the merits in any court, because the attorney who repre-sented Buck in his frst state postconviction proceeding failed to raise it. In 2006, a Federal District Court relied on that failure\u2014properly, under then-governing law\u2014to hold that Buck's claim was procedurally defaulted and unreviewable. In 2014, Buck sought to reopen that 2006 judgment by fl- ing a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were fled for Constitutional Accountability Center by Elizabeth B.

S. 100 (2017) 105 Opinion of the Court He argued that this Court's decisions in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler , 569 U. S. 413 (2013), had changed the law in a way that provided an excuse for his procedural default, permitting him to litigate his claim on the merits. In addition to this change in the law, Buck's motion identifed ten other factors that, he said, constituted the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required to justify re-opening the 2006 judgment under the Rule. See Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U. S. 524, 535 (2005). The District Court below denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit declined to issue the certifcate of appealability (COA) requested by Buck to appeal that decision. We granted certiorari, and now reverse. I A On the morning of July 30, 1995, Duane Buck arrived at the home of his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner. He was carrying a rife and a shotgun. Buck entered the home, shot Phyllis Taylor, his stepsister, and then shot Gardner's friend Kenneth Butler. Gardner fed the house, and Buck followed. So did Gardner's young children. While Gardner's son and daughter begged for their mother's life, Buck shot Gardner in the chest. Gardner and Butler died of their wounds. Taylor survived. Police offcers arrived soon after the shooting and placed Buck under arrest. An offcer would later testify that Buck was laughing at the scene. He remained \"happy\" and \"up-beat\" as he was driven to the police station, \"[s]miling and laughing\" in the back of the patrol car. App. 134a-135a, 252a. Buck was tried for capital murder, and the jury convicted. During the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was charged with deciding two issues. The frst was what the parties term the \"future dangerousness\" question. At the time of Buck's trial, a Texas jury could impose the death penalty 106 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court only if it found\u2014unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014\"a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\" Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a7 2(b)(1) (Vernon Cum. Supp. 1998). The second issue, to be reached only if the jury found Buck likely to be a future danger, was whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless warranted a sentence of life imprisonment instead of death. See \u00a7 2(e). The parties focused principally on the frst question. The State called witnesses who emphasized the brutality of Buck's crime and his evident lack of remorse in its aftermath. The State also called another former girlfriend, Vivian Jack-son. She testifed that, during their relationship, Buck had routinely hit her and had twice pointed a gun at her. Fi-nally, the State introduced evidence of Buck's criminal his-tory, including convictions for delivery of cocaine and unlaw-fully carrying a weapon. App. 125a-127a, 185a. Defense counsel answered with a series of lay witnesses, including Buck's father and stepmother, who testifed that they had never known him to be violent. Counsel also called two psychologists to testify as experts. The frst, Dr. Patrick Lawrence, observed that Buck had previously served time in prison and had been held in minimum custody. From this he concluded that Buck \"did not present any prob-lems in the prison setting.\" Record in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), Doc. 5-116, pp. 12-13. Dr. Lawrence further tes-tifed that murders within the Texas penal system tend to be gang related (there was no evidence Buck had ever been a member of a gang) and that Buck's offense had been a \"crime of passion\" occurring within the context of a romantic relationship. Id., at 4, 19, 21. Based on these considera- tions, Dr. Lawrence determined that Buck was unlikely to be a danger if he were sentenced to life in prison. Id., at 20-21. Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 107 Opinion of the Court Buck's second expert, Dr. Walter Quijano, had been ap- pointed by the presiding judge to conduct a psychological evaluation. Dr. Quijano had met with Buck in prison prior to trial and shared a report of his fndings with defense counsel. Like Dr. Lawrence, Dr. Quijano thought it signifcant that Buck's prior acts of violence had arisen from romantic rela-tionships with women; Buck, of course, would not form any such relationships while incarcerated. And Dr. Quijano likewise considered Buck's behavioral record in prison a good indicator that future violence was unlikely. App. 36a, 39a-40a. But there was more to the report. In determining whether Buck was likely to pose a danger in the future, Dr. Quijano considered seven \"statistical factors.\" The fourth factor was \"race.\" His report read, in relevant part: \"4. Race. Black: Increased probability. There is an over- representation of Blacks among the violent offenders.\" Id., at 19a. Despite knowing Dr. Quijano's view that Buck's race was competent evidence of an increased probability of future vio-lence, defense counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand and asked him to discuss the \"statistical factors\" he had \"looked at in regard to this case.\" Id., at 145a-146a. Dr. Quijano responded that certain factors were \"know[n] to predict fu-ture dangerousness\" and, consistent with his report, identi-fed race as one of them. Id., at 146a. \"It's a sad commen- tary,\" he testifed, \"that minorities, Hispanics and black people, are over represented in the Criminal Justice Sys-tem.\" Ibid. Through further questioning, counsel elicited testimony concerning factors Dr. Quijano thought favorable to Buck, as well as his ultimate opinion that Buck was un-likely to pose a danger in the future. At the close of Dr. Quijano's testimony, his report was admitted into evidence. Id., at 150a-152a. 108 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court After opening cross-examination with a series of general questions, the prosecutor likewise turned to the report. She asked frst about the statistical factors of past crimes and age, then questioned Dr. Quijano about the roles of sex and race: \"You have determined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent than a female because that's just the way it is, and that the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons; is that cor-rect?\" Id., at 170a. Dr. Quijano replied, \"Yes.\" Ibid. During closing arguments, defense counsel emphasized that Buck had proved to be \"controllable in the prison popu-lation,\" and that his crime was one of \"jealousy, . . . passion and emotion\" unlikely to be repeated in jail. Id., at 189a- 191a. The State stressed the crime's brutal nature and Buck's lack of remorse, along with the inability of Buck's own experts to guarantee that he would not act violently in the future\u2014a point it supported by reference to Dr. Quijano's testimony. See id., at 198a-199a (\"You heard from Dr. Qui- jano, told you that . . . the probability did exist that [Buck] would be a continuing threat to society.\"). The jury deliberated over the course of two days. During that time it sent out four notes, one of which requested the \"psychology reports\" that had been admitted into evidence. Id., at 209a. These reports\u2014including Dr. Quijano's\u2014were provided. The jury returned a sentence of death. B Buck's conviction and sentence were affrmed on direct ap- peal. Buck v. State , No. 72,810 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr. 28, 1999). His case then entered a labyrinth of state and federal collateral review, where it has wandered for the better part of two decades. Buck fled his frst petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Texas state court in 1999. The four claims advanced in his petition, however, were all frivolous or noncognizable. See Ex parte Buck, No. 699684-A (Dist. Ct. Harris Cty., Tex., Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 109 Opinion of the Court July 11, 2003), pp. 6-7. The petition failed to mention de- fense counsel's introduction of expert testimony that Buck's race increased his propensity for violence. But Dr. Quijano had testifed in other cases, too, and in 1999, while Buck's frst habeas petition was pending, one of those cases reached this Court. The petitioner, Victor Hugo Saldano, argued that his death sentence had been tainted by Dr. Quijano's testimony that Saldano's Hispanic heritage \"was a factor weighing in the favor of future dangerousness.\" App. 302a. Texas confessed error on that ground and asked this Court to grant Saldano's petition for certiorari, vacate the state court judgment, and remand the case. In June 2000, the Court did so. Saldano v. Texas, 530 U. S. 1212. Within days, the Texas Attorney General, John Cornyn, issued a public statement concerning the cases in which Dr. Quijano had testifed. The statement affrmed that \"it is in-appropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system.\" App. 213a. In keeping with that principle, the Attorney General explained that his offce had conducted a \"thorough audit\" and \"identifed eight more cases in which testimony was offered by Dr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider in making its determination about the sentence in a capital murder trial.\" Ibid. Six of those cases were \"similar to that of Victor Hugo Saldano\"; in those cases, letters had been sent to counsel apprising them of the Attorney General's fndings. Id., at 213a-214a. The statement closed by identifying the defend-ants in those six cases. Buck was one of them. Id., at 215a-217a. By the close of 2002, the Attorney General had confessed error, waived any available procedural defenses, and consented to resentencing in the cases of fve of those six defendants. See Alba v. Johnson, 232 F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table); Memorandum and Order in Blue v. Johnson, No. 4:99-cv-00350 (SD Tex.), pp. 15-17; Order in Garcia v. Johnson, No. 1:99-cv-00134 (ED Tex.), p. 1; Order in Brox- ton v. Johnson, No. 4:00-cv-01034 (SD Tex.), pp. 10-11; Final 110 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court Judgment in Gonzales v. Cockrell, No. 7:99-cv-00072 (WD Tex.), p. 1. Not, however, in Buck's. In 2002, Buck's attorney fled a new state habeas petition alleging that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by introducing Dr. Quijano's testimony. The State was not represented by the Attorney General in this proceeding\u2014the Texas Attorney General represents state respondents in federal habeas cases, but not state habeas cases\u2014and it did not confess error. Because Buck's petition was successive, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed it as an abuse of the writ. Ex parte Buck, Nos. 57,004-01, 57,004-02 (Oct. 15, 2003) (per curiam ). Buck turned to the federal courts. He fled a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 in October 2004, by which time Attorney General Cornyn had left offce. See Buck v. Dretke , 2006 WL 8411481, *2 (SD Tex., July 24, 2006). Buck sought relief on the ground that trial counsel's introduc-tion of Dr. Quijano's testimony was constitutionally ineffec-tive. The State responded that the state court had dismissed Buck's ineffective assistance claim because Buck had failed to press it in his frst petition, raising it for the frst time in a procedurally improper second petition. The State argued that such reliance on an established state rule of procedure was an adequate and independent state ground precluding federal review. Texas acknowledged that it had waived sim-ilar procedural defenses in Saldano's case. But it argued that Buck's case was different because \"[i]n Saldano's case Dr. Quijano testifed for the State\"; in \"it was Buck who called Dr. Quijano to testify.\" Answer and Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), p. 20. Buck countered that, notwithstanding his procedural de- fault, the District Court should reach the merits of his claim because a failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. Buck did not argue that his default should be ex-cused on a showing of \"cause\" and \"prejudice\"\u2014that is, cause for the default, and prejudice from the denial of a federal Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 111 Opinion of the Court right. And for good reason: At the time Buck fled his \u00a7 2254 petition, our decision in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752-753 (1991), made clear that an attorney's failure to raise an ineffective assistance claim during state postconviction review could not constitute cause. The District Court re-jected Buck's miscarriage of justice argument and held that, because of his procedural default, his ineffective assistance claim was unreviewable. Buck v. Dretke , 2006 WL 8411481, *8. Buck unsuccessfully sought review of the District Court's ruling. See Buck v. Thaler , 345 Fed. Appx. 923 (CA5 2009) (per curiam ) (denying application for a COA), cert. denied, 559 U. S. 1072 (2010). In 2011, Buck sought to reopen his case, arguing that the prosecution had violated the Equal Protection and Due Proc-ess Clauses by asking Dr. Quijano about the relationship between race and future violence on cross-examination and referring to his testimony during summation. Buck also ar-gued that the State's decision to treat him differently from the other defendants affected by Dr. Quijano's testimony jus-tifed relieving him of the District Court's adverse judgment. The Fifth Circuit disagreed, see Buck v. Thaler , 452 Fed. Appx. 423, 427-428 (CA5 2011) v. Thaler , 565 U. S. 1022 (2011). Buck, still barred by Coleman from avoiding the consequences of his procedural default, did not pursue his ineffective assistance claim. C In 2012, this Court \"modif[ied] the unqualifed statement in Coleman that an attorney's ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to ex-cuse a procedural default.\" Martinez, 566 U. S., at 9. We held that when a State formally limits the adjudication of claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to collateral review, a prisoner may establish cause for procedural default if (1) \"the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding,\" or \"appointed counsel in [that] 112 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court proceeding . . . was ineffective under the standards of Strick- land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984)\"; and (2) \"the under- lying . . . claim is a substantial one, which is to say that . . . the claim has some merit.\" Id., at 14. By its terms, Martinez did not bear on Buck's ineffective assistance claim. At the time of Buck's conviction and ap-peal, Texas did not formally require criminal defendants to reserve such claims for collateral review. In Trevino , how- ever, the Court concluded that the exception announced in Martinez extended to state systems that, as a practical mat- ter, deny criminal defendants \"a meaningful opportunity\" to press ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. 569 U. S., at 428. The Court further concluded that the system in Texas, where petitioner had been convicted, was such a system. Ibid. The upshot: Had Martinez and Trevino been decided before Buck fled his \u00a7 2254 petition, a federal court could have reviewed Buck's ineffective assistance claim if he demonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and (2) the claim had \"some merit.\" Martinez, 566 U. S., at 14. D When Trevino was decided, Buck's third state habeas peti- tion was pending in Texas court. That petition was denied in November 2013. Ex parte Buck, 418 S. W. 3d 98 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (per curiam ). Two months later, Buck re- turned to federal court, where he fled a motion to reopen his \u00a7 2254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). Rule 60(b) enumerates specifc circumstances in which a party may be relieved of the effect of a judgment, such as mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, and the like. The Rule concludes with a catchall category\u2014subdivi-sion (b)(6)\u2014providing that a court may lift a judgment for \"any other reason that justifes relief.\" Relief is available under subdivision (b)(6), however, only in \"extraordinary cir-cumstances,\" and the Court has explained that \"[s]uch cir-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 113 Opinion of the Court cumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.\" Gon- zalez, 545 U. S., at 535. In his motion, Buck identifed 11 factors that, in his view, justifed reopening the judgment. These included his attor- ney's introduction of expert testimony linking Buck's race to violence, the central issue at sentencing; the prosecution's questions about race and violence on cross-examination and reliance on Dr. Quijano's testimony in summation; the State's confession of error in other cases in which Dr. Quijano testi-fed, but its refusal to concede error in Buck's case; and the change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino , which, if they had been decided earlier, would have permitted federal review of Buck's defaulted claim. App. 283a-285a. The District Court denied relief on two grounds. First, the court concluded that Buck had failed to demonstrate ex-traordinary circumstances. To that end, the court observed that a change in decisional law is rarely extraordinary by itself. Buck v. Stephens, 2014 WL 11310152, *4 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014). It further determined that the State's \"promise\" not to oppose resentencing did not count for much, reasoning that \"Buck's case is different in critical respects from the cases in which Texas confessed error\" in that Buck's lawyer, not the prosecutor, had frst elicited the objec-tionable testimony. Id., at *4-*5. The court also dismissed the contention that the nature of Dr. Quijano's testimony ar-gued for reopening the case. Although \"the introduction of any mention of race was,\" in the court's view, \"ill[ ]advised at best and repugnant at worst,\" it was also \"de minimis\": Dr. Quijano had discussed the connection between race and violence only twice. Id., at *5. The court accordingly con- cluded that Buck had failed to make out the predicate for Rule 60(b)(6) relief. Second, the court determined that\u2014even if the circum- stances were extraordinary\u2014Buck's claim would fail on the merits. The court noted that under Strickland, Buck was obliged to show that counsel's performance was both def-114 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court cient and prejudicial. The court held that Buck's lawyer had indeed performed defciently in calling Dr. Quijano to give testimony that \"len[t] credence to any potential latent racial prejudice held by the jury.\" 2014 WL 11310152, *6. But, the court concluded, Buck had failed to demonstrate prejudice. It observed that Buck's crime had been \"hor-rifc.\" Ibid. And the court had already concluded that \"the introduction of any mention of race was . . . de mini- mis.\" Id., at *5. For those reasons, it held, Buck had failed to show a reasonable probability that he would not have been sentenced to death but for Dr. Quijano's testimony about race and violence. Buck sought to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) mo- tion. He accordingly fled an application for a COA with the Fifth Circuit. To obtain a COA, Buck was required to make \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" * 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Fifth Circuit denied a COA, concluding that Buck's case was \"not extraordinary at all in the habeas context.\" Buck v. Stephens, 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 673 (2015). The panel agreed with the District Court that Martinez and Trevino were not signifcant factors in the analysis. It characterized most of the other factors Buck had identifed as \"variations on the merits\" of his claim, which was \"at least unremarkable as far as [ineffective assistance] claims go.\" 623 Fed. Appx., at 673. The panel likewise rejected Buck's argument that he was entitled to relief because the State had issued a press release indicating that his case would be treated like Sal-dano's, and then had confessed error in the other cases iden-tifed as similar in the statement, but not in Buck's. Id., at 674. Because Buck had \"not shown extraordinary circum- *The Federal Courts of Appeals appear to disagree over whether a COA is needed to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. See Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U. S. 524, 535, and n. 7 (2005). In keeping with the approach adopted by the Fifth Circuit below and by the parties in their briefs, we assume without deciding that a COA is required here. Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 115 Opinion of the Court stances that would permit relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6),\" the panel \"den[ied] the application for a COA.\" Id., at 669. Buck's motion for rehearing en banc was denied over two dissenting votes. Buck v. Stephens, 630 Fed. Appx. 251 (CA5 2015) (per curiam ). We granted certiorari. Buck v. Stephens, 578 U. S. 1022 (2016). II A state prisoner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied by a federal district court does not enjoy an abso-lute right to appeal. Federal law requires that he frst ob-tain a COA from a circuit justice or judge. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). A COA may issue \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Until the prisoner secures a COA, the court of appeals may not rule on the merits of his case. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 336 (2003). The COA inquiry, we have emphasized, is not coextensive with a merits analysis. At the COA stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that \"jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his con-stitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to pro-ceed further.\" Id., at 327. This threshold question should be decided without \"full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\" Id., at 336. \"When a court of appeals sidesteps [the COA] process by frst deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual mer-its, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\" Id., at 336-337. The court below phrased its determination in proper terms\u2014that jurists of reason would not debate that Buck should be denied relief, 623 Fed. Appx., at 674\u2014but it reached that conclusion only after essentially deciding the 116 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court case on the merits. As the court put it in the second sen- tence of its opinion: \"Because [Buck] has not shown extraor-dinary circumstances that would permit relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), we deny the application for a COA.\" Id., at 669. The balance of the Fifth Circuit's opinion refects the same approach. The change in law ef-fected by Martinez and Trevino , the panel wrote, was \"not an extraordinary circumstance.\" 623 Fed. Appx., at 674. Even if Texas initially indicated to Buck that he would be resentenced, its \"decision not to follow through\" was Buck not shown why\" the State's broken promise \"would justify relief from the judgment.\" Ibid. But the question for the Fifth Circuit was not whether Buck had \"shown extraordinary circumstances\" or \"shown why [Texas's broken promise] would justify relief from the judgment.\" Id., at 669, 674. Those are ultimate merits de- terminations the panel should not have reached. We reiter-ate what we have said before: A \"court of appeals should limit its examination [at the COA stage] to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [the] claims,\" and ask \"only if the District Court's decision was debatable.\" Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 327, 348. The dissent does not accept this established rule, arguing that a reviewing court that deems a claim nondebatable \"must necessarily conclude that the claim is meritless.\" Post, at 129 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Of course when a court of appeals properly applies the COA standard and deter-mines that a prisoner's claim is not even debatable, that nec-essarily means the prisoner has failed to show that his claim is meritorious. But the converse is not true. That a pris-oner has failed to make the ultimate showing that his claim is meritorious does not logically mean he failed to make a preliminary showing that his claim was debatable. Thus, when a reviewing court (like the Fifth Circuit here) inverts the statutory order of operations and \"frst decid[es] the mer-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 117 Opinion of the Court its of an appeal, . . . then justif[ies] its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits,\" it has placed too heavy a burden on the prisoner at the COA stage . Miller- El, 537 U. S., at 336-337. Miller-El fatly prohibits such a departure from the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 2253. Ibid. The State defends the Fifth Circuit's approach by arguing that the court's consideration of an application for a COA is often quite thorough. The court \"occasionally hears oral argument when considering whether to grant a COA in a capital case.\" Brief for Respondent 50. Indeed, in one re-cent case, it \"received nearly 200 pages of initial briefng, permitted a reply brief, considered the parties' supplemental authorities, invited supplemental letter briefs from both sides, and heard oral argument before denying the request for a COA.\" Id., at 50-51. But this hurts rather than helps the State's case. \"[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not pre-vail.\" Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 338. The statute sets forth a two-step process: an initial determination whether a claim is reasonably debatable, and then\u2014if it is\u2014an appeal in the normal course. We do not mean to specify what procedures may be appropriate in every case. But whatever procedures are employed at the COA stage should be consonant with the limited nature of the inquiry. Given the approach of the court below, it is perhaps under- standable that the parties have essentially briefed and ar-gued the underlying merits at length. See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner 32 (\"[T]rial counsel rendered defcient perform-ance under Strickland.\"); id., at 39 (\"[T]here is a reasonable probability that Dr. Quijano's race-as-dangerousness opinion swayed the judgment of jurors in favor of death.\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); id., at 59 (Buck \"has demonstrated his entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\"); Brief for Respondent 40 (\"The particular facts of 118 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court petitioner's case do not establish extraordinary circum- stances justifying relief from the judgment.\" (boldface type deleted)). With respect to this Court's review, \u00a7 2253 does not limit the scope of our consideration of the underlying merits, and at this juncture we think it proper to meet the decision below and the arguments of the parties on their own terms. III Buck's request for a COA raised two separate questions for the Fifth Circuit, one substantive and one procedural: frst, whether reasonable jurists could debate the District Court's conclusion that Buck was not denied his right to ef-fective assistance of counsel under Strickland; and second, whether reasonable jurists could debate the District Court's procedural holding that Buck had not made the necessary showing to reopen his case under Rule 60(b)(6). A We begin with the District Court's determination (not spe- cifcally addressed by the Fifth Circuit) that Buck's constitu-tional claim failed on the merits. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel \"is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\" Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970)). A defendant who claims to have been denied effective assistance must show both that counsel performed defciently and that coun-sel's defcient performance caused him prejudice. 466 U. S., at 687. 1 Strickland's frst prong sets a high bar. A defense lawyer navigating a criminal proceeding faces any number of choices about how best to make a client's case. The lawyer has dis-charged his constitutional responsibility so long as his deci-sions fall within the \"wide range of professionally competent assistance.\" Id., at 690. It is only when the lawyer's errors were \"so serious that counsel was not functioning as the Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 119 Opinion of the Court `counsel' guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment\" that Strickland's frst prong is satisfed. Id., at 687. The District Court determined that, in this case, counsel's performance fell outside the bounds of competent represen-tation. We agree. Counsel knew that Dr. Quijano's report refected the view that Buck's race disproportionately pre-disposed him to violent conduct; he also knew that the princi-pal point of dispute during the trial's penalty phase was whether Buck was likely to act violently in the future. Counsel nevertheless (1) called Dr. Quijano to the stand; (2) specifcally elicited testimony about the connection between Buck's race and the likelihood of future violence; and (3) put into evidence Dr. Quijano's expert report that stated, in ref-erence to factors bearing on future dangerousness, \"Race. Black: Increased probability.\" App. 19a, 145a-146a. Given that the jury had to make a fnding of future danger- ousness before it could impose a death sentence, Dr. Qui-jano's report said, in effect, that the color of Buck's skin made him more deserving of execution. It would be pat-ently unconstitutional for a State to argue that a defendant is liable to be a future danger because of his race. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 885 (1983) (identifying race among factors that are \"constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process\"). No competent de- fense attorney would introduce such evidence about his own client. See Buck v. Thaler , 565 U. S., at 1022 (statement of Alito, J., joined by Scalia and Breyer, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari) (Buck's case \"concerns bizarre and objection-able testimony\"). 2 To satisfy Strickland, a litigant must also demonstrate prejudice\u2014\"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" 466 U. S., at 694. Accordingly, the question before the District Court was whether Buck had demonstrated a reasonable probability that, without Dr. Qui-120 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court jano's testimony on race, at least one juror would have har- bored a reasonable doubt about whether Buck was likely to be violent in the future. The District Court concluded that Buck had not made such a showing. We disagree. In arguing that the jury would have imposed a death sen- tence even if Dr. Quijano had not offered race-based testi-mony, the State primarily emphasizes the brutality of Buck's crime and his lack of remorse. A jury may conclude that a crime's vicious nature calls for a sentence of death. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. 15 (2009) (per curiam ). In this case, however, several considerations convince us that it is reasonably probable\u2014notwithstanding the nature of Buck's crime and his behavior in its aftermath\u2014that the pro-ceeding would have ended differently had counsel rendered competent representation. Dr. Quijano testifed on the key point at issue in Buck's sentencing. True, the jury was asked to decide two issues\u2014 whether Buck was likely to be a future danger, and, if so, whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless justifed a sentence of life imprisonment. But the focus of the proceed-ing was on the frst question. Much of the penalty phase testimony was directed to future dangerousness, as were the summations for both sides. The jury, consistent with the focus of the parties, asked during deliberations to see the expert reports on dangerousness. See App. 187a-196a, 198a-203a, 209a. Deciding the key issue of Buck's dangerousness involved an unusual inquiry. The jurors were not asked to determine a historical fact concerning Buck's conduct, but to render a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of specula-tion. Buck, all agreed, had committed acts of terrible vio-lence. Would he do so again? Buck's prior violent acts had occurred outside of prison, and within the context of romantic relationships with women. If the jury did not impose a death sentence, Buck would be sen-tenced to life in prison, and no such romantic relationship Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 121 Opinion of the Court would be likely to arise. A jury could conclude that those changes would minimize the prospect of future dangerousness. But one thing would never change: the color of Buck's skin. Buck would always be black. And according to Dr. Quijano, that immutable characteristic carried with it an \"[i]ncreased probability\" of future violence. Id., at 19a. Here was hard statistical evidence\u2014from an expert\u2014to guide an otherwise speculative inquiry. And it was potent evidence. Dr. Quijano's testimony ap- pealed to a powerful racial stereotype\u2014that of black men as \"violence prone.\" Turner v. Murray , 476 U. S. 28, 35 (1986) (plurality opinion). In combination with the substance of the jury's inquiry, this created something of a perfect storm. Dr. Quijano's opinion coincided precisely with a particularly noxious strain of racial prejudice, which itself coincided pre-cisely with the central question at sentencing. The effect of this unusual confuence of factors was to provide support for making a decision on life or death on the basis of race. This effect was heightened due to the source of the testi- mony. Dr. Quijano took the stand as a medical expert bear-ing the court's imprimatur. The jury learned at the outset of his testimony that he held a doctorate in clinical psychol-ogy, had conducted evaluations in some 70 capital murder cases, and had been appointed by the trial judge (at public expense) to evaluate Buck. App. 138a-141a. Reasonable jurors might well have valued his opinion concerning the central question before them. See Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249, 259 (1988) (testimony from \"a medical doctor spe- cializing in psychiatry\" on the question of future dangerous-ness may have infuenced the sentencing jury). For these reasons, we cannot accept the District Court's conclusion that \"the introduction of any mention of race\" during the penalty phase was \"de minimis.\" 2014 WL 11310152, *5. There were only \"two references to race in Dr. Quijano's testimony\"\u2014one during direct examination, the other on cross. Ibid. But when a jury hears expert 122 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court testimony that expressly makes a defendant's race directly pertinent on the question of life or death, the impact of that evidence cannot be measured simply by how much air time it received at trial or how many pages it occupies in the record. Some toxins can be deadly in small doses. The State acknowledges, as it must, that introducing \"race or ethnicity as evidence of criminality\" can in some cases prejudice a defendant. Brief for Respondent 31. But it insists that this is not such a case, because Buck's own counsel, not the prosecution, elicited the offending testimony. We are not convinced. In fact, the distinction could well cut the other way. A prosecutor is seeking a conviction. Jurors understand this and may reasonably be expected to evaluate the government's evidence and argu-ments in light of its motivations. When a defendant's own lawyer puts in the offending evidence, it is in the nature of an admission against interest, more likely to be taken at face value. The effect of Dr. Quijano's testimony on Buck's sentencing cannot be dismissed as \"de minimis.\" Buck has demon-strated prejudice. B 1 We now turn to the lower courts' procedural holding: that Buck failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to have the judgment against him reopened under Rule 60(b)(6). We have held that a litigant seeking a COA must demonstrate that a procedural ruling barring relief is itself debatable among jurists of reason; otherwise, the appeal would not \"de-serve encouragement to proceed further.\" Slack v. McDan- iel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle , 463 U. S. 880, 893, n. 4 (1983)). The Rule 60(b)(6) holding Buck challenges would be re- viewed for abuse of discretion during a merits appeal, see 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Proce-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 123 Opinion of the Court dure \u00a7 2857 (3d ed. 2012), and the parties agree that the COA question is therefore whether a reasonable jurist could con-clude that the District Court abused its discretion in declin-ing to reopen the judgment. See Brief for Petitioner 54-57; Brief for Respondent 34. Buck brought his Rule 60(b) motion under the Rule's catchall category, subdivision (b)(6), which permits a court to reopen a judgment for \"any other reason that justifes relief.\" Rule 60(b) vests wide discretion in courts, but we have held that relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only in \"extraordi-nary circumstances.\" Gonzalez, 545 U. S., at 535. In deter- mining whether extraordinary circumstances are present, a court may consider a wide range of factors. These may in-clude, in an appropriate case, \"the risk of injustice to the parties\" and \"the risk of undermining the public's confdence in the judicial process.\" Liljeberg v. Health Services Acqui- sition Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 864 (1988). In the circumstances of this case, the District Court abused its discretion in denying Buck's Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The District Court's conclusion that Buck \"ha[d] failed to demonstrate that this case presents extraordinary circum-stances\" rested in large measure on its determination that \"the introduction of any mention of race\"\u2014though \"ill[ ]ad-vised at best and repugnant at worst\"\u2014played only a \"de minimis\" role in the proceeding. 2014 WL 11310152, *5. The Fifth Circuit, for its part, failed even to mention the racial evidence in concluding that Buck's claim was \"at least unremarkable as far as [ineffective assistance] claims go.\" 623 Fed. Appx., at 673. But our holding on prejudice makes clear that Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race. As an initial matter, this is a disturbing departure from a basic premise of our criminal justice sys-tem: Our law punishes people for what they do, not who they are. Dispensing punishment on the basis of an immutable characteristic fatly contravenes this guiding principle. As petitioner correctly puts it, \"[i]t stretches credulity to char-124 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court acterize Mr. Buck's [ineffective assistance of counsel] claim as run-of-the-mill.\" Brief for Petitioner 57. This departure from basic principle was exacerbated be- cause it concerned race. \"Discrimination on the basis of race, odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the ad-ministration of justice.\" Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 555 (1979). Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction \"poi-sons public confdence\" in the judicial process. Davis v. Ayala, 576 U. S. 257, 285 (2015). It thus injures not just the defendant, but \"the law as an institution, . . . the community at large, and . the democratic ideal refected in the proc- esses of our courts.\" Rose , 443 U. S., at 556 (internal quota- tion marks omitted). Such concerns are precisely among those we have identifed as supporting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). See Liljeberg , 486 U. S., at 864. The extraordinary nature of this case is confrmed by what the State itself did in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony. When the case of Victor Hugo Saldano came before this Court, Texas confessed error and consented to resentencing. The State's response to Saldano's petition for the injustice Saldano had suffered: \"the in-fusion of race as a factor for the jury to weigh in making its determination violated his constitutional right to be sen-tenced without regard to the color of his skin.\" App. 306a. The Attorney General's public statement, issued shortly after we vacated the judgment in Saldano's case, refected this sentiment. It explained that the State had responded to Saldano's troubling petition by conducting a \"thorough audit\" of criminal cases, fnding six similar to Saldano's \"in which testimony was offered by Dr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider.\" Id., at 213a. The statement affrmed that \"it is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system.\" Ibid. Consistent with this position\u2014and to its credit\u2014the State confessed error in the cases of fve of the six defend-ants identifed in the Attorney General's statement, waiv-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 125 Opinion of the Court ing all available procedural defenses and consenting to resentencing. These were remarkable steps. It is not every day that a State seeks to vacate the sentences of fve defendants found guilty of capital murder. But then again, these were\u2014as the State itself put it at oral argument here\u2014\"extraordi-nary\" cases. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41; see Buck v. Thaler , 565 U. S., at 1030 (Sotomayor, J., joined by Kagan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\"Especially in light of the capital nature of this case and the express recognition by a Texas attorney general that the relevant testimony was inappropri- ately race charged, Buck has presented issues that `deserve encouragement to proceed further.' \" (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 327)). To be sure, the State has repeatedly attempted to justify its decision to treat Buck differently from the other fve de-fendants identifed in the Attorney General's statement, in-cluding on asserted factual grounds that the State has been required to abjure. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 10 (the State's initial opposition to Buck's habeas petition \"errone-ously\" argued that Buck was treated differently because de-fense counsel, not the State, called Dr. Quijano as a witness; that was also true of two of the other defendants). The State continues its efforts before this Court, arguing that Buck's was the only one of the six cases in which defense counsel, not the prosecution, frst elicited Dr. Quijano's opin-ion on race. See also post, at 135 (opinion of Thomas, J.). But this is beside the point. The State's various explana- tions for distinguishing Buck's case have nothing to do with the Attorney General's stated reasons for confessing error in Saldano and the cases acknowledged as similar. Regardless of which party frst broached the subject, race was in all these cases put to the jury \"as a factor . . . to weigh in making its determination.\" App. 306a. The statement that \"it is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system\" is equally applicable whether 126 BUCK v. DAVIS Opinion of the Court the prosecution or ineffective defense counsel initially in- jected race into the proceeding. Id., at 213a. The terms of the State's announcement provide every reason for originally including Buck on the list of defendants situated similarly to Saldano, and no reason for later taking him off. In opposition, the State reminds us of the importance of preserving the fnality of judgments. Brief for Respondent 34. But the \"whole purpose\" of Rule 60(b) \"is to make an exception to fnality.\" Gonzalez, 545 U. S., at 529. And in this case, the State's interest in fnality deserves little weight. When Texas recognized that the infusion of race into proceedings similar to Saldano's warranted confession of error, it effectively acknowledged that the people of Texas lack an interest in enforcing a capital sentence obtained on so fawed a basis. In concluding that the value of fnality does not demand that we leave the District Court's judgment in place, we do no more than acknowledge what Texas itself recognized 17 years ago. 2 Our Rule 60(b)(6) analysis has thus far omitted one sig- nifcant element. When Buck frst sought federal habeas re-lief in 2004, Coleman barred the District Court from hearing his claim. Today, however, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel defaulted in a Texas postconviction proceed-ing may be reviewed in federal court if state habeas counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and the claim has \"some merit.\" Martinez, 566 U. S., at 14; see Trevino , 569 U. S., at 427-428. Buck cannot obtain relief un- less he is entitled to the beneft of this rule\u2014that is, unless Martinez and Trevino , not Coleman, would govern his case were it reopened. If they would not, his claim would remain unreviewable, and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be inappropri-ate. See 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Proce-dure \u00a7 2857 (showing \"a good claim or defense\" is a precondi-tion of Rule 60(b)(6) relief). Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 127 Opinion of the Court Until merits briefng in this Court, both parties litigated this matter on the assumption that Martinez and Trevino would apply if Buck reopened his case. See Pet. for Cert. 27-28; Brief in Opposition 11-13; Amended Application for Certificate of Appealability and Brief in Support 26, Respondent-Appellee's Opposition to Pet. for En Banc Re-hearing 9-11, and Respondent's Opposition to Application for Certifcate of Appealability 15-17 in No. 14-70030 (CA5); Amended Response to Motion for Relief from Judgment in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), pp. 11-13. But the State's brief adopts a new position on this issue. The State now argues that those cases announced a \"new rule\" that, under Teague v. Lane , 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion), does not apply retroactively to cases (like Buck's) on collateral review. Brief for Respondent 38-40. Buck responds that Teague analysis applies only to new rules of criminal proce- dure that govern trial proceedings\u2014not new rules of habeas procedure that govern collateral proceedings\u2014and that the State has in any event waived its Teague argument. Reply Brief 20. We agree that the argument has been waived. See Dan- forth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 289 (2008) (\"States can waive a Teague defense . . . by failing to raise it in a timely manner . . . .\"). It was not advanced in District Court, be-fore the Fifth Circuit, or in the State's brief in opposition to Buck's petition for certiorari. Although we may reach the issue in our discretion, we have observed before that a State's failure to raise a Teague argument at the petition stage is particularly \"signifcant\" in deciding whether such an exercise of discretion is appropriate. Schiro v. Farley , 510 U. S. 222, 228-229 (1994). When \"a legal issue appears to warrant review, we grant certiorari in the expectation of being able to decide that issue.\" Id., at 229. If we were to entertain the State's eleventh-hour Teague argument and fnd it persuasive, Buck's Strickland and Rule 60(b)(6) con- tentions\u2014the issues we thought worthy of review\u2014would be 128 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting insulated from our consideration. We therefore decline to reach the Teague question and conclude that Martinez and Trevino apply to Buck's claim. We reach no broader deter- mination concerning the application of these cases. C For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Buck has dem- onstrated both ineffective assistance of counsel under Strick- land and an entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6). It follows that the Fifth Circuit erred in denying Buck the COA required to pursue these claims on appeal. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas , with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting. Having settled on a desired outcome, the Court bulldozes procedural obstacles and misapplies settled law to justify it. But the majority's focus on providing relief to petitioner in this particular case has at least one upside: Today's decision has few ramifcations, if any, beyond the highly unusual facts presented here. The majority leaves entirely undisturbed the black-letter principles of collateral review, ineffective as-sistance of counsel, and Rule 60(b)(6) law that govern day-to-day operations in federal courts. I In reversing the judgment below, the majority relies on three grounds: that the Fifth Circuit misapplied the standard for granting a certifcate of appealability (COA); that the District Court erroneously rejected petitioner's Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim; and that the District Court abused its discretion in rejecting petition-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 129 Thomas, J., dissenting er's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion to re- open the court's earlier judgment denying habeas relief. On each ground, the majority simply disagrees with the courts below over the application of the governing standard. The majority does not announce any new standards or suggest that the District Court or the Fifth Circuit applied the wrong standards altogether. See, e. g., ante, at 115 (\"The court below phrased its determination in proper terms . . . \"). I agree with the majority that the courts below identifed the correct standards for all three of these inquiries. Con-trary to the majority's conclusion, however, I would hold that they correctly applied those standards, too. A At the outset, the Court wrongly criticizes the Fifth Cir- cuit for its application of the COA standard. A COA is warranted only if the district court's ruling is \"debatable amongst jurists of reason.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 336 (2003). To answer this question, a court must con-duct a \"general assessment\" of the merits of a defendant's claim. Ibid. The majority faults the Fifth Circuit for con- cluding outright that petitioner \" `has not shown extraordi-nary circumstances that would permit relief under [Rule] 60(b)(6).' \" Ante , at 116 (quoting Buck v. Stephens, 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 669 (CA5 2015)). In the majority's view, the ex-istence of extraordinary circumstances represents an \"ulti-mate merits determinatio[n] the panel should not have reached.\" Ante, at 116. Instead, according to the majority, the panel should have limited itself to the threshold question whether the merits were debatable. The majority's criticism of the Fifth Circuit is misplaced. A court may grant a COA even if it might ultimately con-clude that the underlying claim is meritless, so long as the claim is debatable. Miller-El, supra, at 336. But to deny a COA, a court must necessarily conclude that the claim is mer-itless. A reviewing court cannot determine that a claim is in-130 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting disputably meritless (that is, nondebatable) without frst de- is meritless. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000) (\"Where a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case,\" the claim is not debatable (emphasis added)); Weeks v. Ange- lone , 528 U. S. 225, 231, 234 (2000) (affrming denial of COA after determining that petitioner's claim was meritless). In concluding that petitioner's claims were indisputably meritless as a prelude to denying the COA, the Fifth Circuit thus adopted the approach that courts must take in denying a COA. The majority might disagree with the conclusion that petitioner's claims are indisputably meritless, but its criticism of the Fifth Circuit's approach is most certainly misguided. The majority's contrary approach would pre-vent a court of appeals from denying a COA in any case, an outcome that Congress and our precedents have plainly foreclosed. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (COA warranted only if petitioner makes \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\"); Miller-El, supra, at 337 (The \"issu- ance of a COA must not be pro forma or a matter of course\"). The majority's comment that \"[u]ntil the prisoner secures a COA, the court of appeals may not rule on the merits of his case,\" ante, at 115, should not be taken at face value. In any event, after chastising the Court of Appeals for making an end run around the COA standard in order to reach the merits of petitioner's Rule 60(b) claim, the Court does precisely that. See ante, at 128 (\"[W]e conclude that Buck has demonstrated . . . an entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\"). Astonishingly, the Court also decides the merits of petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim\u2014an issue that was not even \"addressed by the Fifth Circuit.\" Ante, at 118; see ante , at 128 (\"Buck has demonstrated . . . ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland [v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984)]\"). After reaching out to adjudicate the merits, the Court re- lies on its merits disposition to justify reversing the Fifth Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 131 Thomas, J., dissenting Circuit's denial of a COA. Ante , at 128 (\"It follows that the Fifth Circuit erred in denying Buck the COA required to pursue these claims on appeal\" (emphasis added)). This un-apologetic course reversal\u2014made without so much as a hint of the irony\u2014is striking. The majority also has things just backwards. It criticizes the Fifth Circuit for undertaking a merits inquiry to deny a COA (when such an inquiry is re- quired) and then it conducts a merits inquiry to decide that petitioner's claim is debatable (when such an inquiry is inappropriate). B The Court's application of the standard in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), is similarly misguided. In particular, the Court erroneously fnds that petitioner's claim satisfes Strickland's second prong, which requires a defend- ant to show that his counsel's mistake materially prejudiced his defense. Prejudice exists only when correcting the al-leged error would have produced a \"substantial\" likelihood of a different result. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U. S. 86, 111-112 (2011). Here, the sentence of death hinged on the jury's fnding that petitioner posed a threat of future danger-ousness. Texas' standard for making such a fnding is not diffcult to satisfy: \"The facts of the offense alone may be suffcient to sustain the jury's fnding of future dangerous-ness,\" and \"[a] jury may also infer a defendant's future dan-gerousness from evidence showing a lack of remorse.\" Bun- tion v. State , 482 S. W. 3d 58, 66-67 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). The majority neglects even to mention the relevant legal standard in Texas, relying instead on rhetoric and specula-tion to craft a fnding of prejudice. But the prosecution's evidence of both the heinousness of petitioner's crime and his complete lack of remorse was overwhelming. Accord-ingly, Dr. Quijano's \"de minimis\" racial testimony, Buck v. Stephens, 2014 WL 11310152, *5 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014), did not prejudice petitioner. 132 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting First, the facts leave no doubt that this crime was premed- itated and cruel. The Court recites defense testimony de- scribing the killing spree here as a \"crime of passion,\" ante, at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted), but the record be-lies that characterization. The rampage occurred at the home of Debra Gardner, petitioner's ex-girlfriend. Prior to the shooting, petitioner called her house. His stepsister, Phyllis Taylor, answered, and petitioner asked to speak with Gardner. Gardner declined, and petitioner hung up. Peti-tioner then retrieved a shotgun and rife, loaded both guns, and drove 28 miles to Gardner's house. Upon arrival, he broke down the door and opened fre without provocation. The shooting did not occur in the heat of the moment. In addition to describing this as a crime of passion, the majority also parrots defense testimony that petitioner's vio-lence was limited to \"the context of romantic relationships.\" Ante, at 120. But this assertion is also quite wrong. Upon entering Gardner's house, petitioner frst shot at an acquaint-ance, Harold Ebnezer. He next approached his stepsister, Taylor, who was seated on the couch. He said, \" `I'm going to shoot your ass too.' \" App. 82a. She begged him, \" `Duane, please don't shoot me. I'm your sister. I don't deserve to be shot. Remember I do have children.' \" Id., at 83a. Petitioner ignored her pleas, placed the gun on her chest, and shot her. Petitioner does not claim that he was in a romantic relationship with either Ebnezer or Taylor. After shooting Taylor, petitioner cornered one of Gard- ner's friends, Kenneth Butler, and shot him, as well. He then exited the house and chased Gardner into the middle of the street. She turned to him and pleaded, \" `Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me. Why are you doing this in front of my kids?' \" Id., at 104a. Her son, Devon, watched from the sidewalk. Her daughter, Shennel, begged petitioner to spare her mother and even attempted to re-strain him. Petitioner pointed the gun at Gardner and said, \" `I'm going to shoot you. I'm going to shoot your A[ss].' \" Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 133 Thomas, J., dissenting Id., at 117a. He then did so. The fight path of the bullet suggests that Gardner was on her knees when petitioner shot her. Second, the evidence of petitioner's lack of remorse, largely ignored by the majority, is startling. After shooting Gardner, petitioner walked back to his car and placed the frearms in the trunk. He then returned to taunt Gardner where she lay mortally wounded and bleeding in the street. He said, \" `It ain't funny now. You ain't laughing now.' \" Id., at 106a. Police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested him. In the patrol car, petitioner was \"laughing and joking and taunting.\" Id., at 71a. He continued to smile and laugh during the drive to the police station. When one of the off-cers informed petitioner that he did not fnd the situation humorous, petitioner replied that \" `[t]he bitch got what she deserved.' \" Id., at 135a. He remained happy and upbeat for the remainder of the drive, even commenting that he was going to heaven because God had already forgiven him. C Finally, the majority incorrectly concludes that the Dis- trict Court erred in denying petitioner's motion under Rule 60(b)(6), which permits district courts to reopen otherwise final judgments only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Ackermann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950). Al- though the majority pays lipservice to the fact that the Dis-trict Court's decision on this point is subject to \"limited and deferential appellate review,\" Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U. S. 524, 535 (2005); see ante, at 122-123, it proceeds to conduct a de novo review. Indeed, the majority references the Dis- trict Court's analysis only once in the entire section of its opinion addressing Rule 60(b)(6). But the question is not whether this Court thinks the circumstances are extraordi- nary; the question is whether reasonable jurists would de-bate that the District Court abused its discretion in reaching the equitable, highly factbound conclusion that they are not. 134 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting Particularly in light of our admonition that such circum- stances \"will rarely occur in the habeas context,\" 545 U. S., at 535, I think it is not debatable that the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Rule 60(b)(6) relief here. In reversing the Fifth Circuit, the centerpiece of the Court's analysis is its observation that \" `[d]iscrimination on the basis of race, odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.' \" Ante, at 124 (quoting Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, 555 (1979)). I agree that racial classifcations are categorically impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause\u2014but petitioner is not raising an equal protection claim. The many precedents the Court cites interpreting that Clause are therefore beside the point. Instead, petitioner is claiming that his case presents extra-ordinary circumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). The majority identifes no precedents regarding race in the Rule 60(b)(6) context. And certainly nothing in the text or history of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014unlike the text and history of the Equal Pro-tection Clause\u2014suggests that race-based claims demand unique solicitude in this context. At the very least, the Dis-trict Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that they do not. 1 In a similar vein, the majority suggests that the use of race in petitioner's capital proceeding injured the public's confdence in the integrity of our judicial system. Ante, at 124. This argument cannot be squared with the District Court's fnding that the challenged racial testimony was \"de minimis.\" 2014 WL 11310152, *5. It also ignores the fact that petitioner's own counsel elicited the testimony. The majority obscures this point by citing cases concerning al- 1 That is especially true given that Dr. Quijano's testimony is relevant to the Rule 60(b)(6) inquiry, under the majority's reasoning, only insofar as it was prejudicial. See ante, at 123 (\"[O]ur holding on prejudice makes clear that Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race\"). As I have explained, the testimony was not prejudicial. Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 135 Thomas, J., dissenting leged racial discrimination by an agent of the state. See ante, at 124 (citing, e. g., Davis v. Ayala, 576 U. S. 257 (2015) (addressing the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes and holding that any constitutional error was harmless)). There, the injury to public confdence derives from the fact that the government itself is discriminating against the de-fendant. The same cannot be said, however, when defense counsel introduces harmful testimony or makes a bad strate-gic choice. 2 In conjunction with its observations about race, the Court notes that the Texas attorney general, in response to similar testimony from Dr. Quijano in another case, issued a press release decrying the use of race in the justice system and subsequently waived all procedural obstacles to resentencing in several cases in which Dr. Quijano testifed. But Texas had good reason for treating this case differently from the others. Of those cases, this is the only one where \"it can be said that the responsibility for eliciting the offensive testi-mony lay squarely with the defense.\" Buck v. Thaler , 565 U. S. 1022, 1025 (2011) (Alito , J., statement respecting denial of certiorari). Lastly, the Court belittles Texas' claimed interest in fnal- ity. In the majority's view, Texas effectively forfeited its fnality interest when it waived its procedural defenses in purportedly similar cases. See ante, at 126. But Texas did not waive its procedural defenses in this case, and, in any event, Texas is not alone in possessing an interest in the fnality of petitioner's sentence. Society at large has the same interest. Finality advances values \"essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.\" Teague v. Lane , 489 U. S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion). It promotes the law's deterrent effect; it provides peace of mind to a wrong- 2 Although the prosecution on cross-examination asked Dr. Quijano a single question about his views on race, the question arose in the course of canvassing his expert report, and did not extend beyond the testimony already elicited by the defense. App. 170a. 136 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting doer's victims; it promotes public confdence in the justice system; it conserves limited public resources; and it ensures the clarity of legal rights and statuses. The Court's fnality analysis also ignores the lengthy pas- sage of time (nearly eight years) between the District Court's original rejection of habeas relief in this case and petitioner's fling of the instant Rule 60(b)(6) motion. See Gonzalez, 545 U. S., at 542, n. 4 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"In cases where signifcant time has elapsed between a habeas judgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within a district court's discretion to leave such a judg-ment in repose\"). Permitting a defendant to fle a Rule 60(b) motion years after the fact functionally eviscerates the statute of limitations contained in the Antiterrorism and Ef-fective Death Penalty Act of 1996, thereby undermining its purpose of \"lend[ing] fnality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.\" Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205- 206 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). II Despite its errors, today's opinion should have little effect on the broader law, for two reasons. For one thing, the Court's reasoning is highly factbound, and the facts pre-sented here are unlikely to arise again. For another, al-though the majority misapplies settled principles, it does not purport to actually alter any of those principles. A This is an unusual case, and the majority's single-minded focus on according relief to this petitioner on these facts nat- urally limits the reach of its decision. In cases presenting different facts, today's decision will provide little guidance. The Court's ultimate conclusion relies on the convergence of three critical factors that will rarely, if ever, recur. See ante, at 121 (describing this case as involving an \"unusual confuence of factors\" that together create a \"perfect storm\"). Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 137 Thomas, J., dissenting First, the Court places special weight on the fact that this is a capital case. See, e. g., ante, at 125 (noting \"the capital nature of this case\" as a factor favoring Rule 60(b)(6) relief (internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, the Court notes that the testimony at issue was expressly racial and suggested that petitioner was more deserving of the death penalty because he is black. See, e. g., ante, at 123 (\"Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race. . . . [T]his is a disturbing departure from a basic premise of our criminal justice system\"). 3 Third, the Court explains that the state attorney general took the \"remarkable steps,\" ante, at 125, of publicly declaring that Dr. Quijano's testimony in this case was inappropriate and waiving all procedural defenses to resentencing in similar cases. See, e. g., ante, at 124 (\"The extraordinary nature of this case is confrmed by what the State itself did in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony\"). B The effect of today's decision is also limited for a second reason. Although the majority misapplies many existing doctrines, it refrains from announcing any new principles of law. In particular, it leaves untouched\u2014and courts should accordingly continue to apply as usual\u2014established princi-ples governing collateral review, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, and Rule 60(b)(6) motions. At the outset, the opinion leaves intact Miller-El's well- worn COA standard for habeas petitions: Courts of appeals should deny applications when the district court's ruling is not \"debatabl[y]\" wrong. 537 U. S., at 336; see ante, at 115. \"A prisoner seeking a COA must prove something more than 3 Dr. Quijano also testifed that petitioner was more likely to be danger- ous in the future because he is male. Petitioner does not claim that this testimony renders his case extraordinary, and the Court does not so hold. Any such claim would fnd no support in today's decision, given the impor-tance of the racial nature of the testimony at issue to the Court's reasoning. 138 BUCK v. DAVIS Thomas, J., dissenting the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith on his or her part.\" 537 U. S., at 338 (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts have substantial discretion in de-ciding how to structure this inquiry. See ante, at 117 (\"We do not mean to specify what procedures may be appropriate in every case\"). The Court also reaffrms the \" `highly deferential' \" charac- ter of the Strickland standard. Harrington, 562 U. S., at 105 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689); see, e. g., ante, at 118 (frst prong of Strickland \"sets a high bar\"). Courts applying Strickland must respect \"the constitutionally pro- tected independence of counsel and the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\" Cullen v. Pinhol- ster, 563 U. S. 170, 195 (2011) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Counsel should be \"strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all signif-cant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judg-ment.\" Id., at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted). And a defendant can show prejudice only if the likelihood of a different result would have been \"substantial, not just conceivable.\" Harrington, supra, at 112. Perhaps most signifcantly, the test for reopening judg- ments under Rule 60(b)(6) remains the same. A \" `very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the fnality of judgments is to be preserved.' \" Gonzalez, supra, at 535 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 873 (1988) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting)). A dis- trict court may grant relief only if the movant can show \"ex-traordinary circumstances,\" which \"will rarely occur in the habeas context.\" 545 U. S., at 535 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 112-113. A change in law alone is not enough. See 545 U. S., at 536-537. And a district court's decision to deny relief is subject to only \"limited and deferen-tial\" appellate review. Id., at 535. Although petitioner argues that the change in law effected by Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Tha-Cite as: 580 U. S. 100 (2017) 139 Thomas, J., dissenting ler, 569 U. S. 413 (2013), is central to the Rule 60(b)(6) in- quiry, see Brief for Petitioner 56; Reply Brief 19, the Court does not even count those decisions in its tally of extraordi-nary circumstances. Instead, it treats a potentially viable Martinez claim as a \"precondition\" to relief. Ante, at 126. This makes sense: Unless petitioner has the ability to invoke Martinez and Trevino , reopening the judgment would be fu- tile. For those in petitioner's position, the absence of a po-tentially valid Martinez claim is disqualifying, but the pres- ence of one does nothing to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances. III Finally, the Court's opinion does not require the lower courts to refexively accord relief to petitioner on remand. In order to succeed under Martinez and Trevino , petitioner must establish that his state habeas counsel was constitu-tionally ineffective for failing to raise a Strickland claim as to his trial counsel. Today's decision does not address that showing, and the court on remand should not treat it as a foregone conclusion. I respectfully dissent. 140 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Syllabus LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. et al. v. PROMEGA CORP. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit No. 14-1538. Argued December 6, 2016\u2014Decided February 22, 2017 Respondent Promega Corporation sublicensed the Tautz patent, which claims a toolkit for genetic testing, to petitioner Life Technologies Cor- poration and its subsidiaries (collectively Life Technologies) for the man-ufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement felds worldwide. One of the kit's fve components, an enzyme known as the Taq polymerase, was manufactured by Life Technologies in the United States and then shipped to the United Kingdom, where the four other components were made, for combination there. When Life Tech-nologies began selling the kits outside the licensed felds of use, Pro-mega sued, claiming that patent infringement liability was triggered under \u00a7 271(f)(1) of the Patent Act, which prohibits the supply from the United States of \"all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention\" for combination abroad. The jury returned a ver-dict for Promega, but the District Court granted Life Technologies' mo-tion for judgment as a matter of law, holding that \u00a7 271(f)(1)'s phrase \"all or a substantial portion\" did not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention. The Federal Circuit re-versed. It determined that a single important component could consti-tute a \"substantial portion\" of the components of an invention under \u00a7 271(f)(1) and found the Taq polymerase to be such a component. Held: The supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad does not give rise to \u00a7 271(f)(1) liability. Pp. 145- 152. (a) portion\" refers to a quanti- tative measurement. Although the Patent Act itself does not defne the term \"substantial,\" and the term's ordinary meaning may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size, the statutory context points to a quantitative meaning. Neighboring words \"all\" and \"portion\" convey a quantitative meaning, and nothing in the neighboring text points to a qualitative interpretation. Moreover, a qualitative reading would render the modifying phrase \"of the components\" unnec-essary the frst time it is used in \u00a7 271(f)(1). Only the quantitative ap-proach thus gives meaning to each statutory provision. Promega's proffered \"case-specifc approach,\" which would require a factfnder to decipher whether the components at issue are a \"substan-Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 141 Syllabus tial portion\" under either a qualitative or a quantitative test, is rejected. Tasking juries with interpreting the statute's meaning on an ad hoc basis would only compound, not resolve, the statute's ambiguity. And Promega's proposal to adopt an analytical framework that accounts for both the components' quantitative and qualitative aspects is likely to complicate rather than aid the factfnder's review. Pp. 145-149. (b) Under a quantitative approach, a single component cannot consti- tute a \"substantial portion\" triggering is reinforced by \u00a7 271(f)'s text, context, and structure. Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to the plural \"components,\" indicating that multiple components make up the substantial portion. Reading \u00a7 271(f)(1) to cover any single component would also leave little room for \u00a7 271(f)(2), which refers to \"any component,\" and would undermine \u00a7 271(f)(2)'s express reference to a single component \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\" The better reading allows the two provisions to work in tandem and gives each provision its unique application. Pp. 149-151. (c) The history of \u00a7 271(f) further bolsters this conclusion. Congress enacted \u00a7 271(f) in response to Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, to fll a gap in the enforceability of patent rights by reach-ing components that are manufactured in the United States but assem-bled overseas. Consistent with Congress' intent, a supplier may be lia-ble under \u00a7 271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of the invention or under \u00a7 271(f)(2) for supplying a single component if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity. But, as here, when a product is made abroad and all com-ponents but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, the activity is outside the statute's scope. Pp. 151-152. 773 F. 3d 1338, reversed and remanded.

Section 271(f)(1) of the Patent Act of 1952 prohibits the supply from the United States of \"all or a substantial portion\" of the components of a patented invention for combination abroad. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(f)(1).

S. 927 (2016). We hold that a single component does not constitute a substantial portion of the components that can give rise to liability under \u00a7 271(f)(1). Because only a single component of the patented invention at issue here was supplied from the United States, we reverse and remand. *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were fled for Agilent Technolo- gies, Inc., by John M.

S. 140 (2017) 143 Opinion of the Court I A We begin with an overview of the patent in dispute. Al- though the science behind the patent is complex, a basic un- derstanding suffces to resolve the question presented by this case. The Tautz patent, U. S. Reissue Patent No. RE 37,984, claims a toolkit for genetic testing. 1 The kit is used to take small samples of genetic material\u2014in the form of nucleotide sequences that make up the molecule deoxyribonucleic acid (commonly referred to as \"DNA\")\u2014and then synthesize mul-tiple copies of a particular nucleotide sequence. This proc-ess of copying, known as amplifcation, generates DNA pro-fles that can be used by law enforcement agencies for forensic identifcation and by clinical and research institu-tions around the world. For purposes of this litigation, the parties agree that the kit covered by the Tautz patent con-tains fve components: (1) a mixture of primers that mark the part of the DNA strand to be copied; (2) nucleotides for forming replicated strands of DNA; (3) an enzyme known as Taq polymerase; (4) a buffer solution for the amplifcation; and (5) control DNA. 2 Respondent Promega Corporation was the exclusive li- censee of the Tautz patent. Petitioner Life Technologies Corporation manufactured genetic testing kits. 3 During the 1 The Tautz patent expired in 2015. The litigation thus concerns past acts of infringement only. 2 Because the parties here agree that the patented invention is made up of only these fve components, we do not consider how to identify the \"components\" of a patent or whether and how that inquiry relates to the elements of a patent claim. 3 Applied Biosystems, LLC, and Invitrogen IP Holdings, Inc., are also petitioners in this proceeding and are wholly owned subsidiaries of Life Technologies Corporation. The agreement at issue here was originally between Promega and Applied Biosystems . 773 F. 3d 1338, 1344, n. 3 (CA Fed. 2014). 144 LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. v. PROMEGA CORP. Opinion of the Court timeframe relevant here, Promega sublicensed the Tautz pat- ent to Life Technologies for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement felds world-wide. Life Technologies manufactured all but one compo-nent of the kits in the United Kingdom. It manufactured that component\u2014the Taq polymerase\u2014in the United States. Life Technologies shipped the Taq polymerase to its United Kingdom facility, where it was combined with the other four components of the kit. Four years into the agreement, Promega sued Life Tech- nologies on the grounds that Life Technologies had infringed the patent by selling the kits outside the licensed felds of use to clinical and research markets. As relevant here, Promega alleged that Life Technologies' supply of the Taq polymerase from the United States to its United Kingdom manufacturing facilities triggered liability under \u00a7 271(f)(1). B At trial, the parties disputed the scope of \u00a7 271(f)(1)'s pro- hibition against supplying all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention from the United States for combination abroad. Section 271(f)(1)'s full text reads: \"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combina-tion of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combina-tion occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer .\" The jury returned a verdict for Promega, fnding that Life Technologies had willfully infringed the patent. Life Tech-nologies then moved for judgment as a matter of law, contend-ing that \u00a7 271(f)(1) did not apply to its conduct because the Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 145 Opinion of the Court phrase \"all or a substantial portion\" does not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention. The District Court granted Life Technologies' motion. The court agreed that there could be no infringement under \u00a7 271(f)(1) because Promega's evidence at trial \"showed at most that one component of all of the accused products, [the Taq] polymerase, was supplied from the United States.\" 2012 WL 12862829, *3 (WD Wis., Sept. 13, 2012) (Crabb, J.). Section 271(f)(1)'s reference to \"a substantial portion of the components,\" the District Court ruled, does not embrace the supply of a single component. Id., at *5. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and reinstated the jury's verdict fnding Life Technologies liable for infringement. 4 773 F. 3d 1338, 1353 (2014). As relevant here, the court held that \"there are circumstances in which a party may be liable under \u00a7 271(f)(1) for supplying or causing to be supplied a single component for combination outside the United States.\" Ibid. The Federal Circuit concluded that the dictionary defnition of \"substantial\" is \"important\" or \"essential,\" which it read to suggest that a single important component can be a \" `substantial portion of the compo-nents' \" of a patented invention. Ibid. Relying in part on expert trial testimony that the Taq polymerase is a \" `main' \" and \" `major' \" component of the kits, the court ruled that the single Taq polymerase component was a substantial compo- nent as the term is used in \u00a7 271(f)(1). Id., at 1356. II The question before us is whether the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention is an infringing act under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(f)(1). We hold that it is not. 4 Chief Judge Prost dissented from the majority's conclusion with re- spect to the \"active inducement\" element of 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(f)(1). 773 F. 3d, at 1358-1360. Neither that question, nor any of the Federal Cir- cuit's conclusions regarding Life Technologies' liability under \u00a7 271(a) or infringement of four additional Promega patents, see id., at 1341, is before us. See 579 U. S. 927 (2016). 146 LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. v. PROMEGA CORP. Opinion of the Court A The threshold determination to be made is whether \u00a7 271(f)(2)'s requirement of \"a substantial portion\" of the components of a patented invention refers to a quantitative or qualitative measurement. Life Technologies and the United States argue that the text of \u00a7 271(f)(1) establishes a quantitative threshold, and that the threshold must be greater than one. Promega defends the Federal Circuit's reading of the statute, arguing that a \"substantial portion\" of the components includes a single component if that compo-nent is suffciently important to the invention. We look frst to the text of the statute. Sebelius v. Cloer , 569 U. S. 369, 376 (2013). The Patent Act itself does not de-fne the term \"substantial,\" and so we turn to its ordinary meaning. Ibid. Here we fnd little help. All agree the term is ambiguous and, taken in isolation, might refer to an important portion or to a large portion. Brief for Petition-ers 16; Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12. \"Substantial,\" as it is commonly under- stood, may refer either to qualitative importance or to quan-titatively large size. See, e. g., Webster's Third New Inter- national Dictionary 2280 (defs. 1c, 2c) (1981) (Webster's Third) (\"important, essential,\" or \"considerable in amount, value, or worth\"); 17 Oxford English Dictionary 67 (defs. 5a, 9) (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\"That is, constitutes, or involves an essential part, point, or feature; essential, material,\" or \"Of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or dimensions\"). The context in which \"substantial\" appears in the statute, however, points to a quantitative meaning here. Its neigh-boring terms are the frst clue. \"[A] word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\" United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008). Both \"all\" and \"portion\" convey a quantitative meaning. \"All\" means the entire quantity, without refer-ence to relative importance. See, e. g., Webster's Third 54 (defs. 1a, 2a, 3) (\"that is the whole amount or quantity of,\" Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 147 Opinion of the Court or \"every member or individual component of,\" or \"the whole number or sum of\"); 1 OED 324 (def. 2) (\"The entire number of; the individual components of, without exception\"). \"Por-tion\" likewise refers to some quantity less than all. Web-ster's Third 1768 (defs. 1, 3a) (\"an individual's part of something,\" or \"a part of a whole\"); 12 OED 154, 155 (defs. 1a, 5a) (\"The part (of anything) allotted or belonging to one per-son,\" or \"A part of any whole\"). Conversely, there is nothing in the neighboring text to ground a qualitative interpretation. Moreover, the phrase \"substantial portion\" is modifed by \"of the components of a patented invention.\" It is the sup- ply of all or a substantial portion \"of the components\" of a patented invention that triggers liability for infringement. But if \"substantial\" has a qualitative meaning, then the more natural way to write the opening clause of the provision would be to not reference \"the components\" at all. Instead, the opening clause of \u00a7 271(f)(1) could have triggered liability for the supply of \"all or a substantial portion of . . . a pat-ented invention, where [its] components are uncombined in whole or in part.\" A qualitative reading would render the phrase \"of the components\" unnecessary the frst time it is used in \u00a7 271(f)(1). Whenever possible, however, we should favor an interpretation that gives meaning to each statutory provision. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004). Only the quantitative approach does so here. Thus, \"sub-stantial,\" in the context of \u00a7 271(f)(1), is most reasonably read to connote a quantitative measure. Promega argues that a quantitative approach is too nar- row, and invites the Court to instead adopt a \"case-specifc\" approach that would require a factfnder to decipher whether the components at issue are a \"substantial portion\" under either a qualitative or quantitative test. Brief for Respond- ent 17, 42. We decline to do so. Having determined the phrase \"substantial portion\" is ambiguous, our task is to re-solve that ambiguity, not to compound it by tasking juries across the Nation with interpreting the meaning of the stat-148 LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. v. PROMEGA CORP. Opinion of the Court ute on an ad hoc basis. See, e. g., Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 345-346 (1997). As a more general matter, moreover, we cannot accept Promega's suggestion that the Court adopt a different ana- lytical framework entirely\u2014one that accounts for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the components. Promega reads \u00a7 271(f)(1) to mean that the answer to whether a given portion of the components is \"substantial\" depends not only on the number of components involved but also on their qualitative importance to the invention overall. At frst blush, there is some appeal to the idea that, in close cases, a subjective analysis of the qualitative importance of a component may help determine whether it is a \"substantial portion\" of the components of a patent. But, for the reasons discussed above, the statute's structure provides little sup-port for a qualitative interpretation of the term. 5 Nor would considering the qualitative importance of a component necessarily help resolve close cases. To the con-trary, it might just as easily complicate the factfnder's re-view. Surely a great many components of an invention (if not every component) are important. Few inventions, in-cluding the one at issue here, would function at all without any one of their components. Indeed, Promega has not iden-tifed any component covered by the Tautz patent that would not satisfy Promega's \"importance\" litmus test. 6 How are courts\u2014or, for that matter, market participants attempting to avoid liability\u2014to determine the relative importance of 5 The examples Promega provides of other statutes' use of the terms \"substantial\" or \"signifcant\" are inapposite. See Brief for Respondent 19-20. The text of these statutes, which arise in different statutory schemes with diverse purposes and structures, differs in material ways from the text of \u00a7 271(f)(1). The Tax Code, for instance, refers to \"a sub-stantial portion of a return,\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 7701(a)(36)(A), not to \"a substan-tial portion of the entries of a return.\" 6 Life Technologies' expert described the Taq polymerase as a \"main\" component. App. 160. The expert also described two other components the same way. Ibid. Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 149 Opinion of the Court the components of an invention? Neither Promega nor the Federal Circuit offers an easy way to make this decision. Accordingly, we conclude that a quantitative interpretation hews most closely to the text of the statute and provides an administrable construction. B Having determined that the term \"substantial portion\" re- fers to a quantitative measurement, we must next decide whether, as a matter of law, a single component can ever constitute a \"substantial portion\" so as to trigger liability under \u00a7 271(f)(1). The answer is no. As before, we begin with the text of the statute. Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to \"components\" in the plural. The section is targeted toward the supply of all or a substan-tial portion \"of the components,\" where \"such components\" are uncombined, in a manner that actively induces the com-bination of \"such components\" outside the United States. Text specifying a substantial portion of \"components,\" plu-ral, indicates that multiple components constitute the sub-stantial portion. The structure of \u00a7 271(f) reinforces this reading. Section 271(f)(2), which is \u00a7 271(f)(1)'s companion provision, reads as follows: \"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or espe-cially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substan-tial noninfringing use, where such component is uncom-bined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such compo-nent will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combina-tion occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\" 150 LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. v. PROMEGA CORP. Opinion of the Court Reading \u00a7 271(f)(1) to refer to more than one component allows the two provisions to work in tandem. Whereas \u00a7 271(f)(1) refers to \"components,\" plural, \u00a7 component,\" singular. And, whereas \u00a7 271(f)(1) speaks to whether the components supplied by a party constitute a substantial portion of the components, \u00a7 271(f)(2) speaks to whether a party has supplied \"any\" noncommodity compo-nent \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\" We do not disagree with the Federal Circuit's observation that the two provisions concern different scenarios. See 773 F. 3d, at 1354. As this Court has previously observed, \u00a7\u00a7 271(f)(1) and (f)(2) \"differ, among other things, on the quantity of components that must be `supplie[d] . . . from the United States' for liability to attach.\" Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 454, n. 16 (2007). But we do not draw the Federal Circuit's conclusion from these different but related provisions. Reading \u00a7 271(f)(1) to cover any sin- gle component would not only leave little room for \u00a7 271(f)(2) but would also undermine \u00a7 271(f)(2)'s express reference to a single component \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\" 7 Our conclusion that \u00a7 271(f)(1) pro- hibits the supply of components, plural, gives each subsec- tion its unique application.8 See, e. g., Cloer , 569 U. S., at 376. 7 This Court's opinion in Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 447 (2007), is not to the contrary. The holding in that case turned not on the number of components involved, but rather on whether the software at issue was a component at all. 8 Promega argues that the important distinction between these provi- sions is that \u00a7 271(f)(1), unlike \u00a7 271(f)(2), requires a showing of specifc intent for active inducement. Brief for Respondent 34-41. But cf. Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563 U. S. 754, 765-766 (2011) (substantially equating the intent requirements for \u00a7\u00a7 271(b) and (c), on which Promega asserts \u00a7\u00a7 271(f)(1) and (f)(2) were modeled). But, to re-peat, whatever intent subsection (f)(1) may require, it also imposes liabil-ity only on a party who supplies a \"substantial portion of the components\" Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 151 Opinion of the Court Taken alone, \u00a7 271(f)(1)'s reference to \"components\" might plausibly be read to encompass \"component\" in the singular. See 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1 (instructing that \"words importing the plu-ral include the singular,\" \"unless the context indicates other-wise\"). But \u00a7 271(f)'s text, context, and structure leave us to conclude that when Congress said \"components,\" plural, it meant plural, and when it said \"component,\" singular, it meant singular. We do not today defne how close to \"all\" of the compo- nents \"a substantial portion\" must be. We hold only that one component does not constitute \"all or a substantial por-tion\" of a multicomponent invention under \u00a7 271(f)(1). This is all that is required to resolve the question presented. C The history of \u00a7 271(f) bolsters our conclusion. The Court has previously observed that Congress enacted \u00a7 271(f) in response to our decision in Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Lai- tram Corp., 406 U. S. 518 (1972). See Microsoft Corp., 550 U. S., at 444. In Deepsouth, the Court determined that, under patent law as it existed at the time, it was \"not an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\" 406 U. S., at 527. The new \u00a7 271(f) \"ex-pand[ed] the defnition of infringement to include supplying from the United States a patented invention's components,\" as outlined in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2). Microsoft, 550 U. S., at 444-445. The effect of this provision was to fll a gap in the enforce- ability of patent rights by reaching components that are manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas of the invention. Thus, even assuming that subsection (f)(1)'s \"active in- ducement\" and \"intending\" element\u2014a question we do not reach today\u2014that difference between the two provisions does not read the \"substantial portion\" lan-guage out of the statute. 152 LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. v. PROMEGA CORP. Opinion of Alito, J. and that were beyond the reach of the statute in its prior formulation. Our ruling today comports with Congress' in-tent. A supplier may be liable under \u00a7 271(f)(1) for supply- ing from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components (plural) of the invention, even when those components are combined abroad. The same is true even for a single component under \u00a7 271(f)(2) if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity. We are persuaded, however, that when as in this case a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, this activity is outside the scope of the statute. III We hold that the phrase \"substantial portion\" in 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(f)(1) has a quantitative, not a qualitative, meaning. We hold further that \u00a7 271(f)(1) does not cover the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case. Justice Alito , with whom Justice Thomas joins, con- curring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join all but Part II-C of the Court's opinion. It is clear from the text of 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(f) that Congress intended not only to fll the gap created by Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518 (1972)\u2014where all of the compo- nents of the invention were manufactured in the United States, id., at 524\u2014but to go at least a little further. How much further is the question in this case, and the genesis of \u00a7 271(f) sheds no light on that question. Cite as: 580 U. S. 140 (2017) 153 Opinion of Alito, J. I note, in addition, that while the Court holds that a single component cannot constitute a substantial portion of an in- vention's components for \u00a7 271(f)(1) purposes, I do not read the opinion to suggest that any number greater than one is suffcient. In other words, today's opinion establishes that more than one component is necessary, but does not address how much more. 154 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Syllabus FRY et vir , as next friends of minor E. F. v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit No. 15-497. Argued October 31, 2016\u2014Decided February 22, 2017 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment to furnish a \"free appro- priate public education\" (FAPE) to children with certain disabilities, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A), and establishes formal administrative proce- dures for resolving disputes between parents and schools concerning the provision of a FAPE. Other federal statutes also protect the interests of children with disabilities, including Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, this Court considered the interaction be- tween those other laws and the IDEA, holding that the IDEA was \"the exclusive avenue\" through which a child with a disability could chal-lenge the adequacy of his education. Id., at 1009. Congress responded by passing the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, overturn-ing Smith's preclusion of non-IDEA claims and adding a carefully de- fned exhaustion provision. Under that provision, a plaintiff bringing suit under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws \"seeking relief that is also available under [the IDEA]\" must frst exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures. \u00a7 1415( l). Petitioner E. F. is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy; a trained service dog named Wonder assists her with various daily life activities. When E. F.'s parents, petitioners Stacy and Brent Fry, sought permission for Wonder to join E. F. in kindergarten, offcials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused. The offcials reasoned that the human aide provided as part of E. F.'s individualized education program rendered the dog superfuous. In response, the Frys removed E. F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her. They also fled a com-plaint with the Department of Education's Offce for Civil Rights (OCR), claiming that the exclusion of E. F.'s service animal violated her rights under Title II and \u00a7 504. OCR agreed, and school offcials invited E. F. to return to Ezra Eby with Wonder. But the Frys, concerned about resentment from school offcials, instead enrolled E. F. in a different school that welcomed the service dog. The Frys then fled this suit in federal court against Ezra Eby's local and regional school districts and principal (collectively, the school districts), alleging that they violated Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 155 Syllabus Title II and \u00a7 504 and seeking declaratory and monetary relief. The District Court granted the school districts' motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \u00a7 1415( l) required the Frys to frst exhaust the IDEA's ad- ministrative procedures. The Sixth Circuit affrmed, reasoning that \u00a7 1415( l) applies whenever a plaintiff's alleged harms are \"educational\" in nature. Held: 1. Exhaustion of the IDEA's administrative procedures is unneces- sary where the gravamen of the plaintiff's suit is something other than the denial of the IDEA's core guarantee of a FAPE. Pp. 165-174. (a) The language of \u00a7 1415( l) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \"relief\" that is \"available\" under the IDEA. Establishing the scope of \u00a7 1415( l), then, requires identifying the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress or access a beneft. That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme. The IDEA's stated purpose and specifc commands center on ensuring a FAPE for children with disabilities. And the IDEA's admin-istrative procedures test whether a school has met this obligation: Any decision by a hearing offcer on a request for substantive relief \"shall\" be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a free appro-priate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i). Accordingly, \u00a7 1415( l)'s ex- haustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE. If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \u00a7 1415( l) merely by bringing the suit under a statute other than the IDEA. But if the remedy sought in a suit brought under a different statute is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA's procedures is not required. Pp. 165-169. (b) In determining whether a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE, what matters is the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint, set-ting aside any attempts at artful pleading. That inquiry makes central the plaintiff's own claims, as \u00a7 1415( l) explicitly requires in asking whether a lawsuit in fact \"seeks\" relief available under the IDEA. But examination of a plaintiff's complaint should consider substance, not sur-face: Section 1415( l) requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a com- plaint seeks redress for a school's failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way. In addressing whether a complaint fts that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities. The IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services for children with disabilities, while Title II and \u00a7 504 promise nondiscriminatory ac-cess to public institutions for people with disabilities of all ages. That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate 156 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Syllabus all three statutes. But still, these statutory differences mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \u00a7 504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA's FAPE obligation. One clue to the gravamen of a complaint can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions. First, could the plaintiff have brought essen-tially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school? Second, could an adult at the school have pressed essentially the same grievance? When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject. But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE. A further sign of the gravamen of a suit can emerge from the history of the proceedings. Prior pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies may provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term. Pp. 169-174. 2. This case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for a proper analysis of whether the gravamen of E. F.'s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE. The Frys' complaint alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E. F.'s school provided. Instead, the Frys have maintained that the school districts infringed E. F.'s right to equal access\u2014even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements. But the possibility remains that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different. The parties have not addressed whether the Frys initially pursued the IDEA's ad-ministrative remedies, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts. On remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA's dispute resolution process before fling suit. And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.

NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court section states that if a suit brought under such a law \"seek[s] relief that is also available under\" the IDEA, the plaintiff must frst exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures. In this case, we consider the scope of that exhaustion re-quirement. We hold that exhaustion is not necessary when the gravamen of the plaintiff's suit is something other than the denial of the IDEA's core guarantee\u2014what the Act calls a \"free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). I A The IDEA offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a \"free appropriate public educa-tion\"\u2014more concisely known as a FAPE\u2014to all children with certain physical or intellectual disabilities. Ibid.; see \u00a7 1401(3)(A)(i) (listing covered disabilities). As defned in the Act, a FAPE comprises \"special education and related services\"\u2014both \"instruction\" \"unique needs\" \"supportive services\" to beneft from that instruction. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(9), (26), (29); see Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley , 458 U. S. 176, 203 (1982). An eligible child, as this Court has explained, acquires a \"substantive right\" to such an education once a State accepts the IDEA's fnancial assistance. Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1010 (1984). Under the IDEA, an \"individualized education program,\" called an IEP for short, serves as the \"primary vehicle\" for providing each child with the promised FAPE. Honig v. Doe, 484 U. S. 305, 311 (1988); see \u00a7 1414(d). (Welcome to\u2014 and apologies for\u2014the legisla-tion.) Crafted by a child's \"IEP Team\"\u2014a group of school offcials, teachers, and parents\u2014the IEP spells out a person-alized plan to meet all of the child's \"educational needs.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II)(bb), (d)(1)(B). Most notably, child's current \"levels of academic achieve-Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 159 Opinion of the Court ment,\" specifes \"measurable annual goals\" for how she can \"make progress in the general education curriculum,\" and lists the \"special education and related services\" to be pro-vided so that she can \"advance appropriately toward [those] goals.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I), (II), (IV)(aa). Because parents and school representatives sometimes cannot agree on such issues, the IDEA establishes formal procedures for resolving disputes. To begin, a dissatisfed parent may fle a complaint as to any matter concerning the provision of a FAPE with the local or state educational agency (as state law provides). See \u00a7 1415(b)(6). That pleading generally triggers a \"[p]reliminary meeting\" involv-ing the contending parties, \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i); at their option, the parties may instead (or also) pursue a full-fedged me-diation process, see \u00a7 1415(e). Assuming their impasse con-tinues, the matter proceeds to a \"due process hearing\" before an impartial hearing officer. \u00a7 1415(f )(1)(A); see \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(A)(i). Any decision of the offcer granting sub-stantive relief must be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a [FAPE].\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i). If the hearing is initially conducted at the local level, the ruling is appealable to the state agency. See \u00a7 1415(g). Finally, a parent unhappy with the outcome of the administrative proc-ess may seek judicial review by fling a civil action in state or federal court. See \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). Important as the IDEA is for children with disabilities, it is not the only federal statute protecting their interests. Of particular relevance to this case are two antidiscrimination laws\u2014Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12131 et seq., and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 794\u2014which cover both adults and children with disabilities, in both public schools and other settings. Title II forbids any \"public entity\" from discriminating based on disability; \u00a7 504 applies the same prohibition to any federally funded \"program or activity.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132; 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 794(a). A regulation implementing Title II re-160 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court quires a public entity to make \"reasonable modifcations\" to its \"policies, practices, or procedures\" when necessary to avoid such discrimination. 28 CFR \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) (2016); see, e. g., Alboniga v. School of Broward Cty., 87 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1345 (SD Fla. 2015) (requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under Title II). In similar vein, courts have interpreted \u00a7 504 as demanding certain \"reasonable\" modifcations to existing practices in order to \"accommodate\" persons with disabilities. Alexander v. Choate , 469 U. S. 287, 299-300 (1985); see, e. g., Sullivan v. Vallejo City Unifed School Dist., 731 F. Supp. 947, 961-962 (ED Cal. 1990) (requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under \u00a7 504). And both statutes authorize individuals to seek redress for violations of their substantive guarantees by bringing suits for injunctive relief or money damages. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12133. This Court frst considered the interaction between such laws and the IDEA in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992. 1 The plaintiffs there sought \"to secure a `free appropriate public education' for [their] handicapped child.\" Id., at 994. But instead of bringing suit under the IDEA alone, they ap-pended \"virtually identical\" claims (again alleging the denial of a \"free appropriate public education\") under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 1009; see id., at 1016. The Court held that the IDEA altogether foreclosed those additional claims: With its \"comprehensive\" and \"carefully tailored\" provisions, the Act was \"the exclusive avenue\" through which a child with a disability (or his parents) could chal-lenge the adequacy of his education. Id., at 1009; see id., at 1013, 1016, 1021. 1 At the time (and until 1990), the IDEA was called the Education of the Handicapped Act, or EHA. See \u00a7 901(a), 104 Stat. 1141-1142 (renaming the statute). To avoid confusion\u2014and acronym overload\u2014we refer throughout this opinion only to the IDEA. Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 161 Opinion of the Court Congress was quick to respond. In the Handicapped Chil- dren's Protection Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 796, it overturned Smith's preclusion of non-IDEA claims while also adding a carefully defned exhaustion requirement. Now codifed at 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415( l), the relevant provision of that statute reads: \"Nothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the [ADA], title V of the Reha-bilitation Act [including \u00a7 504], or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities, except that before the fling of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under [the IDEA], the [IDEA's administrative procedures] shall be ex-hausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under [the IDEA].\" The frst half of \"except that\") \"reaffrm[s] the viability\" of federal statutes like the ADA or Rehabilita-tion Act \"as separate vehicles,\" no less integral than the IDEA, \"for ensuring the rights of handicapped children.\" H. R. Rep. No. 99-296, p. 4 (1985); see id., at 6. According to that opening phrase, the IDEA does not prevent a plaintiff from asserting claims under such laws even if, as in Smith itself, those claims allege the denial of an appropriate public education (much as an IDEA claim would). But the second half of \u00a7 1415( l) (from \"except that\" onward) imposes a limit on that \"anything goes\" regime, in the form of an exhaustion provision. According to that closing phrase, a plaintiff bringing suit under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or sim-ilar laws must in certain circumstances\u2014that is, when \"seek-ing relief that is also available under\" the IDEA\u2014frst ex-haust the IDEA's administrative procedures. The reach of that requirement is the issue in this case. B Petitioner E. F. is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy, which \"signifcantly limits her motor skills and mobil-162 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court ity.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 6, Complaint \u00b619.2 When E. F. was fve years old, her parents\u2014petitioners Stacy and Brent Fry\u2014obtained a trained service dog for her, as rec- ommended by her pediatrician. The dog, a goldendoodle named Wonder, \"help[s E. F.] to live as independently as possible\" by assisting her with various life activities. Id., at 2, \u00b63. In particular, Wonder aids E. F. by \"retrieving dropped items, helping her balance when she uses her walker, opening and closing doors, turning on and off lights, helping her take off her coat, [and] helping her transfer to and from the toilet.\" Id., at 7, \u00b627. But when the Frys sought permission for Wonder to join E. F. in kindergarten, offcials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused the request. Under E. F.'s existing IEP, a human aide provided E. F. with one-on-one support through-out the day; that two-legged assistance, the school offcials thought, rendered Wonder superfuous. In the words of one administrator, Wonder should be barred from Ezra Eby be-cause all of E. F.'s \"physical and academic needs [were] being met through the services/programs/accommodations\" that the school had already agreed to. Id., at 8, \u00b633. Later that year, the school offcials briefy allowed Wonder to accom-pany E. F. to school on a trial basis; but even then, \"the dog was required to remain in the back of the room during classes, and was forbidden from assisting [E. F.] with many tasks he had been specifcally trained to do.\" Ibid., \u00b635. And when the trial period concluded, the administrators again informed the Frys that Wonder was not welcome. As a result, the Frys removed E. F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her. 2 Because this case comes to us on review of a motion to dismiss E. F.'s suit, we accept as true all facts pleaded in her complaint. See Leather- man v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993). Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 163 Opinion of the Court In addition, the Frys fled a complaint with the U. S. Department of Education's Offce for Civil Rights (OCR), charging that Ezra Eby's exclusion of E. F.'s service ani-mal violated her rights under Title II of the ADA and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Following an investiga-tion, OCR agreed. The offce explained in its decision letter that a school's obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services: A school could offer a FAPE to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws' ban on discrimination. See App. 30-32. And here, OCR found, Ezra Eby had indeed violated that ban, even if its use of a human aide satisfed the FAPE standard. See id., at 35-36. OCR analogized the school's conduct to \"requir[ing] a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried\" by an aide or \"requir[ing] a blind student to be led [around by a] teacher\" instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane. Id., at 35. Regardless whether those\u2014or Ezra Eby's\u2014policies denied a FAPE, they violated Title II and \u00a7 504 by discriminating against children with disabilities. See id., at 35-36. In response to OCR's decision, school offcials at last agreed that E. F. could come to school with Wonder. But after meeting with Ezra Eby's principal, the Frys became concerned that the school administration \"would resent [E. F.] and make her return to school diffcult.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 10, \u00b648. Accordingly, the Frys found a different public school, in a different district, where adminis-trators and teachers enthusiastically received both E. F. and Wonder. C The Frys then fled this suit in federal court against the local and regional school districts in which Ezra Eby is lo- cated, along with the school's principal (collectively, the school districts). The complaint alleged that the school dis-164 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court tricts violated Title II of the ADA and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabili- tation Act by \"denying [E. F.] equal access\" to Ezra Eby and its programs, \"refus[ing] to reasonably accommodate\" E. F.'s use of a service animal, and otherwise \"discriminat[ing] against [E. F.] as a person with disabilities.\" Id., at 15, \u00b668, 17-18, \u00b6\u00b682-83. According to the complaint, E. F. suffered harm as a result of that discrimination, including \"emotional distress and pain, embarrassment, [and] mental anguish.\" Id., at 11-12, \u00b651. In their prayer for relief, the Frys sought a declaration that the school districts had violated Title II and \u00a7 504, along with money damages to compensate for E. F.'s injuries. The District Court granted the school districts' motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \u00a7 1415( l) required the Frys to frst exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 50. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affrmed on the same ground. In that court's view, \u00a7 1415( l) applies if \"the injuries [alleged in a suit] relate to the specifc substantive protections of the IDEA.\" 788 F. 3d 622, 625 (2015). And that means, the court continued, that exhaustion is necessary whenever \"the genesis and the manifestations\" of the complained-of harms were \"educational\" in nature. Id., at 627 (quoting Charlie F. v. Board of Ed. of Skokie School Dist. 68, 98 F. 3d 989, 993 (CA7 1996)). On that understanding of \u00a7 1415( l), the Sixth Circuit held, the Frys' suit could not proceed: Because the harms to E. F. were generally \"educational\"\u2014most notably, the court reasoned, because \"Wonder's absence hurt her sense of independence and social confdence at school\"\u2014the Frys had to exhaust the IDEA's procedures. 788 F. 3d, at 627. Judge Daughtrey dissented, emphasizing that in bring- ing their Title II and \u00a7 504 claims, the Frys \"did not allege the denial of a FAPE\" or \"seek to modify [E. F.'s] IEP in any way.\" Id., at 634. We granted certiorari to address confusion in the Courts of Appeals as to the scope of \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion requirement. Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 165 Opinion of the Court 579 U. S. 940 (2016).3 We now vacate the Sixth Circuit's decision. II Section 1415( l) requires that a plaintiff exhaust the IDEA's procedures before fling an action under the ADA, the Reha- bilitation Act, or similar laws when (but only when) her suit \"seek[s] relief that is also available\" under the IDEA. We frst hold that to meet that statutory standard, a suit must seek relief for the denial of a FAPE, because that is the only \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available.\" We next conclude that in determining whether a suit indeed \"seeks\" relief for such a denial, a court should look to the substance, or grava-men, of the plaintiff's complaint. 4 A In this Court, the parties have reached substantial agree- ment about what \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available\" for children with disabilities\u2014and about how the Sixth Circuit went wrong in addressing that question. The Frys maintain 3 See Payne v. Peninsula School Dist., 653 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (cataloguing different Circuits' understandings of \u00a7 1415( l)). In particular, the Ninth Circuit has criticized an approach similar to the Sixth Circuit's for \"treat[ing] \u00a7 1415( l) as a quasi-preemption provision, requir- ing administrative exhaustion for any case that falls within the general `feld' of educating disabled students.\" Id., at 875. 4 In reaching these conclusions, we leave for another day a further ques- tion about the meaning of \u00a7 1415( l): Is exhaustion required when the plain- tiff complains of the denial of a FAPE, but the specifc remedy she re-quests\u2014here, money damages for emotional distress\u2014is not one that an IDEA hearing offcer may award? The Frys, along with the Solicitor General, say the answer is no. See Reply Brief 2-3; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16. But resolution of that question might not be needed in this case because the Frys also say that their complaint is not about the denial of a FAPE, see Reply Brief 17\u2014and, as later ex-plained, we must remand that distinct issue to the Sixth Circuit, see infra, at 174-176. Only if that court rejects the Frys' view of their lawsuit, using the analysis we set out below, will the question about the effect of their request for money damages arise. 166 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court that such a child can obtain remedies under the IDEA for decisions that deprive her of a FAPE, but none for those that do not. So in the Frys' view, \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion require- ment can come into play only when a suit concerns the denial of a FAPE\u2014and not, as the Sixth Circuit held, when it merely has some articulable connection to the education of a child with a disability. See Reply Brief 13-15. The school districts, for their part, also believe that the Sixth Circuit's exhaustion standard \"goes too far\" because it could mandate exhaustion when a plaintiff is \"seeking relief that is not in substance available\" under the IDEA. Brief for Respond- ents 30. And in particular, the school districts acknowledge that the IDEA makes remedies available only in suits that \"directly implicate[ ]\" a FAPE\u2014so that only in those suits can \u00a7 1415( l) apply. Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the parties' shared view: The only relief that an IDEA offcer can give\u2014hence the thing a plain-tiff must seek in order to trigger \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion rule\u2014 is relief for the denial of a FAPE. We begin, as always, with the statutory language at issue, which (at risk of repetition) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \"relief\" that is \"available\" under the IDEA. The ordinary meaning of \"relief\" in the context of a lawsuit is the \"redress[ ] or beneft\" that attends a favorable judgment. Black's Law Dictionary 1161 (5th ed. 1979). And such relief is \"available,\" as we recently explained, when it is \"accessible or may be obtained.\" Ross v. Blake , 578 U. S. 632, 642 (2016) (quoting Webster's Third New International Diction-ary 150 (1993)). So to establish the scope of \u00a7 1415( l), we must identify the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress (or, similarly, to access a beneft). That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme. In its frst section, the IDEA de-clares as its frst purpose \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A). That principal purpose then Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 167 Opinion of the Court becomes the Act's principal command: A State receiving fed- eral funding under the IDEA must make such an education \"available to all children with disabilities.\" \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). The guarantee of a FAPE to those children gives rise to the bulk of the statute's more specifc provisions. For example, the IEP\u2014\"the centerpiece of the statute's education delivery system\"\u2014serves as the \"vehicle\" or \"means\" of providing a , 484 U. S., at 311; Rowley , 458 U. S., at 181; see supra, at 158. And fnally, as all the above suggests, the FAPE requirement provides the yardstick for measuring the adequacy of the education that a school offers to a child with a disability: Under that standard, this Court has held, a child is entitled to \"meaningful\" access to education based on her individual needs. Rowley, 458 U. S., at 192. 5 The IDEA's administrative procedures test whether a school has met that obligation\u2014and so center on the Act's FAPE requirement. As noted earlier, any decision by a hearing offcer on a request for substantive relief \"shall\" be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\" \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(i); see supra, at 159. 6 Or said Latin: In the IDEA's administra- tive process, a FAPE denial is the sine qua non. Suppose that a parent's complaint protests a school's failure to provide some accommodation for a child with a disability. If that accommodation is needed to fulfll the IDEA's FAPE require-ment, the hearing offcer must order relief. But if it is not, he cannot\u2014even though the dispute is between a child with a disability and the school she attends. There might be good reasons, unrelated to a FAPE, for the school to make the 5 A case now before this Court, Endrew F. v. Douglas County School Dist. RE-1, No. 15-827, presents unresolved questions about the precise content of the FAPE standard. [Reporter's Note: See post, p. 386.] 6 Without fnding the denial of a FAPE, a hearing offcer may do nothing more than order a school district to comply with the Act's various proce-dural requirements, see \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(E)(iii)\u2014for example, by allowing par-ents to \"examine all records\" relating to their child, \u00a7 1415(b)(1). 168 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court requested accommodation. Indeed, another federal law (like the ADA or Rehabilitation Act) might require the ac- commodation on one of those alternative grounds. See infra, at 170-171. But still, the hearing offcer cannot pro-vide the requested relief. His role, under the IDEA, is to enforce the child's \"substantive right\" to a FAPE. Smith, 468 U. S., at 1010. And that is all. 7 For that reason, \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE. If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \u00a7 1415( l) merely by bringing her suit under a statute other than the IDEA\u2014as when, for example, the plaintiffs in Smith claimed that a school's failure to provide a FAPE also violated the Rehabilitation Act. 8 Rather, that plaintiff must frst submit her case to an IDEA hearing offcer, experienced in addressing exactly the issues she raises. But if, in a suit brought under a different statute, the remedy sought is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA's procedures is not required. After all, the plaintiff could not get any relief from those procedures: A hearing offcer, as just explained, would have to send her away empty-handed. And that is true even when the suit arises directly from a school's treatment of a child with a disability\u2014and so could be said to relate in some way to her education. A school's conduct toward such a child\u2014say, some refusal to make an accommodation\u2014might injure her in ways unrelated to a FAPE, which are addressed in statutes other than the 7 Similarly, a court in IDEA litigation may provide a substantive remedy only when it determines that a school has denied a FAPE. See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359, 369 (1985). Without such a fnding, that kind of relief is (once again) unavail- able under the Act. 8 Once again, we do not address here (or anywhere else in this opinion) a case in which a plaintiff, although charging the denial of a FAPE, seeks a form of remedy that an IDEA offcer cannot give\u2014for example, as in the Frys' complaint, money damages for resulting emotional injury. See n. 4, supra. Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 169 Opinion of the Court IDEA. A complaint seeking redress for those other harms, independent of any FAPE denial, is not subject to \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion rule because, once again, the only \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available\" is relief for the denial of a FAPE. B Still, an important question remains: How is a court to tell when a plaintiff \"seeks\" relief for the denial of a FAPE and when she does not? Here, too, the parties have found some common ground: By looking, they both say, to the \"sub-stance\" of, rather than the labels used in, the plaintiff's com-plaint. Brief for Respondents 20; Reply Brief 7-8. And here, too, we agree with that view: What matters is the crux\u2014or, in legal-speak, the gravamen\u2014of the plaintiff's complaint, setting aside any attempts at artful pleading. That inquiry makes central the plaintiff's own claims, as \u00a7 1415( l) explicitly requires. The statutory language asks whether a lawsuit in fact \"seeks\" relief available under the IDEA\u2014not, as a stricter exhaustion statute might, whether the suit \"could have sought\" relief available under the IDEA (or, what is much the same, whether any remedies \"are\" available under that law). See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (contrasting \u00a7 1415( l) with the exhaustion provision in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1997e(a)). In effect, \u00a7 1415( l) treats the plaintiff as \"the master of the claim\": She identifes its remedial basis\u2014and is subject to exhaustion or not based on that choice. Cater- pillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 392, and n. 7 (1987). A court deciding whether \u00a7 1415( l) applies must therefore examine whether a plaintiff's complaint\u2014the principal in- strument by which she describes her case\u2014seeks relief for the denial of an appropriate education. But that examination should consider substance, not sur- face. The use (or non-use) of particular labels and terms is not what matters. The inquiry, for example, does not ride on whether a complaint includes (or, alternatively, omits) the 170 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court precise words(?) \"FAPE\" or \"IEP.\" After all, \u00a7 1415( l)'s premise is that the plaintiff is suing under a statute other than the IDEA, like the Rehabilitation Act; in such a suit, the plaintiff might see no need to use the IDEA's distinctive language\u2014even if she is in essence contesting the adequacy of a special education program. And still more critically, a \"magic words\" approach would make \u00a7 1415( l)'s exhaustion rule too easy to bypass. Just last Term, a similar worry led us to hold that a court's jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act turns on the \"gravamen,\" or \"es-sentials,\" of the plaintiff's suit. OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U. S. 27, 34, 35, 36 (2015). \"[A]ny other ap- proach,\" we explained, \"would allow plaintiffs to evade the Act's restrictions through artful pleading.\" Id., at 36. So too here. Section 1415( l) is not merely a pleading hurdle. It requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school's failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way. In addressing whether a complaint fts that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities\u2014the IDEA on the one hand, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act (most notably) on the other. The IDEA, of course, protects only \"children\" (well, really, adolescents too) and concerns only their school-ing. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). And as earlier noted, the statute's goal is to provide each child with meaningful access to educa-tion by offering individualized instruction and related serv-ices appropriate to her \"unique needs.\" \u00a7 1401(29); see Row- ley, 458 U. S., at 192, 198; supra, at 167. By contrast, Title II of the ADA and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act cover people with disabilities of all ages, and do so both inside and outside schools. And those statutes aim to root out disability-based discrimination, enabling each covered person (sometimes by means of reasonable accommodations) to participate equally to all others in public facilities and federally funded programs. See supra, at 159-160. In short, the IDEA guarantees Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 171 Opinion of the Court individually tailored educational services, while Title II and \u00a7 504 promise non-discriminatory access to public institu-tions. That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate all three statutes\u2014which is why, as in Smith, a plaintiff might seek relief for the denial of a FAPE under Title II and \u00a7 504 as well as the IDEA. But still, the statutory differences just discussed mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \u00a7 504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA's FAPE obligation. One clue to whether the gravamen of a complaint against a school concerns the denial of a FAPE, or instead addresses disability-based discrimination, can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions. First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school\u2014say, a public theater or library? And second, could an adult at the school\u2014say, an employee or visitor\u2014have pressed essen-tially the same grievance? When the answer to those ques-tions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that sub-ject; after all, in those other situations there is no FAPE obligation and yet the same basic suit could go forward. But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE, even if it does not explicitly say so; for the FAPE requirement is all that explains why only a child in the school setting (not an adult in that setting or a child in some other) has a viable claim. Take two contrasting examples. Suppose frst that a wheelchair-bound child sues his school for discrimination under Title II (again, without mentioning the denial of a FAPE) because the building lacks access ramps. In some sense, that architectural feature has educational conse-quences, and a different lawsuit might have alleged that it violates the IDEA: After all, if the child cannot get inside the school, he cannot receive instruction there; and if he must 172 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court be carried inside, he may not achieve the sense of independ- ence conducive to academic (or later to real-world) success. But is the denial of a FAPE really the gravamen of the plain-tiff's Title II complaint? Consider that the child could fle the same basic complaint if a municipal library or theater had no ramps. And similarly, an employee or visitor could bring a mostly identical complaint against the school. That the claim can stay the same in those alternative scenarios suggests that its essence is equality of access to public fa-cilities, not adequacy of special education. See supra, at 163 (describing OCR's use of a similar example). And so \u00a7 1415( l) does not require exhaustion. 9 But suppose next that a student with a learning disability sues his school under Title II for failing to provide remedial tutoring in mathematics. That suit, too, might be cast as one for disability-based discrimination, grounded on the school's refusal to make a reasonable accommodation; the complaint might make no reference at all to a FAPE or an IEP. But can anyone imagine the student making the same claim against a public theater or library? Or, similarly, imagine an adult visitor or employee suing the school to ob- 9 The school districts offer another example illustrating the point. They suppose that a teacher, acting out of animus or frustration, strikes a stu- dent with a disability, who then sues the school under a statute other than the IDEA. See Brief for Respondents 36-37. Here too, the suit could be said to relate, in both genesis and effect, to the child's education. But the school districts opine, we think correctly, that the substance of the plaintiff's claim is unlikely to involve the adequacy of special education\u2014 and thus is unlikely to require exhaustion. See ibid. A telling indicator of that conclusion is that a child could fle the same kind of suit against an offcial at another public facility for inficting such physical abuse\u2014as could an adult subject to similar treatment by a school offcial. To be sure, the particular circumstances of such a suit (school or theater? student or employee?) might be pertinent in assessing the reasonableness of the chal-lenged conduct. But even if that is so, the plausibility of bringing other variants of the suit indicates that the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint does not concern the appropriateness of an educational program. Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 173 Opinion of the Court tain a math tutorial? The diffculty of transplanting the complaint to those other contexts suggests that its essence\u2014 even though not its wording\u2014is the provision of a FAPE, thus bringing \u00a7 1415( l) into play. 10 A further sign that the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a FAPE can emerge from the history of the proceedings. In particular, a court may consider that a plaintiff has pre-viously invoked the IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute\u2014thus starting to exhaust the Act's remedies before switching midstream. Recall that a parent dissatisfed with her child's education initiates those administrative proce-dures by fling a complaint, which triggers a preliminary meeting (or possibly mediation) and then a due process hear-ing. See supra, at 159. A plaintiff's initial choice to pursue that process may suggest that she is indeed seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE\u2014with the shift to judicial proceed-ings prior to full exhaustion refecting only strategic calcula-tions about how to maximize the prospects of such a remedy. Whether that is so depends on the facts; a court may con-clude, for example, that the move to a courtroom came from a late-acquired awareness that the school had fulflled its FAPE obligation and that the grievance involves something else entirely. But prior pursuit of the IDEA's administra-tive remedies will often provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of a 10 According to Justice Alito , the hypothetical inquiries described above are useful only if the IDEA and other federal laws are mutually exclusive in scope. See post, at 176 (opinion concurring in part and con- curring in judgment). That is incorrect. The point of the questions is not to show that a plaintiff faced with a particular set of circumstances could only have proceeded under Title II or \u00a7 504\u2014or, alternatively, could only have proceeded under the IDEA. (Depending on the circumstances, she might well have been able to proceed under both.) Rather, these questions help determine whether a plaintiff who has chosen to bring a claim under Title II or \u00a7 504 instead of the IDEA\u2014and whose complaint makes no mention of a FAPE\u2014nevertheless raises a claim whose sub- stance is the denial of an appropriate education. 174 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of the Court FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.11 III The Court of Appeals did not undertake the analysis we have just set forward. As noted above, it asked whether E. F.'s injuries were, broadly speaking, \"educational\" in na- ture. See supra, at 164; 788 F. 3d, at 627 (reasoning that the \"value of allowing Wonder to attend [school] with E. F. was educational\" because it would foster \"her sense of inde-pendence and social confdence,\" which is \"the sort of inter-est the IDEA protects\"). That is not the same as asking whether the gravamen of E. F.'s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE. And that difference in standard may have led to a difference in result in this case. Understood correctly, \u00a7 1415( l) might not require ex- haustion of the Frys' claim. We lack some important infor-mation on that score, however, and so we remand the issue to the court below. The Frys' complaint alleges only disability-based discrimi- nation, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E. F.'s school provided. The school districts' \"refusal to allow Wonder to act as a service dog,\" the complaint states, \"discriminated against [E. F.] as a person with disabilities . . . by denying her equal access\" to public facilities. App. to Brief in Opposition 15, Com-plaint \u00b668. The complaint contains no allegation about the denial of a FAPE or about any defciency in E. F.'s IEP. More, it does not accuse the school even in general terms of refusing to provide the educational instruction and services that E. F. needs. See 788 F. 3d, at 631 (acknowledging that 11 The point here is limited to commencement of the IDEA's formal ad- ministrative procedures; it does not apply to more informal requests to IEP Team members or other school administrators for accommodations or changes to a special education program. After all, parents of a child with a disability are likely to bring all grievances frst to those familiar offcials, whether or not they involve the denial of a FAPE. Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 175 Opinion of the Court the Frys do not \"state that Wonder enhances E. F.'s educa- tional opportunities\"). As the Frys explained in this Court: The school districts \"have said all along that because they gave [E. F.] a one-on-one [human] aide, that all of her . . . educational needs were satisfed. And we have not chal-lenged that, and it would be diffcult for us to challenge that.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. The Frys instead maintained, just as OCR had earlier found, that the school districts infringed E. F.'s right to equal access\u2014even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements. See App. to Brief in Opposition 15, 18-19, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 69, 85, 87; App. 34-37; supra, at 163-164. And nothing in the nature of the Frys' suit suggests any implicit focus on the adequacy of E. F.'s education. Con-sider, as suggested above, that the Frys could have fled es-sentially the same complaint if a public library or theater had refused admittance to Wonder. See supra, at 172. Or similarly, consider that an adult visitor to the school could have leveled much the same charges if prevented from enter-ing with his service dog. See ibid. In each case, the plain- tiff would challenge a public facility's policy of precluding service dogs (just as a blind person might challenge a policy of barring guide dogs, see supra, at 163) as violating Title II's and \u00a7 504's equal access requirements. The suit would have nothing to do with the provision of educational services. From all that we know now, that is exactly the kind of action the Frys have brought. But we do not foreclose the possibility that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different. As earlier discussed, a plaintiff's initial pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies can serve as evidence that the gra-vamen of her later suit is the denial of a FAPE, even though that does not appear on the face of her complaint. See supra, at 173-174. The Frys may or may not have sought those remedies before fling this case: None of the parties here have addressed that issue, and the record is cloudy as to 176 FRY v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS Opinion of Alito, J. the relevant facts. Accordingly, on remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys in-voked the IDEA's dispute resolution process before bringing this suit. And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the grava-men of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion. With these instructions and for the reasons stated, we va- cate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Alito , with whom Justice Thomas joins, con- curring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join all of the opinion of the Court with the exception of its discussion (in the text from the beginning of the frst new paragraph on page 15 to the end of the opinion) in which the Court provides several misleading \"clue[s],\" ante , at 171, for the lower courts. The Court frst instructs the lower courts to inquire whether the plaintiff could have brought \"essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school\u2014say, a public theater or li- brary.\" Ibid. Next, the Court says, a court should ask whether \"an adult at the school\u2014say, an employee or visi- tor\u2014[could] have pressed essentially the same grievance.\" Ibid. These clues make sense only if there is no overlap between the relief available under the following two sets of claims: (1) the relief provided by the Individuals with Disa-bilities Education Act (IDEA), and (2) the relief provided by other federal laws (including the Constitution, the Ameri-cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Rehabilita-tion Act of 1973). The Court does not show or even claim that there is no such overlap\u2014to the contrary, it observes that \"[t]he same conduct might violate\" the ADA, the Reha-bilitation Act and the IDEA. Ibid. And since these clues Cite as: 580 U. S. 154 (2017) 177 Opinion of Alito, J. work only in the absence of overlap, I would not suggest them. The Court provides another false clue by suggesting that lower courts take into account whether parents, before fling suit under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, began to pur-sue but then abandoned the IDEA's formal procedures. Ante , at 173. This clue also seems to me to be ill advised. It is easy to imagine circumstances under which parents might start down the IDEA road and then change course and fle an action under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that seeks relief that the IDEA cannot provide. The par-ents might be advised by their attorney that the relief they were seeking under the IDEA is not available under that law but is available under another. Or the parents might change their minds about the relief that they want, give up on the relief that the IDEA can provide, and turn to an-other statute. Although the Court provides these clues for the purpose of assisting the lower courts, I am afraid that they may have the opposite effect. They are likely to confuse and lead courts astray.

Holbrook, Superintendent, Washington State Penitentiary. C. A. 9th Cir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 799 F. 3d 1238. Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting. Petitioner Clark Elmore was convicted of murder in 1995 and was sentenced to death. His court-appointed lawyer, who had never tried a capital case before, knew that Elmore had been exposed to toxins as a young adult and that he had a history of impulsive behavior. A more experienced attorney encouraged Elmore's lawyer to investigate whether Elmore had suffered brain ORDERS 939 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting damage as a young man. Instead of doing so\u2014indeed, instead of conducting any meaningful investigation into Elmore's life\u2014 Elmore's lawyer chose to present a 1-hour penalty-phase argu-ment to the jury about the remorse that Elmore felt for his crime. As a result, the jury did not hear that Elmore had spent his childhood playing in pesticide-contaminated felds and had spent his service in the Vietnam War repairing Agent Orange pumps. The jury did not hear the testimony of experts who concluded that Elmore was cognitively impaired and unable to control his impulses. The jury heard only from an assortment of local judges that Elmore had looked \"dejected\" as he pleaded guilty to murder, not from the many independent witnesses who had observed El-more's searing remorse. The Constitution demands more. The penalty phase of a capi- tal trial is \"a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inficting the penalty of death.\" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (1976). It ensures that a capital sentencing is \"hu-mane and sensible to the uniqueness of the individual.\" Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110 (1982). Elmore's penalty phase fell well below the bare minimum guaranteed by the Constitution. His lawyer acted defciently in choosing a mitigation strategy without fully exploring the alternatives and in failing to investi-gate the mitigation strategy that he did choose to present. And had the jury known that Elmore\u2014who had never before been convicted of a crime of violence and felt searing remorse for the heinous act he committed\u2014might be brain damaged, it might have sentenced him to life rather than death. This Court has not hesitated to summarily reverse in capital cases tainted by egregious constitutional error, particularly where an attorney has rendered constitutionally defcient performance. See, e. g., Hinton v. Alabama, 571 U. S. 263 (2014) (per curiam ); Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. 945 (2010) (per curiam ); Porter v. Mc- Collum, 558 U. S. 30 (2009) (per curiam ). This case plainly meets that standard. For that reason, I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari. I A Elmore was born in 1951 in central Oregon, where he lived until his teens. Social History, 12 Record 5524-5530. He was exposed to powerful neurotoxins from a young age. Elmore's 940 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. house in Oregon was located next to an airport from which crop dusters regularly sprayed pesticides. Trial Court Findings of Fact, No. 95-1-00310-1 (Super. Ct. Whatcom Cty., Wash., Sept. 10, 2004), 14 id., at 6519-6520 (FOF). Decades after Elmore moved away, the state environmental agency took soil samples that showed toxin levels over 4,500 times the maximum amounts allowed by state law. Decl. of Raymond Singer, 11 id., at 5394 (Singer Decl.). Later, Elmore worked on cars and oil pipelines where he regularly melted lead batteries and handled solvents without gloves. FOF, 14 id., at 6521-6522. And when Elmore left home at age 17 to serve in the Vietnam War, he was tasked with repairing Agent Orange pumps without protective equip-ment. Id., at 6522; Singer Decl., 11 id., at 5395. Experts who testifed at Elmore's postconviction hearing agreed that this exposure placed him at serious risk of brain damage. They conducted neuropsychological tests that revealed mild to moderate cognitive impairments, see Reporter's Tr. in No. 95-1- 00310-1, 15 id., at 7076 (PRP Tr.), including a marked inability to control his emotions and impulses, see id., at 7079-7080. Elmore tested in the bottom 1 percent on tests measuring that charac-teristic. Id., at 7080. The experts concluded that damage to Elmore's frontal lobe had made him impulsive and susceptible to emotion. See Decl. of Dale Watson, 11 id., at 5383; Decl. of Ray- mond Singer, 13 id., at 6389 (2d Singer Decl.); Decl. of George Woods, 11 id., at 5360-5361 (Woods Decl.). And they agreed that the murder Elmore later committed was linked to Elmore's cogni-tive defcits\u2014for instance, by making him unable to \"pu[t] on the brakes\" when emotional. FOF, 14 id., at 6495; see also Woods Decl., 11 id., at 5358; 2d Singer Decl., 13 id., at 6389-6390; PRP Tr., 15 id., at 7094. Elmore was discharged from the Army under honorable condi- tions in 1972, but found it hard to return to civilian life. 12 id., at 5631. He moved around the United States, taking jobs in hotels, gas stations, farms, and oil felds. Social History, id., at 5532-5538. Elmore was arrested three times\u2014once for stealing checks, once for stealing furniture, and once for stealing appli-ances from a motel. Reporter's Tr. in No. 95-1-00310-1, 5 id., at 2470-2473 (Trial Tr.); Social History, 12 id., at 5532, 5536. Off- cers at one prison reported that Elmore was nonviolent and, if anything, was the victim of other inmates' threats. Id., at 5533- 5534. After his second conviction, Elmore was incarcerated for ORDERS 941 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting two years in Washington state prison, where he was repeatedly raped by another inmate. Id., at 5536. Until the murder for which he was ultimately sentenced to death, and despite his emo-tional challenges, Elmore was never convicted of a violent crime. Elmore's death sentence arises out of a murder that he com- mitted in 1995. The crime was horrifc. Elmore raped and mur-dered his stepdaughter, frst strangling her with a belt, then driv-ing a sharp object through her ear, and fnally bludgeoning her with a hammer. In re Elmore , 162 Wash. 2d 236, 244, 172 P. 3d 335, 340 (2007). Elmore was apparently motivated by fear that the victim would tell the authorities that he had previously sexu-ally abused her. Ibid. After several days of misdirecting the authorities, Elmore turned himself in and confessed. FOF, 14 Record 6460. In the wake of the murder, Elmore expressed ex-treme remorse. A jailhouse minister who visited Elmore in prison later attested that, the day after he arrived, he \"was hud-dled into a ball at the back of the room, shaking uncontrollably.\" Decl. of Dana Paul Sellars, 11 id., at 5399 (Sellars Decl.). Elmore, he said, \"was unlike any prisoner I had counseled before. He was wracked with anguish and dripping with remorse.\" Id., at 5400. A correctional offcer at the prison later testifed that El- more appeared \"in a state of disbelief about what he had done\" and was \"an emotional wreck.\" Decl. of Donald Pierce, id., at 5404-5405. B The jury that sentenced Elmore to death learned about the terrible crime he committed, but heard virtually nothing about his troubling background and cognitive defects. A lawyer named Jon Komorowski was appointed to represent Elmore at trial. Ko-morowski had never previously worked on a capital case. Decl. of Jon Komorowski, 11 id., at 5325 (Komorowski Decl.). On Ko- morowski's advice, Elmore pleaded guilty to capital murder with-out any negotiations with the prosecution. Id., at 5326. Because Elmore pleaded guilty, the trial consisted of only a penalty phase. During that penalty phase, the State presented nine witnesses, all of whom testifed regarding the horrifc circumstances of the crime. Trial Tr., 5 id., at 2348-2580. The State also presented evidence of Elmore's three criminal convictions, all two decades old. Id., at 2470-2473. Komorowski's mitigation case for Elmore lasted only an hour. See 162 Wash. 2d, at 250, 172 P. 3d, at 343. The theme was 942 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. remorse: \"[T]here are no excuses in this case and none are offered. There is acceptance of responsibility and punishment.\" Trial Tr., 5 Record 2367; see also id., at 2580-2658 (defense case). The only character witnesses were the three judges who had presided over Elmore's pretrial appearances, who testifed that he had sought to plead guilty from the outset. Id., at 2581-2586, 2587-2589, 2590-2594. One described Elmore as \"somewhat second as \"dejected.\" Id., at 2586, 2592. The defense investigator read out a \"bare bones\" summary of Elmore's biography. Id., at 2306, 2599-2601. Finally, an expert witness testifed that Elmore's prior convictions were not violent felonies under Washington's three-strikes law. Id., at 2644-2658. Years later, in postconviction proceedings, Komorowski ac- knowledged his error, explaining that the decision not to investi-gate Elmore's medical history was \"the product 11 id., at 5329. He admitted that he and the defense team had reviewed Elmore's prison records and some of his hospital records, and had spoken to Elmore's family, who had told them about Elmore's hardships as a child and as a young adult. PRP Tr., 15 id., at 6907-6911. And he consulted with more experienced counsel, in-cluding an attorney named Todd Maybrown, who strongly advised Komorowski to investigate indicia of \"organic brain disorder\" and cautioned that the testimony of a psychologist with no neurology background would not be suffcient. Decl. of Todd Maybrown advised Komo-rowski that \"he might need to hire a medical doctor to try to determine if his client suffered from brain damage.\" Id., at 5541-5542. But Komorowski did not hire a neuropsychiatrist, nor did he conduct any further investigation into the possibility of brain damage. Komorowski consulted with three mental health profes-sionals, but none of them tested for any sort of brain damage. PRP Tr., 15 id., at 6985-6986, 7406-7407. The frst administered a personality test and concluded that Elmore was not insane, but recommended that Komorowski consult a second expert about whether Elmore was a psychopath. Id., at 7404-7405, 7412. The second concluded that Elmore was not a psychopath: He demon-strated remorse and empathy, and his crime was impulsive and reactive, indicating heightened emotional arousal rather than psy-chopathy. Id., at 7230-7231. The third was not a licensed psy-ORDERS 943 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting chologist at all. Id., at 6889, 6911, 6924. The two psychologists later agreed that, had Komorowski told them about Elmore's ex- posure to toxins, they would have recommended neuropsychologi-cal testing. Id., at 7422-7423, 7243-7244. C Elmore moved for postconviction relief in state court, arguing that Komorowski's representation deprived him of effective assist-ance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. But the Washington Supreme Court denied his claim. In re Elmore , 162 Wash. 2d 236, 172 P. 3d 335. \"There is no question that the defense team did investigate petitioner's mental health defcien-cies,\" the state court held. Id., at 258, 172 P. 3d, at 347. \"Rather, the issue is whether counsel's failure to conduct further evaluations amounted to defcient representation. We believe it did not.\" Ibid. The Washington Supreme Court ruled that Ko- morowski did not perform below the constitutional standard and had instead made a \"strategic\" decision to curtail the investiga-tion. Ibid. According to the state court, Komorowski's strategy was defensible for four reasons: Presenting more mitigation evi-dence might have opened the door to damaging rebuttal evidence; additional witnesses would have been \"cumulative\" of the judges who testifed; Komorowski worried that if he did not rush to trial, the prosecution might fnd witnesses who would testify that Elmore's remorse was waning; and Elmore had objected to the presentation of any mitigation case. Id., at 257-258, 263-265, 172 P. 3d, at 346-347, 348-350. A Federal District Court denied Elmore's habeas petition, and the Ninth Circuit affrmed. Elmore v. Sinclair , 799 F. 3d 1238 (2015). Two judges held that the Washington Supreme Court's decision was not unreasonable. Id., at 1243. The third would have found that the Washington Supreme Court's determination that Komorowski was constitutionally effective was unreasonable, but concurred because he did not believe that the question of prejudice was beyond debate. Id., at 1256-1257 (opinion of Hur- witz, J.). Elmore petitioned for certiorari. II I would grant the petition and summarily reverse on the ground that Komorowski's performance during the penalty phase of El-944 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. more's trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective as- sistance of counsel. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Elmore is entitled to relief only if the state court's adjudica-tion of his claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Fed-eral law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In other words, we may not grant relief where reasonable minds could differ over the correct application of legal principles, and we must evaluate that applica-tion on the basis of the law that was \"clearly established\" at the time of the state-court adjudication. See Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S. 362, 402-409 (2000). The legal principles that govern claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) come from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), and were clearly established over a decade before Elmore's trial. An IAC claim has two components: A petitioner must show that counsel's performance was defcient and that the defciency prejudiced the defense. See id., at 687. To establish defcient representation, a petitioner must demonstrate that coun-sel's representation \"fell below an objective standard of reason-ableness.\" Id., at 688. In order to establish prejudice, a peti- tioner must show that, but for the constitutionally defcient representation, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the out-come of the proceeding would have been different. Id., at 694. \"A standard of reasonableness applied as if one stood in coun- sel's shoes spawns few hard-edged rules.\" Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 381 (2005). But our cases reveal clearly established principles that, taken together, demonstrate that the state court's decision here was contrary to this Court's precedents and that the state court unreasonably applied the Strickland standard in evaluating Elmore's claim. A \"This is not a case in which defense counsel simply ignored their obligation to fnd mitigating evidence.\" Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 381. But Komorowski's decision not to search for much of the important mitigating evidence of Elmore's life was objec-tively unreasonable under Strickland. And the Washington Su- preme Court's opinion declaring Komorowski's conduct reasonable was contrary to our precedents. Clearly established legal princi-ples make that apparent. ORDERS 945 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting First, it was clearly established that constitutionally effective counsel must thoroughly investigate the defense he chooses to present. In this case, that was the remorse defense, the basket into which Komorowski had put all of Elmore's eggs. See Wig- gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 526 (2003). Had Elmore's defense team interviewed even the jailhouse minister, for instance, whom they knew was visiting Elmore, the jury would have heard a description of Elmore's remorse that was far more robust than the testimony of judges who had observed Elmore for short peri-ods during his few court appearances. E. g., Sellars Decl., 11 Record 5400. The Washington Supreme Court dismissed this testimony as \"cumulative,\" but that conclusion was unreasonable in light of this Court's precedent. In re Elmore , 162 Wash. 2d, at 265, 172 P. 3d, at 350. The judges testifed that Elmore wanted to plead guilty and commented on his appearance; the jailhouse minister, the correctional offcer, and others would have discussed Elmore's ac-tual emotional state over the course of months. Cf. Williams, 529 U. S., at 396 (faulting counsel for presenting some character witnesses, but not other, stronger character witnesses, such as certifed public accountant); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 518, 526 (fault- ing counsel where counsel stopped investigation before fnding evidence about abusive childhood that was more \"detailed\" and \"graphic\" than evidence in counsel's possession). Second, we have said time and again that while \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts rele-vant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[,] . . . stra-tegic choices made after less than complete investigation are rea-sonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\" Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690-691. Before Komorowski decided to focus exclu-sively on a remorse-based defense, he had an obligation to fully investigate other possible mitigation cases. See Sears, 561 U. S., at 953-954; Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 521-526. For example, Komo- rowski had been specifcally told by an experienced capital attorney that the testimony of a psychologist was unlikely to be suffcient and that the details of the crime, standing alone, strongly suggested \"some sort of organic brain disorder or dysfunction.\" Maybrown Decl., 12 Record 5541. Yet he did not pursue neuropsychological testing or investigate Elmore's expo-sure to neurotoxins. 946 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. The Washington Supreme Court concluded that because Komo- rowski had conducted some mental health investigation, any deci- sion he made about which information to present to the jury was strategic. In re Elmore , 162 Wash. 2d, at 263-264, 172 P. 3d, at 349-350. This was error. This Court has squarely rejected the notion that \"because counsel had some information with respect to petitioner's background . . . they were in a position to make a tactical choice.\" Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. To the contrary, we have often emphasized that an attorney who learns some informa- tion about a defendant's background is under an obligation to pursue that information in order to \"mak[e] an informed choice among possible defenses.\" Id., at 525. So too here: The informa- tion Komorowski did have about Elmore's background and the advice he received from Maybrown would have prompted a com-petent attorney to conduct further investigation and consult with experts about brain damage. See Komorowski Decl., 11 Record 5329; Social History, 12 id., at 5526, 5531-5538. While Komorow- ski consulted with three experts as to Elmore's mental health, he neither provided them with suffcient information to make an informed evaluation nor asked any of them to administer tests designed to measure Elmore's brain functioning. PRP Tr., 15 id., at 6985-6986, 7406-7407. Third, it was clearly established that, while fear of a prosecu- tor's rebuttal case may justify a decision not to present certain mitigating evidence, it can rarely justify a failure to investigate in the frst place. See Williams, 529 U. S., at 396 (counsel should have investigated juvenile records even where records contained evidence he had been previously committed to the juvenile sys-tem); Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 386, n. 5 (counsel should have investi- gated prior crime even though defense strategy was predicated on keeping evidence of prior crime out). So even if Komorowski's fear of opening the door to damaging rebuttal evidence could have justifed a decision not to introduce mitigating evidence, it could not have justifed his failure to investigate whether that evidence existed in the frst place. And it is questionable whether Komorowski's fear could even have justifed the decision not to introduce the evidence. Komo-rowski identifed three aggravators that he claimed the prosecu-tion could have presented in rebuttal: the gruesome details of the crime, Elmore's sexual abuse of the victim, and his waning re-morse. But the frst two aggravators were presented to the jury: ORDERS 947 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting the details of the crime in the State's penalty-phase argument, Trial Tr., 5 Record 2361-2362, 2500, 2502-2503, and the sexual abuse during the taped confession that was played to the jury, PRP Tr., 15 id., at 6952. Nor was there a strong basis for Komo- rowski to conclude that Elmore's remorse was waning, as his own defense investigator testifed that Elmore remained as remorseful through the day of trial as he had ever been. Id., at 7439-7440. Finally, it was clearly established that counsel has an obligation to pursue reasonable inquiries even where a client is \"actively obstructi[ng]\" that effort. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 381. Here, evidence introduced at the postconviction hearing indicated that Elmore resisted some of Komorowski's efforts to develop a mitiga-tion case, telling him that he would act out in the courtroom if Komorowski put on testimony about his personal life. PRP Tr., 15 Record 6994-6995. The Washington Supreme Court drew from this that Elmore \"objected to the presentation of a mitiga-tion case and threatened to act out in the courtroom if mitigation was put on for the jury.\" In re Elmore , 162 Wash. 2d, at 258, 172 P. 3d, at 347. But Komorowski said no such thing: He testi-fed only that Elmore objected to the presentation of details about his personal life, not to the presentation of any mitigation case at all. PRP Tr., 15 Record 6994-6995. Our precedent makes clear that such an objection does not justify a wholesale failure to investigate readily available mitigating evidence. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 381. In short, all of the Washington Supreme Court's justifcations for Komorowski's performance stand in sharp contrast with prin-ciples clearly established by this Court. No reasonable jurist could conclude that Komorowski's performance was not defcient. B Our precedents make it equally clear that Elmore was preju- diced by Komorowski's defcient performance. First, it was clearly established that the key inquiry for preju- dice purposes is the difference between what was actually pre-sented at trial and what competent counsel could have presented. See id., at 393. Here, the difference between the two is stark. At trial, Komorowski presented no witnesses who knew Elmore personally; the jury nonetheless deliberated for more than a full day. Trial Tr., 5 Record 2733-2734. By contrast, postconviction counsel put forth a wealth of mitigating information that was 948 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. available to trial counsel: well-respected community members who could attest to Elmore's remorse; neuropsychological evidence about Elmore's frontal lobe damage and how it may have directly affected the commission of his crime; and information about El-more's history of head injuries and exposure to neurotoxins, in-cluding his exposure to Agent Orange when he served in the Vietnam War. Second, it was clearly established that an inquiry to prejudice should not presume that an expert opinion about the magnitude and effect of a defendant's mental health issues is rendered mean-ingless by the State's introduction of a contrary opinion. In Por- ter, for example, the State's two experts disputed petitioner's postconviction expert's conclusion that he was acting under the infuence of an extreme emotional disturbance and that brain dam-age impaired his ability to obey the law. 558 U. S., at 36. We nonetheless concluded that the absence of an expert witness at trial prejudiced petitioner: \"While the State's experts identifed perceived problems with the tests that [petitioner's expert] used and the conclusions that he drew from them, it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that his testimony might have had on the jury.\" Id., at 43. Here, too, it was not reasonable to \"discount entirely\" the testi- mony of Elmore's three postconviction experts. Particularly given that this was Elmore's frst conviction for a violent crime, a jury might have been convinced that this crime was a direct result of Elmore's cognitive impairments, as Elmore's three ex-perts opined. And even if the jury was not convinced that there was a causal nexus between the crime and Elmore's brain damage, there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have at least credited evidence on which all parties\u2014including the State's expert\u2014agreed, namely, that Elmore's cognitive limitations con-tributed in at least a \"longer term\" way to the crime. PRP Tr., 15 Record 7355; see, e. g., Williams, 529 U. S., at 398 (considering evidence of borderline mental retardation even though crime was not linked to cognitive impairments); Sears, 561 U. S., at 945 (con- sidering frontal lobe damage even though crime was not linked to brain damage). Finally, it was clearly established that even a defendant who committed a heinous crime can be prejudiced by ineffective coun-sel. See Williams, 529 U. S., at 368 (petitioner \"brutally as- saulted an elderly woman\"); Rompilla, 545 U. 397 (Ken-ORDERS 949 938 Sotomayor, J., dissenting nedy , J., dissenting) (\"brutal crime\"; victim was stabbed 16 times, beaten with a blunt object, gashed in the face with beer bottle shards, and set on fre); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 553, n. 4 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"bizarre crime\" in which 77-year-old woman was found drowned in her bathtub, missing her underwear, and sprayed with insecticide). Elmore's crime was horrifc, but there was a dramatic difference between the mitigation that was pre-sented and the mitigation that should have been presented. The evidence presented by postconviction counsel \"adds up to a miti-gation case that bears no relation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided on the death penalty, that is not the test.\" Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 393. * * * Many observers, on and off this Court, have questioned the reliability and fairness of the imposition of capital punishment in America. See, e. g., Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863, 908-909 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting); Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 86 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1145 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Fletcher, Our Broken Death Penalty, 89 N. Y . U. L. Rev. 805 (2014); D. Baldus et al., Equal Justice and the Death Penalty: A Legal and Empirical Analysis (1990). Whether our system of capital punishment is inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, as these critics have charged, is not at issue here. I do believe, however, that whatever faws do exist in our system can be tolerated only by remaining faithful to our Constitution's procedural safeguards. All crimes for which defendants are sentenced to death are horrifc. See Glossip, 576 U. S., at 863 (Breyer, J., dissenting); id., at 899 (Thomas, J., concurring). But not all defendants who commit horrifc crimes are sentenced to death. Some are spared by juries. The Constitution guarantees that possibility: It re-quires that a sentencing jury be able to fully and fairly evaluate \"the characteristics of the person who committed the crime.\" Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 197 (1976) (joint opinion of Stew- art, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). That guarantee is a bedrock prem-ise on which our system of capital punishment depends, and it is a guarantee that must be honored\u2014especially for defendants like Elmore, whose lives are marked by extensive mitigating circum-950 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 October 17, 19, 25, 28, 2016 580 U. S. stances that might convince a jury to choose life over death. Only upon hearing such facts can a jury fairly make the weighty\u2014 and fnal\u2014decision whether such a person is entitled to mercy. I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.

Arizona, immediately infra.] 952 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 October 31, 2016 580 U. S. Certiorari granted, judgments vacated, and cases remanded for further consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016). No. 15-8850. Tatum v. Arizona. Ct. App. Ariz. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted. Cer- tiorari granted, judgment vacated, and case remanded for further consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016). Justice Sotomayor , concurring.* This Court explained in Miller v. Alabama, 567 U. S. 460 (2012), that a sentencer is \"require[d] . . . to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\" Id., at 480. Children are \"constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing\" in light of their lack of maturity and underdevel-oped sense of responsibility, their susceptibility to negative infu-ences and outside pressure, and their less well-formed character traits. Id., at 471. Failing to consider these constitutionally sig- nifcant differences, we explained, \"poses too great a risk of dis-proportionate punishment.\" Id., at 479. In the context of life without parole, we stated that \"appropriate occasions for sentenc-ing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncom-mon.\" Ibid. Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016), held that Miller \"announced a substantive rule of constitutional law.\" 577 U. S., at 212. That rule draws \"a line between children whose crimes refect transient immaturity and those rare children whose crimes refect irreparable corruption\" and allows for the possibil-ity \"that life without parole could be a proportionate sentence [only] for the latter kind of juvenile offender.\" Id., at 209. The petitioners in these cases were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed before they turned 18. A grant, vacate, and remand of these cases in light of Montgomery permits the lower courts to consider whether these petitioners' sentences comply with the substantive rule gov-erning the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile offender. *This opinion also applies to No. 15-8842, Purcell v. Arizona, supra, p. 951; supra, No. Arizona, supra, p. 951; and No. 15-9057, DeShaw v. Arizona, supra, p. 951. ORDERS 953 952 Sotomayor, J., concurring Justice Alito questions this course, noting that the judges in these cases considered petitioners' youth during sentencing. As Montgomery made clear, however, \"[e]ven if a court considers a child's age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime refects unfortunate yet transient immaturity.\" Id., at 208 (internal quotation marks omitted). On the record before us, none of the sentencing judges ad- dressed the question Miller and Montgomery require a sentencer to ask: whether the petitioner was among the very \"rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes refect permanent incorri-gibility.\" 577 U. S., at 209. Take Najar v. Arizona, No. 15-8878. There, the sentencing judge identifed as mitigating factors that the defendant was \"16 years of age\" and \"emotionally and physically immature.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-8878, p. A-51. He said no more on this front. He then discounted the petitioner's efforts to rehabilitate himself as \"nothing signifcant,\" despite commending him for those efforts and expressing hope that they would continue. Id., at A-52. The sentencing judge did not evaluate whether Najar represented the \"rare juvenile offender who exhibits such irre-trievable depravity that rehabilitation is impossible and life with-out parole is justifed.\" Montgomery , 577 U. S., at 208. Purcell v. Arizona, No. 15-8842, is no different. The sentenc- ing judge found that Purcell's age at the time of his offense\u201416 years old\u2014qualifed as a statutory mitigating factor. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-8842, p. A-80. He then minimized the rele-vance of Purcell's troubled childhood, concluding that \"this case sums up the result of defendant's family environment: he became a double-murderer at age 16. Nothing more need be said.\" Id., at A-83. So here too, the sentencing judge did not undertake the evaluation that Montgomery requires. He imposed a sentence of life without parole despite fnding that Purcell was \"likely to do well in the structured environment of a prison and that he pos-sesses the capacity to be meaningfully rehabilitated.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-8842, at A-83. The other petitions are similar. In Tatum v. Arizona, No. 15- 8850, and DeShaw v. Arizona, No. 15-9057, the sentencing judge merely noted age as a mitigating circumstance without further discussion. In Arias v. Arizona, No. 15-9044, the record before 954 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Alito, J., dissenting 580 U. S. us does not contain a sentencing transcript or order refecting the factors the sentencing judge considered. It is clear after Montgomery that the Eighth Amendment re- quires more than mere consideration of a juvenile offender's age before the imposition of a sentence of life without parole. It requires that a sentencer decide whether the juvenile offender before it is a child \"whose crimes refect transient immaturity\" or is one of \"those rare children whose crimes refect irreparable corruption\" for whom a life without parole sentence may be ap-propriate. 577 U. S., at 209. There is thus a very meaningful task for the lower courts to carry out on remand. Justice Alito , with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.* The Court grants review and vacates and remands (GVR) in this and four other cases in which defendants convicted of commit-ting murders while under the age of 18 were sentenced to life without parole. The Court grants this relief so that the Arizona courts can reconsider their decisions in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016), which we decided last Term. I expect that the Arizona courts will be as puzzled by this directive as I am. In Montgomery , the Court held that Miller v. Alabama, 567 U. S. 460 (2012), is retroactive. 577 U. S., at 206. That holding has no bearing whatsoever on the decisions that the Court now vacates. The Arizona cases at issue here were decided after Miller , and in each case the court expressly assumed that Miller was applicable to the sentence that had been imposed. Therefore, if the Court is taken at its word\u2014that is, it simply wants the Arizona courts to take Montgomery into account\u2014there is noth- ing for those courts to do. It is possible that what the majority wants is for the lower courts to reconsider the application of Miller to the cases at issue, but if that is the Court's aim, it is misusing the GVR *This opinion also applies to four other petitions: No. Purcell v. Arizona, supra, supra, No. 15-9057, DeShaw v. Ari- zona, supra, p. 951. This is certainly Justice Sotomayor 's explanation of the GVR. She faults the lower courts for failing to heed the statement in Miller that \"ap- propriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.\" 567 U. S., at 479. If the others in the majority have a ORDERS 955 954 Alito, J., dissenting vehicle. We do not GVR so that a lower court can reconsider the application of a precedent that it has already considered. In any event, the Arizona decisions at issue are fully consistent with Miller 's central holding, namely, that mandatory life without parole for juvenile offenders is unconstitutional. 567 U. S., at 465. A sentence of life without parole was imposed in each of these cases, not because Arizona law dictated such a sentence, but be-cause a court, after taking the defendant's youth into account, found that life without parole was appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the offender. It is true that the Miller Court also opined that \"life without parole is excessive for all but `the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption,' \" Montgomery , supra , at 208 (quoting Miller , supra, at 479-480 (internal quotation marks omitted)), but the record in the cases at issue provides ample support for the conclusion that these \"children\" fall into that category. For example, in Purcell v. Arizona, No. 15-8842, a 16-year-old gang member fred a sawed-off shotgun into a group of teenagers, killing two of them, under the belief that they had fashed a rival gang's sign at him. He was ultimately convicted of two counts of frst-degree murder, nine counts of attempted frst-degree mur-der, and one count each of aggravated assault and misconduct involving weapons. The trial court considered his youth, identi-fed his age as a mitigating factor, and still sentenced him to life without parole. The remaining cases are in the same vein. See Tatum v. Arizona, No. 15-8850 (17-year-old defendant convicted of frst-degree murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, at-tempted armed robbery, and aggravated assault); Najar v. Ari- zona, No. 15-8878 (juvenile convicted of and theft); Arias v. Arizona , No. 15-9044 (16-year-old defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of frst-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping, four counts of armed robbery, and one count each of frst-degree burglary, conspiracy to commit frst-degree murder, and conspiracy to com-mit armed robbery); DeShaw v. Arizona, No. 15-9057 (17-year- old defendant convicted of frst-degree murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping). similar view, the Court should grant review and decide the cases on the merits. 956 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 October 31, 2016 580 U. S. In short, the Arizona courts have already evaluated these sen- tences under Miller , and their conclusions are eminently reason- able. It is not clear why this Court is insisting on a do-over, or why it expects the results to be any different the second time around. I respectfully dissent. No. 16-181. Timm v. North Dakota. Sup. Ct.

November 3, 4, 5, 2016 November 3, 2016 Miscellaneous Order No. 16A451 (16-602). Arthur v. Dunn, Commissioner, Ala- bama Department of Corrections, et al. C. A. 11th Cir. Application for stay of execution of sentence of death, presented to Justice Thomas, and by him referred to the Court, granted pending disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari. Should the petition for writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall termi-nate automatically. In the event the petition for writ of certio-rari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court. Justice Thomas and Justice Alito would deny the application. Statement of The Chief Justice respecting the grant of the application for stay. I do not believe that this application meets our ordinary criteria for a stay. This case does not merit the Court's review: the claims set out in the application are purely fact-specifc, dependent on contested interpretations of state law, insulated from our re-view by alternative holdings below, or some combination of the three. Four Justices have, however, voted to grant a stay. To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy.

Application to vacate stay, presented to Justice Kagan, and by her referred to the Court, denied. Statement of Justice Ginsburg respecting the denial of the application to vacate stay. Mindful that Ohio law proscribes voter intimidation, see, e. g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 3501.90(A)(1) (Lexis 2013) (\"Harassment in violation of the election law\" includes an \"improper practice or attempt tending to obstruct, intimidate, or interfere with an elector in registering or voting at a place of registration or elec-tion.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), I vote to deny the application.

Appx. 130. No. 16-5247. Sireci v. Florida. Sup. Ct. Fla. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 192 So. 3d 42. Justice Breyer, dissenting. Henry Sireci, the petitioner, was tried, convicted of murder, and frst sentenced to death in 1976. He has lived in prison under threat of execution for 40 years. When he was frst sentenced to death, the Berlin Wall stood frmly in place. Saigon had just fallen. Few Americans knew of the personal computer or the Internet. And over half of all Americans now alive had not yet been born. See Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015 (June 2016), online at http://factfnder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/product view.xhtml?pid=PEP_2015_PEPAGESEX&prodType=table (all Internet materials as last visited Dec. 9, 2016). Forty years is more time than an average person could expect to live his entire life when America constitutionally forbade the \"infict[ion]\" of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" Amdt. 8; see 5 Dictionary of American History 104 (S. Kutler ed., 3d ed. 2003). This Court, speaking of a period of four weeks, not 40 years, once said that a prisoner's uncertainty before execution is \"one of the ORDERS 1037 1036 Breyer, J., dissenting most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected.\" In re Med- ley, 134 U. S. 160, 172 (1890). I should hope that this kind of delay would arise only on the rarest of occasions. But in the ever diminishing universe of actual executions, I fear that delays of this kind have become more common. The number of yearly executions has fallen from its peak of 98 in 1999 to 19 so far this year, while the average period of imprisonment between death sentence and execution has risen from 12 years to over 18 years in that same period. See Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), Facts About the Death Penalty, online at http:// www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf (updated Dec. 7, 2016); Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2013\u2014Statistical Tables, p. 14 (rev. Dec. 19, 2014) (Table 10); DPIC Execution List 2016, online at http://www. deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2016. Nor is this case the only case during the last few months in which the Court has received, but then rejected, a petition to review an execution taking place in what I would consider espe-cially cruel and unusual circumstances. On September 15, 2009, the State of Ohio attempted to execute Romell Broom by lethal injection. State v. Broom, 146 Ohio St. 3d 60, 61-62, 2016-Ohio- 1028, 51 N. E. 3d 620, 623. Medical team members tried for over two hours to fnd a useable vein, repeatedly injecting him with needles and striking bone in the process, all causing \"a great deal of pain.\" Id., at 62, 51 N. E. 3d, at 624. The State now wishes to try to execute Broom once again. Given its frst failure, does its second attempt amount to a \"cruel and unusual\" punishment? See In re Kemmler , 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890) (\"Punishments are when they involve . . . a lingering death\"). I would have heard Broom's claim. As I and other Justices have previously pointed out, individuals who are executed are not the \"worst of the worst,\" but, rather, are individuals chosen at random, on the basis, perhaps of geog-raphy, perhaps of the views of individual prosecutors, or still worse on the basis of race. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863, 915-923 (2015) (Breyer , J., joined by Ginsburg , J., dissenting); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 309-310 (1972) (Stewart, J., concurring) (\"These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual. For, of all the people convicted of [death-eligible crimes], many just as reprehensible as these, the[se] petitioners are among a 1038 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 December 12, 2016 580 U. S. capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has in fact been imposed\" (footnote omitted)). Cf. Smith v. Alabama, ante , p. 1027 (judge overrode jury's recommendation of a life sentence; this Court, by an equally divided vote, denied a stay of execution). I have elsewhere described these matters at greater length, and I have explained why the time has come for this Court to reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty. Glossip, supra, at 946 (dissenting opinion); see also Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 993 (1999) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari); Valle v. Florida, 564 U. S. 1067 (2011) (opinion dissenting from denial of stay); Boyer v. Davis, 578 U. S. 965, 966 (2016) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari); Conner v. Sellers, 579 U. S. 957, 958 (2016) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari and denial of stay). Cases such as the ones discussed here provide additional evidence that it is important for us to do so. See Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., memorandum respecting denial of certiorari). I would grant this petition for certiorari, as I would in No. 16-5580, Broom v. Ohio, immediately infra, and Smith, and include this question. No. 16-5580. Broom v. Ohio. Sup. Ct. Ohio. Certiorari de- nied.

Certiorari denied. Reported below: 830 F. 3d 216. Statement of Chief Justice Roberts respecting the denial of certiorari. In 2011, the Texas Legislature enacted Senate Bill 14 (SB14). The law requires voters to present government-issued photo iden- tifcation before, or shortly after, casting a ballot in person. The United States and private plaintiffs fled suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas seeking to en-join enforcement of the law. They argued that SB14 violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments because the Texas Legislature acted with discriminatory intent, and that the law violates \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it \"results in a denial or abridgment of the right . . . to vote on account of race or color.\" After conducting a bench trial, the District Court ruled in plaintiffs' favor on both claims and enjoined the voter-ORDERS 1105 1104 Statement of Roberts, C. J. identifcation provisions of SB14. Veasey v. Perry , 71 F. Supp. 3d 627, 633, 707 (2014). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the injunction, heard the case en banc, and sent it back to the District Court. First, the Fifth Circuit vacated the District Court's fnding of discriminatory intent and remanded for further consideration of the facts. 830 F. 3d 216, 230 (2016). Second, the court affrmed the District Court's conclusion that SB14 vio-lates \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 264-265. Because the \u00a7 2 violation did not justify enjoining SB14 in its entirety, how-ever, the court remanded for further proceedings on an appro-priate remedy. Id., at 268-271. Six judges would have reversed the District Court's conclusion that SB14 is unconstitutional and violates \u00a7 2. Id., at 280, 326 (opinions of Jones, J., and Elrod, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Texas offcials who are defendants in this lawsuit have petitioned for certiorari. Their petition asks the Court to review whether the Texas Legislature enacted SB14 with a discrimina-tory purpose and whether the law results in a denial or abridg- ment of the right to vote under \u00a7 2. Although there is no barrier to our review, the discriminatory purpose claim is in an interlocu-tory posture, having been remanded for further consideration. As for the \u00a7 2 claim, the District Court has yet to enter a fnal remedial order. Petitioners may raise either or both issues again after entry of fnal judgment. The issues will be better suited for certiorari review at that time. No. 16-670. Von Schoenebeck et al. v. Koninklijke Lucht- vaart Maatschappij N. V., aka KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. C. A. 9th Cir.

Certiorari denied. Reported below: 840 F. 3d 1268. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting. Nearly two years ago in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863 (2015), the Court issued a macabre challenge. In order to successfully attack a State's method of execution as cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, a condemned prisoner must not only prove that the State's chosen method risks severe pain, but must also propose a \"known and available\" alternative method for his own execution. Id., at 877-878, 880. Petitioner Thomas Arthur, a prisoner on Alabama's death row, has met this challenge. He has amassed signifcant evidence that Alabama's current lethal-injection protocol will result in intolera-ble and needless agony, and he has proposed an alternative\u2014 death by fring squad. The Court of Appeals, without consider-ing any of the evidence regarding the risk posed by the current 1142 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. protocol, denied Arthur's claim because Alabama law does not expressly permit execution by fring squad, and so it cannot be a \"known and available\" alternative under Glossip . Because this decision permits States to immunize their methods of execution\u2014 no matter how cruel or how unusual\u2014from judicial review and thus permits state law to subvert the Federal Constitution, I would grant certiorari and reverse. I dissent from my colleagues' decision not to do so. I A Execution by lethal injection is generally accomplished through serial administration of three drugs. First, a fast-acting sedative such as sodium thiopental induces \"a deep, comalike unconscious-ness.\" Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 44 (2008) (plurality opinion). Second, a paralytic agent\u2014most often pancuronium bromide\u2014\"in-hibits all muscular-skeletal movements and, the diaphragm, stops respiration.\" Ibid. Third, potassium chloride induces fatal cardiac arrest. Ibid. The frst drug is critical; without it, the prisoner faces the unadulterated agony of the second and third drugs. The second drug causes \"an extremely painful sensation of crushing and suffo- cation,\" see Denno, When Legislatures Delegate Death: The Trou-bling Paradox Behind State Uses of Electrocution and Lethal Injection and What It Says About Us, 63 Ohio St. L. J. 63, 109, n. 321 (2002); but paralyzes the prisoner so as to \"mas[k] any outward sign of distress,\" thus serving States' interest \" `in pre-serving the dignity of the procedure,' \" Baze , 553 U. S., at 71, 73 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the third drug causes an \"excruciating burning sensation\" that is \"equivalent to the sensation of a hot poker being inserted into the arm\" and travel-ing \"with the chemical up the prisoner's arm and . . . across his chest until it reaches his heart.\" Denno, supra, at 109, n. 321. Execution absent an adequate sedative thus produces a night- marish death: The condemned prisoner is conscious but entirely paralyzed, unable to move or scream his agony, as he suffers \"what may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.\" Glossip, 576 U. S., at 949 (Sotomayor, J ., dissenting). ORDERS 1143 1141 Sotomayor, J., dissenting B For many years, the barbiturate sodium thiopental seemed up to this task.1 In 2009, however, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental suspended domestic production and later left the market altogether. Id., at 869- 870 (majority opinion). States then began to use another barbiturate, pentobarbital. Id., at 870. But in 2013, it also became unavailable. Id., at 870-871. Only then did States turn to midazolam, the drug at the center of this case. Midazolam, like Valium and Xanax, belongs to a class of medi- cines known as benzodiazepines and has some anesthetic effect. Id., at 952-953 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Generally, anesthe- tics can cause a level of sedation and depression of electrical brain activity suffcient to block all sensation, including pain. App. to Pet. for Cert. 283a-290a. But it is not clear that midazolam ade-quately serves this purpose. This is because midazolam, unlike bar-biturates such as pentobarbital, has no analgesic\u2014pain-relieving\u2014 effects. Id., at 307a; see also Glossip, 576 U. S., at 953 (Soto- mayor, J., dissenting). Thus, \"for midazolam to maintain uncon- sciousness through application of a particular stimulus, it would need to depress electrical activity to a deeper level than would be required of, for example, pentobarbital.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 307a. 2 Although it can be used to render individuals 1 We examined the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35 (2008). There, the parties did not dispute that \"proper any meaningful risk that a prisoner would experience pain\" and results in a humane death. Id., at 49 (plurality opinion). The petitioners nonetheless challenged Kentucky's three-drug protocol on the ground that, if prison executioners failed to follow the mandated procedures, an unconstitutional risk of signifcant pain would result. Ibid. A plurality of the Court concluded that \"petitioners ha[d] not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol\" would violate the prohibi-tion on cruel and unusual punishments. Id., at 41. 2 Because \"midazolam is not an analgesic drug, any painful stimulus ap- plied to an inmate will generate and transmit full intensity pain signals to the brain without interference.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a. \"a is like being asleep, analgesia is like wearing earplugs. If two people are sleeping equally deeply, but only one is wearing earplugs, it will be much easier to shout and wake the person who is not wearing 1144 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. unconscious, midazolam is not used on its own to maintain anes- thesia\u2014complete obliviousness to physical sensation\u2014in surgical procedures, and indeed, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drug for this purpose. Glossip, 576 U. S., at 953 (Sotomayor, J ., dissenting). Like the experts in Glossip, the experts in this case agree that midazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that there is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug does not result in any greater effect. Ibid. The main dispute with respect to midazolam relates to how this ceiling effect operates\u2014if the ceil-ing on midazolam's sedative effect is reached before complete un- consciousness can be achieved, it may be incapable of keeping individuals insensate to the extreme pain and discomfort associ-ated with administration of the second and third drugs in lethal-injection protocols. Ibid. After the horrifc execution of Clayton Lockett, who, notwith- standing administration of midazolam, awoke during his execution and appeared to be in great pain, we agreed to hear the case of death-row inmates seeking to avoid the same fate. In Glossip, these inmates alleged that because midazolam is incapable of ren-dering prisoners unconscious and insensate to pain during lethal injection, Oklahoma's intended use of the drug in their executions would violate the Eighth Amendment. The Court rejected this claim for two reasons. First, the Court found that the District Court had not clearly erred in determining that \"midazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\" Id., at 881. Second, the Court held that the petitioners had failed to satisfy the novel requirement of pleading and proving a \"known and available alternative\" method of execution. Id., at 880. Post-Glossip, in order to prevail in an Eighth Amendment chal- lenge to a State's method of execution, prisoners frst must prove the State's current method \"entails a substantial risk of severe pain,\" id., at 867, and second, must \"identify a known and avail- able alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\" ibid. earplugs. If two people are sedated to equivalent levels of electrical brain activity, but only one has analgesia, the person sedated without analgesia will be much more easily aroused to consciousness by the application of pain.\" Ibid. ORDERS 1145 1141 Sotomayor, J., dissenting II This case centers on whether Thomas Arthur has met these requirements with respect to Alabama's lethal-injection protocol. A Alabama adopted lethal injection as its default method of execu- tion in 2002. Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(a) (2011); see also Ex parte Borden, 60 So. 3d 940, 941 (Ala. 2007). The State's capital punish- ment statute delegates the task of prescribing the drugs neces-sary to compound a lethal injection to the Department of Correc-tions. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(f). Consistent with the practice in other States following the national shortage of sodium thiopental and pentobarbital, the department has adopted a protocol involving the same three drugs considered in Glossip . See Brooks v. War- den, 810 F. 3d 812, 823 (CA11 2016). Perhaps anticipating constitutional challenges, Alabama's legis- lature enacted a contingency plan: The statute provides that \"[i]f electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional . . . all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.\" \u00a7 15-18- 82.1(c). B Thomas Douglas Arthur killed his paramour's husband in 1982. 840 F. 3d 1268, 1272-1273 (CA11 2016). Over the next decade, two juries found Arthur guilty of murder, and each time, Arthur's conviction was overturned on appeal. Ibid. After a third trial in 1992, Arthur was convicted and sentenced to death. Ibid. Since then, Arthur has been scheduled to die on six separate occasions, and each time, his execution was stayed. Id., at 1275, n. 2. After 34 years of legal challenges, Arthur has accepted that he will die for his crimes. He now challenges only how the State will be permitted to kill him. Arthur asserted two distinct claims in the District Court. First, Arthur asserted a facial challenge, arguing that midazolam is generally incapable of performing as intended during Alabama's three-drug lethal-injection procedure. Second, Arthur asserted an as-applied challenge, arguing that because of his individual health attributes, midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain for him during the procedure. The District Court considered these two claims separately. With respect to the facial challenge, the District Court ordered 1146 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. bifurcated proceedings, with the frst hearing limited to the avail- ability of a feasible alternative method of execution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a, and n. 2. Arthur's initial complaint proposed a single dose either of pentobarbital or sodium thiopental rather than a three-drug protocol, but the District Court found that those methods were unavailable given the elimination of both drugs from the domestic market. Id., at 203a-205a. Arthur then moved to amend his complaint to allege the fring squad as an alternative method of execution. The District Court denied the motion, holding that \"execution by fring squad is not permitted by statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\" Id., at 241a. Because Arthur's claim failed on this ground, the court never considered Arthur's evi-dence with respect to midazolam, despite later observing that it was \"impressive.\" Id., at 166a. In a separate order, the District Court considered Arthur's as- applied challenge. Arthur alleged, based on the expert opinion of Dr. Jack Strader, that \"his cardiovascular issues, combined with his age and emotional makeup, create a constitutionally unaccept-able risk of pain that will result in a violation of the Eighth Amendment if he is executed under the [midazolam] protocol.\" Id., at 151a. Echoing its rationale with respect to Arthur's facial challenge, the District Court found that Arthur failed to prove the existence of a feasible, readily available alternative. The court then turned to the question it had avoided in the facial challenge: whether Alabama's lethal-injection protocol cre-ated a risk of serious illness or needless suffering. But because the District Court considered the question as part of Arthur's as-applied challenge, it focused on the protocol as applied to Arthur's personal physical condition. The court rejected Dr. Strader's opinion that the dose of midazolam required by Alabama's protocol \" `will likely induce a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pres-sure more quickly than it results in sedation,' \" and that during this time gap, Arthur\u2014whom he believed to suffer from heart disease\u2014would suffer a painful heart attack. Id., at 169a. Be- cause Dr. Strader's experience was limited to clinical doses of midazolam, which typically range from 2 to 5 mg, the court con-cluded that he had no basis to extrapolate his experience to non-clinical, lethal doses, such as the 500-mg bolus required by ORDERS 1147 1141 Sotomayor, J., dissenting The District Court expressly refused to consider the expert opinions that Arthur proffered as part of his facial challenge, noting that they \"are untested in court, due to Arthur's inability to provide a[n alternative] remedy in his facial, and now as-applied, challenges.\" Id., at 167a, n. 16. The District Court therefore concluded that Arthur failed to meet the Glossip standard and entered judgment in favor of the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a. C The Eleventh Circuit affrmed. In a 111-page slip opinion is- sued the day before Arthur's scheduled execution, the court frst found that \"Arthur never showed Alabama's current lethal injec-tion protocol, per se or as applied to him, violates the Constitu- tion.\" 840 F. 3d, at 1315. The court based this fnding on Ar-thur's failure to \"satisfy the frst [Glossip ] prong as to midazolam\" as part of his as-applied challenge, ibid., and the fact that this Court \"upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol\" in Glossip, 840 F. 3d, at 1315. Like the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit never considered the evidence Arthur introduced in sup- port of his facial challenge to the protocol. Then, \"[a]s an alterna-tive and independent ground,\" ibid., the Court of Appeals found that the fring squad is not an available alternative because that method is \"beyond [the Department of Corrections'] statutory au-thority,\" id., at 1320. Finally, and as yet another independent ground for denying relief, the court held Arthur's motion regard-ing the fring squad barred by the doctrine of laches. Ibid., n. 35. According to the Eleventh Circuit, the \"known and available\" alternative requirement was made clear in Baze \u2014not Glossip \u2014 and because Arthur failed to amend his complaint in 2008 when Baze was decided, his claim was barred by laches. On the day of his scheduled execution, Arthur fled a petition for certiorari and an application to stay his execution. The Court granted the stay, ante , p. 977, but now denies certiorari. III A The decision below permits a State, by statute, to bar a death- row inmate from vindicating a right guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment. Under this view, even if a prisoner can prove that 1148 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. the State plans to kill him in an intolerably cruel manner, and even if he can prove that there is a feasible alternative, all a State has to do to execute him through an unconstitutional method is pass a statute declining to authorize any alternative method. This cannot be right. To begin with, it contradicts the very decisions it purports to follow\u2014Baze and Glossip . Glossip based its \"known and avail- the plurality opinion in Baze . Baze , in turn, states that \"[t]o qualify, the alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact signifcantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\" 553 U. S., at 52 (plural-ity opinion). The Court did not mention\u2014or even imply\u2014that a State must authorize the alternative by statute. To the contrary, Baze held that \"[i]f a State refuses to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages,\" its \"refusal to change its method can be viewed as `cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). The decision below turns this language on its head, holding that if the State refuses to adopt the alternative legislatively, the inquiry ends. That is an alarming misreading of Baze . Even more troubling, by conditioning federal constitutional rights on the operation of state statutes, the decision below con-travenes basic constitutional principles. The Constitution is the \"supreme law of the land\"\u2014irrespective of contrary state laws. Art. VI, cl. 2. And for more than two centuries it has been axiomatic that this Court\u2014not state courts or legislatures\u2014is the fnal arbiter of the Federal Constitution. See Marbury v. Madi- son, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Acting within our exclusive \"prov-ince and duty\" to \"say what the law is,\" ibid., we have interpreted the Eighth Amendment to entitle prisoners to relief when they succeed in proving that a State's chosen method of execution poses a substantial risk of severe pain and that a constitutional alternative is \"known and available,\" Glossip, 576 U. S., at 878- 881. The States have no power to override this constitutional guarantee. While States are free to defne and punish crimes, \"state laws respecting crimes, punishments, and criminal proce-dure are . . . subject to the overriding provisions of the United States Constitution.\" Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808, 824 (1991). Equally untenable are the differing interpretations of the Eighth Amendment that would result from the Eleventh Circuit's ORDERS 1149 1141 Sotomayor, J., dissenting rule. Under the Eleventh Circuit's view, whether an inmate who will die in an intolerably cruel manner can obtain relief under Glossip depends not on the Constitution but on vagaries of state law. The outcome of this case, for instance, would turn on whether Arthur had been sentenced in Oklahoma, where state law expressly permits the fring squad, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, \u00a7 1014 (Supp. 2016), rather than in Alabama, which\u2014according to the Eleventh Circuit 3\u2014does not, see Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1. But since the very beginning of our Nation, we have emphasized the \"necessity of uniformity\" in constitutional interpretation \"throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within the purview of the constitution.\" Martin v. Hunter's Lessee , 1 Wheat. 304, 347-348 (1816) (emphasis deleted). Nowhere is the need for uniformity more pressing than the rules governing States' imposition of death. B The Eleventh Circuit's alternative holdings are unavailing. First, the court erroneously concluded that Arthur failed to carry his burden on the frst Glossip requirement\u2014proving that Alabama's midazolam-centered protocol poses a substantial risk of severe pain. The court used the District Court's fnding that Arthur failed to meet this prong with respect to his as-applied challenge to hold that Arthur's facial challenge likewise failed. But it is undisputed that Arthur put forth \"impressive\" evidence to support his facial challenge that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals considered. This evidence included the expert testimony of Dr. Alan Kaye, chairman of the Department 3 I question the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that the statute does not authorize the fring squad as an available means of execution. In my view, the Alabama statute unambiguously reads as a codifcation of Glossip . If either of the specifed methods\u2014lethal injection or electrocution\u2014is declared unconstitutional, the statute authorizes the State to execute prisoners by \" any constitutional method of execution.\" Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c) (2016) (emphasis added). The state statute thus permits exactly what the Court required in Glossip \u2014if a condemned prisoner can prove that the lethal-injection protocol presents an unconstitutional risk of needless suffer-ing, he may propose an alternative, constitutional means of execution, which may include the fring squad. Even assuming, however, that the Eleventh Circuit properly interpreted Alabama's statute, the question remains whether States may legislatively determine what the Eighth Amendment requires or prohibits. That question is worthy of our review. 1150 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. of Anesthesiology at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center, who found the dose of midazolam prescribed in Alabama's protocol insuffcient to \"cure . the frst drug in [Alabama's lethal-injection] pro-tocol.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 302a (emphasis added). Dr. Kaye concluded that \"the chemical properties of midazolam limit its ability to depress electrical activity in the brain. The lack of another chemical property\u2014analgesia\u2014renders midazolam incapa-ble of maintaining even that limited level of depressed electrical activity under the undiminished pain of the second and third le-thal injection drugs.\" Id., at 311a. The court next read Glossip as categorically \"uph[olding] the midazolam-based execution protocol.\" 840 F. 3d, at 1315. Glossip did no such thing. The majority opinion in Glossip con- cluded that, based on the facts presented in that case, \"[t]he Dis-trict Court did not commit clear error when it found that midazo-lam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\" 576 U. S., at 881. The opinion made no determi-nation whether midazolam-centered lethal injection represents a constitutional method of execution. Finally, the court's laches fnding faults Arthur for failing to act immediately after Baze , which, according to the panel, \"made clear in 2008 . . . that a petitioner-inmate had the burden to show that a proffered alternative was `feasible, readily implemented, and in fact signifcantly reduce[d] a substantial risk of severe pain.' \" 840 F. 3d, at 1320, n. 35 (quoting Baze , 553 U. S., at 41). But the District Court in this case\u2014not to mention at least four Justices of this Court, see Glossip, 576 U. S., at 970-973 (Soto- mayor, J ., dissenting)\u2014did not read Baze as requiring an alterna- tive. See Record in Arthur v. Myers, No. 2:11-cv-438 (MD Ala.), Doc. 195, p. 11 (\"[T]he court does not accept the State's argument that [a known and available alternative method of execution] is a specifc pleading requirement set forth by Baze that must be prop- erly alleged before a case can survive a motion to dismiss\"). Ar-thur fled a statement within 14 days of our decision in Glossip informing the District Court of his belief that our decision would impact his case, see id., Doc. 245, and moved to amend his com- plaint a few weeks later, see id., Doc. 256. In sum, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion rests on quicksand foun- dations and fouts the as well . These errors alone counsel in favor of certiorari. IV The decision below is all the more troubling because it would put an end to an ongoing national conversation\u2014between the leg- islatures and the courts\u2014around the methods of execution the Constitution tolerates. The meaning of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments \"is determined not by the standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791\" but instead derives from \" `the evolving stand-ards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' \" Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 419 (2008) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)). Evolving standards have yielded a familiar cycle: States develop a method of execution, which is generally accepted for a time. Science then reveals that\u2014unknown to the previous generation\u2014the States' chosen method of execution causes unconstitutional levels of suf-fering. A new method of execution is devised, and the dialogue continues. The Eighth Amendment requires this conversation. States should not be permitted to silence it by statute. A From the time of the founding until the early 20th century, hanging was the preferred practice. Gardner, Executions and Indignities\u2014An Eighth Amendment Assessment of Methods of Inficting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L. J. 96, 119 (1978). After several grotesque failures at the gallows\u2014including slow asphyxiation and violent decapitation\u2014revealed the \"crude and imprecise\" nature of the practice, Campbell v. Wood, 511 U. S. 1119, 1122 (1994) (Blackmun, J ., dissenting from denial of certio- rari), States sought to execute condemned prisoners \" `in a less barbarous manner' \" and settled on electrocution. See In re Kemm- ler, 136 U. S. 436, 444 (1890). New York carried out the world's frst electrocution in ghastly fashion, 4 leading the New York Times to declare it \"a disgrace to 4 New York executed William Kemmler on August 6, 1890. According to the New York Times, \"[p]robably no convicted murderer of modern times has been made to suffer as Kemmler suffered.\" Far Worse Than Hanging, N. Y . Times, Aug. 7, 1890, p. 1. Witnesses recounted the execution: \"After the frst convulsion there was not of Kemm- ler's body. . . . Then the eyes that had been momentarily turned from Kemm-1152 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. civilization.\" See Far Worse Than Hanging, N. Y . Times, Aug. 7, 1890, p. 1. Electrocution nonetheless remained the dominant mode of execution for more than a century, until the specter of charred and grossly disfgured bodies proved too much for the public, and the courts, to bear. 5 See, e. g., Dawson v. State , 274 Ga. 327, 335, 554 S. E. 2d 137, 144 (2001) (\"[W]e hold that death by electrocution, with its specter of excruciating pain and its certainty of cooked brains and blistered bodies, violates the prohi- bition against cruel and unusual punishment\"). The States then tried lethal gas. Although the gas chamber was initially believed to produce relatively painless death, it ulti-mately became clear that it exacted \"exquisitely painful\" sensa-tions of \"anxiety, panic, [and] terror,\" leading courts to declare it unconstitutional. See, e. g., Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F. 3d 301, 308 (CA9 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). 6 ler's body returned to it and gazed with horror on what they saw. The men rose from their chairs impulsively and groaned at the agony they felt. `Great God! [H]e is . . \"Again came that click as before, and again the body of the unconscious wretch in the chair became as rigid as one of bronze. It was awful, and the witnesses were so horrifed by the ghastly sight that they could not take their eyes off it. The dynamo did not seem to run smoothly. The current could be heard sharply snapping. Blood began to appear on the face of the wretch in the chair. It stood on the face like sweat. . . . \"An awful odor began to permeate the death chamber, and then, as though to cap the climax of this fearful sight, it was seen that the hair under and around the electrode on the head and the fesh under and around the elec-trode at the base of the spine was singeing. The stench was unbearable.\" Ibid. (paragraph break omitted). 5 After a particularly gruesome electrocution in Florida, this Court granted certiorari on the question whether electrocution creates a constitu-tionally unacceptable risk of physical suffering in violation of the Eighth Amendment, see Bryan v. Moore , 528 U. S. 960 (1999), but later dismissed the writ as improvidently granted in light of an amendment to the State's execution statute that permitted prisoners to choose lethal injection rather than electrocution, see Bryan v. Moore , 528 U. S. 1133 (2000). See also Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 922.10 (West 2001). 6 This Court granted certiorari in Fierro , vacated the judgment, and re- manded for consideration in light of the California Legislature's adoption of lethal injection as the State's primary method of execution. See Gomez v. Fierro , 519 U. S. 918 (1996). ORDERS 1153 1141 Sotomayor, J., dissenting Finally, States turned to a \"more humane and palatable\" method of execution: lethal injection. Denno, 63 Ohio St. L. J., at 92. Texas performed the frst lethal injection in 1982 and, impressed with the apparent ease of the process, other States quickly followed suit. S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An Ameri-can History 297 . . The guy just goes to sleep. That's all there is to it.' \" Ibid. What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet. B Science and experience are now revealing that, at least with respect to midazolam-centered protocols, prisoners executed by lethal injection are suffering horrifying deaths beneath a \"medi-cally sterile aura of peace.\" Denno, supra, at 66. Even if we sweep aside the scientifc evidence, we should not blind ourselves to the mounting frsthand evidence that midazolam is simply un-able to render prisoners insensate to the pain of execution. The examples abound. After Ohio administered midazolam during the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014, he \"strained against the re-straints around his body, and . . . repeatedly gasped for air, mak-ing snorting and choking sounds for about 10 minutes.\" Johnson, Inmate's Death Called `Horrifc', Columbus Dispatch, Jan. 17, 2014, pp. A1, A10. The scene was much the same during Oklahoma's execution of Clayton Lockett in April 2014. After executioners administered midazolam and declared him unconscious, Lockett began to writhe against his restraints, saying, \"[t]his s*** is f***ing with U. S., at 951 (Sotomayor, J ., dissenting). When Arizona executed Joseph Rudolph Wood in July 2014 using a midazolam-based protocol, he \"gulped like a fsh on land.\" Kiefer, Botched Execution, Arizona Republic, July 24, 2014, pp. A1, A9. A witness reported more than 640 gasps as Wood convulsed on the gurney for more than an hour and a half before being declared dead. Ibid. Finally, and just over a month after this Court stayed Thomas Arthur's execution, Alabama executed Ronald Bert Smith. Fol-lowing the dose of midazolam, Smith \"clenched his fst\" and was \"apparently struggling for breath as he heaved and coughed for 1154 OCTOBER TERM, 2016 Sotomayor, J., dissenting 580 U. S. about 13 minutes.\" Berman & Barnes, Alabama Inmate Was Heaving, Coughing During Lethal-Injection Execution, Washing-ton Post, Dec. 10, 2016, p. A3. It may well be that as originally designed, lethal injection can be carried out in a humane fashion that comports with the Eighth Amendment. But our lived experience belies any suggestion that midazolam reliably renders prisoners entirely unconscious to the searing pain of the latter two drugs. These accounts are espe-cially terrifying considering that each of these men received doses of powerful paralytic agents, which likely masked the full extent of their pain. Like a hangman's poorly tied noose or a malfunc-tioning electric chair, midazolam might render our latest method of execution too much for our conscience\u2014and the Constitution\u2014 to bear. C As an alternative to death by midazolam, Thomas Arthur has proposed death by fring squad. Some might fnd this choice re-gressive, but the available evidence suggests \"that a competently performed shooting may cause nearly instant death.\" Denno, Is Electrocution an Unconstitutional Method of Execution? The En-gineering of Death Over the Century, 35 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 551, 688 (1994). In addition to being near instant, death by shoot-ing may also be comparatively painless. See Banner, supra, at 203. And historically, the fring squad has yielded signifcantly fewer botched executions. See A. Sarat, Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that while 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection between 1900 and 2010 were \"botched,\" none of the 34 executions by fring squad had been). Chief Justice Warren famously wrote that \"[t]he basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dig-nity of man.\" Trop, 356 U. S., at 100 (plurality opinion). States have designed lethal-injection protocols with a view toward pro-tecting their own dignity, but they should not be permitted to shield the true horror of executions from offcial and public view. Condemned prisoners, like Arthur, might fnd more dignity in an instantaneous death rather than prolonged torture on a medical gurney. To be clear, this is not a matter of permitting inmates to choose the manner of death that best suits their desires. It is a matter of permitting a death-row inmate to make the showing Glossip ORDERS 1155 580 U. S. February 21, 2017 requires in order to prove that the Constitution demands some- thing less cruel and less unusual than what the State has offered. Having met the challenge set forth in Glossip, Arthur deserves the opportunity to have his claim fairly reviewed in court. The Eleventh Circuit denied him this opportunity, and in doing so, thwarted the Court's decision in Glossip, as well as basic constitu- tional principles. * * * Twice in recent years, this Court has observed that it \"has never invalidated a State's chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infiction of cruel and unusual punish-ment.\" Baze , 553 U. S., at 48 (plurality opinion); Glossip, 576 U. S., at 869 (same). In Glossip, the majority opinion remarked that the Court \"did not retreat\" from this nonintervention strat-egy even after Louisiana strapped a 17-year-old boy to its electric chair and, having failed to kill him the frst time, argued for a second try\u2014which this Court permitted.

Marcus Dante Reed was sentenced to death in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, a county that in recent history has apparently sen-tenced more people to death per capita than any other county in the United States. See Aviv, Revenge Killing: Race and the Death Penalty in a Louisiana Parish, The New Yorker, July 6 & 13, 2015, p. 34. The arbitrary role that geography plays in the imposition of the death penalty, along with the other serious prob-lems I have previously described, has led me to conclude that the Court should consider the basic question of the death penalty's constitutionality. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863, 908 (2015) (Breyer , J., dissenting). For this reason, I would grant Reed's petition for a writ of certiorari. ORDERS 1167 580 U. S. February 27, 2017 No. 16-910.
