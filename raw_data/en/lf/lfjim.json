Section 2.4 shall be deleted in its enti rety and replaced with the following: 2.4 ENROLLMENT IN AN MCO 2.4.1 General TENNCARE is solely responsible for enrollm ent of TennCare enrollees in an MCO. 2.4.2 Authorized Service Area 2.4.2.1 Grand Region Enrollees will be enrolled in MCOs by Grand Region(s) of the state. The specific counties in each Grand Region are listed in Section 1 of this Agreement. 2.4.2.2 CONTRACTOR's Authorized Service Area The CONTRACTOR is authorized under th is Agreement to serve enrollees who reside in the Grand Region(s) specified below: East Grand Region X Middle Grand Region West Grand Region 2.4.3 Maximum Enrollment 2.4.3.1 The CONTRACTOR agrees to accept enrollm ent in the CONTRACTOR's MCO of up to seventy percent (70%) of the eligib le population in the applicable Grand Page 22 of 374 Region. TENNCARE shall determine and notify the CONTRACTOR of the number of eligibles in the applicable Gra nd Region and the CONTRACTOR's maximum enrollment limit, which shall be approximatel y seventy percent (70%) of the eligible population in the applicable Grand Region. 2.4.3.2 TENNCARE shall establish an enrollment threshold for the CONTRACTOR that will equal approximately ninety percent (90%) of the maximum enrollment limit established in Section 2.4.3.1 above. This en rollment threshold may be adjusted by TENNCARE at its discretion. 2.4.3.3 Once the CONTRACTOR's enrollment threshold is met, TENNCARE may discontinue default assignment of enrollees to the CONTRACTOR's MCO. Enrollees who select the CONTRACTOR or whose family members are enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO shall continue to be enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO until the maximum enrollment limit estab lished in Section 2.4.3.1 above is met. 2.4.3.4 Both TENNCARE and the CONTRACTOR recognize that management of the CONTRACTOR's maximum enrollment limit and enrollment threshold within exact limits may not be possible. In the event enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO exceeds the maximum enrollment limit, TE NNCARE may reduce enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO based on a plan est ablished by TENNCARE that provides appropriate notice to the CONTRACTOR, a llows appropriate choice of MCOs for enrollees, and meets the objectives of the TennCare program. 2.4.3.5 The establishment of a maximum enrollment li mit and/or of an enrollment threshold does not obligate the State to enroll a cer tain number of TennCare enrollees in the CONTRACTOR's MCO and does not create in the CONTRACTOR any rights, interests or claims of entitlement to enrollment. The CONTRACTOR's actual enrollment level will be determined th rough the MCO selection and assignment process described in Section 2.4.4 below. 2.4.3.6 Upon the request of TENNCARE, the C ONTRACTOR shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of TENNCARE it has the capacity to serve the number of enrollees in the maximum enrollment limit. 2.4.4 MCO Selection and Assignment 2.4.4.1 General TENNCARE shall enroll individuals determined eligible for TennCare and eligible for enrollment in an MCO that is availabl e in the Grand Region in which the enrollee resides. Enrollment in an MCO may be th e result of an enrollee's selection of a particular MCO or assignment by TENNCARE. Enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO is subject to the CONTRACTOR's maximum enrollment limit and threshold (see Section 2.4.3) and capacity to accept additional members. Page 23 of 374 2.4.4.2 Current TennCare Enrollees TennCare enrollees who are known to be eligible for enrollment with the CONTRACTOR as of the start date of operations (defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) and residing in the Grand Re gion served by the CONTRACTOR shall be assigned by TENNCARE to the MCOs serving the Grand Region in accordance with the process described in Section 2.4.4.6 below. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.4.4, this includes enrollees curre ntly enrolled in another MCO, including TennCare Select. 2.4.4.3 New TennCare Enrollees 2.4.4.3.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agre ement, all non-SSI applicants shall be required at the time of their application to select an MCO other than TennCare Select from those MCOs available in the Grand Re gion where the applicant resides. If the applicant does not select an MCO, the person will be assigned to an MCO by the State in accordance with Section 2.4.4.6. 2.4.4.3.2 Adults eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI benefits will be assigned to an MCO (other than TennCare Select) by the State. 2.4.4.3.3 Children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI will be assigned to TennCare Select (defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) but may opt-out of TennCare Select and choose another MCO. 2.4.4.3.4 TennCare may allow enrollment of new TennCare enrollees in TennCare Select if there is insufficient capacity in other MCOs. 2.4.4.4 Children in State Custody TennCare enrollees who are children in the cu stody of the Department of Children's Services (DCS) will be enrolled in TennCare Select. When these enrollees exit state custody, they remain enrolled in TennCare Select for a specified period of time and then are disenrolled from TennCare Select. After disenrollment from TennCare Select, if the enrollee has a family member in an MCO (other than TennCare Select) he/she will be enrolled in that MCO. Ot herwise, the enrollee will be given the opportunity to select another MCO. If the enrollee does not select another MCO, he/she will be assigned to an MCO (other than TennCare Select) using the default logic in the auto assignment process (see Section 2.4.4.6 below). 2.4.4.5 Enrollment in MCO Other than the MCO Selected In certain circumstances, if an enrollee re quests enrollment in a particular MCO, the enrollee may be assigned by the State to an MCO other than the one that he/she requested. Examples of circumstances when an enrollee would not be enrolled in the requested MCO include, but are not limited to, such factors as the enrollee does not reside in the Grand Region covered by th e requested MCO, the enrollee has other family members already enrolled in a different MCO, the MCO is closed to new TennCare enrollment, or the enrollee is a member of a population that is to be enrolled in a specified MCO as defined by TENNCARE (e.g., children in the custody of the Department of Children's Services are enrolled in TennCare Select). Page 24 of 374 2.4.4.6 Auto Assignment 2.4.4.6.1 TENNCARE will auto assign an enrollee to an MCO, in specified circumstances, including but not limited to, the enrollee do es not request enrollment in a specified MCO, cannot be enrolled in the requested MCO, or is an adult eligible as a result of receiving SSI benefits. 2.4.4.6.2 The current auto assignment process does not a pply to children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI or children in the state's custody. 2.4.4.6.3 There are four different levels to the current auto assignment process: 2.4.4.6.3.1 If the enrollee was previously enroll ed with an MCO and lost TennCare eligibility for a period of two (2) months or less, the enrollee will be re-enrolled with that MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.2 If the enrollee has family members in an MCO (other than TennCare Select), the enrollee will be enrolled in that MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.3 If the enrollee is a newborn, the enroll ee will be assigned to his/her mother's MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.4 If none of the above applies, the enrollee will be assigned using default logic that randomly assigns enrollees to MCOs (other than TennCare Select). 2.4.4.6.4 TENNCARE may modify the auto assignment algorithm to change or add criteria including but not limited to quality measures or cost or utilization management performance. 2.4.4.7 Non-Discrimination 2.4.4.7.1 The CONTRACTOR shall accept enrollees in the order in which applications are approved and enrollees are assigned to the CONTRACTOR (whether by selection or assignment). 2.4.4.7.2 The CONTRACTOR shall accept an enrollee in the health condition the enrollee is in at the time of enrollment and shall not discr iminate against individuals on the basis of health status or need for health care services. 2.4.4.8 Family Unit If an individual is determined eligible fo r TennCare and has another family member already enrolled in an MCO, that individual shall be enrolled in the same MCO. This does not apply when the individual or family member is assigned to TennCare Select. If the newly enrolled family member opts to change MCOs during the 45-day change period (see Section 2.4.7.2.1), all family members in the case will be transferred to the new MCO. Page 25 of 374 2.4.5 Effective Date of Enrollment 2.4.5.1 Initial Enrollment of Current TennCare Enrollees The effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO for TennCare enrollees who are enrolled in accordance with Section 2.4. 4.2 shall be the date provided on the enrollment file from TENNCARE. In general, the effective date of enrollment for these enrollees will be the start date of operations. 2.4.5.2 Ongoing Enrollment In general, a member's effective date of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO will be the member's effective date of el igibility for TennCare. For SSI enrollees the effective date of eligibility/enrollment is determined by the Social Security Administration in approving SSI coverage for the individual. The effective date of eligibility for other TennCare enrollees is the date of application or the date of the qualifying event (e.g., the date the spend down obligation is met for medically needy enrollees). The effective date on the enro llment file provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR shall govern regardless of the other provisions of this Section 2.4.5.2. 2.4.5.3 In the event the effective date of el igibility provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR for either the initial enro llment of current TennCare enrollees or ongoing enrollment precedes the start date of operations, the CONTRACTOR shall treat the enrollee as a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO effective on the start date of operations. Although the enrollee is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO prior to the start date of operations , the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the payment of claims incurred by th e enrollee during the period of eligibility prior to the start date of operations as specified in Section 3.7.1.2.1. 2.4.5.4 TENNCARE will be responsible for the payment of claims for long-term care services provided to a CHOICES member during the member's period of TennCare eligibility prior to the implementation of CHOICES in the Grand Region covered by this Agreement. 2.4.5.5 Enrollment Prior to Notification 2.4.5.5.1 Because individuals can be retroactively elig ible for TennCare, and the effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO is the effec tive date of eligibility or start date of operations, whichever is sooner, the effectiv e date of enrollment may occur prior to the CONTRACTOR being notified of the person's enrollment. Therefore, enrollment of individuals in the CONTRACTOR's MCO may occur without prior notice to the CONTRACTOR or enrollee. 2.4.5.5.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not be liable for th e cost of any covered services prior to the effective date of enrollment/eligibility but shall be responsible for the costs of covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of enrollment/eligibility. 2.4.5.5.3 TENNCARE shall make payments to the CO NTRACTOR from the effective date of an enrollee's date of enrollment/e ligibility. If the effective date of Page 26 of 374 enrollment/eligibility precedes the start date of operations, payment shall be made in accordance with Section 3.7.1.2.1.

Page 41 of 374 2.6.3 Medical Necessity Determination 2.6.3.1 The CONTRACTOR may establish procedur es for the determination of medical necessity. The determination of medical necessity shall be made on a case by case basis and in accordance with the definition of medical necessity defined in TCA 71-5-144 and TennCare rules and regulations. Howe ver, this requirement shall not limit the CONTRACTOR's ability to use medically appropriate cost effective alternatives in accordance with Section 2.6.5. 2.6.3.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not employ, and shall not permit others acting on their behalf to employ, utilization control guidelin es or other quantitative coverage limits, whether explicit or de facto, unless supporte d by an individualized determination of medical necessity based upon the needs of each TennCare enrollee and his/her medical history. The CONTRACTOR shall have the ability to place tentative limits on a service; however, such tentative limits placed by the CONTRACTOR shall be exceeded (up to the applicable benefit limits on behavioral health and long-term care services provided in Section 2.6.1.4 and 2.6.1.5 above) when medically necessary based on a member's individual characteristics. 2.6.3.3 The CONTRACTOR shall not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service solely because of the diagnosis, type of illness, or condition. 2.6.3.4 The CONTRACTOR may deny services that are non-covered except as otherwise required by TENNderCare or unless otherwise directed to provide by TENNCARE and/or an administrative law judge. 2.6.3.5 All medically necessary services shall be c overed for enrollees under twenty-one (21) years of age in accordance with TENNder Care requirements (see Section 2.7.6). 2.6.4 Second Opinions The CONTRACTOR shall provide for a second opinion in any situation where there is a question concerning a diagnosis or the options for surgery or other treatment of a health condition when requested by a member, parent and/or legally appointed representative. The second opinion shall be provided by a contracted qualified health care professional or the CONTRACTOR shall arrange for a member to obtain one from a non- contract provider. The second opinion shall be provided at no cost to the member. 2.6.5 Use of Cost Effective Alternative Services 2.6.5.1 The CONTRACTOR shall be allowed to u se cost effective alternative services, whether listed as covered or non-covered or omitted in Section 2.6.1 of this Agreement, when the use of such alternativ e services is medically appropriate and is cost effective. This may include, for exam ple, use of nursing facilities as step down alternatives to acute care hospitalizati on or hotel accommodations for persons on outpatient radiation therapy to avoid the rigors of daily transportation. The CONTRACTOR shall comply with TennCare policies and procedures. As provided in the applicable TennCare policies and procedures, services not listed in the TennCare policies and procedures must be prior approved in writing by TENNCARE. Page 42 of 374 2.6.5.2 For CHOICES members, the CONTRACTOR may choose to provide the following as a cost effective alternative to other covered services: 2.6.5.2.1 HCBS to CHOICES members who would othe rwise receive nursing facility care. If a member meets categorical and financial eligibility requirements for enrollment in Group 2 and also meets the nursing facility level of care, as determined by TENNCARE, and would otherwise remain in or be admitted to a nursing facility (as determined by the CONTRACTOR and demonstrated to the satisfaction of TENNCARE), the CONTRACTOR may, at its discretion and upon TENNCARE written prior approval, offer that member H CBS as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care (see Section 2.9.6.3.13). In this instance, TENNCARE will enroll the member receiving HCBS as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility services in Group 2, notwithstanding any enrollment target for Group 2 that has been reached. 2.6.5.2.2 HCBS to CHOICES members in Group 2 in excess of the benefit limits described in Section 2.6.1.5.4 as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care or covered home health services. 2.6.5.2.3 HCBS to CHOICES members in Group 3 in excess of the benefit limits described in Section 2.6.1.5.4 as a cost effective alte rnative to covered home health services. Members in Group 3 do not meet nursing facility level of care and as such, HCBS in excess of benefit limits specified in Section 2.6.1.5.4 may not be offered as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care. 2.6.5.2.4 Non-covered HCBS services to CHOI CES members in Group 2 not otherwise specified in this Agreement or in applicable TennCare policies and procedures, upon written prior approval from TENNCARE. 2.6.5.2.5 For CHOICES members transitioning from a nursing facility to a community setting, a one-time transition allowance, per member . The amount of the transition allowance shall not exceed two thousand dollars ($2,00 0) and may be used for items such as, but not limited to, the first month's rent a nd/or utility deposits, kitchen appliances, furniture, and basic household items. 2.6.5.2.6 For CHOICES members in Groups 2 or 3, non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) not otherwise covered by this Agreement. 2.6.5.3 If the CONTRACTOR chooses to provide cost effective alternative services to a CHOICES member, in no case shall the co st of HCBS, private duty nursing and home health care for Group 2 exceed a member's cost neutrality cap nor the total cost of HCBS, excluding minor home modifications, for members in Group 3 exceed the expenditure cap. The total cost of HCBS includes all HCBS (whether otherwise covered or not covered) and other services that are offered as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care, HCBS, or home health, including, as applicable, the one-time transition allowance for Group 2 and NEMT for Groups 2 and 3. Page 43 of 374 2.6.6 Additional Services and Use of Incentives 2.6.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall not advertise any services that are not required by this Agreement other than those covered pursuant to Section 2.6.1 of this Agreement. 2.6.6.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not offer or provide any services other than services covered by this Agreement (see Section 2.6.1) or services provided as a cost effective alternative (see Section 2.6.5) of this Agreement. However, the CONTRACTOR may provide incentives that have been sp ecifically prior approved in writing by TENNCARE. For example, TENNCARE may a pprove the use of incentives given to enrollees to encourage participation in disease management programs. 2.6.7 Cost Sharing and Patient Liability 2.6.7.1 General The CONTRACTOR and all providers and s ubcontractors shall not require any cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities fo r covered services except to the extent that cost sharing or patient liability r esponsibilities are required for those services by TENNCARE in accordance with TennCare rules and regulations, including but not limited to, holding enrollees liable for debt due to insolvency of the CONTRACTOR or non-payment by the State to the C ONTRACTOR. Further, the CONTRACTOR and all providers and subcontractors shall not charge enrollees for missed appointments. 2.6.7.2 Patient Liability 2.6.7.2.1 TENNCARE will notify the CONTRACTOR of any applicable patient liability amounts for CHOICES members in Group 1 vi a the eligibility/enrollment file. The CONTRACTOR shall delegate collection of patient liability to the nursing facility and shall pay the facility net of the applicable patient liability amount. 2.6.7.2.2 In accordance with the involuntary discharg e process, including notice and appeal (see Section 2.12.11.3), a nursing facility may refuse to continue providing services to a member who fails to pay his or her patient liability and for whom the nursing facility can demonstrate to the CONTRACTOR that it has made a good faith effort to collect payment. 2.6.7.2.3 If the CONTRACTOR is notified that a nursi ng facility is considering discharging a member (see Section 2.12.11.3), the CONTRACTOR shall work to find an alternate nursing facility willing to serve the member and document its efforts in the member's files. 2.6.7.2.4 If the CONTRACTOR is unable to find an alternate nursing facility willing to serve the member, the CONTRACTOR shall determine if it can safely and effectively serve the member in the community and with in the cost neutrality cap. If it can, the member shall be offered a choice of HCBS. If the member chooses HCBS, the CONTRACTOR shall forward all relevant information to TENNCARE for a decision regarding enrollment in Group 2 (Section 2.9.6.3). Page 44 of 374 2.6.7.2.5 If the CONTRACTOR is unable to find an alternate nursing facility willing to serve the member and the CONTRACTOR determines that it cannot safely and effectively serve the member in the community and w ithin the cost neutrality cap, the member declines to enroll in Group 2, or TENNC ARE denies enrollment in Group 2, the CONTRACTOR may, pursuant to Section 2.6.1.5.8, request to no longer provide long-term care services to the member. 2.6.7.3 Preventive Services TennCare cost sharing or patient liabilit y responsibilities shall apply to covered services other than the preventive servi ces described in TennCare rules and regulations. 2.6.7.4 Cost Sharing Schedule The current TennCare cost sharing schedule is included in this Agreement as Attachment II. The CONTRACTOR shall not waive or use any alternative cost sharing schedules, unless required by TENNCARE. 2.6.7.5 Provider Requirements 2.6.7.5.1 Providers or collection agencies acting on the provider's behalf may not bill enrollees for amounts other than applicable TennCare cost sharing or patient liability amounts for covered services, including but not limited to, services that the State or the CONTRACTOR has not paid for, except as permitted by TennCare rules and regulations and as described below. Provi ders may seek payment from an enrollee only in the following situations. 2.6.7.5.1.1 If the services are not covered services and, prior to providing the services, the provider informed the enrollee that the services were not covered. The provider shall inform the enrollee of the non- covered service and have the enrollee acknowledge the information. If the en rollee still requests the service, the provider shall obtain such acknowledgmen t in writing prior to rendering the service. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, on ce the provider bills an MCO for the service that has been provided, the prio r arrangement with the enrollee becomes null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. 2.6.7.5.1.2 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pe nding at the time services are provided and if the provider informs the person they will not accept TennCare assignment whether or not eligibility is establish ed retroactively. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, once the provider bills an MCO for the service the prior arrangement with the enrollee becomes null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. Page 45 of 374 2.6.7.5.1.3 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pe nding at the time services are provided, however, all monies collected, except applicable TennCare cost sharing or patient liability amounts shall be refunded when a claim is submitted to an MCO because the provider agreed to accept TennCare assignment once retroactive TennCare eligibility was established. (The monies collected shall be refunded as soon as a claim is submitted and shall not be held conditionally upon payment of the claim.) 2.6.7.5.1.4 If the services are not covered because they are in excess of an enrollee's benefit limit, and the provider complies with applicable TennCare rules and regulations. 2.6.7.5.2 The CONTRACTOR shall require, as a conditi on of payment, that the provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payer) plus any applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service. Except in the circumstances described above, if the CONTRACTOR is aware that a provider, or a collection agency acting on the provider's behalf, bills an enrollee for amounts other than the applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities due fro m the enrollee, the CONTRACTOR shall notify the provider and demand that the provider and/or collection agency cease such action against the enrollee immediately. If a provider continues to bill an enrollee after notification by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall refer the provider to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. 9. Section 2.7 shall be deleted in its enti rety and replaced with the following: 2.7 SPECIALIZED SERVICES 2.7.1 Emergency Services 2.7.1.1 Emergency services (as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. 2.7.1.2 The CONTRACTOR shall review and approve or disapprove claims for emergency services based on the definition of emergenc y medical condition specified in Section 1 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall base coverage decisions for emergency services on the severity of the symptoms at the time of presentation and shall cover emergency services where the presenting symptoms are of sufficient severity to constitute an emergency medical condition in the judgment of a prudent layperson. The CONTRACTOR shall not impose restrictions on coverage of emergency services more restrictive than those permitted by the prudent layperson standard. 2.7.1.3 The CONTRACTOR shall provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient emergency services, furnished by a qualified provider, re gardless of whether the member obtains the services from a contract provider, that are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition that is f ound to exist using the prudent layperson standard. These services shall be provided without prior authorization in accordance with 42 CFR 438.114. The CONTRACTOR shall pay for any emergency screening examination services conducted to dete rmine whether an emergency medical Page 46 of 374 condition exists and for all emergency ser vices that are medically necessary until the member is stabilized. 2.7.1.4 If an emergency screening examination leads to a clinical determination by the examining provider that an actual em ergency medical condition exists, the CONTRACTOR shall pay for both th e services involved in the screening examination and the services required to stabilize the member. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to pay for all emergency services which are medically necessary until the clinical emergency is stabilized. This includes all medical and behavioral health services that may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the member's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, discharge of the memb er or transfer of the member to another facility. If there is a disagreement between the treating facility and the CONTRACTOR concerning whether the memb er is stable enough for discharge or transfer, or whether the medical benefits of an un-stabilized transfer outweigh the risks, the judgment of the attending provid er(s) actually caring for the member at the treating facility prevails and is binding on the CONTRACTOR. The CONTRACTOR, however, may establish a rrangements with a treating facility whereby the CONTRACTOR may send one of its own providers with appropriate emergency room privileges to assume the attending provider's responsibilities to stabilize, treat, and transfer the member, provided that such arrangement does not delay the provision of emergency services. 2.7.1.5 The CONTRACTOR shall not retroactively deny a claim for an emergency screening examination because the condition, which a ppeared to be an emergency medical condition under the prudent la yperson standard, turned out to be non-emergency in nature. If an emergency screening examinati on leads to a clinical determination by the examining provider that an actual em ergency medical condition does not exist, then the determining factor for payment liability shall be whether the member had acute symptoms of sufficient severity at th e time of presentation. In such cases, the CONTRACTOR shall review the presenting symptoms of the member and shall pay for all services involved in the screening ex amination where the presenting symptoms (including severe pain) were of sufficien t severity to have warranted emergency attention under the prudent layperson st andard regardless of final diagnosis. 2.7.1.6 When the member's PCP or the CONTRA CTOR instructs the member to seek emergency services, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for payment for the medical screening examination and for other medically necessary emergency services, without regard to whether the member's condition meets the prudent layperson standard. 2.7.1.7 Once the member's condition is stabilized , the CONTRACTOR may require prior authorization for hospital admission or follow-up care. 2.7.2 Behavioral Health Services 2.7.2.1 General Provisions 2.7.2.1.1 The CONTRACTOR shall provide all behavioral health services as described in this Section, Section 2.6.1 and Attachment I.

The CONTRACTOR shall select its own electronic visit verification vendor and shall ensure, in the development of such sy stem, the following minimal functionality: 2.9.6.12.3.1 The ability to log the arrival and departur e of individual provider staff person or consumer direction worker; 2.9.6.12.3.2 The ability to verify in accordance with business rules that services are being delivered in the correct location (e.g., the member's home); 2.9.6.12.3.3 The ability to verify the identity of the i ndividual provider staff person or worker providing the service to the member; 2.9.6.12.3.4 The ability to match services provided to a member with services authorized in the plan of care; 2.9.6.12.3.5 The ability to ensure that the provider/wo rker delivering the service is authorized to deliver such services; 2.9.6.12.3.6 The ability to establish a schedule of ser vices for each member which identifies the time at which each service is needed, and the amount, frequency, duration and scope of each service, and to ensure adherence to the established schedule; 2.9.6.12.3.7 The ability to provide immediate (i.e., \"real time\") notification to care coordinators if a provider or worker does not arrive as scheduled or otherwise deviates from the authorized schedule so that service gaps and the reason the service was not provided as scheduled, are immediately identified and addressed, including through the implementation of back-up plans, as appropriate; 2.9.6.12.3.8 The ability for a provider of home-delivered meals to log in and enter the meals that have been delivered during the day, including the member's name, time delivered and the reason a meal was not delivered (when applicable); 2.9.6.12.3.9 The ability for a provider, e.g., adult day care provider, to log in and enter attendance for the day; 2.9.6.12.3.10 The ability for the provider/worker to submit claims to the CONTRACTOR (claims from workers shall be submitted initially to the FEA, and the FEA shall provide claims information to the CONT RACTOR as specified in the subcontract with the FEA; see Section 2.26); and 2.9.6.12.3.11 The ability to reconcile paid claims with service authorizations. Page 126 of 374 2.9.6.12.4 The CONTRACTOR shall not require that provider staff delivering home-delivered meals log in at arrival and departure. In stead, the provider may opt to log in on a daily basis after meals have been delivered and enter information on all the meals that were delivered that day (see Section 2.9.6.12.3.8 above). 2.9.6.12.5 The CONTRACTOR shall monitor and use information from the electronic visit verification system to verify that services are provided as specified in the plan of care, and in accordance with the estab lished schedule, including the amount, frequency, duration, and scope of each service, and that services are provided by the authorized provider/worker; and to iden tify and immediately address service gaps, including late and missed visits.

(Companion care is only available for persons electing consum er direction of HCBS.) A service that is not specified in TennCare rules and regula tions as available for consumer direction shall not be consumer directed. Consumer direction in CHOICES affords members the opportunity to have choice and contro l over how eligible HCBS are provided, who provides the services and how much workers are paid for providing care, up to a specified maximum amount established by TENNCARE (see Section 2.9.7.6.11). Member participation in c onsumer direction of HCBS is voluntary. Members may elect to participate in or withdraw from consumer direction of HCBS at any time, service by service, without affecting thei r enrollment in CHOICES. To the extent possible, the member shall provide his/he r care coordinator ten (10) days advance notice regarding his/her intent to no longer direct one or more eligible HCBS or to withdraw from participation in consumer direction of HCBS entirely. The CONTRACTOR shall respond to the memb er's request in keeping with the timeframes and processes set fort h in this Section, in order to facilitate a seamless transition to appropriate service deliver y. TENNCARE shall establish reasonable limitations on the frequency with which memb ers may opt into and out of consumer direction of HCBS. Page 128 of 374 2.9.7.1.2 Consumer direction is a process by which eligible HCBS are delivered; it is not a service. If a member chooses not to direct his/her care, he/she shall receive authorized HCBS through contract providers. While the denial of a member's request to participate in consumer direction or the termination of a member's participation in consumer direction gives rise to due process including the right to fair hearing, such appeals shall be processed by the TennCare Division of Long Term Care rather than the TennCare Solutions Units, which manages medical appeals pertaining to TennCare benefits (i.e., services). 2.9.7.1.3 Members who participate in consumer direction of HCBS choose either to serve as the employer of record of their worker s or to designate a representative (see definition below in Section 2.9.7.2.1) to serve as the employer of record on his/her behalf. As the employer of record the memb er or his/her representative is responsible for the following: 2.9.7.1.3.1 Hiring/Firing workers; workers; 2.9.7.1.3.4 Supervising workers; 2.9.7.1.3.5 Evaluating worker performance and addressing any identified deficiencies or concerns; 2.9.7.1.3.6 Setting wages up to a specified maximum amount established by TENNCARE; 2.9.7.1.3.7 Training workers to provide personalized care based on the member's needs and preferences; 2.9.7.1.3.8 Reviewing and approving timesheets; 2.9.7.1.3.9 Reviewing and ensuring proper documen tation for services provided; and 2.9.7.1.3.10 Developing and activating as needed a b ack-up plan to address instances when a scheduled worker does not show up. 2.9.7.1.3.10.1 The back-up plan developed by the member may include both paid and unpaid supports; however, it is the responsibilit y of the member electing consumer direction and/or his/her representative to secure paid (as well as unpaid) back-up staff who are willing and available to serve in this capacity for consumer directed services. The CONTRACTOR shall not be expected or required to maintain contract providers \"on standby\" to serve in a back-up capacity for services a member has elected to receive through consumer direction. The member must make arrangements for the provision of n eeded medical care and does not have the option of going without needed services. 2.9.7.1.3.10.2 In some respects, the back-up plan for c onsumer direction is similar to the back- up plan that contract providers are obligat ed to maintain (i.e., to address instances where an agency staff person does not show up). As the employer of record, the Page 129 of 374 member and/or representative have willingly taken on the responsibilities that would otherwise be performed by the c ontract provider agency. However, the back-up plan for consumer directed workers is more comprehensive in that it is intended to facilitate the provision of need ed care even when another paid worker is not available and is thus comparable to and shall be integrated with the back-up plan which is part of the member's plan of care and which also addresses (as applicable) instances in which a contract provider is authorized to provide care and the contract provider's back-up plan fails. The CONTRACTOR shall assess the adequacy of the back-up plan. 2.9.7.2 Representative 2.9.7.2.1 A member may designate, or have appointed by a guardian, a representative to assume the consumer direction responsib ilities on his/her behalf. A representative shall meet, at minimum the following requirements: be at least 18 years of age, have a personal relationship with the member and understand his/her support needs; know the member's daily schedule and routine, medical and functional status, medication regimen, likes and dislikes, and strengths and weaknesses; and be physically present in the member's residence on a regular basis or at least at a frequency necessary to supervise and evaluate workers. 2.9.7.2.2 In order to participate in consumer direction of HCBS with the assistance of a representative, one of the following must apply: (1) the member must have the ability to designate a person to serve as his/ her representative or (2) the member has a legally appointed representative who may serve as the member's representative. 2.9.7.2.3 The care coordinator shall determine if th e member requires assistance in carrying out the responsibilities required for consum er direction and therefore requires a representative. The member's care coordinator/care coordination team shall verify that a representative meets the qualifications as described in Section 2.9.7.2.1 above. 2.9.7.2.4 A member's representative shall not receive payment for serving in this capacity and shall not serve as the member's worker fo r any consumer directed service. The CONTRACTOR shall use a representative agreement developed by TENNCARE to document a member's choice of a representative for consumer direction of HCBS and the representative's contact informa tion, and to confirm the individual's agreement to serve as the representative and to accept the responsibilities and perform the associated duties defined therei n. Ongoing, the fiscal employer agent (FEA) shall notify the CONTRACTOR with in one (1) business day when it becomes aware of any changes to a representative' s contact information. Conversely, the CONTRACTOR shall notify the FEA within one (1) business day when it becomes aware of any changes to a representative's contact information. 2.9.7.2.5 The representative agreement shall be signed by the member (or person authorized to sign on member's behalf which shall not also be the representative for consumer direction) and the representative in the presence of the care coordinator. The care coordinator shall include the representativ e agreement in the member's file and provide copies to the member and/or the member's representative and the FEA (see Section 2.9.7.3 below). Page 130 of 374 2.9.7.2.6 A member may change his/her representative at any time. To the extent possible, the member shall notify his/her care coordinator ten (10) days in advance of initiating a change in representatives. The CONTRA CTOR shall respond to the member's request in keeping with the timeframes a nd processes set forth in this Section, in order to facilitate a seamless transition to a new representative. TENNCARE shall establish reasonable limitations on the freque ncy with which members may change representatives. In the event a member's representative is unexpectedly no longer willing or able to fulfill the consumer dir ection functions on behalf of the member, the CONTRACTOR shal l, as soon as possible, work with the member to find an alternate representative. 2.9.7.2.7 The member's care coordinator/care coordination team shall verify that the new representative meets the qualifications as descr ibed in Section 2.9.7.2.1 above. A new representative agreement shall be completed and signed, in the presence of a care coordinator, prior to the new representa tive assuming the respective responsibilities. The member's care coordinator/care coordination team shall immediately notify the FEA when a member changes his/her representative and provide a copy of the representative agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall facilitate a seamless transition to the new representative, and ensure that there are no interruptions or gaps in services. As part of the needs assessm ent and plan of care process, the care coordinator shall educate the member about the importance of notifying the care coordinator prior to changing a representative. 2.9.7.2.8 The FEA shall ensure that the new repr esentative signs all service agreements (see Section 2.9.7.6.6). 2.9.7.3 Fiscal Employer Agent (FEA) 2.9.7.3.1 The CONTRACTOR shall enter into a s ubcontract with the FEA specified by TENNCARE to provide assistance to members choosing consumer direction. 2.9.7.3.2 The FEA shall fulfill, at a minimum, the following financial administrative and supports broker functions for all CHOICES members electing consumer direction of HCBS: 2.9.7.3.2.1 Assign a supports broker to each CHOICES member electing to participate in consumer direction of HCBS; 2.9.7.3.2.2 Assist in identifying and addressing in the risk assessment and planning processes any additional risk associated with receiving consumer directed services; 2.9.7.3.2.3 Provide initial and ongoing training to members and their representatives (as applicable) on consumer direction and othe r relevant issues (see Section 2.9.7.7 of this Agreement); 2.9.7.3.2.4 Verify worker qualifications, including, as specified by TENNCARE, conduct background checks on workers, enroll workers into Medicaid, assign provider Medicaid ID numbers, and hold Medicaid provider agreements (see Section 2.9.7.6.1 of this Agreement); Page 131 of 374 2.9.7.3.2.5 Provide initial and ongoing training to workers on consumer direction and other relevant issues (see Section 2.9.7.7 of this Agreement); 2.9.7.3.2.6 Assist the member and/or representative in developing and updating service agreements (see Section 2.9.7.6.6); 2.9.7.3.2.7 Receive, review and process timesheets; 2.9.7.3.2.8 Resolve timesheet discrepancies; 2.9.7.3.2.9 Obtain documentation from the member a nd/or representative to ensure that services were provided prior to payment of timesheets; 2.9.7.3.2.10 Withhold, file and pay applicable: fede ral, state and local income taxes; employment and unemployment taxes; and worker's compensation; 2.9.7.3.2.11 Pay workers for services rendered; 2.9.7.3.2.12 Facilitate resolution of any disputes rega rding payment to workers for services rendered; 2.9.7.3.2.13 Monitor quality of services provided by workers; and 2.9.7.3.2.14 Report to the CONTRACTOR on worker and/or staff identification of, response to, participation in and/or i nvestigation of critical incidents (see Section 2.15.8). 2.9.7.3.3 The FEA shall also fulfill, at a minimum, the following financial administrative and supports broker functions for CHOICES me mbers electing consumer direction of HCBS on an as needed basis: 2.9.7.3.3.1 Assist the member and/or representa tive in developing job descriptions; 2.9.7.3.3.2 Assist the member and/or representativ e in locating and recruiting workers; 2.9.7.3.3.3 Assist the member and/or representative in interviewing workers (developing questions, evaluating responses); 2.9.7.3.3.4 Assist the member and/or repr esentative in scheduling workers; 2.9.7.3.3.5 Assist the member and/or representative in managing and monitoring payments to workers; and 2.9.7.3.3.6 Assist the member and/or representa tive in monitoring and evaluating the performance of workers. 2.9.7.3.4 The CONTRACTOR's care coordination func tions shall not duplicate the supports broker functions performed by the FEA or its subcontractor. A member's care coordinator shall work with and coordina te with a member's supports broker in implementing and monitoring consumer direction. Page 132 of 374 2.9.7.3.5 The CONTRACTOR's subcontract with the FEA shall include the provisions specified by TENNCARE in the model FEA subcontract. The subcontract shall specify at a minimum the functions noted in Section 2.9.7.3.2 through 2.9.7.3.3. above (or a reference to the functions); the FEA's responsibilities for communicating with the CONTRACTOR, members and workers; customer service requirements; processes and timeframes for authorizations of consumer directed services; processes and timeframes for service initiation; re quirements and timeframes for processing employee payroll; process and requirements for billing; systems requirements and information exchange requirements; re quirements for notifying MCO regarding readiness to initiate consumer direction of HCBS for a member; role and responsibility for training staff, contractors, members, representatives and workers regarding abuse and neglect plan protocols as described in Section 2.24.4.3 of this Agreement; and role and responsibility for critical incident reporting and management (see Section 2.15.8. 4.6 of this Agreement). 2.9.7.3.6 The CONTRACTOR in collaboration with the FEA shall establish a process that allows for the efficient exchange of all relevant member information between the CONTRACTOR and the FEA. 2.9.7.3.7 The CONTRACTOR and FEA shall develop a protocol for interfaces and transfers of customer service inquiries per the requirements of Section 2.18 of this Agreement. 2.9.7.3.8 The CONTRACTOR shall provide to the FEA copies of all relevant initial and updated member documents, including at a minimum, plans of care, representative agreements and risk agreements. The C ONTRACTOR shall provide to the FEA all relevant documentation prior to service delivery. 2.9.7.4 Needs Assessment/Plan of Care Process 2.9.7.4.1 A CHOICES member may choose to direct n eeded eligible HCBS at anytime: during CHOICES intake, through the needs assessme nt/reassessment and plan of care and plan of care update processes; and outside of these processes. The care coordinator shall assess the member's needs for eligib le HCBS per requirements in Sections 2.9.6.2.4, 2.9.6.3 and 2.9.6.5, as applicable. The care coordinator shall use the plan of care process (including updates) to identify the eligible services that the member will direct and to facilitate the member's enrollment in consumer direction of HCBS. 2.9.7.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall obtain written confirmation of the member's decision to participate in consumer direction of HCBS. 2.9.7.4.2.1 The care coordinator shall assist the member in identifying which of the needed eligible HCBS shall be consumer direct ed, provided by contract providers or a combination of both, in which case, there must be a set schedule which clearly defines when contract providers will be utilized. The CONTRACTOR shall not be expected or required to maintain contr act providers \"on standby\" to serve in a back-up capacity for services a member has elected to receive through consumer direction. 2.9.7.4.3 If the member intends to direct one or mo re needed eligible HCBS, throughout the period of time that consumer direction is being initiated, the CONTRACTOR shall arrange for the provision of needed HCBS through contract providers in accordance Page 133 of 374 with 2.9.6. The care coordinator shall obtain from the member his/her choice of contract providers who will provide HCBS until such time as workers are secured and ready to begin delivering care through consumer direction,. 2.9.7.4.3.1 If a member has been assessed to n eed companion care services, the CONTRACTOR shall identify non-reside ntial services that will offer interim support to address the member's needs and assist the member in obtaining contract providers for these services. 2.9.7.4.4 The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible fo r providing all needed eligible HCBS using contract providers until all necessary requirements have been fulfilled in order to implement consumer direction of HCBS , including but not limited to: the FEA verifies that workers for these services m eet all necessary requirements (see Section 2.9.7.6.1 of this Agreement); service ag reements are completed and signed; and authorizations for consumer directed se rvices are in place. The CONTRACTOR, in conjunction with the FEA, shall facilitate a seamless transition between contract providers and workers and ensure that ther e are no interruptions or gaps in services. 2.9.7.4.5 The care coordinator shall determine if the member will appoint a representative to assume the consumer direction functions on his/her behalf (see Section 2.9.7.6.1 of this Agreement). If the member does not in tend to appoint a representative, the care coordinator shall determine the extent to which a member requires assistance to participate in consumer direction of HCBS, based upon the results of the member's responses to the self-assessment instrume nt developed by TENNCARE. The self- assessment instrument shall be completed by the member with assistance from the member's care coordinator as appropriate . The care coordinator shall file the completed self-assessment in the member's file. 2.9.7.4.5.1 If, based on the results of the self-asse ssment, the care coordinator determines that a member requires assistance to direct his/her services, and the member has not already designated a representative to assume the consumer direction functions, the care coordinator shall inform the member that he/she will need to designate a representative to assume the consumer direction functions on his/her behalf. 2.9.7.4.5.2 The CONTRACTOR shall forward to TE NNCARE for disposition, pursuant to TennCare policy, any cases in which the CONTRACTOR plans to deny participation in consumer direction because a care coordinator has determined that the health, safety and welfare of the member would be in jeopardy if the member participates in consumer dire ction without a representative but the member does not want to appoint a representative to assist in directing his/her services. The CONTRACTOR shall abide by TENNCARE's decision. 2.9.7.4.6 The member's care coordinator/care coordination team shall ensure that the person identified to serve as the representative meets all qualifications (see Section 2.9.7.2.1 of this Agreement) and that a representative agreement is completed and signed by the member and the person prior to forwar ding a referral to the FEA (see Section 2.9.7.4.7 below). 2.9.7.4.7 Within two (2) business days of signi ng the representative agreement, the CONTRACTOR shall forward to the FEA a referral initiating the member's Page 134 of 374 participation in consumer direction of HCBS. The referral shall include at a minimum: the date of the referral; the member's name, address, telephone number, social security number; the name of th e representative and telephone number, if applicable, (if known at the time) and social security number; member TennCare ID number; member's CHOICES enrollment da te; eligible selected HCBS, including amount, frequency and duration of each; a nd care coordinator name and contact information. The CONTRACTOR shall also forward to the FEA a copy of the written confirmation of the member's decision to participate in consumer direction of HCBS. 2.9.7.4.8 Within two (2) business days of receipt of the referral, the FEA shall assign a supports broker to the member and shall notify the care coordinator of the assignment. 2.9.7.4.9 Within five (5) days of receipt of the re ferral, the FEA shall contact the member to inform the member of his/her assigned suppor ts broker, provide contact information for the supports broker, and to begin the pr ocess of initiating consumer direction of HCBS. 2.9.7.4.10 The care coordinator, in conjunction with th e FEA, shall assist the member and/or the representative as needed in developing a back -up plan for consumer direction that adequately identifies how the member w ill address situations when a scheduled worker fails to show up. The member and his/her representative (as applicable) shall have primary responsibility for the developm ent of the back-up plan for consumer directed services. The back-up plan shall include the names and telephone numbers of contacts for alternate care, the order in which contact shall be made and the services to be provided by contacts. Back -up workers may include paid and non-paid supports; however, it is the responsibility of the member electing consumer direction and/or his/her representative to secure pa id (as well as unpaid) back-up staff who are willing and available to serve in this capacity. The CONTRACTOR shall not be expected or required to maintain contract providers \"on standby\" to serve in a back- up capacity for services a member has elected to receive through consumer direction. All persons and/or organizations noted in back-up plan for consumer directed services shall first be contacted by the me mber and/or representative to determine their willingness and availability to serve as back-up workers. The care coordinator shall follow-up with these persons and/or or ganizations to confirm their willingness and availability to provide care when need ed.

If the health plan risk assessment score for any MCO deviates from the profile for the Grand Region being served by the MCO by more than three percent (3%), whether a negative or positive change in scores, the base capitation ra tes as subsequently adjusted will be proportionally adjusted. 3.4.3.4 TENNCARE will recalibrate health plan ri sk assessment scores on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring shifts in en rollment. If warranted prior to the next scheduled annual recalibration as demonstrated by a significant change in health plan risk assessment scores, defined as a change of three percent (3%) or more, whether a negative or positive change in scores, TE NNCARE may adjust the original base capitation rates as subsequently adjusted for all MCOs. 3.4.3.5 In addition to the annual recalibration of risk adjustment factors, those factors will be updated when there is a significant change in program participation. This may occur when an MCO enters or leaves a Grand Region. If an MCO withdraws from a Grand Region, that MCO's membership may be temporarily distributed to TennCare Select or distributed to the remaining MCOs or to new MCOs. New risk adjustment values for the remaining MCOs or new MCO(s) will be calculated that consider the population that will be enrolled in the MCO for the remainder of the contract year only. In this instance, MCOs would be given the option to provide TENNCARE, in writing, with a six (6) months notice of termination in accordance with Section Page 304 of 374 4.4.7.2. This notice option is not availa ble for rate adjustments as described in Sections 3.4.3.1 through 3.4.3.4. 3.4.3.6 An individual's health status will be determined using the John Hopkins ACG\u00ae Case-Mix System (ACG System). In the ev ent the State elects to use a different system to calculate an adjustment for MCO h ealth status risk, the State will notify the CONTRACTOR prior to its implementati on. The ACG System does not account for long-term care services or service delivery setting. 3.4.3.7 For CHOICES members, only the non-long-term care component of the base capitation rate will be adjusted for health plan risk. The long-term care component of the base capitation rate will not be adjusted for health plan risk. 3.4.4 Beginning with capitation payment rates effective Ju ly 1, 2008, in additio n to other adjustments specified in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, the base capitation rates as subsequently adjusted and the priority add-on rates shall be adjusted a nnually for inflation in accordance with the recommendation of the State's actuary. 3.4.5 If (i) changes are required pursuant to federal or st ate statute, federal regulations, the action of a federal agency, a state or federal court, or ru les and regulations of a State of Tennessee agency other than the TennCare Bureau and (ii) the cha nges are likely to impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s) described in Section 3, as determined by TENNCARE, TENNCARE shall have its independent actuary review the re quired change and determine whether the change would impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s). If TENNCARE's independent actuary determines that the change would impact the actuarial soundness of one or more of the capitation rates, the actuary shall determine the a ppropriate adjustment to the impacted capitation rate(s). 3.4.6 In the event TENNCARE amends TennCare rules or regulations or initiates a policy change not addressed in Section 3.4.5 above that is likely to impact the capitation rate(s ) described in Section 3, as determined by TENNCARE, TENNCARE sha ll have its independent actuary review the proposed change and determine whether the change would impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s). If TENNCARE's independent actua ry determines that the change would impact the actuarial soundness of one or more of the ca pitation rates, the actuary shall determine the appropriate adjustment to the impacted capitation rate(s). 3.4.7 In the event the amount of the two percent (2%) pr emium tax is increased during the term of this Agreement, the payments shall be increased by an amount equal to the increase in premium payable by the CONTRACTOR. 3.4.8 Any rate adjustments shall be subject to the availability of state appropriations. 3.5 CAPITATION PAYMENT SCHEDULE TENNCARE shall make payment by the fifth (5th) business day of each month to the CONTRACTOR for the CONTRACTOR's satisfactory performance of its duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement. Page 305 of 374 3.6 CAPITATION PAYMENT CALCULATION 3.6.1 When eligibility has been estab lished by the State for enrollees, the amount owed to the CONTRACTOR shall be calculated as described herein. 3.6.2 Each month payment to the CONTRACTOR shall be equal to the number of enrollees enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO five (5) business days prior to the date of the capitation payment multiplied by the appropriate capitation rate(s) for the enrollee. 3.6.3 The capitation rates stated in Attachment XII w ill be the amounts used to determine the amount of the monthly capitation payment. 3.6.4 The actual amount owed the CONTRACTOR for each member shall be determined by dividing the appropriate monthly capitation rate(s) by the number of days in the month and then multiplying the quotient of this transaction by th e actual number of days the member was enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.6.5 The amount paid to the CONTRACTOR shall equal the total of the amount owed for all enrollees determined pursuant to Section 3.6.4 less th e withhold amount (see Section 3.9), capitation payment adjustments made pursuant to Section 3. 7 or 3.11, and any other adjustments, which may include withholds for penalties, damages, liquidated damages, or adjustments based upon a change of enrollee status. 3.7 CAPITATION PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS 3.7.1 The State has the discretion to retroactively ad just the capitation payment for any enrollee if TENNCARE determines an incorrect payment was made to the CONTRACTOR; provided, however: 3.7.1.1 For determining the capitation rate(s) only, the Grand Region being served by the enrollee's MCO under this Agreement will be used to determine payment. The capitation payment shall not be retroactivel y adjusted to reflect a different Grand Region of residence so long as the enro llee's MCO assignment is effective. 3.7.1.2 For individuals enrolled with a retroactive effective date on the date of enrollment, the payment rate for retroactive periods shall be the capitation rate(s) for the applicable rate category and the Grand Region in which the enrollee's assigned MCO is operating under this Agreement as spec ified in Attachment XII, except that: 3.7.1.2.1 The CONTRACTOR agrees to manually process claims and reimburse providers for services incurred prior to the start date of operations of this Agreement; however, the CONTRACTOR will not be at risk for these services. The CONTRACTOR shall be paid two dollars ($2.00) per claim as reimbursement for processing claims for services incurred prior to the start date of operations. Actual expenditures for covered services and the allowed amount for claims processing are subject to TCA 56-32-124. The CONTRACTOR shall negotiate provide r reimbursement subject to TENNCARE prior written approval and prepare checks fo r payment of providers for the provision of covered services incurred during an enrollee' s period of eligibility prior to the start date of operations on an as needed b asis. The CONTRACTOR shall notify the State of the amount to be paid in a mutually acceptable form and format at least forty-eight Page 306 of 374 (48) hours in advance of distribution of any provider payment related to this requirement. TENNCARE shall remit paymen t to the CONTRACTOR in an amount equal to: the amount to be paid to provid ers; plus, two dollars ($2.00) per claim processed by the CONTRACTOR; plus, an am ount sufficient to cover any payment due in accordance with TCA 56-32-124 within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of notice. The CONTRACTOR shall then releas e payments to providers within twenty- four (24) hours of the receipt of funds from the State. The CONTRACTOR is responsible for any payments requi red pursuant to TCA 56-32-124. 3.7.1.2.2 TENNCARE will be responsible for the payment of claims for long-term care services provided to a CHOICES member dur ing the member's period of eligibility prior to the implementation of CHOICES in the Grand Region covered by this Agreement. 3.7.1.3 If a provider seeks reimbursement for a service provided during a retroactive period of eligibility, the CONTRACTOR sha ll assess cost sharing responsibilities in accordance with the cost sharing schedules in effect on the date of service for which reimbursement is sought (see Attachme nt II) and collect patient liability from CHOICES members as applicable (see Sections 2.6.7.2 and 2.21.5). 3.7.1.4 Should TENNCARE determine after the capitation payment is made that an enrollee's capitation rate category had changed or the enrollee was deceased, TENNCARE shall retroactively adjust the payment to the CONTRACTOR to accurately reflect the enrollee's capitation rate category for the period for which payment has been made. TENNCARE shall in itially retroactively adjust the payment to the CONTRACTOR, not to exceed twelve (12) months. Subsequently, TENNCARE shall further retroactively adju st the payment to the CONTRACTOR to accurately reflect the enrollee's capitation ra te category for the period prior to the twelve (12) month adjustment initially made by TENNCARE. TENNCARE will make the subsequent adjustment at least semi-annually. 3.7.1.4.1 TENNCARE and the CONTRACTOR agree that the twelve (12) month limitation described in Sections 3.7.1.4 is applicable only to retroactive capitation rate payment adjustments described in those paragraphs and shall in no way be construed as limiting the effective date of eligibility or enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.7.1.5 Payment adjustments resulting in a reducti on or increase of the capitation rate shall be accomplished through the monthly capitation reconciliation process. 3.8 SERVICE DATES Except where required by this Agreement or by applicable federal or state law, the CONTRACTOR shall not make payment for the cost of any services provided prior to the effective date of eligibility in the CONTRA CTOR's MCO. The CONTRACTOR shall make payment for the cost of any covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of eligibility in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. Page 307 of 374 3.9 WITHHOLD OF THE CAPITATION RATE 3.9.1 A withhold of the aggregate capitation paymen t shall be applied to ensure CONTRACTOR compliance with the requirements of this Agr eement and to provide an agreed incentive for assuring CONTRACTOR compliance with the requirements of this Agreement. 3.9.2 The amount due for the first monthly payment, and for each month thereafter, calculated pursuant to Section 3.6 shall be reduced by the appropria te cash flow withhold percentage amount and set aside for distribution to the CONTRACTOR in th e next regular monthly payment, unless retained as provided below. 3.9.2.1 Except as further provided below, the app licable capitation payment withhold amount will be equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the monthly capitation payment for the first six months following the start date of operations, and for any consecutive six (6) month period following the CONTRACTOR's receipt of a notice of deficiency as described in Section 2.25.9; 3.9.2.2 If, during any consecutive six (6) month period following the start date of operations, TENNCARE determines that the CONTRACTOR has no deficiencies and has not issued a notice of deficiency, the monthly withhold amount will be reduced to five percent (5%) of the monthly capitation payment. 3.9.2.3 If, during any consecutive six (6) month pe riod following a reduction of the monthly withhold amount to five percent (5%) of the monthly capitation payment, TENNCARE determines that the CONTRACTOR has no deficiencies and has not issued a notice of deficiency, the monthly withhold amount will be reduced to two and one half percent (2.5%) of the monthly capitation payment. 3.9.2.4 If the CONTRACTOR is notified by TENNCARE of a minor deficiency and the CONTRACTOR cures the minor deficiency to the satisfaction of TENNCARE within a reasonable time prior to the ne xt regularly scheduled capitation payment cycle, TENNCARE may disregard the minor deficiency for purposes of determining the withhold. 3.9.2.5 If TENNCARE has determined the CONTRA CTOR is not in compliance with a requirement of this Agreement in any given month, TENNCARE will issue a written notice of deficiency and TENNCARE will retain the amount withheld for the month prior to TENNCARE identifying the compliance deficiencies. 3.9.2.6 The withhold amounts for subsequent months thereafter in which the CONTRACTOR has not cured the deficienci es shall be in accordance with Section 3.9.2.1 as described above. If the CONTRACT OR has attained a two and one half percent (2.5%) withhold and TENNC ARE subsequently determines the CONTRACTOR is not in compliance with a requirement of this Agreement, TENNCARE will provide written notice of such determination and TENNCARE will re-institute the retention of the withhold as described in Section 3.9.2.1 at the next capitation payment cycle. Monthly retention of the withhold amount will continue for each subsequent month so long as the identified deficiencies have not been corrected. These funds will not be distributed to the CONTRACTOR unless it is determined by TENNCARE the CONTRACTOR has come in to compliance with the Agreement requirement(s) within six (6) months of TENNCARE identifying these deficiencies. Page 308 of 374 For example, if a specified deficiency(s) is corrected within four (4) months and there are no other identified deficiencies which the CONTRACTOR has been given written notice of by TENNCARE, the withhold for the four (4) consecutive months will be paid to the CONTRACTOR upon TENNCARE determination that the deficiency(s) was corrected. However, any amounts withheld by TENNCARE for six (6) consecutive months for the same or similar compliance deficiency(s) shall be retained by TENNCARE on the anniversary of the sixth consecutive month and shall not be paid to the CONTRACTOR. If the same or si milar specified deficiency(s) continues beyond six (6) consecutive months, TENNCARE may declare the MCO ineligible for future distribution of the ten percent (10% ) incentive withhold. Such ineligibility will continue for each month TENNCARE determ ines the same or similar specified deficiency(s) continues to exist. Once a CONTRACTOR corrects the deficiency(s), TENNCARE may reinstate the MCO's eligibilit y for distribution of the ten percent (10%) compliance incentive payment of futu re withholds. If TENNCARE determines that distribution of the ten percent (10%) withhold is appropriate, distribution of the ten percent (10%) shall be made at the time of the next scheduled monthly check write which includes all other payments due the CONTRACTOR. 3.9.3 No interest shall be due to the CONTRACTOR on any sums withheld or retained under this Section. The provisions of this Section may be invoked alone or in conjunction with any other remedy or adjustment otherwise allowed under this Agreement. 3.9.4 If TENNCARE has not identified CONTRACTOR deficiencies, TENNCARE will pay to the CONTRACTOR the withhold of the CONTRACTOR's payments withheld in the month subsequent to the withhold. 3.10 PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS 3.10.1 General 3.10.1.1 TENNCARE will make incentive payments to the CONTRACTOR in accordance with this Section 3.10. 3.10.1.2 Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6, the total of a ll payments made to the CONTRACTOR for a year shall not exceed one hundred and five percent (105%) of capitation payments made to the CONTRACTOR. 3.10.1.3 In the first year that the incentives specif ied in Sections 3.10.2 and 3.10.3 below are available, the TennCare regional average HEDIS score (as calculated by TENNCARE using audited MCO HEDIS results) for each of the measures specified in Sections 3.10.2 and 3.10.3 for the last fu ll calendar year prior to the year that the CONTRACTOR began operating under this Agreement will serve as the baseline. If complete TennCare HEDIS data for these measures is not available for the region for the year prior to the year that the CONTRACTOR began operating under this Agreement, then the last year for which co mplete data is available will serve as the baseline. 3.10.1.4 If NCQA makes changes in any of the measures specified in Section 3.10.2 or 3.10.3 below, such that valid comparison to prior years will not be possible, TENNCARE, at its sole discretion, may elect to ei ther eliminate the measure from pay-for- performance incentive eligibility or replace it with another measure. Page 309 of 374 3.10.2 Physical Health HEDIS Measures 3.10.2.1 Beginning on July 1, 2010, on July 1 of each year, the CONTRACTOR will be eligible for a $.03 PMPM payment, applied to member months from the preceding calendar year, for each of the audited HEDIS measures specified in Section 3.10.2.2 below (calculated from the preceding calendar year's data) for which significant improvement has been demonstrated. The CONTRACTOR's HEDIS result for the re porting period prior to the current reporting period will serve as the baselin e. Significant improvement is defined using NCQA's minimum effect size change methodology (see Section 3.10.5 below) . 3.10.2.2 Incentive payments will be available for the following audited HEDIS measures: 3.10.2.2.1 HbA1C Testing 3.10.2.2.5 Breast Cancer Controlling High Blood Pressure. 3.10.2.3 For HbA1C control, the reverse of the HE DIS measure (i.e. 100 minus the percentage of individuals with poorly controlled HbA1C) will serve as the measure for purposes of this section. 3.10.3 Behavioral Health HEDIS Measures 3.10.3.1 Beginning on July 1, 2010, on July 1 of each year, the CONTRACTOR will be eligible for a $.03 PMPM payment, applied to member months from the preceding calendar year, for each of th e following audited HEDIS measures (calculated from the preced ing calendar year's data) for which significant improvement has been demonstrated. The CONTRACTOR's HEDIS result for the reporting period prior to the cu rrent reporting period will serve as the baseline. To be eligible for in centive payment for a measure, the CONTRACTOR must demons trate significant improvement for both rates comprising the measure. Significant im provement is defined using NCQA's minimum effect size change met hodology (see Section 3.10.5 below). 3.10.3.1.1 Antidepressant Medication Management; and 3.10.3.1.2 Follow-up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication. Page 310 of 374 3.10.4 Community Tenure/Hospital Readmission for Mental Illness 3.10.4.1 Beginning on July 1, 2010, on July 1 of each year, the CONTRACTOR will be eligible for a $.03 PMPM payment, applied to member months from the preceding calendar year, if significant improvement has been demonstrated in the rate at which members hospitalized for mental illness re main in the community (i.e. are not readmitted to an inpatient hospital setting for treatment of mental illness) within thirty (30) days of discharge. Signifi cant improvement is defined using NCQA's minimum effect size change methodology (see Section 3.10.5 below). The baseline rate will be the percentage of the CONT RACTOR's enrollees that were discharged following hospitalization for mental illness during the reporting period prior to the current reporting period and that were not readmitted within thirty (30) days following discharge, as calculated by TennCar e. The baseline rate will be compared to the percentage of the CONTRACTOR's members that were discharged following hospitalization for mental illness during the preceding calendar year of operation, and that were not readmitted within thirty (30 days) following discharge. The latter calculation will use methodology identical to that used in th e baseline calculation performed by TENNCARE. 3.10.5 NCQA Minimum Effect Size Change Methodology The NCQA minimum effect size change methodology is as follows: Baseline Rate Minimum Effect Size 0-59 At least a 6 percentage point change 60-74 At least a 5 percentage point change 75-84 At least a 4 percentage point change 85-92 At least a 3 percentage point change 93-96 At least a 2 percentage point change 97-99 At least a 1 percentage point change 3.11 EFFECT OF DISENROLLMENT ON CAPITATION PAYMENTS 3.11.1 Payment of capitation payments shall cease effect ive the date of the member's disenrollment from the CONTRACTOR's MCO, and the CONTRACTOR shall have no further responsibility for the care of the enrollee. Except for situations involving enrollment obtained by fraudulent applications or death, disenrollment from Te nnCare shall not be made retroactively. 3.11.2 Fraudulent Enrollment 3.11.2.1 In the case of fraudulent, mi srepresented or deceptive a pplications submitted by the enrollee, the CONTRACTOR, at its discretion, may refund to TENNCARE all capitation payments made on behalf of pe rsons who obtained enrollment in TennCare through such means and the CONTRACTOR may pursue full restitution for all payments made on behalf of the indivi dual while the person was inappropriately enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.11.2.2 In the event of enrollment obtained by fra ud, misrepresentation or deception by the CONTRACTOR's staff, officers, employees, providers, volunteers, subcontractors, Page 311 of 374 or anyone acting for or on behalf of the CONTRACTOR, TENNCARE may retroactively recover capitation amounts plus interest, as allowed by TCA 47-14-103, and any other monies paid to the CONT RACTOR for the enrollment of that individual. The refund of capitation payments plus interest will not preclude the State from exercising its right to criminal pro secution, civil penalties, trebled damages and/or other remedial measures. 3.12 HMO PAYMENT TAX The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for paym ent of applicable taxes pursuant to TCA 56- 32-124. In the event the amount due pursuant to TCA 56-32-124 is increased during the term of this Agreement, the payments to the CONTRACT OR shall be increased by an amount equal to the increase in the amount due by the CONTRACTOR. 3.13 PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR FO R ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION SYSTEM TENNCARE will pay the CONTRACTOR $605,600 to offset the CONTRACTOR's costs related to implementing an electronic visit verification (EVV) system. In accordance with the applicable appropriations language, these funds sha ll be used to implement the EVV, and they shall not be used for any other purpose. U pon TENNCARE's request the CONTRACTOR shall submit documentation that demonstrates that funds were used to offset the CONTRACTOR's costs related to implementing the EVV. 3.14 PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS 3.14.1 Maximum Liability 3.14.1.1 In no event shall the maximum liability of the State under this Agreement during the original term of the Agreement exceed tw o billion, three hundred twenty one million, nine hundred ninety five thousand, six hundred forty seven dollars ($2,321,995,647.00). 3.14.1.2 If the Agreement maximum would be ex ceeded as a result of an increase in enrollment, a change in mix of enrollment among rate cells or any rate adjustment pursuant to Section 3.4 above, the State shall adjust the Agreement maximum liability to accommodate the aforementioned ci rcumstances. This adjustment shall be based on consultation with the State's independent actuary. 3.14.1.3 This Agreement does not obligate the State to pay a fixed minimum amount and does not create in the CONTRACTOR any rights, in terests or claims of entitlement in any funds. 3.14.1.4 The CONTRACTOR is not entitled to be pa id the maximum liability for any period under the Agreement or any extensions of the Agreement. The maximum liability represents available funds for payment to the CONTRACTOR and does not guarantee payment of these funds to the CONTRACTOR under this Agreement. Page 312 of 374 3.14.2 Compensation Firm The capitation rates and the Maximum Liability of th e State under this Agreement are firm for the duration of the Agreement and are not subject to escalation for any reason unless amended, or changed by the Notice specified in Section 3.4.2 of this Agreement. 3.14.3 Capitation Payment Amounts After the First Year The base capitation rates (see Section 3) for the period from the start date of operations to June 30, 2008 for all non-CHOICES rate categories will be established through a competitive bid process, and the priority add-on rate and the base capitation rate for CHOICES members will be established by the State. The base capitation rates (for CHOICES and non-CHOICES members) and the priority add-on rate for subsequent y ears will be set by Notice as provided under Section 3.4.2 of this Agreement. 3.14.4 Payment Methodology The CONTRACTOR shall be compensated in accord ance with Section 3 above as authorized by the State in a total amount not to exceed the Agreement Maximum Liability established in Section 3.13.1 above. The CONTRACTOR's compensation shall be contingent upon the satisfactory completion of requirements under this Agreement. 3.14.5 Return of Funds and Deductions 3.14.5.1 The CONTRACTOR shall refund to TENNCARE any overpayments due or funds disallowed pursuant to this Agreement within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of written notification from TENNCARE, unless otherwise authorized by TENNCARE in writing. 3.14.5.2 The State reserves the right to deduct from amounts which are or shall become due and payable to the CONTRACTOR under this or any Agreement or contract between the CONTRACTOR and the State of Tennessee any amounts which are or shall become due and payable to the State of Tennessee by the CONTRACTOR. 3.14.6 Automatic Deposits The CONTRACTOR shall complete and sign an \"Authorization Agreement for Automatic Deposit (ACH Credits)\" form. This form shall be provided to the CONTRACTOR by the State. Once this form has been completed and subm itted to the State by the CONTRACTOR all payments to the CONTRACTOR, under this or any other Agreement/contract the CONTRACTOR has with the State of Tennessee sh all be made by Automated Clearing House (ACH). The CONTRACTOR shall not be paid under this Agreement until the CONTRACTOR has completed this form and submitted it to the State. Page 313 of 374 29. Sections 4.2 through 4.5 shall be deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following: 4.2 AGREEMENT TERM 4.2.1 Term of the Agreement This Agreement, including any amendments and any changes made by notice to adjust the capitation rates, shall be effective commencing on Au gust 15, 2006 and ending on June 30, 2010. 4.2.2 Term Extension The State reserves the right to extend this Agreem ent for an additional period or periods of time representing increments of no more than one (1) ye ar and a total term of no more than five (5) years, provided that the State notifies the CONTRACT OR in writing of its intention to do so at least six (6) months prior to the Agreement expi ration date.

It consists of activities performed by a team or a single mental health case manager to support clinical services. Mental health case managers assist in ensuring the individual/family access to services. Mental health case management requires that the mental health case manager and the individual and/or family have a strong productive relationship whic h includes viewing the individual/family as a responsible partner in identifying and obtaining th e necessary services and resources. Services rendered to children and youth shall be consum er-centered and family-focused w ith case managers working with multiple systems (e.g. education, child welfare, ju venile justice). Mental health case management is provided in community settings, which are accessible and comfortable to the individual/family.

Page 337 of 374 SERVICE DELIVERY The CONTRACTOR shall: Determine caseload size based on an average numbe r of individuals per case manager, with the expectation being that case managers will have mi xed caseloads of clients and flexibility between Levels 1 and 2 (Levels 1 a nd 2 are defined below); and Ensure that caseload sizes and minimum contacts are met as follows: Case Management Type Maximum Caseload Size Minimum Face-to-Face Contacts Level 1 (Non- Team Approach)* 25 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Level 1 (Team Approaches): Adult CTT 20 individuals:1 team 20 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Children & Youth (C&Y) CTT 15 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week CCFT 15 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week ACT 100 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week PACT 100 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Level 2* 35 individuals:1 case manager Two (2) contacts per month *For case managers having a combination of Level 1 & Level 2 (non-team) individuals, the maximum caseload size shall be no more than 30 individuals:1 case manager . The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that the following requirements are met: 1) All mental health case managers shall have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree; 2) Supervisors shall maintain no greater than a 1:30 supervisory ratio with mental health case managers; 3) Mental health case managers who are assigned to both a parent(s) and child in the same family, should have skills and experience needed for both ages; mental health case managers who are assigned to individuals with co-occurring disorders (mental illness and substance abuse disorders) should have the skills and experience to meet the needs of these individuals; 4) Eighty percent (80%) of all mental health case management services should take place outside the case manager's office; 5) The children and youth (C&Y) (under age eighteen (18)) mental health case management model shall provide a transition from C&Y services into adult services, including adult mental health case management services.

Page 338 of 374 Level 1 Level 1 mental health case management is the most intense level of service. It provides frequent and comprehensive support to individuals with a focus on recovery and resilience. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure the provision of level 1 mental health case mana gement to the most severely disabled adults and emotionally disturbed children and youth, includi ng individuals who are at high risk of future hospitalization or placement out of the home a nd require both community support and treatment interventions. Level 1 mental health case management can be rendered through a team approach or by individual mental health case managers. Team approa ches may include such models as ACT, CTT, CCFT and PACT, as described below: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) ACT is a way of delivering comprehensive and effectiv e services to adults diagnosed with severe mental illness and who have needs that have not been well met by traditional approaches to delivering services. The principles of ACT include: 1) Services targeted to a specific group of individuals with severe mental illness; 2) Treatment, support and rehabilitation servi ces provided directly by the ACT team; 3) Sharing of responsibility between team me mbers and individuals served by the team; 4) Small staff (all team staff including case mana gers) to individual ratios (approx. 1 to 10); 5) Comprehensive and flexible range of treatment and services; 6) Interventions occurring in community settings ra ther than in hospitals or clinic settings; 7) No arbitrary time limit on receiving services; 8) Individualized treatment, support and rehabilitation services; 9) Twenty-four (24) hour a da y availability of services; and 10) Engagement of individuals in treatment and monitoring. Continuous Treatment Team (CTT) CTT is a coordinated team of staff (to include phys icians, nurses, case managers, and other therapists as needed) who provide a range of intensive, integr ated mental health case management, treatment, and rehabilitation services to adults and children and youth. The intent is to provide intensive treatment to families of children and youth with acute psychiatric problems in an effort to prevent removal from the home to a more restrictive level of care. An array of services are delivered in the home or in natural settings in the community, and are provided through a strong partnership with the family and other community support systems. The program provides services including crisis intervention and stabilization, counseling, skills building, therap eutic intervention, advocacy, educational services, medication management as indicated, school based c ounseling and consultation w ith teachers, and other specialized services deemed necessary and appropriate. Comprehensive Child and Fam ily Treatment (CCFT) CCFT services are high intensity, time-limited ser vices designed for children and youth to provide stabilization and deter the \"imminent\" risk of State custody for the individual. There is usually family instability and high-risk behaviors exhibited by th e child/adolescent. CCFT serv ices are concentrated on child, family, and parental/guardian behaviors and interaction. CCFT servi ces are more treatment oriented and situation specific with a focus on short-term stab ilization goals. The primary goal of CCFT is to reach an appropriate point of stabilization so the individu al can be transitioned to a less intense outpatient service. Page 339 of 374 Program of Assertive and Community Treatment (PACT) PACT is a service delivery model for providing compre hensive community-based treatment to adults with severe and persistent mental illness. It involves the use of a multi-disciplinary team of mental health staff organized as an accountable, mobile mental health ag ency or group of providers who function as a team interchangeably to provide the treatment, rehabilitati on and support services pers ons with severe and/or persistent mental illnesses need to live successfully in the community. Level 2 Level 2 mental health case manageme nt is a less intensive level of servi ce than Level 1 and is focused on resilience and recovery. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that level 2 mental health case management is provided to individuals whose symptoms are at least partially stabilized or reduced in order to allow treatment and rehabilitation efforts. SERVICE COMPONENTS The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that mental hea lth case management incorporates the following service components: Crisis Facilitation Crisis facilitation is provided in situations re quiring immediate attention/resolution for a specific individual or other person(s) in relation to a spec ific individual. It is the process of accessing and coordinating services for an individual in a crisis s ituation to ensure the necessary services are rendered during and following the crisis episode. Most cris is facilitation activities w ould involve face-to-face contact with the individual. Assessment of Daily Functioning Assessment of daily functioning involves the on-going monitoring of how an individual is coping with life on a day to day basis for the purposes of dete rmining necessary services to maintain community placement and improve level of functioning. Most assessments of daily functioning are achieved by face- to-face contact with the individual in his or her natural environment. Assessment/Referral/Coordination Assessment/referral/coordination involves assessing th e needs of the individual for the purposes of referral and coordination of services that will impr ove functioning and/or ma intain stability in the individual's natural environment. Mental Health Liaison Mental health liaison services are offered to persons who are not yet assigned to mental health case management. It is a short-term service for the pur poses of service referral and continuing care until other mental health services are initiated. Page 340 of 374 SERVICE Psychiatric Reh abilitation DEFINITION Psychiatric rehabilitation is an array of consumer -centered recovery services designed to support the individual in the attainment or maintenance of his or her optimal level of functioning. These services are designed to capitalize on personal strengths, develop copi ng skills and strategies to deal with deficits and develop a supportive environment in which to func tion as independent as possible on the individual's recovery journey. Services included under psychiatric rehabilitation are as follows. SERVICE COMPONENTS Psychosocial Rehabilitation Psychosocial rehabilitation services utilize a comprehensiv e approach (mind, body, and spirit) to work with the whole person for the purposes of improving an individuals' functioning , promoting management of illness(s), and facilitating recovery. The goal of psyc hosocial rehabilitation is to support individuals as active and productive members of their communities. Indivi duals, in partnership with staff, form goals for skills development in the areas of vocational, edu cational, and interpersonal growth (e.g. household management, development of social support netw orks) that serve to maximize opportunities for successful community integration. Individuals procee d toward goal attainment at their own pace and may continue in the program at varying levels in tensity for an indefinite period of time. Supported Employment Supported employment consists of a range of services to assist individuals to choose, prepare for, obtain, and maintain gainful employment that is based on individuals' preferences, strengths, and experiences. This service also includes a variety of support services to the individual, including side-by-side support on the job. These services may be integrated into a psychosocial rehabilitation center. Peer Support Peer support services allow individuals to direct their own recovery and advocacy process and are provided by persons who are or have been consumers of the behavioral health system and their family members and are Certified Peer Support Specialists. These services include providing assistance with more effectively utilizing the service delivery system (e.g. assistance in developing plans of care, accessing services and supports, partnering with prof essionals) or understanding and coping with the stressors of the person's illness through support gr oups, coaching, role modeling, and mentoring. Activities which promote socialization, recovery, self-advocacy, development of natural supports, and maintenance of community living skil ls are rendered so individuals can educate and support each other in the acquisition of skills needed to manage their illnesses and access resources within their communities. Services are often provided during the evening and weekend hours. Page 341 of 374 Illness Management & Recovery Illness management and recovery services refers to a series of weekly sessions with trained mental health practitioners for the purpose of assisting individuals in developing personal st rategies for coping with mental illness and promoting recovery. Supported Housing Supported housing services refers to services rendered at facilities that are staffed twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days a week with associated ment al health staff supports fo r individuals who require treatment services and supports in a highly structured setting. These mental health services are for persons with serious and/or persistent mental illnesses (SPM I) and are intended to prepare individuals for more independent living in the community while providing an environment that allows individuals to live in community settings. Given this goal, every effort sh ould be made to place individuals in facilities near their families and other support systems and origin al areas of residence. Supported housing services are mental health services and do not include the payment of room and board. 39.

Ot herwise, the enrollee will be given the opportunity to select another MCO. If the enrollee does not select another MCO, he/she will be assigned to an MCO (other than TennCare Select) using the default logic in the auto assignment process (see Section 2.4.4.6 below). 2.4.4.5 Enrollment in MCO Other than the MCO Selected In certain circumstances, if an enrollee re quests enrollment in a particular MCO, the enrollee may be assigned by the State to an MCO other than the one that he/she requested. Examples of circumstances when an enrollee would not be enrolled in the requested MCO include, but are not limited to, such factors as the enrollee does not reside in the Grand Region covered by th e requested MCO, the enrollee has other family members already enrolled in a different MCO, the MCO is closed to new TennCare enrollment, or the enrollee is a member of a population that is to be enrolled in a specified MCO as defined by TENNCARE (e.g., children in the custody of the Department of Children's Services are enrolled in TennCare Select). 2.4.4.6 Auto Assignment 2.4.4.6.1 TENNCARE will auto assign an enrollee to an MCO, in specified circumstances, including but not limited to, the enrollee do es not request enrollment in a specified MCO, cannot be enrolled in the requested MCO, or is an adult eligible as a result of receiving SSI benefits. 21 of 327 2.4.4.6.2 The current auto assignment process does not a pply to children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI or children in the state's custody. 2.4.4.6.3 There are four different levels to the current auto assignment process: 2.4.4.6.3.1 If the enrollee was previously enroll ed with an MCO and lost TennCare eligibility for a period of two (2) months or less, the enrollee will be re-enrolled with that MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.2 If the enrollee has family members in an MCO (other than TennCare Select), the enrollee will be enrolled in that MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.3 If the enrollee is a newborn, the enroll ee will be assigned to his/her mother's MCO. 2.4.4.6.3.4 If none of the above applies, the enrollee will be assigned using default logic that randomly assigns enrollees to MCOs (other than TennCare Select). 2.4.4.6.4 TENNCARE may modify the auto assignment algorithm to change or add criteria including but not limited to quality measures. 2.4.4.7 Non-Discrimination 2.4.4.7.1 The CONTRACTOR shall accept enrollees in the order in which applications are approved and enrollees are assigned to the CONTRACTOR (whether by selection or assignment). 2.4.4.7.2 The CONTRACTOR shall accept an enrollee in the health condition the enrollee is in at the time of enrollment and shall not discr iminate against individuals on the basis of health status or need for health care services. 2.4.4.8 Family Unit If an individual is determined eligible fo r TennCare and has another family member already enrolled in an MCO, that individual shall be enrolled in the same MCO. This does not apply when the individual or family member is assigned to TennCare Select. If the newly enrolled family member opts to change MCOs during the 45-day change period (see Section 2.4.7.2.1), all family members in the case will be transferred to the new MCO. 2.4.5 Effective Date of Enrollment 2.4.5.1 Initial Enrollment of Current TennCare Enrollees The effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO for TennCare enrollees who are enrolled in accordance with Section 2.4. 4.2 shall be the date provided on the enrollment file from TENNCARE. In general, the effective date of enrollment for these enrollees will be the start date of operations. 22 of 327 2.4.5.2 Ongoing Enrollment In general, a member's effective date of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO will be the member's effective date of el igibility for TennCare. For SSI enrollees the effective date of eligibility/enrollment is determined by the Social Security Administration in approving SSI coverage for the individual. The effective date of eligibility for other TennCare enrollees is the date of application or the date of the qualifying event (e.g., the date the spend down obligation is met for medically needy enrollees). The effective date on the enro llment file provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR shall govern regardless of the other provisions of this Section 2.4.5.2. 2.4.5.3 In the event the effective date of el igibility provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR for either the initial enro llment of current TennCare enrollees or ongoing enrollment precedes the start date of operations, the CONTRACTOR shall treat the enrollee as a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO effective on the start date of operations. Although the enrollee is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO prior to the start date of operations , the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the payment of claims incurred by th e enrollee during the period of eligibility prior to the start date of operations as specified in Section 3.7.1.2.1. 2.4.5.4 Enrollment Prior to Notification 2.4.5.4.1 Because individuals can be retroactively elig ible for TennCare, and the effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO is the effec tive date of eligibility or start date of operations, whichever is sooner, the effectiv e date of enrollment may occur prior to the CONTRACTOR being notified of the person's enrollment. Therefore, enrollment of individuals in the CONTRACTOR's MCO may occur without prior notice to the CONTRACTOR or enrollee. 2.4.5.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not be liable for th e cost of any covered services prior to the effective date of enrollment/eligibility but shall be responsible for the costs of covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of enrollment/eligibility. 2.4.5.4.3 TENNCARE shall make payments to the CO NTRACTOR from the effective date of an enrollee's date of enrollment/e ligibility. If the effective date of enrollment/eligibility precedes the start date of operations, payment shall be made in accordance with Section 3.7.1.2.1. 2.4.5.4.4 Except for applicable TennCare cost shari ng, the CONTRACTOR shall ensure that members are held harmless for the cost of covered services provided as of the effective date of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.6 Eligibility and Enrollment Data 2.4.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall receive, process, and update enrollment files from TENNCARE. Enrollment data shall be upda ted or uploaded to the CONTRACTOR's eligibility/enrollment database(s) within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt from TENNCARE. 23 of 327 2.4.6.2 The CONTRACTOR shall provide an electronic eligibility file to TENNCARE as specified and in conformance to data exch ange format and method standards outlined in Section 2.23.5. 2.4.7 Enrollment Period 2.4.7.1 General 2.4.7.1.1 The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the provision and costs of all covered services provided to enrollees during their period of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.7.1.2 Enrollment shall begin at 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO and shall end at 12:00 midnight on the date that the enrollee is disenrolled from the CONTRACTOR's MCO (see Section 2.5). 2.4.7.1.3 Once enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO, the member shall remain enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO until or unless the enrollee is disenrolled pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement. 2.4.7.2 Changing MCOs 2.4.7.2.1 45-Day Change Period After becoming eligible for TennCare and enrolling in the CONTRACTOR's MCO (whether the result of selection by the enrollee or assignment by TENNCARE), enrollees shall have one (1) opportunity, anytime during the forty-five (45) day period immediately following the date of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR's MCO or the date TENNCARE sends the member notice of enrollment in an MCO, whichever is later, to request to change MCOs. Children eligible for TennCare as a result or being eligible for SSI may request to enroll in another MCO or re-enroll with TennCare Select. 2.4.7.2.2 Annual Choice Period 2.4.7.2.2.1 TENNCARE shall provide an opportuni ty for members to change MCOs (excluding TennCare Select) every twelve (12) months. Children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI may request to enroll in another MCO or re-enroll with TennCare Select. 2.4.7.2.2.2 Members who do not select another MCO will be deemed to have chosen to remain with their current MCO. 2.4.7.2.2.3 Enrollees who select a new MCO shall have one (1) opportunity anytime during the forty-five (45) day period immediat ely following the sp ecified enrollment effective date in the newly selected MCO to request to change MCOs. 2.4.7.2.3 Appeal Based on Hardship Criteria As provided in TennCare rules and regulations, members may appeal to TENNCARE to change MCOs ba sed on hardship criteria. 24 of 327 2.4.7.2.4 Additional Reasons for Disenrollment As provided in Section 2.5.2, a member may be disenrolled from the CONTRACTOR's MCO for the reasons specified therein. 2.4.7.3 Member Moving out of Grand Region The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the provision and cost of all covered services for any member moving outside the CONTRACTOR's Grand Region until the member is disenrolled by TENNCARE. TENNCARE shall continue to make payments to the CONTRACTOR on behalf of the enrollee until such time as the enrollee is enrolled in another MCO or ot herwise disenrolled by TENNCARE (e.g., enrollee is terminated from the TennCar e program). TENNCARE shall notify the CONTRACTOR promptly upon enrollment of the enrollee in another MCO. 2.4.8 Transfers from Other MCOs 2.4.8.1 The CONTRACTOR shall accept enrollees (enrolled or pending enrollment) from any MCO in the CONTRACTOR's service area as authorized by TENNCARE. The transfer of membership may occur at an y time during the year. No enrollee from another MCO shall be transferred retroactively to the CONTRACTOR except as specified in Section 2.4.9. Except as provided in Section 2.4.9, the CONTRACTOR shall not be responsible for payment of any covered services incurred by enrollees transferred to the CONTRACTOR prior to the effective date of transfer to the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.8.2 Transfers from other MCOs shall be in consideration of the maximum enrollment levels established in Section 2.4.3. 2.4.8.3 To the extent possible and practical, TENNC ARE shall provide advance notice to all MCOs serving a Grand Region of the impendi ng failure of one of the MCOs serving the Grand Region; however, failure by TE NNCARE to provide advance notice shall not limit in any manner the responsibility of each MCO to accept enrollees from failed MCOs. 2.4.9 Enrollment of Newborns 2.4.9.1 TennCare-eligible newborns and their mothers, to the extent that the mother is eligible for TennCare, should be enrolle d in the same MCO with the exception of newborns that are SSI eligible at birth. Newborns that are SSI eligible at birth shall be assigned to TennCare Select but may opt out and enroll in another MCO. 2.4.9.2 A newborn may be inadvertently enrolled in an MCO different than its mother. When such cases are identified by the C ONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately report to TENNCARE, in accordance with written procedures provided by TENNCARE, that a newborn has been in correctly enrolled in an MCO different than its mother. 25 of 327 2.4.9.3 Upon receipt of notice from the CONTRACTOR or discovery by TENNCARE that a newborn has been incorrectly enrolled in an MCO different than its mother, TENNCARE shall immediately: 2.4.9.3.1 Disenroll the newborn from the incorrect MCO; 2.4.9.3.2 Enroll the newborn in the same MCO as its mother with the same effective date as when the newborn was enrolled in the incorrect MCO; 2.4.9.3.3 Recoup any payments made to the incorrect MCO for the newborn; and 2.4.9.3.4 Make payments only to the correct MCO for the period of coverage. 2.4.9.4 The MCO in which the newborn is correctly enrolled shall be responsible for the coverage and payment of covered services provided to the newborn for the full period of eligibility. Except as provided below, the MCO in which the newborn was incorrectly enrolled shall have no liabilit y for the coverage or payment of any services during the period of incorrect MCO assignment. TENNCARE shall only be liable for the capitation payment to the correct MCO. 2.4.9.5 There are circumstances in which a new born's mother may not be eligible for participation in the TennCare program. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to process claims received for services provided to newborns within the time frames specified in Section 2.22.4 of this Ag reement. A CONTRACTOR shall not utilize any blanket policy which results in the au tomatic denial of claims for services provided to a TennCare-eligible newborn, during any period of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO, because the newborn's mother is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO. However, it is re cognized that in complying with the claims processing time frames specified in 2.22.4 of this Agreement, a CONTRACTOR may make payment for services provided to a TennCare-eligible newborn enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO at the time of payment but the newborn's eligibility may subsequently be m oved to another MCO. In such event, the MCO in which the newborn is first en rolled (first MCO) may submit supporting documentation to the MCO in which the newborn is moved (second MCO) and the second MCO shall reimburse the first MCO within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of such properly documented request for reimbursement, for the amount expended on behalf of the newborn prior to the newborn's eligibility having been moved to the second MCO. Such reimbursem ent shall be the actual amount expended by the first MCO. The second MCO agr ees that should the second MCO fail to reimburse the first MCO the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn within thirty (30) calendar days of recei pt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE is authorized to de duct the amount owed from any funds due the second MCO and to reimburse the first MCO. Should it become necessary for TENNCARE to intervene in such cases, both the second MCO and the first MCO agree that TENNCARE shall be held harm less by both MCOs for actions taken by TENNCARE to resolve the dispute. 26 of 327 2.4.10 Information Requirements Upon Enrollment As described in Section 2.17 of this Agreemen t, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the following information to new members: a member handbook, a provider directory and an identification card. 2.5 DISENROLLMENT FROM AN MCO 2.5.1 General A member may be disenrolled from the CONT RACTOR's MCO only when authorized by TENNCARE. 2.5.2 Acceptable Reasons for Disenrollment from an MCO A member may request disenrollment or be disenrolled from the CONTRACTOR's MCO if: 2.5.2.1 The member selects another MCO during the forty-five (45) day change period after enrollment with the CONTRACTOR's MC O and is enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.2 The member selects another MCO during the annual choice period and is enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.3 An appeal by the member to change MCOs based on hardship criteria (pursuant to TennCare rules and regulations) is decide d by TENNCARE in favor of the member, and the member is enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.4 The member is assigned incorrectly to the CONTRACTOR's MCO by TENNCARE and enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.5 The member moves outside the MCO's service area and is enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.6 During the appeal process, if TENNCARE determ ines it is in the best interest of the enrollee and TENNCARE (see Section 2.19.2.9); 2.5.2.7 The member loses eligibility for TennCare; 2.5.2.8 TENNCARE grants members the right to terminate enrollment pursuant to Section 4.20.1, and the member is enrolled in another MCO; 2.5.2.9 The CONTRACTOR no longer participates in TennCare; or 2.5.2.10 This Agreement expires or is terminated. 2.5.3 Unacceptable Reasons for Disenrollment from an MCO The CONTRACTOR shall not request disenrollmen t of an enrollee for any reason.

The CONTRACTOR shall not waive or use any alternative cost sharing schedules, unless required by TENNCARE. 2.6.7.4 Provider Requirements 2.6.7.4.1 Providers or collection agencies acting on the provider's behalf may not bill enrollees for amounts other than applicable TennCar e cost sharing responsibilities for covered services, including but not limited to, services that the State or the CONTRACTOR has not paid for, except as permitted by TennCare rules and regulations and as described below. Providers may seek paym ent from an enrollee only in the following situations. 2.6.7.4.1.1 If the services are not covered services and, prior to providing the services, the provider informed the enrollee that the services were not covered. The provider must inform the enrollee of the non- covered service and have the enrollee acknowledge the information. If the en rollee still requests the service, the provider shall obtain such acknowledgmen t in writing prior to rendering the service. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, on ce the provider bills an MCO for the service that has been provided, the prio r arrangement with the enrollee becomes null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. 2.6.7.4.1.2 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pe nding at the time services are provided and if the provider informs the person they will not accept TennCare assignment whether or not eligibility is establish ed retroactively. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, once the provider bills an MCO for the service the prior arrangement with the enrollee becomes null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. 2.6.7.4.1.3 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pe nding at the time services are provided, however, all monies collected, except applicable TennCare cost sharing amounts must be refunded when a claim is su bmitted to an MCO because the provider agreed to accept TennCare assignment on ce retroactive TennCare eligibility was established. (The monies collected sha ll be refunded as soon as a claim is submitted and shall not be held conditi onally upon payment of the claim). 2.6.7.4.1.4 If the services are not covered because th ey are in excess of an enrollee's hard benefit limit, and the provider complies with applicable TennCare rules and regulations. 2.6.7.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall require, as a conditi on of payment, that the provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payer) plus any applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for 37 of 327 the service. Except in the circumstances described above, if the CONTRACTOR is aware that a provider, or a collection agency acting on the provider's behalf, bills an enrollee for amounts other than the applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee, the CONTRACTOR shall notify the provider and demand that the provider and/or collection agency cease such action against the enrollee immediately. If a provider continues to bill an enrollee after notification by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall refer the provider to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. 2.7 SPECIALIZED SERVICES 2.7.1 Emergency Services 2.7.1.1 Emergency services (as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. 2.7.1.2 The CONTRACTOR shall review and approve or disapprove claims for emergency services based on the definition of emergenc y medical condition specified in Section 1 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall base coverage decisions for emergency services on the severity of the symptoms at the time of presentation and shall cover emergency services where the presenting symptoms are of sufficient severity to constitute an emergency medical condition in the judgment of a prudent layperson. The CONTRACTOR shall not impose restrictions on coverage of emergency services more restrictive than those permitted by the prudent layperson standard. 2.7.1.3 The CONTRACTOR shall provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient emergency services, furnished by a qualified provider, re gardless of whether the member obtains the services from a contract provider, that are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition that is f ound to exist using the prudent layperson standard. These services shall be provided without prior authorization in accordance with 42 CFR 438.114. The CONTRACTOR shall pay for any emergency screening examination services conducted to dete rmine whether an emergency medical condition exists and for all emergency ser vices that are medically necessary until the member is stabilized. 2.7.1.4 If an emergency screening examination leads to a clinical determination by the examining provider that an actual em ergency medical condition exists, the CONTRACTOR shall pay for both th e services involved in the screening examination and the services required to stabilize the member. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to pay for all emergency services which are medically necessary until the clinical emergency is stabilized. This includes all medical and behavioral health services that may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the member's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, discharge of the memb er or transfer of the member to another facility. If there is a disagreement be tween the hospital and the CONTRACTOR concerning whether the member is stable e nough for discharge or transfer, or whether the medical benefits of an un-stabilized transfer outweigh the risks, the judgment of the attending provider(s) actually caring for the member at the treating facility prevails and is binding on the CONTRA CTOR. The CONTRACTOR, however, may establish arrangements with a hospital whereby the CONTRACTOR may send one of 38 of 327 its own providers with appropriate emergency room privileges to assume the attending provider's responsibilities to stabilize, treat, and transfer the member, provided that such arrangement does not delay the provision of emergency services. 2.7.1.5 The CONTRACTOR shall not retroactively deny a claim for an emergency screening examination because the condition, which a ppeared to be an emergency medical condition under the prudent la yperson standard, turned out to be non-emergency in nature. If an emergency screening examinati on leads to a clinical determination by the examining provider that an actual em ergency medical condition does not exist, then the determining factor for payment liability shall be whether the member had acute symptoms of sufficient severity at th e time of presentation. In such cases, the CONTRACTOR shall review the presenting symptoms of the member and shall pay for all services involved in the screening ex amination where the presenting symptoms (including severe pain) were of sufficien t severity to have warranted emergency attention under the prudent layperson st andard regardless of final diagnosis. 2.7.1.6 When the member's PCP or the CONTRA CTOR instructs the member to seek emergency services, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for payment for the medical screening examination and for other medically necessary emergency services, without regard to whether the member's condition meets the prudent layperson standard. 2.7.1.7 Once the member's condition is stabilized , the CONTRACTOR may require prior authorization for hospital admission or follow-up care. 2.7.2 Behavioral Health Services 2.7.2.1 General Provisions 2.7.2.1.1 The CONTRACTOR shall provide all behavioral health services as described in this Section, Section 2.6.1 and Attachment I. 2.7.2.1.2 The CONTRACTOR shall provide behavioral health services in ac cordance with best practice guidelines, rules and regulations, a nd policies and procedures set forth by the State. 2.7.2.1.3 The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that all members receiving behavioral health services from providers whose primary focus is to render behavioral health services have individualized treatment plans.

Children between the ages of thirty-six (36) months and seventy-two (72) months of age must receive a screening blood lead test if they have not been previo usly screened for lead poisoning. A blood lead test must be used when screening Medicaid-eligible children. A blood lead test equal to or greater than ten (10) ug/dL obtained by capillary specimen (finger stick) must be confirmed by us ing a venous blood sample; and 49 of 327 2.7.5.3.3.6 Health education which includes anticip atory guidance based on the findings of all screening. Health education should include counseling to both members and members' parents or to the legally appointed representative to assist in understanding what to expect in terms of the child's development and to provide information about the benefits of h ealthy lifestyles and practices as well as accident and disease prevention. 2.7.5.3.4 The CONTRACTOR shall encourage providers to refer children to dentists for periodic dental screens beginning no later than three (3) years of age and earlier as needed (as early as six (6) to twelve (12) months in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) guidelines) and as otherwise appropriate. 2.7.5.3.5 The CONTRACTOR shall establish a procedure for PCPs or other providers completing TENNderCare screenings to refer TENNderCare eligible members requiring behavioral health ser vices to appropriate providers. 2.7.5.4 Services 2.7.5.4.1 Should screenings indicate a need, the CONTRACTOR must provide all necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in 42 USC 1396d(a) (Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act) to correct or ameliorate or prevent from worsening defects and phys ical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the Medicaid State plan (see Section 2.7.5.4.8).

This requirement shall not preclude the CONTRACTOR from requiring notification for a referral for an assessment. Furthermore, the CONTRACTOR shall establish a procedure fo r PCPs, or other providers, completing TENNderCare screenings, to refer members under the age of twenty-one (21) for a mental health or substance abuse assessment. 2.7.5.4.5 For services not covered by Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, but found to be needed as a result of conditions di sclosed during screening and diagnosis, the CONTRACTOR shall provide referral assistance as required by 42 CFR 441.61, including referral to providers and State health agencies. 50 of 327 2.7.5.4.6 Transportation Services 2.7.5.4.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall provide transpor tation assistance for a child.

The CONTRACTOR is not responsible for either the risk as sessments or the lead inspection at the secondary site. However, the CONTRACTOR shall contact th e DOH when these services are indicated as this agency is responsible for these services. 2.7.5.4.7.5 CONTRACTOR reimbursement for the prim ary environmental investigations is limited to the items specified in Part 5 of the State Medicaid Manual.

Capitation rates shall be paid according to the methodology as described in this Agreement. 3.1.2 The CONTRACTOR agrees that capitation payments, any payments related to processing claims for services incurred prior to the start date of operations pursuant to Section 3.7.1.2.1 and any incentive payments (if applicable) are payment in full for all services provided pursuant to this Agreement. TENNCARE shall not share with th e CONTRACTOR any financial losses realized under this Agreement. 3.2 ANNUAL ACTUARIAL STUDY In accordance with TCA 9-9-101, the State shall retain a qualified actuary to conduct an annual actuarial study of the TennCare program. The CONTRACTOR shall provide any information requested and cooperate in any manner necessary as requested by TENNCARE in order to assist the State's actuary with completion of the annual actuarial study. 3.3 CAPITATION PAYMENT RATES 3.3.1 The CONTRACTOR will be paid a base capitation rate for each enrollee based on the enrollee's category of aid and age/sex combination and the Grand Region served by the CONTRACTOR under this Agreement in accordance with th e rates specified in Attachment X. 3.3.2 The major aid categories are as follows: 3.3.2.1 Medicaid; 3.3.2.2 Uninsured/Uninsurable; 3.3.2.3 Disabled - The disabled rate is only for t hose enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid as a result of a disability; 3.3.2.4 Medicaid/Medicare Duals - For the purpose of capitation rates, Medicaid/Medicare dual enrollees are TennCare Medicaid enrollees who have Medicare eligibility; and 3.3.2.5 Waiver/Medicare Duals - For the purpose of capitation rates, Waiver/Medicare dual enrollees are TennCare Standard enrollees who have Medicare eligibility. 3.3.3 The CONTRACTOR will also be paid a priority add-on rate for behavioral health services in accordance with the rates speci fied in Attachment X for each priority enrollee. The CONTRACTOR will be paid the priority add-on ra te for priority enrollees, as defined in this Agreement, who have received behavioral health services as reported pursuant to Section 2.23.4 of this Agreement, within the preceding twelve (12) months from the date of the calculation of the monthly payment, and who have had a va lid CRG/TPG assessment within the preceding twelve (12) months from the date of the calculation of the monthly payment. 193 of 327 3.3.4 The CONTRACTOR will be paid the rates speci fied in Attachment X for State Onlys and Judicials. The capitation rate for State Onlys and Judicials shall be for behavioral health services only. 3.3.5 TENNCARE will determine the appropriate rate category to which each enrollee is assigned for payment purposes under this Agreement. 3.3.6 TENNCARE's assignment of an enrollee to a rate category is for payment purposes under this Agreement, only, and is not an \"adverse action\" or determination of the benefits to which an enrollee is entitled under the TennCare program , TennCare rules and regulations, TennCare policies and procedures, the TennCare waiver or relevant court orders or consent decrees. 3.4 CAPITATION RATE ADJUSTMENT 3.4.1 The CONTRACTOR and TENNCARE agree that the capitation rates described in Section 3 of this Agreement may be adjusted periodically. 3.4.2 The CONTRACTOR and TENNCARE further agree th at adjustments to capitation rates shall occur only by written amendment to this Agreement. 3.4.3 The following shall be applicable to adjusting the base capitation rate only: 3.4.3.1 The CONTRACTOR agrees to accept the base ca pitation rates originally proposed by the CONTRACTOR adjusted by the State for health plan risk in accordance with the following: 3.4.3.2 Health plan risk assessment scores will be initially recalibrated after current TennCare enrollees are assigned to the MCOs for retroactive application to payment rates effective on the start date of operations. 3.4.3.2.1 This initial recalibration will be based upon the distribution of enrollment on the start date of operations and health status information will be derived from encounter data submitted to TENNCARE by MCOs serving the Grand Region through the most recent twelve (12) month period deemed appropriate by the State's actuary. 3.4.3.2.2 If the health plan risk assessment score fo r any MCO deviates from the profile for the Grand Region being served by the MCO by more than three percent (3%), whether a negative or positive change in scores, the base capitation ra tes proposed by all MCOs will be proportionally adjusted. 3.4.3.3 Thereafter, health plan risk assessment scores will be recalibrated annually based upon health status information deri ved from encounter data submitted to TENNCARE by MCOs serving the Grand Region through the most recent twelve (12) month period deemed appropriate by the State's actuary. If the health plan risk assessment score for any MCO deviates from the profile for the region being served by the MCO by more than three percent (3 %), whether a negative or positive change in scores, the base capitation rates origina lly proposed by all MCOs as subsequently adjusted will be proportionally adjusted. 194 of 327 3.4.3.4 TENNCARE will recalibrate health plan ri sk assessment scores on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring shifts in en rollment. If warranted prior to the next scheduled annual recalibration as demonstrated by a significant change in health plan risk assessment scores, defined as a change of three percent (3%) or more, whether a negative or positive change in scores, TENNCARE may adjust the base capitation rates originally proposed by all MCOs as subsequently adjusted for all MCOs. 3.4.3.5 In addition to the annual recalibration of risk adjustment factors, those factors will be updated when there is a significant change in program participation. This may occur when an MCO enters or leaves a Grand Region. If an MCO withdraws from a Grand Region, that MCO's membership may be temporarily distributed to TennCare Select or distributed to the remaining MCOs or to new MCOs. New risk adjustment values for the remaining MCOs or new MCO(s) will be calculated that consider the population that will be enrolled in the MCO for the remainder of the contract year only. In this instance, MCOs would be given the option to provide TENNCARE, in writing, with a six (6) months notice of termination in accordance with Section 4.4.6.2. This notice option is not availa ble for rate adjustments as described in Sections 3.4.3.1 through 3.4.3.4. 3.4.3.6 An individual's health status will be determined using the John Hopkins ACG\u00ae Case-Mix System (ACG System). In the ev ent the State elects to use a different system to calculate an adjustment for MCO h ealth status risk, the State will notify the CONTRACTOR prior to its implementation. 3.4.4 Beginning with capitation payment rates effective Ju ly 1, 2008, in additio n to other adjustments specified in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, th e base capitation rates originally proposed by the CONTRACTOR as subsequently adjusted and th e priority add-on rates and State Only and Judicials rates originally specified by the Stat e shall be adjusted annually for inflation in accordance with the recommendation of the State's actuary. 3.4.5 If (i) changes are required pursuant to federal or st ate statute, federal regulations, the action of a federal agency, a state or federal court, or ru les and regulations of a State of Tennessee agency other than the TennCare Bureau and (ii) the cha nges are likely to impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s) described in Section 3, as determined by TENNCARE, TENNCARE shall have its independent actuary review the re quired change and determine whether the change would impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s). If TENNCARE's independent actuary determines that the change would impact the actuarial soundness of one or more of the capitation rates, the actuary shall determine the a ppropriate adjustment to the impacted capitation rate(s). 3.4.6 In the event TENNCARE amends TennCare rules or regulations or initiates a policy change not addressed in Section 3.4.5 above that is likely to impact the capitation rate(s ) described in Section 3, as determined by TENNCARE, TENNCARE sha ll have its independent actuary review the proposed change and determine whether the change would impact the actuarial soundness of the capitation rate(s). If TENNCARE's independent actua ry determines that the change would impact the actuarial soundness of one or more of the ca pitation rates, the actuary shall determine the appropriate adjustment to the impacted capitation rate(s). 195 of 327 3.4.7 In the event TENNCARE requires that the CONT RACTOR contract with the transportation vendor selected by the State, TENNCARE shall ha ve its independent actuary determine whether the change would impact the actuarial s oundness of the capitation rate(s). If TENNCARE's independent actuary determines that the change would impact the actuarial soundness of one or more of the capitation rates, the actuary shall determine the appropriate adjustment to the impacted capitation rate(s). 3.4.8 In the event the amount of the two percent (2%) pr emium tax is increased during the term of this Agreement, the payments shall be increased by an amount equal to the increase in premium payable by the CONTRACTOR. 3.4.9 Any rate adjustments shall be subject to the availability of state appropriations. 3.5 CAPITATION PAYMENT SCHEDULE TENNCARE shall make payment by the fifth (5th) business day of each month to the CONTRACTOR for the CONTRACTOR's satisfactory performance of its duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement. 3.6 CAPITATION PAYMENT CALCULATION When eligibility has been estab lished by the State for enrollees, the amount owed to the CONTRACTOR shall be calculated as described herein and the amount due the CONTRACTOR shall be included in the current month payment of the capitation rate. 3.6.1 Each month payment to the CONTRACTOR shall be equal to the number of enrollees enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO five (5) business days prior to the date of the capitation payment multiplied by the appropriate capitation rate(s) for the enrollee. 3.6.2 The capitation rates stated in Attachment X will be the amounts used to determine the amount of the monthly capitation payment. 3.6.3 The actual amount owed the CONTRACTOR for each member shall be determined by dividing the appropriate monthly capitation rate(s) by the number of days in the month and then multiplying the quotient of this transaction by th e actual number of days the member was enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.6.4 The amount paid to the CONTRACTOR shall equal the total of the amount owed for all enrollees determined pursuant to Section 3.6.3 less th e withhold amount (see Section 3.9), capitation payment adjustments made pursuant to Section 3. 7 or 3.10, and any other adjustments, which may include withholds for penalties, damages, liquidated damages, or adjustments based upon a change of enrollee status. 3.7 CAPITATION PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS 3.7.1 The State has the discretion to retroactively ad just the capitation payment for any enrollee if TENNCARE determines an incorrect payment was made to the CONTRACTOR; provided, however: 3.7.1.1 For determining the capitation rate(s) only, the Grand Region being served by the enrollee's MCO under this Agreement will be used to determine payment. The 196 of 327 capitation payment shall not be retroactivel y adjusted to reflect a different Grand Region of residence so long as the enro llee's MCO assignment is effective. 3.7.1.2 For individuals enrolled with a retroactive effective date on the date of enrollment, the payment rate for retroactive periods shall be the capitation rate(s) for the applicable rate category and the Grand Region in which the enrollee's assigned MCO is operating under this Agreement as spec ified in Attachment X, except that: 3.7.1.2.1 The CONTRACTOR agrees to manually process claims and reimburse providers for services incurred prior to the start date of operations of this Agreement; however, the CONTRACTOR will not be at risk for these services. The CONTRACTOR shall be paid two dollars ($2.00) per claim as reimbursement for processing claims for services incurred prior to the start date of operations. Actual expenditures for covered services and the allowed amount for claims processing are subject to TCA 56-32-224. The CONTRACTOR shall negotiate provide r reimbursement subject to TENNCARE prior approval and prepare checks for payment of providers for the provision of covered services incurred during an enrollee's period of eligibility prior to the start date of operations on an as needed b asis. The CONTRACTOR shall notify the State of the amount to be paid in a mutually acceptable form and format at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of distribution of any provider payment related to this requirement. TENNCARE shall remit paymen t to the CONTRACTOR in an amount equal to: the amount to be paid to provid ers; plus, two dollars ($2.00) per claim processed by the CONTRACTOR; plus, an am ount sufficient to cover any payment due in accordance with TCA 56-32-224 within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of notice. The CONTRACTOR shall then releas e payments to providers within twenty- four (24) hours of the receipt of funds from the State. The CONTRACTOR is responsible for any payments requi red pursuant to TCA 56-32-224. 3.7.1.3 If a provider seeks reimbursement for a service provided during a retroactive period of eligibility, the CONTRACTOR sha ll assess cost sharing responsibilities in accordance with the cost sharing schedules in effect on the date of service for which reimbursement is sought (see Attachment II). 3.7.1.4 Should TENNCARE determine after the capitation payment is made that an enrollee's capitation rate category had changed or the enrollee was deceased, TENNCARE shall retroactively adjust the payment to the CONTRACTOR to accurately reflect the enrollee's capitation rate category for the period for which payment has been made. TENNCARE shall in itially retroactively adjust the payment to the CONTRACTOR, not to exceed twelve (12) months. Subsequently, TENNCARE shall further retroactively adju st the payment to the CONTRACTOR to accurately reflect the enrollee's capitation ra te category for the period prior to the twelve (12) month adjustment initially made by TENNCARE. TENNCARE will make the subsequent adjustment at least semi-annually. 3.7.1.4.1 TENNCARE and the CONTRACTOR agree that the twelve (12) month limitation described in Sections 3.7.1.4 is applicable only to retroactive capitation rate payment adjustments described in those paragraphs and shall in no way be construed as limiting the effective date of eligibility or enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.7.1.5 Payment adjustments resulting in a reducti on or increase of the capitation rate shall be accomplished through the monthly capitation reconciliation process. 197 of 327 3.8 SERVICE DATES Except where required by this Agreement or by applicable federal or state law, the CONTRACTOR shall not make payment for the cost of any services provided prior to the effective date of eligibility in the CONTRA CTOR's MCO. The CONTRACTOR shall make payment for the cost of any covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of eligibility in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 3.9 WITHHOLD OF THE CAPITATION RATE 3.9.1 A withhold of the aggregate capitation paymen t shall be applied to ensure CONTRACTOR compliance with the requirements of this Agr eement and to provide an agreed incentive for assuring CONTRACTOR compliance with the requirements of this Agreement. 3.9.2 The amount due for the first monthly payment, and for each month thereafter, calculated pursuant to Section 3.6 shall be reduced by the appropria te cash flow withhold percentage amount and set aside for distribution to the CONTRACTOR in th e next regular monthly payment, unless retained as provided below. 3.9.2.1 Except as further provided below, the app licable capitation payment withhold amount will be equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the monthly capitation payment for the first six months following the start date of operations, and for any consecutive six (6) month period following the CONTRACTOR's receipt of a notice of deficiency as described in Section 2.25.9; 3.9.2.2 If, during any consecutive six (6) month period following the start date of operations, TENNCARE determines that the CONTRACTOR has no deficiencies and has not issued a notice of deficiency, the monthly withhold amount will be reduced to five percent (5%) of the monthly capitation payment. 3.9.2.3 If, during any consecutive six (6) month pe riod following a reduction of the monthly withhold amount to five percent (5%) of the monthly capitation payment, TENNCARE determines that the CONTRACTOR has no deficiencies and has not issued a notice of deficiency, the monthly withhold amount will be reduced to two and one half percent (2.5%) of the monthly capitation payment. 3.9.2.4 If the CONTRACTOR is notified by TENNCARE of a minor deficiency and the CONTRACTOR cures the minor deficiency to the satisfaction of TENNCARE within a reasonable time prior to the ne xt regularly scheduled capitation payment cycle, TENNCARE may disregard the minor deficiency for purposes of determining the withhold. 3.9.2.5 If TENNCARE has determined the CONTRA CTOR is not in compliance with a requirement of this Agreement in any given month, TENNCARE will issue a written notice of deficiency and TENNCARE will retain the amount withheld for the month prior to TENNCARE identifying the compliance deficiencies. 3.9.2.6 The withhold amounts for subsequent months thereafter in which the CONTRACTOR has not cured the deficienci es shall be in accordance with Section 3.9.2.1 as described above. If the CONTRACT OR has attained a two and one half 198 of 327 percent (2.5%) withhold and TENNC ARE subsequently determines the CONTRACTOR is not in compliance with a requirement of this Agreement, TENNCARE will provide written notice of such determination and TENNCARE will re-institute the retention of the withhold as described in Section 3.9.2.1 at the next capitation payment cycle. Monthly retention of the withhold amount will continue for each subsequent month so long as the identified deficiencies have not been corrected. These funds will not be distributed to the CONTRACTOR unless it is determined by TENNCARE the CONTRACTOR has come in to compliance with the Agreement requirement(s) within six (6) months of TENNCARE identifying these deficiencies. For example, if a specified deficiency(s) is corrected within four (4) months and there are no other identified deficiencies which the CONTRACTOR has been given written notice of by TENNCARE, the withhold for the four (4) consecutive months will be paid to the CONTRACTOR upon TENNCARE determination that the deficiency(s) was corrected. However, any amounts withheld by TENNCARE for six (6) consecutive months for the same or similar compliance deficiency(s) shall be retained by TENNCARE on the anniversary of the sixth consecutive month and shall not be paid to the CONTRACTOR. If the same or si milar specified deficiency(s) continues beyond six (6) consecutive months, TENNCARE may declare the MCO ineligible for future distribution of the ten percent (10% ) incentive withhold. Such ineligibility will continue for each month TENNCARE determ ines the same or similar specified deficiency(s) continues to exist. Once a CONTRACTOR corrects the deficiency(s), TENNCARE may reinstate the MCO's eligibilit y for distribution of the ten percent (10%) compliance incentive payment of futu re withholds. If TENNCARE determines that distribution of the ten percent (10%) withhold is appropriate, distribution of the ten percent (10%) shall be made at the time of the next scheduled monthly check write which includes all other payments due the CONTRACTOR. 3.9.3 No interest shall be due to the CONTRACTOR on any sums withheld or retained under this Section. The provisions of this Section may be invoked alone or in conjunction with any other remedy or adjustment otherwise allowed under this Agreement. 3.9.4 If TENNCARE has not identified CONTRACTOR deficiencies, TENNCARE will pay to the CONTRACTOR the withhold of the CONTRACTOR's payments withheld in the month subsequent to the withhold. 3.10 EFFECT OF DISENROLLMENT ON CAPITATION PAYMENTS Payment of capitation payments shall cease effect ive the date of the member's disenrollment from the CONTRACTOR's MCO, and the CONTRACTOR shall have no further responsibility for the care of the enrollee. Except for situations involving enrollment obtained by fraudulent applications or death, disenrollment from Te nnCare shall not be made retroactively. 3.10.1 Fraudulent Enrollment 3.10.1.1 In the case of fraudulent, mi srepresented or deceptive a pplications submitted by the enrollee, the CONTRACTOR, at its discretion, may refund to TENNCARE all capitation payments made on behalf of pe rsons who obtained enrollment in TennCare through such means and the CONTRACTOR may pursue full restitution for all payments made on behalf of the indivi dual while the person was inappropriately enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO. 199 of 327 3.10.1.2 In the event of enrollment obtained by fra ud, misrepresentation or deception by the CONTRACTOR's staff, officers, employees, providers, volunteers, subcontractors, or anyone acting for or on behalf of the CONTRACTOR, TENNCARE may retroactively recover capitation amounts plus interest, as allowed by TCA 47-14-103, and any other monies paid to the CONT RACTOR for the enrollment of that individual.

The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that the following requirements are met: 1) All mental health case managers shall have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree; 2) Supervisors shall maintain no greater than a 1:30 supervisory ratio with mental health case managers; 3) Mental health case managers who are assigned to both a parent(s) and child in the same family, should have skills and experience needed for both ages; 4) Eighty percent (80%) of all mental health case management services should take place outside the case manager's office; 5) The children and youth (C&Y) (under age eighteen (18)) mental health case management model shall provide a transition from C&Y services into adult services, including adult mental health case management services.

The CONTRACTOR shall ensure the provision of level 1 mental health case mana gement to the most severely disabled adults and emotionally disturbed children and youth, includi ng individuals who are at high risk of future hospitalization or placement out of the home a nd require both community support and treatment interventions. Level 1 mental health case management can be rendered through a team approach or by individual mental health case managers. Team approa ches may include such models as ACT, CTT, CCFT and PACT, as described below: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) ACT is a way of delivering comprehensive and effectiv e services to adults diagnosed with severe mental illness and who have needs that have not been well met by traditional approaches to delivering services. The principles of ACT include: 1) Services targeted to a specific group of individuals with severe mental illness; 2) Treatment, support and rehabilitation servi ces provided directly by the ACT team; 3) Sharing of responsibility between team me mbers and individuals served by the team; 4) Small staff (all team staff including case mana gers) to individual ratios (approx. 1 to 10); 5) Comprehensive and flexible range of treatment and services; 6) Interventions occurring in community settings ra ther than in hospitals or clinic settings; 7) No arbitrary time limit on receiving services; 8) Individualized treatment, support and rehabilitation services; 232 of 327 9) Twenty-four (24) hour a da y availability of services; and 10) Engagement of individuals in treatment and monitoring. Continuous Treatment Team (CTT) CTT is a coordinated team of staff (to include phys icians, nurses, case managers, and other therapists as needed) who provide a range of intensive, integr ated mental health case management, treatment, and rehabilitation services to adults and children and youth. The intent is to provide intensive treatment to families of children and youth with acute psychiatric problems in an effort to prevent removal from the home to a more restrictive level of care. An array of services are delivered in the home or in natural settings in the community, and are provided through a strong partnership with the family and other community support systems. The program provides services including crisis intervention and stabilization, counseling, skills building, therap eutic intervention, advocacy, educational services, medication management as indicated, school based c ounseling and consultation w ith teachers, and other specialized services deemed necessary and appropriate. Comprehensive Child and Fam ily Treatment (CCFT) CCFT services are high intensity, time-limited ser vices designed for children and youth to provide stabilization and deter the \"imminent\" risk of State custody for the individual. There is usually family instability and high-risk behaviors exhibited by th e child/adolescent. CCFT serv ices are concentrated on child, family, and parental/guardian behaviors and interaction. CCFT servi ces are more treatment oriented and situation specific with a focus on short-term stab ilization goals. The primary goal of CCFT is to reach an appropriate point of stabilization so the individu al can be transitioned to a less intense outpatient service. Program of Assertive and Community Treatment (PACT) PACT is a service delivery model for providing compre hensive community-based treatment to adults with severe and persistent mental illness. It involves the use of a multi-disciplinary team of mental health staff organized as an accountable, mobile mental health ag ency or group of providers who function as a team interchangeably to provide the treatment, rehabilitati on and support services pers ons with severe and/or persistent mental illnesses need to live successfully in the community. Level 2 Level 2 mental health case manageme nt is a less intensive level of servi ce than Level 1 and is focused on resilience and recovery. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that level 2 mental health case management is provided to individuals whose symptoms are at least partially stabilized or reduced in order to allow treatment and rehabilitation efforts. 233 of 327 SERVICE COMPONENTS The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that mental hea lth case management incorporates the following service components: Crisis Facilitation Crisis facilitation is provided in situations re quiring immediate attention/resolution for a specific individual or other person(s) in relation to a spec ific individual.

Most cris is facilitation activities w ould involve face-to-face contact with the individual. Assessment of Daily Functioning Assessment of daily functioning involves the on-going monitoring of how an individual is coping with life on a day to day basis for the purposes of dete rmining necessary services to maintain community placement and improve level of functioning. Most assessments of daily functioning are achieved by face- to-face contact with the individual in his or her natural environment. Assessment/Referral/Coordination Assessment/referral/coordination involves assessing th e needs of the individual for the purposes of referral and coordination of services that will impr ove functioning and/or ma intain stability in the individual's natural environment. Mental Health Liaison Mental health liaison services are offered to persons who are not yet assigned to mental health case management. It is a short-term service for the pur poses of service referral and continuing care until other mental health services are initiated. 234 of 327 SERVICE Psychiatric Reh abilitation DEFINITION Psychiatric rehabilitation is an array of consumer -centered recovery services designed to support the individual in the attainment or maintenance of his or her optimal level of functioning. These services are designed to capitalize on personal strengths, develop copi ng skills and strategies to deal with deficits and develop a supportive environment in which to func tion as independent as possible on the individual's recovery journey. Services included under psychiatric rehabilitation are as follows. SERVICE COMPONENTS Psychosocial Rehabilitation Psychosocial rehabilitation services utilize a comprehensiv e approach (mind, body, and spirit) to work with the whole person for the purposes of improving an individuals' functioning , promoting management of illness(s), and facilitating recovery. The goal of psyc hosocial rehabilitation is to support individuals as active and productive members of their communities. Indivi duals, in partnership with staff, form goals for skills development in the areas of vocational, edu cational, and interpersonal growth (e.g. household management, development of social support netw orks) that serve to maximize opportunities for successful community integration. Individuals procee d toward goal attainment at their own pace and may continue in the program at varying levels in tensity for an indefinite period of time. Supported Employment Supported employment consists of a range of services to assist individuals to choose, prepare for, obtain, and maintain gainful employment that is based on individuals' preferences, strengths, and experiences. This service also includes a variety of support services to the individual, including side-by-side support on the job. These services may be integrated into a psychosocial rehabilitation center. Peer Support Peer support services allow individuals to direct their own recovery and advocacy process and are provided by persons who are or have been consumers of the behavioral health system and their family members. These services include providing assistance w ith more effectively utilizing the service delivery system (e.g. assistance in developing plans of car e, accessing services and supports, partnering with professionals) or understanding a nd coping with the stressors of the person's illness through support groups, coaching, role modeling, and mentoring. Ac tivities which promote socialization, recovery, self- advocacy, development of natural s upports, and maintenance of commun ity living skills are rendered so individuals can educate and support each other in the acquisition of skills needed to manage their illnesses and access resources within their communities. Serv ices are often provided during the evening and weekend hours. Illness Management & Recovery Illness management and recovery services refers to a series of weekly sessions with trained mental health practitioners for the purpose of assisting individuals in developing personal st rategies for coping with mental illness and promoting recovery. 235 of 327 Supported Housing Supported housing services refers to facilities staffed twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days a week with associated mental health staff supports for individuals who require treatment services and supports in a highly structured setting. These faciliti es are for persons with serious and/or persistent mental illnesses (SPMI) and are not residential trea tment facilities. Supported housing is intended to prepare individuals for more independent living in the community while providing an environment that allows individuals to live in community settings with appropriate mental health supports. Given this goal, every effort should be made to place individuals near their families and other support systems and original areas of residence. Supported housing does not include the payment of room and board. 236 of 327 ATTACHMENT II COST SHARING SCHEDULE 237 of 327 ATTACHMENT II COST SHARING SCHEDULE Non-Pharmacy Copayment Schedule (unless otherwise directed by TENNCARE) Poverty 0% - 99% $0.00 100% - 199% $25.00, Hospital Emerge ncy Room (waived if admitted) $5.00, Primary Care Provider and Community Mental Health Agency Services Other Than Preventive Care $15.00, Physician Specialists (including Psychiatrists) $100.00, Inpatient Hospital Admission 200% and above $50.00, Ho spital Emergency Room (waived if admitted) $10.00, Primary Care Provider and Community Mental Health Agency Services Other Than Preventive Care $25.00, Physician Specialists (including Psychiatrists) $200.00, Inpatient Hospital Admission The CONTRACTOR is specifically prohibited from waiving or discouraging TENNCARE enrollees from paying the amounts described in this attachment. 238 of 327 ATTACHMENT III TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS 239 of 327 ATTACHMENT III TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS In general, contractors shall provide available, acces sible, and adequate numbers of institutional facilities, service locations, service sites, professional, allie d, and paramedical personnel for the provision of covered services, including all emergency services, on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis.
