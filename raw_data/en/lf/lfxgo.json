A rapidly growing segment of the population, some 66 percent, has turned to the drugless healing arts and practices. This has spurred renewed interest in herbs, nutritional principles, exercise, breathing, iridology, homeopathy, fasting, reflex therapy, polarity work, glandular balancing, acupuncture, and many other aspects of the holistic approach to health. Good health entails a high level of physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. The key to health and wellbeing is found in maintaining a proper nutritional foundation, as excess or deficiency in any of the primary chemical elements needed in human nutrition could account for most diseases and pathogenic mental symptoms. Human body tissue can neither be restored nor rejuvenated without proper nutritional support; eating correctly should, therefore, be our number one priority, but the reality of our highly processed fast food society is that today it is very difficult to follow a healthy diet and even more difficult for our bodies to digest, absorb, and metabolize the foods we eat into useable elements necessary for proper body function. The problem is compounded by the fact that many fruits and vegetables are picked green (for easier transportation to markets) before they absorb the proper life-giving nutrients and our soil is largely depleted of the essential elements. A nutrient depleted soil = nutrient depleted food. Our bodies are not designed to ingest and assimilate foods that are deficient in vitamins, enzymes, fiber, and nutrients or have been irradiated, devitalized, and loaded with additives designed to give them eternal shelf life. Such \u0093food\u0094 leads to sickness and disease. Our bodies are made of the same basic chemical elements (minerals) of which the earth is made. We are not getting the mineral nutrition we need from the foods we eat. Specific minerals facilitate specific functions in the organs and tissues where they are dominantly stored. Each of these minerals is a conductor or transmitter operating on a specific vibratory frequency; rarely does any element function alone. Each element achieves its power through bio-chemical combination and - 5 - relationship with other elements; in other words, our products all work synergistically with our other products and the natural minerals we get from pure food sources. In the same way our bodies are not designed to ingest and assimilate inferior foods, our bodies do not thrive on pharmaceutical drugs created in a laboratory. Drugs are not structured or evolved for compatibility with the human organism. More often than not, drugs cause side effects that range from uncomfortable, to severe, to lethal. Since every disease takes time to develop, eliminating disease takes time, too. Hering\u0092s Law of Cure states: \u0093When we use the drugless healing arts, all illness is reversed and we go through a remission period in which we pick up again our old troubles. Thus gradually, we reverse from the chronic stage of disease toward good health by entering a healing crisis when an acute stage has been reached, often the discharge stage.\u0094 Remember, as with everything in life, balance is important. Inadequate or excessive production or supply of the essential nutrients required for proper body function can result in physiological imbalance leading to a wide variety of disease states. The importance of nutritional supplements is widely recognized in the scientific community and among nutritionally oriented physicians, but it is important to remember that nutritional supplementation should be considered part of a long-term health program, not a quick fix. After taking our products, some people feel a difference within 48 hours while others find it takes longer to recognize a change. Ultimately, most people feel increased energy, an improved sense of wellbeing, and get sick less often. We need to return to a simpler, more natural way of life. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries, herbs, and, when available, organically raised beef, lamb, chicken, and fish. Finally, an abundance of fresh air and sunshine, exercise, adequate rest and plenty of water should help restore us all to good health! About Minerals Recognition of the importance of the minerals required for perfect health is so new that few textbooks contain much about it. It is now believed that at least 24 elements are essential to living matter. Deficiency symptoms occur when there is a lack of these minerals and are then resolved when proper balance is achieved. Minerals are essential to physical and mental health. They are a basic part of all cells, particularly blood, nerve, muscle, bones, teeth, and soft tissue. The electrolyte minerals (sodium, potassium, and chloride) are essential for functional support and help regulate the fluid and acid-base balance of our bodies, while other minerals are part of enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions, aid energy production, metabolism, nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and cell permeability. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals are the building blocks of our diet and provide the fuel, or source of energy, to maintain life and promote cell and tissue growth and other biochemical support. Minerals contain no calories or energy themselves, but assist the body in energy production. Minerals (or elements) come from the earth and eventually return to the earth, and can most simply be defined as chemical molecules that cannot be reduced to simpler substances. They exist in their inorganic state in the soil and in their organic state as the basic constituent of all living matter. The main elements essential to health, each of which makes up more than .01 percent of total body weight, are termed macrominerals (calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, sulfur, sodium, magnesium and silicon). The next group of elements, termed micro minerals or trace minerals, each of which constitute less than .01 percent of total body weight though found only in minute amounts, are also essential to health (iron, copper, zinc, iodine, cobalt, bromide, boron, manganese, selenium, fluorine, molybdenum, vanadium, arsenic and chromium). Other elements contained in the body include some of the toxic metals (lead, aluminum, cadmium, and mercury). - 6 - Any element found to occur naturally in soil or plants is organic . It was there long before man. It is when man refines out these minerals to use in food products, etc., that it changes from an organic and natural form to a synthetic one. All trace elements are needed and even required to sustain human life, but only in trace amounts. Anything in excess is to be avoided whether natural or synthetic. Metal poisoning from too much of a mineral primarily affects the metabolic enzymes, brain and nervous system, but can affect many other bodily functions as well. In addition to the toxic metals, some essential elements such as copper, iodine, selenium, chromium, iron and calcium are more likely than other minerals to cause health problems when high levels are present in the body, as a result of excessive intake or reduced ability to eliminate them. Although your body can manufacture some vitamins, it cannot make minerals; thus, a deficiency of minerals is more common than a deficiency of vitamins. Minerals are harder to extract from food complexes during digestion and there is more mineral \u0093uptake\u0094 competition compared to vitamins. What Makes Our Minerals Unique Our mineral dietary supplements are the purest minerals available on the market (up to 99.99% pure) and the purest water (a special purification process assures absolutely pure water) nothing more, nothing less. Each individual mineral is \u0093processed\u0094 in a manner unique to that particular mineral; that process duplicates nature\u0092s method of turning minerals from the earth into a form useable by man. Recommended Daily Allowances We do not follow the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) suggested by the FDA. Due to the fact that our products are completely absorbable, unlike anything the FDA has ever tested, commonly known measurements do not apply to our products. Work with your health care practitioner to establish appropriate amounts for your individual needs. Having an understanding of how minerals work and the basic mineral needs of your body is the best way to figure out what your deficiencies are. Our minerals do not have to be refrigerated. They last indefinitely. We do not recommend mixing the various minerals together to store them, although it is fine to put them in the same container and then drink them. A gallon = 128 ounces = 256 Tablespoons = 768 Teaspoons A quart = 64 Tablespoons = 192 Teaspoons A pint = 32 Tablespoons = 96 Teaspoons 3 Teaspoons = 1 Tablespoon = 15ml 2 Tablespoons = 1 ounce - 7 - Minerals \u0087= Minerals marked with this symbol (\u0087) are also available in a four times concentrate labeled \u00934X\u0094 or \u0093Extra Strength\u0094. Boron 30 +/- parts per million Boron is said to enhance estrogen\u0092s role in building bones by helping convert Vitamin D into the active form necessary for the absorption of calcium. It is essential to bone metabolism and calcification of bones, helping prevent osteoporosis, arthritis, and tooth decay. Boron is also necessary for cartilage formation and repair; it affects calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Memory and brain function can be improved with boron, and it plays a role in regulating the hormones, both estrogen and testosterone. Some research shows that boron improves libido. A boron deficiency can cause weak and fragile cell walls. Boron is stored in the parathyroid glands. Symptoms of boron deficiency: Arthritis Memory loss Brittle bones Muscle pain Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Osteoporosis Degenerative Joint Disease Receding gums Hormonal imbalance Weak cartilage Loss of libido Natural sources: whole grains, nuts, seeds, apples, pears, grapes, leafy greens. Calcium\u0087 2,500 +/- parts per million Calcium is one of the most essential of the major biochemical elements needed in human nutrition. It is needed in every organ of the body, including the brain. Calcium is called the \u0093knitter\u0094 because it promotes healing (or \u0093knitting\u0094) everywhere in the body. It is valuable for tone, power, strength, longevity, vitality and endurance, healing of wounds, counter-acting acids*, and helping regulate metabolism. Because it is used in almost every bodily function, calcium is commonly deficient in our diets. It is one of the first elements to go out of balance when the diet is inadequate. Magnesium, boron and Vitamin D increase calcium absorption while sodium helps keep calcium in soluble form in the body (it must be water soluble to be useable). Calcium raises the body\u0092s resistance to viruses, parasites, bacteria, and cancer. A lack of calcium leads to a host of diseases and degenerative conditions. Pure water-soluble calcium serves a two-fold purpose; it helps reverse symptoms caused by a buildup of compounded calcium , like kidney stones, gallstones, arthritis, and high cholesterol, and helps reverse conditions caused by a deficiency of calcium like acidosis and osteoporosis. A high incidence of cavities or white spots on fingernails indicates a calcium deficiency. This mineral is necessary to regain the proper pH balance. Calcium is stored in the blood and teeth as well as in the nerves, muscles and tissues. Some symptoms of a calcium deficiency: A c n e C a n c e r Arthritis Cavities Acidosis Cataracts - 8 - Attention Deficit Disorder (A.D.D.) Enlarged heart Asthma Fibromyalgia Bell\u0092s Palsy Gallstones Cramps High cholesterol Common cold Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Natural sources: bran, cheese, raw milk, figs, prunes, dates, onions, vegetable greens, kidney and soybeans, lentils, molasses, shellfish. N OTE: refined sugar and foods high in oxalic acid (spinach, cranberries, and rhubarb) leach calcium from the body. See the books section for the following titles: The Calcium Factor , by R.R. Barefoot & Carl J. Reich, M.D.; Death by Diet , by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , by Sang Whang. Chromium\u0087 300 +/- parts per million Chromium is one mineral not easily absorbed by the body. A deficiency of chromium is a major factor in the development of heart disease (heart attacks, hardening of the arteries). Chromium plays an important role in the liver synthesis of fatty acids (burns fat), and helps the body regulate metabolism, insulin and blood sugar levels. Chromium helps the body lose weight by stimulating enzymes* that metabolize glucose for energy. If a body is chromium deficient, it takes twice as long for insulin to remove glucose from the blood. Chromium enhances insulin performance and glucose utilization and helps carry proteins. It works best if taken before meals. Refined sugar causes the body to deplete chromium more rapidly, and strenuous exercise can also deplete chromium levels. The elderly are unable to store as much chromium in the body as younger people. Refining of starches and carbohydrates robs foods of this mineral. For some reason, American soil is chromium deficient when compared to European soil. Chromium is stored principally in the kidneys, spleen and testes, with trace amounts found in the heart, lungs, pancreas and brain. Some symptoms of a chromium deficiency: Anxiety Hyperinsulinism Attention Deficit Disorder (A.D.D) Hypoglycemia Aortic cholesterol plaque Hyperactivity Arteriosclerosis Impaired growth Bi-polar disease Infertility, decreased sperm count Coronary blood vessel disease Obesity Depression Pre-diabetes Diabetes Peripheral neuropathy High blood cholesterol Natural sources: corn oil, cloves, whole grain cereals, meat, and brewer\u0092s yeast. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. Cobalt 200 +/- parts per million Although the body only needs a small amount of cobalt , it is an essential mineral. Research indicates that cobalt helps with the repair of the myelin sheath, increases the effectiveness of glucose transport from the blood into body cells, and increases the assimilation of iron and the building of red blood cells. An important agent of Vitamin B-12, cobalt increases - 9 - the body\u0092s ability to absorb this vitamin. Cobalt stimulates many enzymes* of the body and normalizes the performance of other body cells. Because of its low absorption rate and high excretion rate, cobalt toxicity is not common, but an excess can lead to enlargement of the thyroid gland. Cobalt is stored in red blood cells with smaller amounts in the kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen. Some symptoms of cobalt deficiency: Digestive disorders Pernicious anemia Fatigue Poor circulation Myelin sheath damage Slow or retarded growth rate Nerve damage Natural sources: raw milk, goat milk, meats, apricots, and sea vegetables. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. Copper\u0087 100 +/- parts per million Copper increases iron assimilation, the two working together in the formation of hemoglobin and red blood cells. In fact, anemia can be a copper deficiency symptom. Various enzyme* reactions require copper . Copper influences protein metabolism and general healing, improves vitamin C oxidation and is integral in the formation of RNA. Low or high copper levels can be found in those with mental and emotional problems. Copper helps rid the body of parasites*, and is beneficial for graying and thinning hair. An excess of this mineral is not common because only a small percentage is assimilated; however, toxicity problems can present serious disease states. Copper is most concentrated in the liver, heart, kidneys, brain, bones, and muscles and is essential in the blood; trace amounts are present in all body tissues. Some symptoms of a copper deficiency: Allergies Kawasaki Disease Anemia Liver cirrhosis Aneurysm Osteoporosis Arthritis Oppressed breathing Dry brittle hair Parasites E d e m a P a r k i n s o n \u0092 s D i s e a s e Gulf War Syndrome Reduced glucose tolerance Hernias Ruptured disc High blood cholesterol Skin eruptions or sores Hyper- and hypo- thyroid White or gray hair Hair loss/baldness Varicose veins Heart disease Wrinkled skin Natural sources: liver, whole grain cereals, almonds, green leafy vegetables, and seafood. *See the books section for the following titles: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D.; Guess What Came to Dinner by Ann Louise Gittleman. Germanium 50 +/- parts per million Germanium , one of the most dynamic new discoveries in the realm of trace elements, is necessary for optimum nutritional health. Although still being researched for all its possible supplementary applications, germanium has been found to raise the activity level of various - 10 - organs by facilitating oxygen uptake and helping expel harmful pollutants and arresting germ activity. Germanium also is believed to act as an anti-cancer agent, has proved itself effective in viral, bacterial and fungal infections and is known to stimulate production of natural killer cells and T-suppressor cells. A poor immune system and low energy indicate germanium deficiencies. Some symptoms of a germanium deficiency: Asthma Leukemia Cancer (breast, lung, bladder) Neuralgia Cardiac insufficiency Nephritis Hypertension Neurotic disorders Hepatic cirrhosis Softening brain tissue Natural sources: garlic, ginseng, aloe vera, comfrey, all chlorophyll rich foods, shiitake mushrooms, and healing herbs. Gold 50 +/- parts per million Gold promotes a general euphoric feeling (helps the body relax), enhances the body\u0092s natural defenses against illness, and promotes vitality and longevity. Gold has been found to improve glandular function. Some people report that after taking gold for an extended period of time, it appeared to raise their energy levels. It is believed that gold helps repair damaged DNA. Effective against joint inflammation, gold, when used with aspirin for arthritis, relieves pain. Gold is not an analgesic but may have anti-inflammatory effects. Some symptoms of a gold deficiency: Arthritis Gland dysfunction Brain dysfunction Heat flashes Chills Insomnia Cancer Joint inflammation Circulatory disorders Night sweats Depression Neutralizes fluoride poisoning* Digestive disorders Obesity Drug/alcohol addiction Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) *See the books section for the following title: Fluoride-the Aging Factor by Dr. John Yiamouyiannis. Indium 80 +/- parts per million Indium is a rare trace (or micro-) mineral believed to support several hormonal systems in the body and may elevate immune activity and reduce the severity and duration of a plethora of human conditions. It is believed that indium may provide aid to the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. These two master hormone producers have the job of maintaining optimal output of hormones for the body. Once this stasis is achieved, a great many other hormone-producers become stimulated, causing a domino effect and helping retard aging and various health problems. Indium seems to enhance food and mineral absorption by the body. It even has been found to aid in the utilization of other essential trace elements. It is not found in food or water; in fact, although it is not ordinarily found in the human body at all after approximately 25-30 years of age, those people taking indium experience beneficial results immediately. - 11 - Some of the short-term benefits reported by many indium users include: increased energy, an enhanced sense of wellbeing \u0096 the so-called \"indium high\u0094, and a reduced need for sleep. Long- term benefits of indium include (but are not limited to) a gradual correction of many chronic illnesses such as: ADD, improved blood pressure, stress-related problems, healthier body weight, autism, and a reversal of visible signs of aging. It is believed that when taking indium one feels rejuvenated and energized because the hormonal system is working better. Some symptoms of an indium deficiency: Cancer Some glandular disorders Depression Lack of energy Obesity NOTE: There are no sulfates is this product. Do not take with food. Not for use on broken skin or in the eyes. Iodine 15 +/- parts per million Iodine , called the \u0093metabolizer\u0094, is one of the most vital of the biochemical elements and has one of the highest vibratory frequency rates of all elements. It mainly affects the thyroid, which controls many important functions. Iodine restores heat and assists calcium in the repairing and building of tissue in the body. The thyroid gland secretes iodine . Hormones produced by the thyroid regulate and control the metabolism of the body, increasing the assimilation of salts. These hormones also control digestion, heart rate, body temperature, nervous system, reproductive system and body weight. Iodine protects the brain by destroying harmful toxins there and helps neutralize toxins elsewhere in the body. Iodine aids the assimilation of calcium and silicon. Although a regular elevated intake of iodine would be required to produce iodine toxicity, allergic reactions to this mineral occur occasionally, manifesting as skin rashes or acne. Iodine is stored primarily in the thyroid and in smaller amounts in the muscles, skin, and bones. Some symptoms of an iodine deficiency: Cretinism Hyper- and Hypo- thyroidism Depression Lethargy Frustration Miscarriages Goiter Scaly or dry skin Hormonal imbalance Sterility or Infertility Natural sources: seafood, kelp, eggs, papayas, mango, pineapple, dulse. Iron 75 +/- parts per million Iron is called the \u0093energy giver.\u0094 It attracts oxygen and builds blood. Along with manganese and copper, it is necessary for healthy blood chemistry and is essential for recovery from illness. Iron is one of the most common deficiencies in men as well as women, although women require more iron than men because of losses that occur during the menstrual cycle. Without sufficient iron, the body cannot manufacture enough new hemoglobin, the red cell protein that transports oxygen in blood. Iron helps the body rid itself of carbon dioxide and keeps liver tissue soft. Iron combines with other nutrients to produce vital blood proteins and is involved in food metabolism, digestion, elimination, circulation, and helps maintain sufficiently high blood - 12 - pressure. Vitamin C improves its absorption. Absorption of iron from food usually ranges from 5-15%, thus showing the need for supplementation. Iron is stored in the blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen, with trace amounts in every organ. Some symptoms of an iron deficiency: Anemia Fatigue/lack of stamina Anorexia Fragile bones Brittle nails Growth retardation Constipation Hair loss Dizziness Headaches Depression Ice eating (Pica) Dysphasia Unnaturally pale skin Natural sources: greens (chlorophyll), high iron fruits, dark berries. Lithium 30 +/- parts per million Lithium is a trace element that may be useful in treating alcoholism, manic depression and mental instability. We do not recommend our lithium mineral water for common or everyday use. Unlike our other mineral waters, lithium could have serious side effects. We believe that water-soluble elemental lithium does not have the side effects commonly associated with lithium compounds available from other sources. It has been added to our line of minerals at the request of numerous health care professionals. We suggest that you take this mineral only under the supervision of your health care professional . Magnesium\u0087 2,000 +/- parts per million Magnesium is a natural tranquilizer. It is called the \u0093anti-stress mineral\u0094 because it aids in relaxing nerves and relieving tension. It also assists digestion, activates enzymes* important for protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and modulates the electrical potential across all cell membranes. Magnesium is important in muscle contraction and relaxation, the production and transfer of energy, and in nerve conduction. It also aids regularity, is necessary to keep vertebrae in their proper position, induces restful sleep, purifies and purges body tissues (combats acids*, toxins, gases, impurities, and neutralizes poisons), and lowers fever. Magnesium is stored in the bowel, nerves and ligaments. Some symptoms of a magnesium deficiency: Asthma Malignant calcification of tissue Anorexia Migraines Cramps Muscular weakness Convulsions Muscle tremors Calcification of organs Muscle tics Calcification of small arteries Myocardial Infarction Depression Neuromuscular problems ECG changes PMS Growth failure Vertigo H e a d a c h e s W r i n k l e s Kidney stones - 13 - Natural sources: chlorophyll, nuts, whole grains, unpolished rice, wheat germ, and green vegetables. *See the books section for the following titles: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D.; Death by Diet by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , Sang Whang. Manganese\u0087 100 +/- parts per million The \u0093brain mineral\u0094 manganese is important in the utilization of all mental facilities/functions. It aids memory and other brain and nerve faculties and also increases resistance and recuperative ability. Like iron, manganese aids in oxygen transfer from lungs to cells. Though only found in trace amounts in the body, good health is impossible without manganese . Manganese strengthens tendons, tissues, ligaments, and linings in and outside of organs \u0093If the human body is well supplied with it ( manganese ), various tissues, cells and nerves become more ductile, tensile, and elastic\u0094 ( The Chemistry of Man by Bernard Jensen) . Manganese makes up a part of molecules known as mucopolysaccharides, which are used to form collagen, the strong fibrous connective material that builds tissue, bone, and cartilage. This mesh of collagen is the framework on which calcium, magnesium, and other bone hardening minerals are deposited. Deafness, if due to damage of the cartilage of the ear, can be attributed partially to a deficiency in manganese . Production of sex hormones is aided by manganese ; it also helps the reproductive organs work properly because of its effect on tissues and nerves. The pain of menstrual cramps can be reduced through the use of manganese . Manganese is stored half in the bones and the remainder in the liver, pancreas, pituitary gland, and kidneys. Some symptoms of a manganese deficiency: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Multiple Sclerosis Deafness Nerve problems Depression PMS Gout Poor muscle co-ordination Hearing problems Retarded or stunted growth Infertility Ringing in the ears (Tinnitus) Lack of concentration Stiff tendons Loss of libido in both sexes Stuttering Memory loss/mental confusion Tremors Miscarriages or stillbirths Natural sources: black walnuts, other raw nuts/seeds, pineapple, blueberries, avocado, cantaloupes, spinach, and the bran/germ of whole grains. Molybdenum 50 +/- parts per million Molybdenum is a little-known, though essential, trace mineral. It is instrumental in regulating pH* balance in the body. For each pH point increase (e.g., 6.1 to 6.2), the oxygen level is increased ten times, increasing the metabolism and enhancing the body\u0092s ability to burn fat. Although very small amounts are needed, molybdenum is a vital part of three important enzyme* systems and is necessary for the proper function of certain enzyme-dependent processes, including the metabolism of iron. When the iron stored in the liver is freed by the molybdenum- dependent enzymes, it then can carry oxygen to body cells and tissue. - 14 - Molybdenum works with the enzyme systems to help eliminate toxic nitrogen waste by turning it into uric acid. The uric acid then can be converted and more easily flushed out of the system. Molybdenum promotes general well being, aids in carbohydrate metabolism, has proven itself useful in MSG (or other chemical) sensitivity, increases libido, and may enhance the effect of fluorine in tooth decay prevention (dental enamel is rich in molybdenum ). It also induces sleep. Molybdenum has been found to interfere with the absorption of copper, so we recommend taking it at a different time than copper. Molybdenum is stored in the liver, bones and kidneys. Some symptoms of a molybdenum deficiency: A c n e E . c o l i A I D S E c z e m a A l l e r g i e s E p s t e i n B a r r A n e m i a G o u t Anthrax Gulf War Syndrome Asthma Hepatitis C Athlete\u0092s foot Herpes simplex Bell\u0092s Palsy Impotency Bladder Liver - Cirrhosis Candidiasis Lupus Canker sores Lyme Disease Cavities Multiple Sclerosis Contrail/Chemtrail exposure Obesity Colds/Flu Parasites Depression Prostate infection Diabetes Ringworm Natural sources: spinach and other leafy, dark green vegetables, cauliflower, whole grains such as oats, buckwheat, and wheat germ, potatoes, legumes (beans and peas), Brewer\u0092s yeast and liver and organ meats. *See the books section for the following titles: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D.; Death by Diet by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , Sang Whang. Platinum 50 +/- parts per million Platinum is used in the treatment of cancer and as a base in some of the chemotherapeutic treatments in conventional hospitals, although not in the proper (natural) form. In the early 1970\u0092s, platinum was used in the dye used when x-raying women\u0092s breasts. Breast lumps reportedly began shrinking and even disappearing after use of the dye. Many believed the platinum in the dye caused the shrinking and disappearance. Since then, platinum dye has been replaced with radioactive dyes. Platinum may be effective in killing disease- causing bacteria, fungi, viruses, and helping boost the immune system. Some symptoms of a platinum deficiency: Back pain Mental alertness C a n c e r N e r v e d a m a g e Chronic fatigue Neuralgia Gland dysfunction PMS Headaches Poor concentration Insomnia - 15 - Potassium 900 +/- parts per million The \u0093alkalizer\u0094* mineral, potassium neutralizes acids and restores alkaline salts to the bloodstream. Potassium works with sodium in all cells including at nerve synapses to maintain or restore membrane potentials and assist in metabolic processes. Potassium is critical to cardiovascular and nerve function, regulating the transfer of nutrients into cells and facilitating muscle energy. It also regulates water balance, assists recuperative powers, aids rheumatic or arthritic conditions (causing acids to leave the joints, easing stiffness), is vital for the elimination of wastes, is a natural pain desensitizer, helps control convulsions, headaches, and migraines, promotes faster healing of cuts, bruises and other injuries, and generally contributes to a sense of well being. Potassium is stored in the muscles. Some symptoms of a potassium deficiency: Bad circulation Insomnia Bluish tint to skin Intestinal pain Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Muscle weakness Diabetes Oppressive breathing Earaches Pain in the eyes Edema Prolapsed uterus Headaches Swollen glands Heart palpitations Tissue anemia Hypertension Water retention Natural sources: leafy green vegetables, citrus, bananas, back olives, potato peelings, beets, beans, kelp, whole grains, and seafood. *See the books section for the following titles: Death by Diet by Robert R.

It promotes normal body growth, enhances fertility, encourages tissue elasticity and is a potent antioxidant that naturally reduces the retention of toxic metals in the body. Selenium is crucial for the proper functioning of the heart muscle and there is evidence that it can help the body fight cancer. The people of Norfolk, England, are said to be among some of the longest-lived in the world. Scientists believe it is due to high concentrations of selenium in the soil. A low level of selenium in soil has long been associated with higher cancer rates. Selenium is stored in muscle and other tissues, as well as in the liver and kidneys. Some symptoms of a selenium deficiency: Age/liver spots Immune deficiencies Alzheimer\u0092s Infertility Anemia Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cancer Muscular Dystrophy (MD) Cardiomyopathy Muscular weakness Cirrhosis of the liver Pancreatic atrophy Cystic Fibrosis Pancreatitis F a t i g u e P a r k i n s o n \u0092 s D i s e a s e Fibromyalgia Premature aging Heart disease Scoliosis - 16 - Heart palpitations Sickle cell anemia HIV (AIDS) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Hot flashes Natural sources: organ meats (liver, kidney), seafood, whole grains, and many natural foods. Silver\u0087 100+/- parts per million Silver has been used for thousands of years for health care. It is believed that silver is a systemic disinfectant and works like a secondary immune system. Since silver only kills anaerobic (nitrogen breathing) bacteria, the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract are immune to it because they are aerobic (oxygen breathing). Silver also can neutralize sodium fluoride* poisoning. \u0093 What we have actually done was rediscover the fact that silver killed bacteria, which had been known for centuries...when antibiotics were discovered, clinical uses for silver as an antibiotic were discarded.\" Dr. Robert O. Becker, M.D. Symptoms of a silver deficiency and some diseases where the use of silver may be beneficial: Anthrax Gonorrhea Athlete\u0092s foot Impetigo B o i l s I n f e c t i o n Candida Influenza Cerebro-spinal meningitis Intestinal Shingles Diphtheria Staphylococci Diplococcus Tuberculosis D y s e n t e r y W a r t s E. Coli Whooping cough *See the books section for the following title: Fluoride-the Aging Factor by Dr. John Yiamouyiannis. Sulfur\u0087 900 +/- parts per million Sulfur is the heating mineral. It aids every cell in the elimination of toxic substances through agitation. Sulfur aids functions in enzyme* reactions and protein synthesis and is important in cellular respiration. It is the flexible bond that connects cells, the lubricant found between joints. A deficiency of water-soluble sulfur can lead to a variety of conditions ranging from skin irritations and rashes to total breakdown of cellular regeneration. Pain and inflammation associated with various muscle and skeletal disorders indicate a deficiency of sulfur . It is believed that sulfur can repair the myelin sheath, the protector on the end of every nerve in the body. Damage to the myelin sheath causes the shaking condition in palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Lorenzo\u0092s Disease and many other disease conditions where motor functions are uncontrollable. Allergies to food and chronic or severe allergies to materials such as dust, pollen, wool, animal hair, feathers, etc., with symptoms ranging from respiratory congestion to inflammation, itching, and general discomfort, can be relieved with sulfur . It increases blood circulation, - 17 - reduces back pain, relieves migraine headaches, promotes muscle healing, scavenges free radicals, beautifies the skin, controls acidity* in stomach ulcers, is important for carbohydrate metabolism and speeds wound healing. Sulfur is stored in the brain, nerves, bowel and liver, and in all body cells, especially skin, hair, and nails. Some symptoms of a sulfur deficiency: Arthritis Infection Asthma Migraines Acne Muscle pain Back pain Nerve disorders Constipation Stress Circulatory problems Skin disorders Dry skin Urinary tract disorders Free radical damage Various muscle/skeletal disorders Inflammation Wrinkles Natural sources: kale, cabbage, cauliflower, horseradish, cranberries, meat, fish, egg yolks, onion, and garlic. *See the books section for the following titles: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D.; Death by Diet by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , Sang Whang. Tin 100 +/- parts per million Tin has many chemical and physical properties similar to those of carbon, silica, germanium and lead. It has been implicated in hair loss and hearing loss, but little is known about the functions for tin in humans. Tin is concentrated primarily in the adrenal glands and in the tissues, liver, brain, spleen and thyroid. Some symptoms of a tin deficiency: Hair loss Male pattern baldness Hearing loss Vanadium\u0087 300 + /- parts per million Vanadium regulates the circulatory system, helps prevent excessive cholesterol deposits in blood vessels and cholesterol buildup in the central nervous system, lowers elevated blood sugar and is believed to help reduce the incidence of heart attack. When used in combination with chromium, it is found to be very beneficial in dealing with mineral deficiencies found in diabetics and those with hypoglycemia. It is estimated that 80 million Americans exhibit some of the characteristics of diabetes: insulin resistance, excess insulin release, high triglycerides and high blood sugar. Chronic weight loss or gain, frequent urination, and chronic thirst are warning signs that are indicative of the possible onset of diabetes. Some symptoms of a vanadium deficiency are: Cardiovascular disease Infertility Diabetes Metabolic dysfunction High cholesterol Obesity Hyperinsulinism Pancreatic dysfunction Hypoglycemia Natural sources: oysters, kelp, gelatin, vegetable oil, soy, sunflower, corn, olive oil, buckwheat, parsley, oats, rice, green beans. - 18 - VanChroZin 1200 +/- parts per million VanChroZin stands for the specialized mineral combination of Vanadium, Chromium, and Zinc . It incorporates the best qualities of each of these minerals. Designed for the mineral deficiencies found in diabetics and hypoglycemics, VanChroZin may be used for other deficiency disorders as well. Below is a list of some conditions we believe our product may help: Hypoglycemia Diabetes Slow growth Infertility Cardiovascular disease Increased infant mortality Hyperinsulenimia Obesity Elevated cholesterol & triglycerides Pancreatic dysfunction Metabolic dysfunction Water of Life\u0087 4000 +/- parts per million Our Water of Life begins as a fossilized kelp seaweed product from Nevada. Centuries ago, part of Nevada was covered by a sea where a great underwater kelp forest flourished. The rich sea minerals were extracted by the kelp and concentrated within. Today, those long-dry seabeds offer us a unique and potent blend of natural minerals and calcium salts called \u0093 CALZYME \u0094. This natural blend causes the same kind of healthful catalytic effects usually associated with enzymes* . We then take the calzyme and add our own blend of \u0093missing elements\u0094 to create a finished product ( Water of Life ) that aids and promotes the body\u0092s natural functions, helping promote healthy blood, strengthening cell walls, and aiding in the proper contraction and relaxation of muscles such as the heart. The numerous elements that compose our bodies are constantly being used up and must be replenished. Unlike all our other mineral products targeted to specific health needs, Water of Life contains approximately 84 elements in trace amounts, making it the perfect nutritional supplement for overall body maintenance. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. Zinc\u0087 300 +/- parts per million Zinc deficiency is common today due to the depletion of nutrients and minerals in our soil and losses associated with food processing. A deficiency of zinc can lead to a wide variety of degenerative diseases and illnesses. Zinc aids in: the proper assimilation of vitamins, normal growth and development, maintenance of body tissues, sexual function, immune system, chemical detoxification, synthesis of DNA, and helps reduce healing time both before and after surgery. Zinc is anti-bacterial, anti-viral and is found in all the body fluids, including fluid in the eyes, lungs, nose, urine and saliva. It is an anti-oxidant, and must be in proper balance to assist some 25 enzymes* in various functions involving digestion, metabolism, and reproduction. In the 1800\u0092s, surgeons used zinc as an antiseptic/antibiotic. Lack of zinc in pregnant women can result in numerous birth defects. Because zinc moves through all the fluids in the body, it creates a defense against infection-causing bacteria and viruses trying to enter the body - 19 - and stops bacterial and viral replication. Zinc is stored in the thyroid, pancreas, liver, kidneys, bones, voluntary muscles, prostate, sperm, skin, hair, nails, white blood corpuscles and parts of the eyes. Some symptoms of a zinc deficiency: Angina Eye diseases Alzheimer\u0092s Free radical damage A n e m i a H e r p e s A n t h r a x H y p e r t e n s i o n Alcoholism Hair loss Acne Infertility Anorexia & Bulimia Infection Body odor Libido, loss of Birth defects (cleft lip, spina bifida, Loss of smell and taste clubbed limbs, hiatal/umbilical hernias) Miscarriages Cavities Obesity Crohn\u0092s Disease PMS Depression Still births Diabetes Thyroid disorders Down\u0092s Syndrome Urinary tract infections Natural sources: oysters, red meat, liver, egg yolks, whole grains, nuts, legumes, poultry, seafood, Brewer\u0092s yeast, mushrooms. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. OTHER PRODUCTS Mineral Test Vial Kits This mineral test kit is designed for kinesiology testing. The kit consists of 22 mineral samples, one EPN and one PRNA sample. The 2.5ml vials are packed in a foam-filled carton. The pH Factor The term \u0093pH\u0094* means \u0093potential of hydrogen\u0094, and the pH scale is used to state the overall hydrogen level of the body. It is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Hydrogen balance is very important. Our bodies are 70% water (a solution). The pH of the body\u0092s fluids and tissues is measured on a scale of 0 to 14; the lower the pH, the more acidic the solution, the higher the pH, the more alkaline. Low pH cells are anaerobic (nitrogen breathing), cancerous cells. Aerobic (oxygen breathing) cells are healthy cells; they have a high pH. The pH in the body controls fat, and alkaline elements break down fat. A pH of 7 is neutral, a balance between positively charged ions (acid-forming) and negatively charged ions (alkaline-forming). Since the body is constantly striving to maintain that balance, a range of 6.0-7.5 is a good pH. We have pH test kits available. *See the books section for the following titles: The Calcium Factor by R. R. Barefoot; Death by Diet by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , Sang Whang. - 20 - EPN ** (Enzyme P hytoN utrient) A Liquid Enzyme* For Immune Support Optimal Health EPN complex is a patent-pending enzyme phytonutrient (from a plant source) that provides the enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication. No combination of vitamins, minerals, amino acids or herbals can replace the necessary saccharides found in EPN . We believe that EPN will provide total enzyme supplementation. Proteins and carbohydrates are chief components of the human body. In the past, food always has provided these essential building blocks. However, scientists are learning more each day about the functions that specific nutritional food components play in the body. As recently as this century, the benefits of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and phytochemicals were discovered. Studies conducted to determine the effects phytonutrient dietary supplementation had on a variety of infections found that enzyme phytonutrients were demonstrated to be effective in supporting the immune system. There is evidence also to suggest that phytonutrient molecules mediate most of the communication that occurs between the 100 trillion or so cells of the human body. Incomplete or poorly formed phytonutrient molecules can result in defective cell messages, which may have implications for immunity. While human milk contains high concentrations of phytonutrients, animal milks vary in the combinations and amounts present. Breast-fed infants are known to have an increased resistance to middle ear infections as well as other childhood illnesses. PhytoNutrients have been tested in: Alcohol craving Anger control Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Autistic children Behavior modification Candida Albicans Canker sores (Aphthous stomatitis) sores or fever blisters (Herpes labialis) Coxsackie Viruses Decrease the need for medications Depression Diabetes Mellitus Dyslexia (learning difficulties) Enhanced glutathione levels Fibromyalgia Hepatitis C Immune function Inflammation Inflammatory Diseases of the Heart Inflammatory Diseases of the Pancreas Liver enzyme serum changes Lupus Menopause Oral Mucosal Disease Osteo-Arthritis Periodontal disease (tooth loss) Positive outlook Protection from chemically-initiated glutathione depletion Respiratory airflow in asthmatics Rheumatoid arthritis Temper Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tissue disorders EPN is created through a unique fourteen-day process. Because this manufacturing process resembles the steps taken as for human digestion, soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners. Through this proprietary process, nutrient enzymes are produced along with a phyto-sweetener resembling human colostrom (found in mother\u0092s - 21 - breast milk). Therefore, EPN is an all-in-one combination of healthful enzymes and a phyto- sweetener. Due to the fact that the creation process is digestive in nature, there is no residual, unassimilated soy matter remaining. We believe that our EPN will allow the body to create all the sugars the body needs, and it is safe for diabetics. EPN does not allow the protein molecules to split, thus helping the body\u0092s digestion and assimilation processes. EPN further helps increase oxygen levels while helping raise pH. Raising pH can protect one from the free radical damage that normal foods create during a nutritional metabolic process. Our EPN can go into the body and metabolize without free radicals, which helps one\u0092s body preserve current anti-oxidant materials. Enzyme phytonutrients provide energy directly to the individual cells and enhance the electromagnetic fields in the body, thus causing increased energy. In conclusion, we believe that EPN will aid in all facets of digestion/enzyme function and possibly provide a variety of the benefits described above. The recommended amount is 1 TBL per day mixed with any liquid. For best results, take on a full stomach. We offer EPN in pints, quarts, and gallons. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. **Contains (Phyto-Ribonucleic Acid) Dry Enzyme * What is \u0093RNA\u0094? Why do we need it? What does it do? RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. Ribonucleic acid is responsible for building proteins and protein synthesis in the body. To understand RNA function one must understand protein function. A protein is a group of molecules composed of elements and amino acids. These are in all living cells and many substances such as enzymes, hormones and the antibodies that are necessary for the proper functioning of any living organism. They are absolutely essential to all animal diets and to the growth and repair of tissue in the body. Without RNA, protein would not be produced or synthesized by the body. This is why RNA is so vitally important. There are 3 types of RNA: messenger RNA, transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA. Messenger RNA is responsible for taking messages from your DNA (your gene structure) and providing a template or a single strand mirror image for your amino acids to link up with. This is where transfer RNA comes in. Transfer RNA seeks out and brings each individual amino acid to the chain and parks it in its particular slot where it will do the most good and be the most beneficial. Now enters rRNA (ribosomal RNA). Ribosomal RNA provides the machinery or energy needed to start the protein synthesis process. As we age, there tend to be breakdowns and shortages of nucleic acids in the system, leading to RNA errors and lack of protein synthesis. This is where aging comes from. Research done by Dr. Benjamin Frank, author of Nucleic Acid Nutritional Therapy , Dr. Milton Fried and HEM Pharmaceuticals shows clearly that those who supplement with RNA on a regular basis showed improvement in their memory function, increased energy levels, better tolerance of extreme temperature changes, enhanced immunity, better vision and tighter, radiant skin. They also found that those who supplemented with RNA looked 5-15 years younger than their actual age. P-RNA is just the product to help with the above. We believe it will not only help one to look and feel younger, but that it will aid in ridding the body of toxins, repair genetic sequences and alterations, desensitize the blood to allergies and promote general youth and vitality. The recommended amount is 1 tsp. per day. *See the books section for the following title: The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee, Ph.D. - 22 - Body Alkalizer The Body Alkalizer* is essentially a form of liquid that, when added to water, will change the value thereof to an alkaline. The basis behind this is to reverse the aging that occurs in one\u0092s body as a result of accumulated non-disposed cellular waste in the system. Since waste products are carried out by the blood and disposed of in a liquid form, drinking the proper kind of water is essential. Alkaline water works on a cellular level; it causes the waste products accumulated in the cell to be removed from the system via perspiration or urine. It also raises one\u0092s own pH level, bringing the body to a healthier, more alkaline state. Water is a very strong solvent. It sustains and even protects life. It carries essential minerals throughout the body, supplying the cells with the necessary nutrients. It is essential in every aspect of our lives, and because of this, getting the right type of water is vital. Many assume the more pure the water, the better. The truth is, \u0093pure\u0094 water (distilled) is dead. Nothing can live in it, and if taken long enough it will leach out valuable minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium from the body. What is more important is the right type of water . Only a few drops of our Body Alkalizer in a glass of milk will neutralize lactic acid, but it will take 120 drops of the Body Alkalizer to neutralize your soda! When added to normal bathtub water (approximately 20 drops), you\u0092ll come out clean as a whistle, no soap required. This is an amazing product! One one-ounce bottle yields five 2-drop doses a day for 45 days. *See the books section for the following titles: Death by Diet by Robert R. Barefoot; Reverse Aging , Sang Whang. OxyDrops OxyDrops is a liquid concentrate of electrolytes of oxygen made available to the body in a molecular form and released upon contact with stomach acid. OxyDrops is the highest quality, strongest and most stable of all the liquid electrolytes of oxygen available today. By providing the bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic (unfriendly) bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming either tissue or friendly (aerobic) bacteria. When extra oxygen is released into the bloodstream in this manner, though minimal when compared to the amount of oxygen entering via the lungs, it is very beneficial to one\u0092s metabolism. If the body can maintain a robust cellular oxidation, meaning that virtually every cell in the body is functioning well, disease and bacteria are killed. When cell oxidation is diminished due to stress, pollution and junk foods, the body is opened up to degeneration, fatigue and sickness. The chlorite molecule is used for a number of important enzymes that help improve cell oxidation. In fact, the most abundant element found in healthy human blood is chlorine, followed by sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and so forth. OxyDrops has specific enzyme-enhancing qualities. When OxyDrops hits stomach acid, it breaks it up into elemental sodium and oxygen; when it is diluted in water, the high alkaline pH is rapidly lowered from a pH of 12-13 to a pH of about 8.6. When this happens, the chlorite-oxygen molecule is separated from the sodium atom. Tiny amounts of chlorine dioxide are released and this reaction destroys microbes in the water, making our Oxydrops a good thing to have on hand if the water source is questionable. One four-ounce bottle yields two 10-drop doses a day for 60 days. - 23 Anne's LaceQueen Anne's LaceQueen Anne's LaceQueen times (as in \u0093folklore medicine\u0094), it was discovered that the seeds of Queen Anne's Lace could be of benefit as an antiseptic diuretic useful in such conditions as cystitis and prostatitis, as well as dropsy and the elimination of uric acid from the body (good for use with gout). Also, the seeds were used for the washing out of gravel and urinary stones. The seeds, high in volatile oils, have been found by some to be soothing to the digestive system, and may be useful for colic and flatulence. Some menopausal and post-menopausal women have reported that the use of our Queen Anne's Lace SEED TINCTURE (\u00bc teaspoon daily) is proving successful as a substitute for yam cream. NOTE: Contains estrogen . Queen Anne's Lace seeds have been found to block progesterone synthesis in pregnant laboratory animals. Some herbalists employ the seeds for implantation prevention.

Ozone Generator Ozone, a \u0093super-active\u0094 form of oxygen composed of three molecules bound together, is produced naturally when the ultra-violet rays of the sun strike oxygen molecules high above the earth. A natural purifier, ozone has the clean fresh scent one notices after a heavy rainstorm and, just as nature uses ozone to protect all life on earth from pollutants and harmful radiation, so our Ozone Generator can be used to help protect the individual against bacteria and viruses. Our Ozone Generator is easy to use, inexpensive to operate, light and portable. Each of our ozone generators is controlled by a simple on-off switch and is available in two different models: (a) the basic ozone generator and (b) the oxygen-ready model. The basic model can produce up to 1 gram of ozone per hour, while our oxygen-ready unit produces up to 1 gram of - 25 - oxygen without being attached to an oxygen tank and up to 5 grams of ozone when attached to an oxygen tank. The ozone generator has three basic uses: (a) water purification, (b) air purification, and (c) personal health. As a water purifier, our Ozone Generator will purify approximately one ounce of water per minute, revitalizing the taste of stored water and not adversely affecting the resulting pH. The Ozone Generator also helps kill algae in water. As an air purifier, it will cleanse the air of all known viruses and bacteria as well as eliminate harmful and unpleasant odors like cigarette smoke and airborne molds. Daily use of the Ozone Generator will help maintain and promote personal health. Not only will exposure to ozone rid the body of fungal infections like athlete\u0092s foot, it has proved effective in helping control conditions such as acne, chapped skin, and melanoma. Ozone has been found effective on insect and spider bites. When taken internally, ozonated water has shown positive results for a variety of conditions such as ulcers, asthma, and cancer. Our Ozone Generator is environmentally safe. It produces ozone through the use of a quartz crystal lamp, using a frequency of 180 nanometers. Our machines use naturally occurring crystal forms to generate negatively charged ions. Many have reported that the positive-charged ions produced by dangerous, high-voltage ozone machines have caused feelings of depression and fatigue. An added benefit of ozone use \u0096 it will extend the shelf life of your fruits and vegetables. Just place the fruit in a bowl of water, attach a fish stone to the end of the plastic tube, drop the fish stone into the water and allow the machine to run 15-20 minutes. Our Ozone Machine comes with a one-year parts warranty from date of purchase.

(shipping weight = 14 lbs.) Ozone Body Suit The ozone body suit is designed for use with our ozone generator. The benefits of using the two together range from helping relieve simple muscle fatigue to aiding severe infections such as limb-threatening gangrene. It has been reported that using the body suit with the ozone generator helps cleanse the skin, removes odor, oxygenates and improves circulation, aids in the removal of viruses from the body and attacks cancer cells. Our ozone suits are made of a durable rip-stop nylon that does not allow the ozone to escape. (The purpose of the suit is to trap the concentrated ozone around you, enabling your body to maximize use of the ozone produced by - 26 - our ozone generator.) The suit is 62 inches long and 38 inches wide, suitable for a large person to use. The hose to the ozone generator can be slipped inside the suit at any opening to allow maximum concentration to the area being ozonated. When utilizing the body suit, one may wear clothing or not; if you want to wear clothing, loose fitting cotton clothing is recommended; rubber or plastics deteriorate when exposed to ozone. It is important to remain warm during sessions in the body suit so that the pores open, allowing the body to absorb the ozone directly through the skin. See information on the ozone generator for more information on the benefits of ozone for the body. NOTE: You may use up to 4 hours for any extremity. Do not exceed 1-hour maximum for torso area.
