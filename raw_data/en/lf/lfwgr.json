Let me guess. Slowly but surely you've been switching over your beauty and personal care routine to natural, [non-toxic products](https://mindfulmomma.com/non-toxic-beauty/) - but there's one area that you haven't quite mastered yet: DEODORANT. I know exactly why. Deodorant is one thing you're too scared to mess with. When you leave the house in the morning - whether you are going to the office, running errands or heading to the gym to work out - you need to be sure that you will not end up a stinking mess by the end of the day. No one wants to be that person! Yet switching to a natural, non-toxic deodorant is totally do-able (and important!). But it's true - it can be a bit tricky. After doing loads of research, including a [reader survey](https://goo.gl/forms/IL97g0JO6h7XRbDl2), here's one thing I know for sure: finding a non toxic deodorant that works is not a one-size-fits all proposal. Note: There may be affiliate links in this post including Amazon Affiliates. [Full disclosure.](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) Why You Should Switch to a Non Toxic Deodorant To start, let's talk about why you should switch deodorants in the first place. Traditional deodorants and antiperspirants contain some potentially harmful ingredients. In fact, in my deodorant survey, the primary reason given for switching to a natural deodorant was to [avoid toxic chemicals](https://mindfulmomma.com/toxic-chemical-exposures-health/). Here's a rundown of deodorant ingredients to AVOID: - Aluminum - the active ingredient in most conventional antiperspirants* - linked to Alzheimer's and breast cancer - Parabens - endocrine disruptors often used as preservatives - Phthalates - hormone disrupting chemicals hiding in the fragrance or other ingredients - Artificial fragrances** - a catch-all term for thousands of chemicals which can cause allergic reactions, skin irritation or worse - Triclosan - an endocrine disruptor and probable carcinogen - Propylene glycol - when derived from natural gas (most common form), it is a potential allergen and a non-renewable resource *A note about antiperspirants: Sweat is our body's natural way of releasing toxins so stopping our sweat glands from working should not be the goal at all. Instead, we want to make our skin less attractive to odor-causing bacteria - which luckily can be done with natural ingredients. **A note about fragrance: The term fragrance is a bit tricky. When you see it on a label, it usually implies [artificial fragrance chemicals](https://mindfulmomma.com/secret-scents-what-is-hiding-in-your-scented-products/) but a few companies use the term even for essential oils and other natural fragrances. For example, Every Man Jack lists fragrance on the label but assured me that their scents are a mixture of essential oils only. On the other hand, Native deodorant uses some safe, phthalate-free synthetic fragrances in addition to essential oils, to make their fragrances stronger. I wish it were easier - but when in doubt - ask the company directly! After a recent study found [cancer-causing benzene in over 40 deodorants](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/high-level-of-leukemia-causing-benzene-found-in-underarm-sprays) and antiperspirants, you'll want to be sure to find a deodorant without benzene, like the ones listed here. Effective Natural Deodorant Ingredients Sometimes I wonder why we get so caught up in chemicals when nature creates so many hard-working ingredients. Nature-made substances including minerals, plant powders, butters and oils from nuts and seeds, and essential oils have all the anti-bacterial and sweat absorbing properties that we need to keep wetness and odor at bay. Here are some of the beneficial ingredients you might find in the best natural deodorants: Odor neutralizing agents - Baking soda* - raises PH of skin, making it less hospitable to bacteria growth [Activated charcoal](https://mindfulmomma.com/activated-charcoal-beauty-products/)- acts like a magnet, drawing out odor-causing bacteria and other toxins from skin - Magnesium - minimizes odor and treats skin problems - Saccharomyces ferment - a vegetable based enzyme that inhibits odor - Essential oils - naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial *A note about baking soda: Many people rave about baking soda for odor control, yet a small number find that it causes skin rashes, bumps or other sensitivities. From what I've read, this is usually a temporary phase as your skin detoxes from conventional deodorants, however many brands now make baking-soda free deodorants for sensitive skin. Wetness absorbing ingredients - Arrowroot - Tapioca starch or cornstarch - Kaolin clay Moisturizing / skin soothing ingredients - Coconut oil - Shea butter - Plant oils - jojoba, sunflower - Beeswax - Candelilla wax - a plant-based substitute for beeswax - Glycerin - Aloe vera - Propanediol (vegetable derived) A note about deodorant formulas: Some people complain that deodorants made with coconut oil and/or shea butter can stain your clothes. If that is a problem, you may prefer a deodorant with a base of glycerin or propanediol. How to Find a Non-Toxic Deodorant that Works No doubt you'd love me to tell you about the amazing natural deodorant that works for everyone. I'm sorry to tell you it doesn't exist. Each one of us is different - from the amount of sweat and odor we produce, to the level of activity we engage in, to our personal skin sensitivities and fragrance preferences. Many of us prefer the convenience of a stick, but some of us love to slather on a [deodorant cream](https://mindfulmomma.com/rethink-your-deodorant/) or do a quick spritz of a spray deodorant. Maybe you are searching for a deodorant that is baking soda free, or one that contains activated charcoal or another specific ingredient. Maybe using a vegan deodorant is important to you, or having a zero-waste deodorant that is better for the planet. Your favorite natural deodorant probably won't be the same as mine - and that's OK! Armpit Detox Also, keep in mind that switching to a natural deodorant takes time. Your skin will need to detox for a couple of weeks as it gets rid of the toxins from your old deodorant. Here are a couple things to consider during the transition time: - Apply deodorant more than once during the day - Do an [armpit detox](https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/armpit-detox/)to prepare your skin for natural deodorant - Try the [Underarm Bar](https://shareasale.com/m-pr.cfm?merchantid=60269&userid=451673&productid=1301724545&afftrack=)- a charcoal based soap that boosts the power of your deodorant - Most important - don't give up! Best Non Toxic Deodorant Brands Here is a list of my recommended natural deodorant brands - including deodorant sticks, deodorant creams and deodorant sprays - all formulated with clean ingredients and no harmful chemicals. The list covers a range of pricing options, and includes zero-waste deodorant options, organic deodorants, as well as vegan deodorant brands (ALL brands listed here are cruelty-free). In terms of odor control, everything I've tried has worked for me - but truth be told - I'm not a super stinky person (guess I drew the lucky card on that one!) All of these natural deodorant options have raving fans - but you'll also find some people who say it didn't work for them. Bottom line: it might take a bit of experimenting to find the clean deodorant that works best for you.
