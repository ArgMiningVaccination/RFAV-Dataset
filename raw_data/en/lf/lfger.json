COVID-19 can make children very sick and cause them to be hospitalized with serious complications, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) where different body parts become inflamed. Like adults, children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. For more information or to check your child's symptoms, visit [Stanford Medicine Children's Health](https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/patient-family-resources/covid-19-patient-education). Expectant Mothers It's recommended that mothers continue to breastfeed or provide their milk even if they have COVID-19 or have been exposed to it.
