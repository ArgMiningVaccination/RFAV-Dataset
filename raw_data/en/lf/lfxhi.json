GORSKI In June, the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Safety, and Insurance, chaired by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri), held a hear - ing on \"Protecting Consumers from False and Deceptive Advertising of Weight-Loss Products.\" Likely few had heard of most of the witnesses giving testimony, which included rep - resentatives from the Federal Trade Commission, supplement manufac - turers, and online advertising groups. However, one witness, Dr. Mehmet Oz, stood out for his fame and influ - ence. Host of the popular daytime program The Dr. Oz Show and dubbed \"America's Doctor\" by his patron Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Oz regularly pro - motes dubious weight loss advice and supplements with the enthusiastically hyperbolic language of an old-time snake oil salesman. As if that weren't bad enough, in - ter mixed with more conventional medical topics Dr. Oz has also fea - tured quackery such as faith healing, \"cleanses,\" \"detoxification,\" and home - opathy; In ter net quacks such as Joseph Mercola and Mike Adams; and psy - chics such as John Edward and \"Long Island Medium\" Theresa Caputo. It's not for nothing that, upon learning of Dr. Oz's impending testimony, one blogger quipped, \"That's like asking Al Capone to testify about U.S. tax policy.\" Congressional hearings tend to re - semble a Japanese Kabuki play: highly stylized and constrained. In deed, the term \"Kabuki dance\" is sometimes used in politics to describe an event designed to create the appearance of uncertain outcome when in fact the \"actors\" know how it is likely to end. The question at the time of the an - nouncement was what the end of this particular Kabuki dance was intended to be. Skeptics had reason to be con - cerned that the hearing could become a forum in which Dr. Oz was allowed to paint himself the victim of weight-loss scammers using his name to sell their products, a complaint Dr. Oz has made on his show. Alarmed, they flooded Sen. McCaskill's office with emails containing links to sources documenting Dr. Oz's tenuous rela - tionship with science-based medicine. It will likely never be known whether McCaskill had planned a trap all along or whether skeptics persuaded her to shift emphasis, but she did at one point use the term \"science-based medicine,\" a term that is not com - monly used outside of skeptical cir - cles. This suggests that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014she had read material from the Science-Based Medicine blog about Dr. Oz. Whatever the case, unfortunately for Dr. Oz, the ending of this K a- buki dance was not pleasant for him. Although his star power did result in extensive news coverage for the hearing, it certainly wasn't the sort of coverage Oz wanted. Unexpectedly, Oz found himself the main target of the senators' wrath, particularly Sen. McCaskill's, over the inflated claims about weight-loss supplements he regularly makes on his show. Unused to not being surrounded by an adoring audience, Dr. Oz faltered and became visibly flustered at points. As is usual for such a hearing, each witness was allowed to read a prepared statement. Dr. Oz's statement was, as expected, self-serving, touting his commitment to educating his viewers about supplements and diet. How - ever, he must have had an inkling of what might be coming, because his statement also justified his show's ap - proach as being necessary to \"engage the viewer\" and defended his having characterized green coffee bean ex - tract as a \"miracle,\" while grudgingly acknowledging that his characteriza - tion had resulted in \"an explosion of ads and marketing.\" Then, completely missing the point, he discussed epi - sodes of his show in which he went after supplement manufacturers using his name to advertise the two main diet supplements he had promoted, green coffee bean extract and garcinia cambogia. When it came time to question Dr. Oz, Sen. McCaskill would have none Mehmet Oz, host of the Dr. Oz Show , testifies at a Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance Subcom - mittee hearing in Russell Building titled \"Protecting Consumers from False and Deceptive Advertising of Weight- Loss Products,\" June 17, 2014.

She quoted from his show: On green coffee extract: \"You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they found the magic weight-loss for every body type.\" On raspberry ketone: \"I've got the number one miracle in a bottle to burn your fat.\" On garcinia cambogia: \"It may be the simple solution you've been looking for to bust your body fat for good.\" Sen. McCaskill said, \"I don't get why you need to say this stuff, because you know it's not true. So why, when you have this amazing megaphone and this amaz - ing ability to communicate, why would you cheapen your show by saying things like that?\" Dr. Oz was clearly taken off guard, and it showed in his body language. He started out by disagreeing that green coffee beans don't work and tried to cite multiple studies, but McCaskill had done her homework and knew that the study Oz had relied on was small and funded by the manufacturer. Oz then retreated into a highly disingenuous false equivalence by saying that many of the things we recom - mend with respect to diet are controver - sial and arguing that medicine advances by embracing new ideas and challenging old ideas. It was deceptive nonsense, of course, because the controversies over these sorts of issues tend to be based in far better evi - dence on both sides than the evidence Oz was able to muster to defend his green coffee bean extract show. Unwittingly, he also basically admitted that the \"clin - ical trial\" he himself did with green coffee bean extract wasn't a real clinical trial at all, that it wouldn't pass scientific mus - ter, and that it wasn't carried out under \"appropriate IRB guidance.\" Although it is unlikely that anyone realized it at the time, in other words, Dr. Oz admitted in front of a Senate committee that he had performed research on human subjects without proper ethical approval, as had been pointed out by skeptics. And so it went. Oz tried to defend himself, admitting that he uses \"flowery\" language to express his enthusiasm for the products he discusses on his show but justifying it by characterizing himself as a cheerleader for weight loss and health, even though he was forced to admit that none of his recommendations besides diet and exercise have actually been proven to work. He also kept saying that those shows from which McCaskill quoted were two years old and that he \"doesn't use that kind of language any more.\" Un - fortunately for Dr. Oz, McCaskill had done her homework about this as well and immediately rattled off examples of language just as \"flowery\" from recent Dr. Oz Show episodes. Oz also kept repeating that he himself doesn't sell any supple - ments, which is true but irrelevant. He's featured many people on his show who do sell supplements and allowed them to turn their appearances on his show into infomercials for their products. At one point, Dr. Oz tried a nonsen - sical defense in which he confessed that he now thinks he's done his audience a \"disservice\" by not giving them a list of \"reputable\" companies that sell the prod - ucts featured on his show, while again complaining about the misuse of his name by scammers. Sen. McCaskill saw right through that ploy as well, retorting, \"I know you feel that you're a victim, but sometimes conduct invites being a victim. I think that if you would be more careful, maybe you wouldn't be victimized quite as frequently.\" At the end of the hearing, McCaskill gave Oz a chance at redemption, saying, \"We didn't call this hearing to beat up on you but we did call this hearing to talk about a real crisis in consumer protection, and you can be part of the problem or you can be part of the police.\" Dr. Oz, chas - tened, promised in essence to be a good boy from now on and affirmed that he wanted to be part of the police. In ad - dition to promising to tell his audience which supplements meet his exacting standards, Oz promised to use less \"flow - ery\" language in the future, although the way he phrased it left considerable doubt over whether he meant it. In the end, unexpectedly this hearing became a big win for science-based medi - cine. Unfortunately, it was only one battle. Whether any legislation or policy changes with respect to weight-loss supplement scams will come out of it remains to be seen, as does the issue of whether Oz will make any substantive changes to his show next season.

Skeptical Inquirer | September/October 2014 7[ NEWS AND COMMENT Keeping Pseudoscience and Religion Out of Health Care Being secular implies a commitment to using science, not supernatural revelation, as a means of determining the most effective therapies. In the context of health care, sound science implies evidence-based medicine. Sadly, despite the tremen- dous success of evidence-based medicine, too many individ- uals rely on pseudoscientific remedies. Here we see another threat to health care, one not derived expressly from religion but one traceable to a similarly dogmatic mindset. Pseudoscientific remedies have flooded the health care system, whether it's Reiki, homeopathic drugs, naturopathy, or any other sham ther- apy pulled from medicine's back room of mysticism and magic. It's scandalous that these quack therapies can be peddled with impunity. The Food and Drug Administration largely takes a hands-off approach, declining to test homeopathic drugs for efficacy, and major universities and medical centers push \"com- plementary and alternative medicine\" on patients at their clin- ics. It's a lot easier to make a profit from \"alternative medicine\" than real medicine. We need to take control of our health care. No church, no religious doctrine should be allowed to interfere with our heath care choices. Likewise, we need to insist that all therapies offered to the public be rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. We need to keep health care both safe and secular. \u2014Ronald A. Lindsay, \"Secularism and Health Care,\" commenting on the Center for Inquiry's new cam- paign \"Keep Health Care Safe and Secular,\" an- nounced June 3, 2014.

According to an arti- cle in the Anchorage Daily News , \"The U.S. Air Force gave official notice to Congress Wednesday [May 14, 2014] that it intends to dismantle the $300 million High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program [ HAARP ] in Gakona this summer. The shutdown of HAARP , a project created by the late Sen. Ted Stevens when he wielded great control over the U.S. defense budget, will start after a final research experiment takes place in mid-June, the Air Force said in a letter to Congress Tuesday [May 13, 2014]. . . . Built at a cost of more than $290 million, the site has 180 antennas on 30 acres that are used to direct energy into the iono- sphere, which is 55 miles to 370 miles above the Earth, and monitor changes in the flow of charged particles.\" The program has become a favorite subject of con- spiracy theorists, who suggest that it had some sinister purpose. Nick Redfern, in his book Keep Out! High Se- curity Facilities, Underground Bases, and Other Off-Lim- its Areas , asks rhetorically, \"Is such technology already being secretly utilized on a planet-wide scale, in order to instill fear in, and exert control over, the world's pop- ulation, and also exert military control and influence over areas of strategic interest? Many conspiracy the- orists say yes. . . . Those who see HAARP as having a distinctly covert agenda point to what they consider the project's darkest of all secrets: The earthquake in Haiti.\" Redfern suggests that the January 2010 7.0 magni- tude earthquake\u2014which leveled much of Haiti's urban \"It's scandalous that these quack therapies can be peddled with impunity.\" Overhead photo of the HAARP Gakona Facility. 8 Volume 38 Issue 5 | Skeptical Inquirerareas and killed at least 100,000 people\u2014\"was a deliberate HAARP - induced event, designed to provide the United States government with a reason to make its presence strongly felt in an area in which it had spe- cial interests.\" In classic follow-the- money-not-the-facts conspiracist thinking, the \"special in- terests\" in this case is oil. Redfern writes that \" HAARP can be secretly utilized to find underground and un- dersea oil reserves.\" How, exactly, a technology designed for studying the ionosphere\u2014which extends high above Earth's surface\u2014is also used for detecting underground oil reserves or causing earthquakes is never ex- plained. Crass desire for oil as a reason to kill hundreds of thousands of people and devastate an already poor country might be more plausible if the United States wasn't already one of the world's top oil producers (getting most of the balance from Canada and South America), if devastating a country's infra structure could somehow help (instead of greatly impede) the abil- ity to access oil underneath it, and if America hadn't donated over $1.4 bil- lion in earthquake recovery aid. Four- and-a-half years later, there seems to be little or no evidence of the urgent oil exploration that was presumably the whole point of the ruthless top- secret HAARP conspiracy project.Of course it's not just the Haiti earthquake. Conspiracy theorists also suspect HAARP of causing the 2011 earthquake and the resulting tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Why would the U.S. gov- ernment want to cause an earthquake in, and irradiate part of, a close ally's country? Oil, of course. As for HAARP itself, Brian Dun- ning, writing for his Skeptoid p o d - cast, notes that \"there's nothing re- motely secret or even classified about HAARP . No security clearance is needed to visit and tour the site, and HAARP usually holds an open house every summer during which anyone can see everything there. During the rest of the year, research is con- ducted. . . . There are several other similar research stations around the world. . . . Sadly for the conspiracy theorists, HAARP has no potential to affect weather. The frequency of en- ergy that HAARP transmits cannot be absorbed by the troposphere or the stratosphere, only by the ionosphere, many kilometers higher than the highest atmospheric weather systems.\" The program is being shut down because its research is done and its funding is spent. The fact that the HAARP project is over will, of course, not deter conspiracy theorists. Some will claim that the shutdown is only of the \"official\" work but that \"black ops\" projects will continue there in even greater secrecy. Those who accept that the project truly has ended will likely proudly take credit for having helped force the govern- ment to shutter it by getting the truth out there.

The girls, Morgan E. Geyser and Anissa E. Weier, are accused of attempting a murder they had been planning for several months. They lured their friend, also twelve, into a wooded area, where one girl allegedly held the victim down while the other stabbed her nineteen times. According to an article in the Mil waukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel , When confronted by police, Weier immediately began explaining about the Web site Creepypasta. Weier said she introduced Morgan Geyser to the site back in December. A character named \"Slenderman\" is the leader of Creepypasta, and below Slenderman is the killer and below the killer is a proxy. Weier explained that in order to be a proxy you needed to kill a person in order to show your dedication to Slenderman. Weier said that many people don't believe Slenderman is real and she wanted to prove the skeptics wrong. Weier said that Geyser told her they should become \"proxies\" of Slenderman, and in order to do so, they needed to kill their friend, the victim, to prove themselves worthy of Slenderman. . . . The suspects believed that \"Slender, \" as Weier called him, lived in a mansion in the Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin. The plan was to kill the victim and walk to Slender's mansion and become one of his proxies, according to the criminal complaint. The victim was hospitalized in serious but stable condition while the two girls accused of trying to kill her face charges of attempted first-degree intentional homicide. Folklorist Gail de Vos, in her book What [ NEWS AND COMMENT Skeptical Inquirer | September/October 2014 9Happens Next? Contemporary Urban Leg- ends plains Slen- derman's origin: \"Recog nized as a fictional contemporary urban legend, created by 'Vic- tor Surge' on the Something Awful forums on June 8, 2009, Slenderman has gained prominence beyond the confines of the on- line forums. He is most often portrayed as a malevolent entity abducting and psychologi- cally traumatizing people after stalking them for a long while.\" The character is wildly pop- ular among online fans, as Sharon Hill of Doubtful News noted in an article in the Feb- ruary 2013 Fortean Times magazine: Slen- derman \"currently stars in an array of videos, Youtube series, alternate reality games, fan art, online horror stories and parodies. . . . Slenderman is an evolving meme.\" The two Wisconsin girls are not alone in believing in the literal existence of Slender- man. Though most people recognize that this boogeyman is fictional and no more real than Freddy Krueger or Captain Hook, not everyone is convinced. Rev. Robin Swope, a pastor at St. Paul's United Church of Christ in Erie, Pennsylvania, believes the Internet-generated monster is real. In his book Slenderman: From Fiction to Fact , Swope states that, after years of reviewing stories sent to him by people who claim to have encountered the elusive monster, he has concluded that Slenderman is a literal demonic entity: W e c a n c o m e t o t h e c o n c l u s i o n t h a t Slenderman is real. The archetype of death that Slenderman embodies is not an archetype at all. Slenderman is the archetype. He is indeed death personified who from countless ages past has hunted down humanity with a relentless determi- nation. If you see him as a child he will forever haunt your dreams and your wak- ing nightmares. . . . There is nothing you can do about it, it is inevitable. Begging and screaming are useless; Slenderman makes no bargains and takes no bribes. Slenderman is coming for you. According to Rev. Swope, Christian faith and prayer are the only defenses against Slenderman. If an adult\u2014the leader of a church, no less\u2014can give credence to Slender man stories as if they were eyewitness accounts, it's no wonder that some children may as well. Acting out a scene or scenario from a story or an urban legend is actually fairly common. Folklorists call this sort of behav- ior ostension or legend tripping, and it is an activity shared by ghost hunters who (sincerely or jokingly) walk around reput- edly haunted locations, as well as people who go into a dark bathroom, stand in front of a mirror, and call out for Bloody Mary. In many urban legends there's an element of what's sometimes referred to as proof: proving you have the nerve to do something daring. In the case of Bloody Mary legends, for example, it's usually girls proving to themselves and their friends that they're not afraid to go through with a test of cour- age: Calling Bloody Mary's name three (or seven, or thirteen) times while standing in front of a mirror in a bathroom. If you do it right, or if you have enough faith, she is said to materialize in the mirror. According to police and news re ports, the reason for the Wisconsin stabbing was very similar: In this case the girls were trying to prove (to Slenderman and to each other) that they had the courage to stab the victim and kill her. Once the act was done, the girls believed Slenderman would appear in front of them and lead them to his mansion, rumored to be hidden in nearby woods. It's a classic example of ostension. There's nothing unusual or inherently pathological about acting out fictional stories and leg- ends. It's similar to the cosplay (\"costumed play\") found among fans of science fiction and fantasy, where people dress up and act out scenes from films and TV series such as Star Wars , Star Trek , Harry Potter , and so on. Of course with tens (in some cases hundreds) of thousands of fans, a small percentage of them may, because of mental illness, the influence of drugs, or for some other reason, take this fantasy world too far and have difficulty separating fact from fiction. If an adult\u2014the leader of a church, no less\u2014can give credence to Slender man stories as if they were eyewitness accounts, it's no wonder that some children may as well. [ NEWS AND COMMENT Skeptical Inquirer | September/October 2014 11IN MEMORIAM: Rob Nanninga, Skeptic Leader and Editor JAN WILLEM NIENHUYS On May 30, 2014, skeptic Rob Nanninga, founding member of the Netherlands skeptic group Skepsis and editor-in-chief of its periodical Skepter , died at age fif - ty-eight. No one else had so much influ - ence on Skepsis, both by setting an exam - ple and by his method of work. Rob Nanninga (his official name was Roelof Hendrik Nanninga, but from childhood on everybody called him Rob) was born August 6, 1955, in Groningen in the north of the Nether - lands. After finishing high school, he attended a teacher training college, and obtained a diploma as a high school teacher of Dutch and English. At the time CSICOP was founded in the USA, in 1976, Rob got involved in what one might call a skeptic discus - sion club. Actually, it was some sort of school project of the college. This was at the time that Uri Geller attracted attention with his spoon-bending act. Rob used to tell the other club mem - bers that he knew exactly how Geller did it, but\u2014in style with magic tradi - tions\u2014he kept the method secret. The Groningen skeptic club re - mained active for a long time. Rob often took the initiative. One club member (who contributed the following story) said that Rob was very good at making others enthusiastic. Rob took the initia - tive in many Skepsis investigations and experiments, such as the pendulum ex - periment (1992, candidates had to de - tect the presence of a precious object in closed boxes) and the astrotest (1995, http://www.skepsis.nl/astrot.html), where about forty-four experienced astrologers had to match seven exten - sive life and personality descriptions to the corresponding birth dates, and two muscle tests (2005, 2006) where the candidates claimed that they could di - agnose the contents of small bottles by the so-called O-ring test. In 2004 the Dutch minister of health publicly announced that he thought homeopathy was silly. A spokesman of an association of lay homeopaths challenged him. If the minister would be so kind as to just try out the effect of Sulphur 200C, namely severe itch and hot flushes, he would change his opinion. Rob and I objected to an un - blinded uncontrolled trial with one test person (who would become subject of public speculation about his state of mind whatever the outcome), and pro - posed a serious test, properly blinded and randomized with eighty test per - sons, to be jointly performed by Skepsis and the homeopaths. Rob entered into discussions with the spokesman, who at first thought it a good idea but then backed out. The homeopaths had at first suggested that a single test person would suffice, but later they claimed it was impossible to estimate the success rate in the verum group. Another prob - lem was that supposedly the test sub - jects would know what symptoms to expect\u2014something that didn't matter when they challenged the minister. Many people have testified that Rob always remained polite and re spectful in his contact with people he dis - agreed with. When Rob started editing Skepter , he also put up a Skepsis web - site, which he filled mainly with articles from the magazine Skepter , but it also contains an extensive library about cults and new religions. Rob's idea was that the information provided by the mag - azine should be available for the lowest possible price, both for the subscribers and for the general public. The site at - tracts about 3,000 views a day, and the magazine has 2,300 paying subscribers. The financial situation of Skepsis is healthy, but Rob shortchanged himself by allowing himself to be grossly under - paid. Actually, he hardly thought about money except when his bank account was empty. He was working on Skepter day and night. It's ironic that the ene - mies of Skepsis claim that we are hand - somely rewarded by Big Pharma. Rob was, in a sense, the skeptic's skeptic. Many skeptics and rationalists have a tendency to preach for the con - verted, but that wasn't Rob's style. He was strict in his views but mild in his statements, as urban legend researcher Peter Burger wrote to me. He was typi - cally a reasonable and cooperative man. Rob saw Skepsis as an organization for giving neutral information about dubious pretenses of knowledge. He sympathized with serious parapsychol - ogists, but when they started behaving like charlatans, he got angry. A typical 12 Volume 38 Issue 5 | Skeptical Inquirerexample was the Therapeutic Touch practitioners. Therapeutic Touch is re- vamped mesmerism or psychic healing. He proposed that they test their explicit claims with a simple test. When they refused, he henceforth considered them to be commercial frauds. Rob sometimes explained that when he started on a subject, he often didn't know anything about it, but then he studied it until he knew it thoroughly. You can imagine this was hard work, with sometimes surprising results. For example, he discovered that modern yoga was a result of the introduction of Western body culture and gymnas- tics in India, starting around 1920. He always worried that he would make a mistake that would cost Skepsis its sci-entific reputation. After all, Skepsis has a committee of recommendation con- sisting of prominent scientists. On the morning of May 30, he was found\u2014seemingly asleep\u2014sitting in front of his computer. The diagnosis was cardiac arrest. I informed the read- ers of Skepter at once. Many have mailed me about how they enjoyed his clear, thoroughly researched articles. The last subject he was working on was the Salvation Army, a Christian sect that rakes in an enormous amount of Dutch government subsidies and strongly dis- criminates against non-Christians. The readers of Skepter didn't know the sweet and caring side of his char- acter. He was the caretaker to his aged mother, who lived upstairs. Something of this side of his character you can see in the endlessly patient way he inter- acted with, for example, an astrologer. He had other sides as well. He was very fond of a certain kind of folk music. The Incredible String Band was his favorite, but he liked German neo-folk too. And if you look at our website, with its austere style without frills, then you see something of Rob's personal- ity: a desire to make the plain objective truth stand out as clearly as possible in an otherwise messy world. Let us try to work in his spirit. Jan Willem Nienhuys, a retired mathe- matician, is secretary of Skepsis. He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skepti- cal Inquiry. Origin of Mysterious Windsor Hum Identified BENJAMIN RADFORD Since 2011, a mysterious hum has plagued residents of Windsor, Ontario. It's only one of several mystery hums around the world, including New Mexico's famous Taos Hum. No one was sure of its origin\u2014or even if it really existed. People living nearby complain of hearing an intermittent hum that has been described as a refrigerator motor, a truck engine, or an idling locomotive. It has driven many to distraction and is said to induce headaches, insomnia, and other health effects. Several investigations have been undertaken. The first report was inconclusive, but part of the mystery has now been solved. In May 2014, a Canadian study confirmed for the first time that the hum is real (and not, for example, an auditory illusion) and iden- tified the source: Michigan's Zug Island, across the Detroit River, the site of heavy manufacturing, including a U.S. steel plant. No one knows where on the island the sound is coming from. Why is it so hard to find the hum? For one thing, the sound is not constant but instead comes and goes, which makes tracking it difficult. Identifying the source of a sound can be problematic in urban areas where concrete, glass, and buildings can reflect, change, and amplify sound waves. Sources of outdoor sounds are nearly endless, including traffic, trains, power plants, and factories. It's also possible that no specific source of the hum will be found for the simple reason that there is no single iden- tifiable source\u2014instead it may be that the vibrations are the result of several factors (mechanical, geological, acoustic, etc.), which don't create the hum individually but only collectively and under certain conditions. Thus, for example, if you have a dozen pieces of machinery that are suspected of contributing to the hum, turning one or more of them off at a time may stem the sound, but those machines may only be part of the answer and the hum may return even if steps are taken to muffle those machines. C a n a d i a n o f f i c i a l s h a v e h a n d e d t h e n e w r e p o r t t o t h e i r American counterparts and requested that the investigation continue until the precise origin of the Windsor hum is identified and the sound is stopped. As a practical matter that may be a very difficult task, and of course companies with manufactur- ing plants on Zug Island are unlikely to voluntarily shut down operations for weeks (thus costing millions of dollars) simply to locate a hum. When and if a definitive origin of the sound is located, it may take months or years to figure out how to stop it. It might be as simple as placing some industrial machinery on a specialized vibration-dampening platform, or it may be as complex as overhauling an entire factory or assembly line at the cost of tens of millions of dollars. In the end, it may not matter where exactly the sound is coming from, since identifying the hum's origin may not solve the problem. Part of the reason the Windsor community hears the hum is that sound carries well over water, so one possi- ble and relatively inexpensive way to stem the infernal Windsor hum might be to simply build a sound-muffling wall around the one-square-mile area of Zug Island to confine the vibrations to the island. In the end, stopping the hum is more important to local communities than spending more taxpayer dollars identi- fying which specific machine or machines created it .

Giger, influenced by Surrealist artists includ - ing Salvador Dali, is best known for imagery that is often sexual and gro - tesque, organic yet alien and mechan - ical. He was most famous for creat - ing the extraterrestrial creature in the 1979 horror film Alien , for which he received an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. His work has been exhibited throughout the world, and just last year he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. But Giger was also influential in a bizarre and little-known way: he un - knowingly helped create the His panic vampire beast el chupacabra , one of the world's best-known \"real\" monsters, which has been reportedly seen through - out Latin America attacking and suck - ing the blood out of goats and chickens. Though many people mistakenly believe that the chupacabra has been reported for many decades, it was first sighted in Puerto Rico in 1995. A woman named Madelyne Tolen - tino claimed she saw the creature near her house in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, during the second week of August in 1995. She said the creature had large eyes that went up the temples and spread around the sides, was about three or four feet high, walked on two legs, and had thin arms and legs. It had no ears or nose but had a row of distinctive spikes on the spine. This original eyewitness description became the basis for many early images of the chupacabra. For many years, this original and in - fluential chupacabra report remained a mystery. What, if anything, did Tolen - tino see? No known animal matched her detailed description. It does, however, look almost exactly like a creature seen by hundreds of thousands of other peo - ple right around the same time, in the 1995 science-fiction film Species : a movie monster named Sil, designed by Giger. Sil and the chupacabra creature that Tolentino described are remarkably similar. Giger's book about his work designing Sil for Species , Species De - sign, contains dozens of his sketches and designs showing what would later become the chupacabra. From the creature's distinctive feather-textured spine spikes, to the bipedal stance, to the earless and oblong head, to the oval wraparound eyes and long, thin fingers and limbs. Despite some differences in details, overall the resemblance is clear. I interviewed Tolentino at her home in Puerto Rico, and she confirmed that she'd seen the film Species . In fact, in a 1996 interview that appears in Scott Corrales's book Chupacabras and Other Mysteries , Tolentino stated that shortly before her chupacabra sighting she saw \"a movie called Species . It would be a very good idea if you saw it. The movie begins here in Puerto Rico. . . . [The movie monster] made my hair stand on end. It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all. . . . The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive.\" As I discuss in my book Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore , both Sil and the chupacabra are not only very similar in morphology but also share identical or - igin stories. Thus the original and most influ - ential chupacabra eyewitness in his - tory described a monster she'd seen in a movie as a mysterious beast she en - countered in real life. Over time the ch - upacabra has changed form, and most modern reports are not of the original chupacabra that Giger de signed (and Tolentino described) but instead re - semble mangy dogs, coyotes, and even raccoons. It's unlikely that Tolentino inten - tionally created a hoax that spawned a famous monster. Instead, she sim - ply confused a real-life memory with something she experienced in a film\u2014a common (and harmless) phenomenon known in psychology as confabulation. We all do it, usually unknowingly, but most of us don't spawn monster mys - teries. In a case of truth being stranger than fiction, H.R. Giger helped create a legend that is among the world's best- known "}
