If so, can you describe it? (SHORT VERSION - VESTIBULAR MIGRAINE AFTER PFIZER BOOSTER?) Hello all... I'm new here, forgive me for posting something that has probably been discussed ad nauseum. But as there are over 1,100 pages here, reading them all has become a bit much for me, so I would appreciate any input on my situation: Received Pfizer Booster shot (plus Flu vaccine) on December 2nd. On December 6th, I suffered a vertigo attack. Unlike previous vertigo attacks, I did not get progressively better. In fact, after about a month, I began to get worsening/new symptoms: Poor vision, specifically with an inability to change focus from distance to near vision Mild-to-moderate ear pain/pressure, with hearing issues like vague, passing earache, and occasional full stuffy feeling in the ear to the point that I could not hear out of it (both ears) Significant worsening of pre-existing tinnitus Occasional, quick-passing feelings of spasm in my face (or at least, it felt like my face was ABOUT to break into spasm) Weird feeling in forehead (felt like a vague numbness, though I could still move my forehead, and feel touch to the area), neck pain, which spread to become jaw tightness (thankfully, this only lasted about a week and is mostly gone). The general weird, post-vertigo head sensations are still there as well, but I expect this (maybe for not this long) and am least concerned about this. I've had vertigo in the past, as well as a history of migraines. After my previous serious bout of vertigo in 2018, test results indicated possible CNS lesion, but Brain MRI was fine, and it was chalked up to \"possible oculomotor deficiencies\", and I was advised to do vision/eye exercises. This time around, a neuroopthalmologist has diagnosed this as vestibular migraine. ENT has not made a diagnosis yet pending a new Brain MRI coming up this week, but her testing also indicated CNS lesion. Has anyone else had vestibular migraines after a recent COVID vaccine, and how are you doing? Did it pass, or is this going to be something chronic that I'll have to deal with? Hello, Am trying to help someone who had vertigo and neck pain after the Moderna 3rd dose. The neck pain went away within a week (after taking a course of prednisone) and the vertigo has improved but short spells are sometimes brought on by lying on back, rolling over during sleep, or looking upward. One small study below suggests that \"Post-vaccination vertigo/dizziness can manifest as exacerbation of previous neurotological disorder. The median time to the onset of vertigo/dizziness following COVID-19 vaccination is 10 days.\" Hope your symptoms continue to improve. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9721153/] If you have a chance, you (or your doctor, or a family member or friend) might consider reporting your symptoms to [VAERS]and/or signing up for the [Yale Listen Study]. One thing that may help some people with post-vaccine inner ear symptoms: trying to lower inflammation and increase circulation/blood flow (to the head, for example), in part through an anti-inflammatory diet (lower amounts of foods or ingredients that may constrict blood vessels/raise cortisol levels such as salt and caffeine; higher amounts of anti-inflammatory foods such as salmon, green vegetables...). Betahistimine is one medication that is prescribed for increased blood flow to the inner ears is used for mineres. Also COQ10 is a supplement that does the same but can't be taken when on blood thinners. I don't know what's going on with me I'm panicking over losing my hearing. Cuz before when my hearing was sensitive I was able to know and hear how much sound to let into my ears because I would hear my ear drum flapping. So after my covid infection I got vertigo for about a minute or less and then again 30-1minute and then I got up it went away. I think it was from a cough fit had too much pressure in my head. So I go get checked at the clinic and was given eply manoeuvre and vertigo had already gone cuz it only lasted less than a minute. A few days later I noticed my left affected side ear I was able to tolerate sound more I was like what? Okay. But what I noticed not later was that I got dizzy to sounds and the sound of my voice. I was like what the heck is going on. So I was sitting here cuz the dishwasher was on and I had my plug in my bad ear. Before I put the earplug in my left I didn't hear any ear flapping I was like what do I need this? So I put it on anyway, and I sat here I can hear my ear start flapping from the sound coming in from my right ear. My right ear is now sensitive. I also have decreased hearing now to my left bad ear. I'm getting worse there is no going back. Everything that I read it related to inner ear damage. By a virus by a vaccine or bacteria in my case the vaccine. It's no wonder why these symptoms started out like this in January 2022. This is a progressive issue once the inner ear is damaged that's it. It will only get worse and not better. It also affected my eye too got it worse I can't focus on things in distant my vision is clear no blurry but i believe it damaged my nerve that helps my eye move the motor part of it. It's like vestibular neuritis is what we have read up on it. It's a debilitating issue. I have that or SSCD. I am having a difficult time I have children my youngest is 10 and I can't even do anything with her. I get head pressure as soon as sound goes through my ear. It's awful. This is making me depressed. I want to go back to work but I can't. My daughter is also having ear issues form covid she got over Christmas we're both having heart issues as in tachycardia where our heart rate will raise after moving here goes to 150's from a simple 15 feet walk mine goes 125. She had tinnitus beginning of December and then covid made it louder. I'm so devastated. I'm so angry. I'm so done. I have audiologist appointment tomorrow for hearing test. Then ent appointment January 26. And it's the same ent that didn't do any testing on me i the beginning of this just mri nothing else VEMP is what shows damage. I also taken it upon myself to look for a ct scan with 0.6mm or less to diagnose SSCD. And so far ppl tell me ohh you gotta get your doctor to worry about that they wouldn't even just tell me I tried to explain that I wanted to get a referral to them I didn't wanna be misdiagnosed because you need a 0.6mm or less of slices (photo) and I don't wanna get scanned and find out later it's not a 0.6mm or less scan. I'll be exposed too too much radiation which is not good. Especially of the temporals. Omg what a stressful thing this is I was so normal before all of this Fucken covid. No one's accountable for this bullshit. It's taking my life away very slowly from me. If anyone wants to contact me they can email me at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or text me from that email as well. I am in the dumps right now Is anyone still having severe GI issues ? or has resolved it ? I'm struggling with it, this has become my main problem by far. Thanks for any kind of help !! I haven't been on for a few months, checking in to see how everyone is doing. I hope you all are headed in the right direction and improving. I swear I have a some PTSD from all of this. But I'm doing so much better, I'd say a good 90% back to normal. @Arica30: I read through your prior posts and see that you got tinnitus as one of your adverse side effects from the vaccine. It also appears that you have successfully resolved your tinnitus. My wife and I both got tinnitus from these horrid vaccines about a year ago. Can you tell me what you did/what worked for you that helped get rid of the tinnitus? I did see where you refer to Cina a number of times, but I'm not familiar with that. Can you provide some info on that; and were there other things that helped? Thanks. Anyone else on here experience a feeling of shortness of breath / kind of tightness or shallowness in the chest area? I get that periodically throughout the day. I'm trying to figure out if it is related to the vaccine (last booster dose was 13 months ago) or a result of me stopping my SSRI about 7 months ago Either way my anxiety is definitely much higher and often, bordering panic attacks. Any feedback would be appreciated. Update: Original Symptoms: Nerve problems across stomach, up back, and across shoulders What I am currently taking: Xyzal, Probiotic, Vitamin E, Selenium, Glutathione, Raw onions, Raw garlic, Eggs, Chicken, and Milk Current Symptoms: I can get by most weeks without any symptoms as long as I am taking these things and not sleeping flat (sleeping with my head propped up). News: I recently started drinking Fairlife Milk. I think a lot of supplements, my body only absorbs through food. It is high in Vitamin D. [DrL](https://vestibular.org/participant/nresearcher/), [alia](https://vestibular.org/participant/sunrise/)and [Thisistoomuch](https://vestibular.org/participant/margaret2022/)reacted Anyone on here experience new, significant symptoms or issues a year or more after your last vaccine dose? Yes, I thought over the summer I finally was past all this and over the fall and into this new year I have some of the same symptoms as before, some worse and new things as well. I read a lot of forums, have been to tons of Dr's and it seems like there are so many \"could be's\"....I have heard of MS/Parkinsons/ALS/MCAS/POTS/Long Covid/FND and the list goes on and on and on and on....I think for me because of looking way too far into way too many neurological diseases, and reading comments of people thinking the worst of the vaccine and what it will do to people..and most of these possibilities having NO cure it has caused me to have such bad anxiety that it most definitely makes symptoms feel more intense and I am hypersensitive from that...one Neurologist mentioned parkinsons and since that appt I have been so nervous and constantly feel shaky and weak, that HAS to be nerves and anxiety. Does anyone REALLY know what is happening to us? Or is it just a guess based on what that Dr has seen or experienced...there is no test for us to see what the vx really did, only to rule some things out. I also think long covid and the VX have almost identical symptoms...right now my biggest concern is the muscle twitches that have come back along with a constant feeling of being weak and shaky and having mild tremors when using my muscles. I hope that just like before it goes away in time. Could it really just be a complete systemic reaction that affected everyone a little differently? Especially if it comes and goes? I had a massage yesterday with lymphatic drainage and she worked on some areas where my nerves were surrounded by a lot of inflammation (according to her).I personally am trying to make it a goal to stay off these twitter reports (some people really believe this vx was a way to kill people off, I don't know why I even read these things!!) and google searches of every known disease and just try to focus on being in the present until hopefully one day this goes away or someone comes up with an answer...I have heard people getting better, sometimes in months sometimes over a year, which is where I am at now...so for me I am just looking forward to warmer weather and better health in 2023 yes I agree the vaccine do harm us, it mimics the covid infection it does something to our vestibular system. and we don't know how. I'm seeing more and more people complaining about the same symptoms after a COVID infection. Or added ones. I'm also seeing people having a relapse about a year after their vaccine with worsening or added symptoms. we'll never know what their intentions were. It's awful. I've been having rough days lately. I've been looking at my symptoms and self diagnosing. Which is not good. But I want to test for these thing to ensure that's not what's going on. My hissing in my head has gotten worse since covid. My eye got worse as well. I seen people getting diagnosed with vestibular neuritis. I feel my symptoms are similar. My ent doesn't seem to think so. I don't know anymore. It makes me tired worrying about tomorrow when you feel like this. It's a burden on me. I don't feel that happiness anymore at all. I went for an appointment with my daughter this morning at the clinic I work at it was so nice to see everyone as soon as I got there my coworkers were asking for help with a lot of things and just we miss you how are you so nice to see you. I really miss them it was so nice to see everyone. However I couldn't even talk much to them with the sound of my voice too loud for my head and my ear. Kinda made me feel dizzy or buzz feeling in my head. When you don't have your ears or your eyes working properly for you it's very disabling. It takes you away from everything. At this point I'm not sure if there's a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I'm not even sure where to begin like how do I know this is MCAS or a mitochondrial thing? In the video below, Dr. Leo Galland explains the association of mechanisms that seem to be involved in LC, at minute [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WslPr1fVxBY] It should be known that these phenomena are all deeply interconnected. So it's not just one or the other, mithochondrial disorder or MCAS. I think what can be done is to try at the same time treatments for each of these factors. any information on how to test for these Anyone on here experience new, significant symptoms or issues a year or more after your last vaccine dose?

At this point I'm not sure if there's a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. @margaret2022: Unfortunately, I have to agree that the vaccines definitely did harm to our bodies in so many different ways. And it's totally frustrating that the medical community remains either clueless or silent about it all. I am quite sure that my tinnitus is permanent, and seems to be getting worse of late. I am so wrought with anxiety and stress that I don't even feel like myself anymore, and it's impossible to determine the physical from the emotional/mental health issues. My anxiety and depression are real and I am completely consumed every day with the thought that this is going to be like this, or worse, for the rest of my life. Everything that pops up I have to wonder, \"is this because of the vaccine?\" I know my family is concerned (and kinda fed up with) how I am of late. If I could just get like a 50% reduction in my tinnitus and deal with my chronic anxiety I'd be OK, but that's a big ask and probably not realistic to hope for. I'll keep trying supplements, etc. but I'm just not reading very many success stories on here or other places. The vaccine and/or our immune system response definitely did permanent damage to our organs and systems and we won't know the truth for a long time, if ever. Keep me posted on your situation and I hope you eventually find some relief. If you come across any success stories, etc., please post on here. Thanks and take care.
